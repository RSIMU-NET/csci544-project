In South Korea, DOD is transforming its military posture through a series of four interrelated posture initiatives. GAO obtained DOD cost estimates that total $17.6 billion through 2020 for initiatives in South Korea, but DOD cost estimates are incomplete. One initiative, to extend the tour length of military service members and move thousands of dependents to South Korea--called \"tour normalization\"--could cost DOD $5 billion by 2020 and $22 billion or more through 2050, but this initiative was not supported by a business case analysis that would have considered alternative courses of action and their associated costs and benefits. As a result, DOD is unable to demonstrate that tour normalization is the most cost-effective approach to meeting its strategic objectives. This omission raises concerns about the investments being made in a $13 billion construction program at Camp Humphreys, where tour normalization is largely being implemented. DOD is also transforming its military posture in Japan, Okinawa, and Guam but has not estimated the total costs associated with these initiatives. Based on an October 2006 Government of Japan budget estimate study for realignment costs and limited cost information developed by DOD, GAO identified approximately $29.1 billion--primarily just construction costs--that is anticipated to be shared by the United States and Japan to implement these initiatives. DOD officials stated total cost estimates for its initiatives were not available because of the significant uncertainty surrounding initiativeimplementation schedules. The Senate Appropriations Committee recently directed DOD to provide annual status updates on posture initiatives in Korea, Japan, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands. If DOD is fully responsive to the Committee's reporting direction, these updates should provide needed visibility into initiative cost and funding requirements. DOD's posture planning guidance does not require the U.S. Pacific Command to include comprehensive cost data in its theater posture plan, and as a result, DOD lacks critical information that could be used by decision makers as they deliberate on posture requirements and affordability. GAO analysis shows that of the approximately $24.6 billion obligated by the military services to support installations in Asia from 2006 through 2010, approximately $18.7 billion (76 percent) was for operation and maintenance of these facilities. The services estimate that operation and maintenance costs would be about $2.9 billion per year through 2015. However, this estimate appears to be understated, and DOD's initiatives may significantly increase those costs. For example, DOD has yet to estimate costs associated with furnishing and equipping approximately 321 new buildings and 578 housing units in Okinawa. Without comprehensive and routine reporting of posture costs, DOD decision makers will not have the full fiscal context in which to develop posture plans and requirements, and congressional committees will lack a full understanding of the potential funding requirements associated with DOD budget requests."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD develop a business case analysis for its strategic objectives related to tour normalization in Korea, limit investments at Camp Humphreys until the business case is completed, and develop comprehensive cost estimates of posture in the Pacific.

In recent years, the Department of  Defense (DOD) has embarked on the largest transformation of U.S.  military posture in the Pacific region since the end of World War II. As of  March 2011, DOD posture initiatives planned for South Korea, Japan, and  Guam will affect tens of thousands of forward-deployed military personnel  and their dependents, and require the construction of hundreds of new  facilities and more than 3,500 housing units. According to DOD estimates,  the DOD population in South Korea may increase from approximately  56,000 to as much as 84,000, and the DOD population in Guam may  increase from 15,000 to 39,000 by as early as 2020. The cost of these  initiatives has yet to be fully estimated, but billions of dollars in combined  investments by host nations and the U.S. government have already been  identified as necessary to implement these initiatives.", "These posture transformation initiatives are being conducted in an era of  increasing budgetary pressures and competition for scarce resources. In  August 2010, the Secretary of Defense called on military leaders to  consider the affordability of programs in developing future plans, with  particular emphasis on reducing overhead costs. The Secretary of Defense  sought a $100-billion reduction in overhead costs over the next 5 years,  froze the size of combatant commands, and required \u201dzero-based\u201d reviews  of their staffing and organizations. In January 2011, the Secretary of  Defense announced he had approved the elimination of more than   100 general officer and flag officer positions and the elimination or  downgrading of nearly 200 civilian Senior Executive Service or equivalent  positions.", "In addition, we have recently reported on the need to address the long- term sustainability of the federal government\u2019s fiscal policies. Since the  end of the recent recession, the gross domestic product has grown slowly  and unemployment has remained at a high level. While the economy is still  recovering and in need of careful attention, there is widespread agreement  on the need to look not only at the near term but also at steps that begin to  change the long-term fiscal path as soon as possible without slowing the  recovery. In our report on opportunities to reduce potential duplication in  government programs, save tax dollars, and enhance revenue, we  observed that having U.S. troops stationed overseas provides benefits,  such as deterring aggression against U.S. allies, but permanent stationing  comes with significant costs. We emphasized the need for DOD to assess  costs and benefits of overseas military presence options before  committing to costly personnel realignments and construction plans.", "The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review highlights the importance of  periodically assessing and tailoring global defense posture in light of  continued globalization and enduring transnational threats. In the  Quadrennial Defense Review, DOD indicates that defense posture will  continuously adapt to the dynamic world environment and that ongoing  assessments of national interests, military requirements, and the strategic  environment should guide U.S. global defense-posture planning. In  addition, DOD identifies global posture as consisting of: (1) forces  (forward-stationed and rotationally deployed), capabilities, and  equipment; (2) overseas infrastructure and facilities; and (3) international  agreements with allies and key partners that may address issues such as  access, transit, and the framework under which U.S. military personnel  operate in a foreign country.

This report, prepared prior to the  earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan on March 11, 2011, addresses  the cost and affordability of the the department\u2019s efforts to transform its  defense posture in Asia. We examine: (1) the magnitude of cost associated  with the major global defense posture initiatives ongoing and planned on  the Korean peninsula and the process by which the decision was made to  move forward with the largest of these initiatives\u2014\u201dtour normalization;\u201d  (2) the magnitude of cost associated with the major global defense-posture  initiatives ongoing and planned in Japan and Guam; and (3) the extent to  which DOD develops comprehensive estimates of the cost of defense  posture in Asia to inform the decision-making process.", "This report is one of a series of GAO reports on DOD\u2019s global defense- posture initiatives. Since 2006, we have reported on issues related to  DOD\u2019s overall global-posture strategy and management practices, the  military buildup on Guam, the transformation of United States Army  posture in Europe, and the establishment of the United States Africa  Command. Those reports make a number of recommendations to improve  DOD\u2019s management of these efforts and the information about them that  DOD makes available to the executive branch and congressional  committees. Most recently, in February 2011, we reported on DOD military  posture in Europe, highlighting the need for additional cost information  and methods for evaluating posture alternatives in that region. In many  cases, DOD has agreed with our recommendations and has taken actions  to implement them.", "For each of our objectives, we reviewed relevant policies and procedures  governing the management and supervision of global defense posture, and  collected information by interviewing and communicating with officials in  the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Air Force, the Army, the Navy,  the Marine Corps, the Joint Staff, United States Pacific Command  (PACOM), and the State Department. We conducted site visits at PACOM  and its service components in Hawaii; United States Forces Japan (USFJ),  its service components, and the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, Japan, and the  U.S. Consulate on Okinawa; United States Forces Korea (USFK), its  service components, and the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, South Korea. To  identify the major global defense-posture initiatives ongoing and planned  and their associated costs, we reviewed appropriate DOD strategies, plans  and guidance including, but not limited to, the Quadrennial Defense  Review, Guidance for the Employment of the Force, and Guidance for the  Deployment of the Force; we also reviewed PACOM\u2019s Theater Campaign  Plan, Theater Posture Plan, and relevant plans and strategies developed  by PACOM\u2019s service components. To identify the cost of posture initiatives  in Korea and Japan, we requested posture-initiative cost estimates from  officials in each military service headquarters, PACOM, USFK, and USFJ.  For initiatives in Japan, DOD officials provided information based on  budget estimates prepared by the Government of Japan, but provided only  limited estimates of costs to the United States. For initiatives in Korea,  DOD officials provided high-level cost estimates, which included  assumptions related to the use of host-nation support funding and host- nation costs, which in some cases were constantly changing or not yet  approved. We discussed this cost information with officials in USFK,  USFJ, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and  determined that although the information was incomplete, it was  sufficiently reliable to provide an order of magnitude estimate of the  potential cost of each initiative, and therefore was adequate for the  purposes of our review, subject to the limitations discussed in this report.  To determine whether DOD captures and reports the total cost of posture  across the PACOM area of responsibility, we assessed the information  included in the 2009 and 2010 DOD Global Defense Posture Reports to  Congress, including the sections addressing posture costs, the 2010  PACOM Theater Posture Plan, and President\u2019s Budget requests for fiscal  years 2010 and 2011. We then used a systematic data collection approach  to obtain cost data from the departments of the Army, Air Force, and  Navy, including the Marine Corps, and their PACOM service component  commands, on posture funding requirements and obligations for fiscal  years 2006 through 2015. To assess the reliability of the cost data obtained  through our systematic data collection effort, we reviewed data system  documentation and obtained information on internal controls for those  systems. We determined that the cost data we received were reliable for  the purposes of this report.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2009 to April 2011,  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Some sites are large complexes containing many facilities to  support military operations, housing, and other support facilities, while  others can be as small as a single radar site.

Because they are scaleable,  they may have a large capacity that can be adapted to provide support  for combat operations, and therefore DOD populations at these  locations can vary greatly, depending on how they are used at any  given time.", "Cooperative security locations are overseas installations with little or  no permanent U.S. military presence, which are maintained with  periodic U.S. military, contractor, or host-nation support.

The Secretary of Defense provides corresponding strategic  direction in the National Defense Strategy. Furthermore, the Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff provides guidance to the military through the  National Military Strategy. The department has developed new guidance  for global defense posture in numerous documents, principally the 2008  Guidance for Employment of the Force and the 2008 Joint Strategic  Capabilities Plan. The Guidance for Employment of the Force  consolidates and integrates planning guidance related to operations and  other military activities, while the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan  implements the strategic policy direction provided in the Guidance for  Employment of the Force and tasks combatant commanders to develop  theater campaign, contingency, and posture plans that are consistent with  the Guidance for Employment of the Force. The Theater Campaign Plan  translates strategic objectives to facilitate the development of operational  and contingency plans, while the Theater Posture Plan provides an  overview of posture requirements to support those plans and identifies  major ongoing and new posture initiatives, including current and planned  military construction requirements.

According to USFK officials, this is an initiative agreed to between the  governments of the United States and South Korea in October 2004.

It is anticipated  that South Korea will fund much of the construction costs for this  initiative; USFK officials estimate that it will cost South Korea about   $6.3 billion and the United States about $2 billion in construction costs  through fiscal year 2016.", "Land Partnership Plan ($4 billion through fiscal year 2016). This  realignment, agreed to between the governments of the United States and  South Korea in March 2002, will move U.S. troops who are currently  stationed north of Seoul farther south to Camp Humphreys, and the land  they vacate is intended to be returned to South Korea. This move will  involve about 7,000 to 8,000 servicemembers, primarily from the 2nd  Infantry Division.

According to the State Department, in 2008, the Presidents of the United  States and South Korea agreed that U.S. troop strength would reach and  be maintained at 28,500.

As of September 2010, USFK officials estimated that the  total DOD population in South Korea was approximately 52,800, including  11,600 dependents. One approach developed by USFK officials for  implementing tour normalization called for completing the construction of  facilities and movement of dependents to South Korea by 2020 except for  the facilities and dependents associated with service members at Kunsan  Air Base (the Air Force has yet to decide if tour normalization will be  implemented at Kunsan Air Base). Under that schedule, initial steps to  implement tour normalization, such as increasing the number of  accompanied tours in South Korea, were expected to be completed in  fiscal year 2011, when USFK officials estimated the total DOD population  in South Korea would be about 54,000. Follow-on implementation steps  would increase the DOD population to about 60,000 by 2016, and 76,000 by  2020, according to USFK estimates (see fig. 4). If DOD implements tour  normalization at Kunsan Air Base, USFK estimated that this would occur  after 2020, and the total DOD population on the South Korean peninsula  could increase to about 84,000.", "Because DOD is still analyzing alternative tour normalization  implementation schedules, the estimated costs have yet to be fully defined  and have been changing. USFK officials have estimated that based on the  2020 implementation schedule, the cost to implement tour normalization  for all services (including military construction, family housing,  personnel, and operation and maintenance costs) would be about   $5.1 billion from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2020, although these  estimates are very preliminary and likely to change. Additional costs  estimated by USFK and the Army include:    USFK estimated $1.5 billion would be needed to implement tour  normalization at Kunsan AFB after fiscal year 2020. However,  according to Air Force officials, this estimate only covers construction  costs; the total implementation costs could be much higher.", "The Army calculated an extended cost estimate for tour normalization  from 2021 through 2050.

According to the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, a  business case analysis is a comparative analysis that presents facts and  supporting details among competing alternatives. A business case  analysis considers not only all the life cycle costs of competing  alternatives, but also quantifiable and nonquantifiable benefits. This  analysis should be unbiased by considering all possible alternatives and  should not be developed solely for supporting a predetermined solution.  Moreover, a business case analysis should be rigorous enough that  independent auditors can review it and clearly understand why a  particular alternative was chosen. A business case analysis seeks to find  the best value solution by linking each alternative to how it satisfies a  strategic objective. Each alternative should identify the  relative life-cycle costs and benefits;    methods and rationale for quantifying the life-cycle costs and benefits;   effect and value of cost, schedule and performance tradeoffs;    Sensitivity to changes in assumptions; and  risk factors.", "On the basis of this information, the business case analysis then  recommends the best alternative. Our Cost Assessment Guide also states  that in addition to supporting an investment decision, the business case  analysis should be considered a living document and should be updated  often to reflect changes in scope, schedule, or budget. In this way, a  business case analysis is a valuable tool for validating decisions to sustain  or enhance the program.", "DOD has focused on and produced tour normalization cost estimates and  continues to refine them, but has not addressed the other aspects of a  business case analysis\u2014which, according to the GAO Cost Estimating  and Assessment Guide would include analyzing alternatives to tour  normalization and determining the associated costs, benefits, advantages,  and disadvantages of any viable alternative. For example, USFK officials  stated that tour normalization was driven by the USFK Commander\u2019s  strategic objectives to (1) obtain greater flexibility in deploying U.S. forces  assigned to South Korea and (2) improve military families\u2019 quality of life by  reducing the amount of time they were separated by deployments.  However, DOD has not clearly demonstrated the extent to which tour  normalization will actually achieve these objectives or the total costs  involved relative to other alternatives. Specifically, a January 2006 joint  statement of the United States and South Korea affirms that South Korea,  as an ally, fully understands the rationale for the transformation of the U.S.  global military strategy and respects the necessity for strategic flexibility  of the U.S. forces in South Korea. U.S. Embassy officials in Seoul  confirmed that there are currently no legal impediments to prevent the  United States from deploying its forces, and under existing agreements,  DOD has flexibility in deploying its forces to other countries or regions as  necessary. However, USFK officials told us that in their view, the  Government of South Korea and the general public remained reluctant to  support such deployments after the United States deployed an Army  brigade to Iraq in 2004 that did not return to South Korea.", "According to the State Department, in April 2008 the Presidents of the United States and  South Korea agreed to maintain the United States force level on the peninsula at 28,500. regions. In those cases, servicemembers would be separated from their  immediate family members in South Korea when they are deployed, and  family members residing in South Korea would be separated from their  extended family network in the United States.", "The financial risks of implementing tour normalization without a business  case analysis to support the decision are high, given the magnitude of the  resources that will be required and the impact on military construction  plans. For example, most of the military dependents who would move to  South Korea under this initiative would move to Camp Humphreys. At the  time of our visit to that location in March 2010 the construction plan for  Camp Humphreys included adding 2,328 acres to the camp, increasing the  total size to 3,538 acres. The plan also included constructing more than a  thousand new structures, including five new schools and an assortment of  housing and other support facilities at an estimated cost of approximately  $13.1 billion. This construction plan and the estimated cost combines  construction of new facilities and infrastructure to accommodate military  service members and dependents associated with the Yongsan Relocation  Plan, Land Partnership Plan, and initial construction associated with tour  normalization initiatives. At the time of our visit, significant land  reclamation was already under way to support the overall transformation  efforts, and new construction had started on facilities such as family  housing, recreational facilities and a family style water park. (see fig. 5).", "Existing Camp  Humphreys 1,210 acres However, the plan for Camp Humphreys at the time of our visit did not  include building the necessary infrastructure to accommodate the  population expected to be added if tour normalization is fully  implemented. DOD officials stated that if tour normalization were to be  fully implemented, Camp Humphreys would require seven additional  schools\u2014as well as an increase in other infrastructure such as housing,  commissaries, and postal facilities. We were also told that the land area  currently dedicated to new construction would not accommodate these  additional buildings, and therefore existing building plans would have to  be modified and additional land might have to be acquired. The Army  Corps of Engineers official responsible for executing the building plan at  Camp Humphreys stated that accommodating the total tour normalization  population would call for a modified or new plan for the camp and that,  with construction already under way, it would be critical to modify the  plans as soon as possible, because costly modifications to building plans  could result from changing facility requirements after major construction  has begun. However, in our discussions with Office of the Secretary of  Defense officials from the Policy and Comptroller\u2019s office, we were told  that because the construction plan for Camp Humphreys combines facility  and infrastructure requirements for the Yongsan Relocation, Land  Partnership, and tour normalization initiatives, they were unable to  determine the extent to which tour normalization has affected  construction plans at Camp Humphreys.", "Tour normalization will also have a major impact on posture costs and  pilot training capabilities at Osan Air Base, located a few miles away from  Camp Humphreys. For example, during our visit to Osan Air Base, officials  told us that one of the challenges they face in implementing tour  normalization is the limited amount of space available to construct the  required housing, parking, child development center, commissary, six  schools, and other quality-of-life facilities. At the time of our visit to Osan  Air Base, base officials provided an overview of their plans to implement  tour normalization, which required the demolition of approximately 20 or  more existing facilities and included 51 construction projects. (All but one  of these projects were planned to start in fiscal year 2012 or later.) Also,  according to Air Force officials, the Air Force\u2019s training capabilities in  South Korea for its F-16 pilots are inadequate; lengthening tours to 2 or   3 years would exacerbate this training deficiency. Specifically, Air Force  officials stated that their pilots do not get enough training time on South  Korean training ranges because the pilots must share the ranges with  South Korean pilots. In addition, South Korean ranges do not offer all of  the training these pilots need. Currently, this reduced training capacity is  deemed acceptable by the Air Force because pilots are reassigned after a  1-year tour and can update their training at their next duty station.  However, according to Air Force officials, if 3-year tours are established  for their pilots in South Korea, they may have to send the pilots on training  missions to Alaska\u2014the closest site with the required capabilities\u2014for the  training they need to maintain the necessary qualification levels.

In February 2005, the  United States Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense hosted Japan\u2019s  Minister for Foreign Affairs, and its Minister of State for Defense and  Director-General of the Defense Agency in a meeting of the United States- Japan Security Consultative Committee. During that meeting, the officials  reached an understanding on common strategic objectives, and  underscored the need to continue examinations of the roles, missions, and  capabilities of Japan\u2019s Self-Defense Forces and the U.S. Armed Forces in  pursuing those objectives. They also decided to intensify their  consultations on realignment of U.S. force structure in Japan. On October  29, 2005, the Security Consultative Committee released a document titled  U.S.-Japan Alliance: Transformation and Realignment for the Future  that, among other points, approved recommendations for realignment of  U.S. military forces in Japan and related Japan Self Defense Forces, in  light of their shared commitment to maintain deterrence and capabilities  while reducing burdens on local communities, including those in  Okinawa. Both sides recognized the importance of enhancing Japanese  and U.S. public support for the security alliance. In May 2006, a United  States\u2014Japan Roadmap for Realignment Implementation was released  that provided details on the approved recommendations for realignment  and stated the construction and other costs for facility development in the  implementation of these initiatives will be borne by the Government of  Japan unless otherwise specified. The Roadmap also stated the U.S.  Government will bear the operational costs that arise from  implementation of these initiatives, and the two Governments will finance  their realignment-associated costs consistent with their commitments to  maintain deterrence and capabilities while reducing burdens on local  communities. The U.S. and Japanese governments signed an agreement in  February 2009 that implemented certain aspects of the Roadmap related  to the relocation of the III Marine Expeditionary Force from Okinawa to  Guam.", "As of December 2009, DOD had approximately 45,000 servicemembers  stationed in Japan, with approximately 24,600 stationed in Okinawa.

In 2006, Japan estimated that  it would spend approximately $1.4 billion to construct new facilities under  this initiative, but DOD has not estimated its own costs. Under this  initiative, the fixed-wing aircraft attached to Carrier Air Wing 5 would  move to Iwakuni, but according to Navy officials, the rotary wing  squadrons would stay at Atsugi.

DOD plans to relocate a Marine Aviation Group, Logistics  Squadron, and several helicopter squadrons to the Futenma Replacement  Facility once it is complete. Although plans for the new air base have not  been finalized, one option includes the construction of two runways  aligned in a V shape that would extend into the Oura and Henoko Bays,  while another option would require a single runway.

It is expected that the 8,600 marines who relocate to Guam will  include the III Marine Expeditionary Force Command Element, the 3rd  Marine Division Headquarters and 3rd Marine Logistics Group  Headquarters, the 1st Marine Air Wing Headquarters, and the 12th Marine  Regiment Headquarters. The governments of Japan and the United States  have agreed to share the costs of transferring the Marines from Okinawa  to Guam, with the Government of Japan anticipated to provide about   $6.1 billion and the United States anticipated to provide an additional   $4.2 billion (in U.S. fiscal year 2008 dollars) for construction of new  facilities and infrastructure development on Guam. In addition, the  Marine Corps estimates that an additional $7.1 billion may be required to  complete the move to Guam-\u2014$4.7 billion for additional construction  costs and $2.4 for costs associated with utilities, labor, and procurement of  military equipment.

Figure 9 illustrates the locations where these initiatives  will be implemented on the island. If implemented as planned, these  initiatives will increase the U.S. military presence on Guam from about  15,000 in 2009 to more than 39,000 by 2020, which will increase the current  population of the island by about 14 percent over those years. We have  issued a series of reports discussing various aspects of the military buildup  on Guam and the costs and challenges DOD will face in accomplishing  those initiatives, including obtaining adequate funding and meeting  operational needs, such as mobility support and training capabilities.

According to Marine Corps officials, independent of the  progress made on the initiatives in Japan and Guam, the Marine Corps will  proceed with constructing new training areas in the Pacific. Some training  areas are expected to be constructed on Guam for the Marines. However,  the environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Marine Corps\u2019 move to  Guam found that Guam cannot accommodate all training for the realigned  Marine Corps forces. DOD has identified the nearby island of Tinian   (100 miles away) and other islands in the Northern Mariana Islands as  locations that could provide additional land for training. Marine Corps  officials estimate that building the training range in the Northern Mariana  Islands could cost approximately $1.9 billion or more. Of that amount,  Marine Corps Pacific officials identified $1 billion in funding requirements  from fiscal years 2012 through 2015 to cover costs such as military  construction, planning and development, environmental compliance, and  combat arms training ranges. The remaining cost for full development of  the training capabilities and capacity in the Northern Mariana Islands was  at least $900 million over an unspecified period of time, according to the  Marine Corps officials.", "According to DOD officials, comprehensive cost estimates for posture  initiatives in Japan, including all costs that will be incurred by the United  States, have not been completed because there are many uncertainties  surrounding initiative implementation schedules. According to Marine  Corps officials and confirmed by USFJ officials, when the Government of  Japan is constructing any facility for the United States, it does not outline  specific timetables; therefore, knowing when a Government of Japan-led  construction project will begin or end is difficult to determine and can  affect DOD\u2019s ability to estimate future costs. This is important because the  United States-Japan Roadmap for Realignment Implementation, dated  May 1, 2006, indicates that the Government of Japan will generally bear the  construction and other costs for facility development under these  initiatives, and the United States will bear the operational costs. In  January 2011, USFJ officials indicated that the service component  commands were in the process of developing some initiative cost  estimates, but their efforts were not complete and no additional  information was provided on the status of these efforts or expected  results.", "In the United States Department of Defense Fiscal Year 2011 Budget  Request Overview, prepared by the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense (Comptroller), DOD outlined the need to change how the  department buys its weapons and other important systems and  investments. According to DOD, one way to reform how the department  invests is to strengthen front-end scrutiny of costs and not rely on overly  optimistic or underestimated costs from the beginning of the investment.  In addition, according to the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment  Guide, one method for capturing all cost elements that pertain to a  program from the initial concept through its operations, support, and  eventual end, is through a life-cycle cost estimate. A life cycle cost  estimate encompasses all past, present, and future costs for every aspect  of the program, regardless of funding source. A life-cycle cost estimate  usually becomes the program\u2019s budget baseline because the estimate  ensures that all costs are fully accounted for, determines when a program  is supposed to move from one phase to another, and establishes if  resources are adequate to support the program.", "Seeking more visibility into DOD posture initiative costs and funding  requirements, the Senate Appropriations Committee recently directed  DOD to provide comprehensive and routine updates on the status of  posture-restructuring initiatives in South Korea, Japan, Guam, and the  Northern Mariana Islands (see app. II).

The  2008 Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan requires that each combatant  command provide, in its theater posture plan, information on the  inventory of installations in the combatant commander\u2019s area of  responsibility, to include estimates of the funding required for proposed  military construction projects.

To ensure the most cost effective approach is  pursued, major initiatives, such as tour normalization in South Korea,  require not only comprehensive cost estimates but a thorough  examination of the potential benefits, advantages, disadvantages, and  affordability of viable alternatives before a course of action is selected.  However, despite not having an approved business case that supports the  decision to move forward with tour normalization and the presence of  outstanding questions about the cost and schedule to implement the  initiative, DOD is constructing facilities and infrastructure at Camp  Humphreys in a manner that combines requirements for multiple  initiatives, an approach that makes it difficult to identify what funds or  construction activities are at risk if a more cost-effective alternative to  tour normalization is identified. Furthermore, across the Pacific region,  DOD has embarked on complex initiatives to transform U.S. military  posture, and these initiatives involve major construction programs and the  movement of tens of thousands of DOD civilian and military personnel,  and dependents\u2014at an undetermined total cost to the United States and  host nations.

We conducted interviews and collected  data from officials at the U.S. Army Garrison Yongsan, U.S. Army Garrison  Humphreys, and Osan Air Base. We also met with U.S. officials at the U.S.  Embassy in Seoul, South Korea. We collected planning and cost  information at military service headquarters, PACOM, United States  Forces Korea, and United States Forces Korea\u2019s Army and Air Force  service components. For initiatives in Korea, USFK officials provided high- level cost estimates, which included assumptions related to the use of  host-nation support funding and host-nation costs, which in some cases  were constantly changing or not yet approved. Army headquarters officials  provided us with detailed estimates of tour normalization costs extended  to 2050, and stated those estimates were the official position of the  Department of the Army on tour normalization costs. We compiled this  initiative information, including available cost information and  assumptions related to host-nation funding, in order to identify the  magnitude of DOD\u2019s initiatives and their potential costs. We converted  host-nation funding to U.S. dollars using exchange rates published in the  2011 Economic Report of the President. We discussed the cost information  we received with officials in USFK and Office of the Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) and determined that although the information was  incomplete, it was sufficiently reliable to provide an order-of-magnitude  estimate of the potential cost of each initiative and therefore was adequate  for the purposes of our review, subject to the limitations discussed in this  report. Once we consolidated initiative description and cost information,  we provided our summaries back to the cognizant DOD offices to ensure  we had appropriately interpreted the data they provided. To determine  whether tour normalization was supported by a business case analysis, we  interviewed and collected data from the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense (Policy), the Department of the Army, and United States Forces  Korea officials. Additionally, we collected and analyzed documentation,  including the current and previous versions of the Quadrennial Defense  Review, OSD policy documents related to tour normalization, and strategic  documentation referencing the decision to move forward with tour  normalization. We then compared DOD\u2019s approach to criteria established  in the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide.", "To determine the magnitude of cost associated with the major global  defense posture initiatives ongoing and planned in Japan, Guam, and the  Northern Mariana Islands, we interviewed and collected data from officials  in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Policy), the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), the Office of the Deputy Under  Secretary of Defense (Installations and Environment), and the Joint Staff;  the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the  Department of the Air Force; PACOM and the Army, Navy, Marine Corps,  and Air Force component commands; United States Forces Japan and its  military service components, including Marine Corps Bases Japan; and the  Joint Guam Program Office.

At all appropriate offices included in our review, including Office of the  Secretary of Defense, PACOM and its service component commands, USFJ  and its component commands and at specific military facilities visited, we  requested comprehensive DOD cost estimates for each posture initiative  and were told that comprehensive cost estimates for each initiative did not  exist. As a result, we collected planning, any cost information that was  available, and initiative status information. For initiatives in Japan, DOD  officials provided information based on budget estimates prepared by the  Government of Japan, but provided only limited estimates of costs to the  United States.

We also reviewed the 2009 and 2010 DOD  Global Defense Posture Reports to Congress, including the sections  addressing posture costs, and sections of the 2010 PACOM Theater  Posture Plans. We also reviewed budget documentation, including the  military construction appropriations component of the President\u2019s Budget  request for fiscal years 2010 and 2011. Furthermore, we issued data  requests asking for actual obligations and projected requirements data on  military construction, family housing, and operations and maintenance  appropriations related to installations as part of DOD\u2019s defense posture in  Asia for fiscal years 2006 through 2015.
