After visiting several overseas posts, the Panel concluded that the condition of U.S. posts and missions abroad was unacceptable and recommended eight major types of changes, which, according to its report, would improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our overseas presence. Specifically, the panel directed the President, the Secretary of State, and congressional leaders to form a partnership to implement the following eight recommendations: improve security and establish accountability for security at our overseas facilities;   create the right size and shape for our overseas presence, ensuring that posts are not over- or under-staffed;   ensure that U.S. facilities are quickly and efficiently renovated and are properly maintained and managed on an ongoing basis;   adopt best practices for human resources management, such as improving recruitment and expanding training and promotion opportunities; invest in up-to-date information technology, including providing Internet access and e-mail to all staff; improve and reinforce consular services, such as same-day processing of visas;   enact cost- and time-saving administrative reforms, such as consolidating some functions (e.g., accounting practices) and automating others; and reinforce the responsibilities and authorities of Ambassadors, who represent the interests of the President of the United States.", "Because State is the lead agency for foreign affairs, President Clinton directed the former Secretary of State, on February 10, 2000, to lead a cabinet-level committee to implement the Panel\u2019s recommendations. As part of the former Secretary\u2019s response, the Under Secretary for Management formed an interagency Overseas Presence Committee (the Committee) in February 2000 to address three of the eight recommendations. The Committee then established three subcommittees to implement the Panel\u2019s recommendations: Overseas Facilities, Interagency Rightsizing, and Interagency Technology.

In response to the recommendation to invest in up-to- date information technology, State reported that it had   established an acquisition and deployment strategy, preliminary system requirements, a high-level implementation plan, and an architectural concept for a common overseas knowledge management system infrastructure;   established September 2000 as the goal for completing a formal program management plan, with a goal of revising the plan by April 2001 after completing evaluation of a prototype system; and   established December 2001 as the goal for completing system pilot testing at two posts.", "On August 8, 2001, State issued its final status report on its efforts to address the Panel\u2019s recommended changes to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. With regard to the recommendation to upgrade information technology, State reported that the interagency group has developed and is testing a prototype of the common overseas system and that a field test of the system\u2019s infrastructure is being conducted at pilot posts in Mexico and India. In addition, State officials told us that the date for completing system prototyping has been delayed by 13 months to May 2002, and the date for completing pilot testing at two posts has been delayed by 9 months to September 2002.

Key system capabilities are to include, among other things, interagency e-mail, post-specific news and information web-based links, crisis coordination support, policy formulation support, and various administrative functions (e.g., accounting, contract management, training, and travel). According to State\u2019s draft program management plan, the department will acquire and deploy system functionality in each of these areas in three increments, or three prioritized groupings of user requirements, which State calls pilot, full-scale implementation, and deferred. (See table 2 for planned system functionality by increment.)", "The system is to use commercially available, Internet-based technology to enable users to access the system from any location using their respective agencies\u2019 existing networks and operating platforms. The desktop Internet browser is intended to be the connection to the common overseas system and its knowledge management tools.

(See fig. 2 for a simplified diagram of the system.)", "In 1999, the Panel estimated the cost to acquire and deploy this unclassified system at about $200 million, assuming the use of commercially available technology. About a year later, State estimated that the investment in the system through fiscal year 2004 would be about $271 million. State plans to update this cost estimate. According to State\u2019s draft program management plan, the estimated cost to perform system prototyping and pilot testing is $18.2 million.", "The conference report accompanying the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001, stated the conference committee\u2019s expectation that State would spend $17 million to carry the program through pilot testing.

In our testimony, we stated, among other things, that it was important for State to (1) carefully plan the initiative establishing realistic goals and milestones, (2) install the needed management and oversight accountability to properly guide the acquisition of the system, and (3) anticipate the steps needed to gain the full cooperation of its agency partners."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State\u2019s Near-Term Plans Are Focused on Risk Reduction Activities", "paragraphs": ["Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance outlines risk reduction principles that are consistent with best commercial practices and, if effectively implemented, can increase the probability that system modernization programs will succeed.

In particular, State is currently focused on acquiring and evaluating system prototypes that are to employ either commercially available and/or government-used hardware and software products. On July 5, 2001, State selected three vendors, each of which was to develop a prototype system by October 2001. However, according to a State official, because of security and infrastructure concerns identified during testing that the vendors must address, the systems are now scheduled for delivery in November 2001. In addition, State planned to evaluate the delivered prototype systems using evaluation criteria that were to be developed by a private firm by September 28, 2001. While an initial draft of the criteria was provided on that date, according to a State official, revisions were needed, and the deadline for finalizing the evaluation criteria was changed to mid-November 2001. Although these events will delay the deadline for completing the prototype evaluation one month to May 2002, piloting activities will not be affected and will begin as scheduled. Once the prototype system solutions have been evaluated, State and its agency partners plan to use the best capabilities from each prototype to refine user requirements and develop a specification for the foundational system capabilities that will be pilot tested. State plans to pilot test these foundational capabilities in India and Mexico between April and September 2002. According to State, no commitments have been made to proceed beyond this pilot test, and any decisions about how best to proceed will have to involve agency partners, OMB, and relevant congressional committees.", "In addition to prototyping the system and using commercially available products, State has also taken steps to engage other foreign affairs agencies in its prototyping activities, including securing stakeholder involvement and buy-in. Specifically, responses from the seven modernization program partner agencies that responded to our survey showed that they were generally satisfied with State\u2019s efforts to engage them in near-term program activities. Additionally, four of these agencies stated that State had informally obtained their concurrence on such items as program plans and system requirements. As for the other three agencies, one stated that while it had reviewed some of the program documentation, it had not participated in an approval process; another stated that it had reviewed program documentation for informational purposes only and was unaware of any approval process; and the third stated that it had not reviewed any of the program documentation.", "Nevertheless, we found that these and other interagency meetings, such as program working group meetings, have occurred and provided forums for informally engaging agency partners. In general, agency partners attended these meetings and participated in the program. For example, two agency partners have assigned staff to the FASI Program Office.", "Available documentation and State CIO officials\u2019 statements confirm that agency partners\u2019 buy-in to program decisions, such as agreement on the requirements for the prototype and approval of plans, is being accomplished informally. According to State, representatives for the partner agencies agreed that their lack of opposition or comments equated to concurrence on actions, plans, and/or documents, thereby eliminating the need to obtain actual signatures to indicate approval.

Similarly, the Software Engineering Institute (SEI), recognized for its expertise in managing software-intensive systems, emphasizes the importance of clearly designating roles and responsibilities on system acquisition programs. While doing so is essential on any program, it is particularly critical for programs like the overseas-presence knowledge management modernization program because its success depends on the effective interplay of multiple federal agencies. Without well-defined, understood, and agreed-to roles in such areas as funding and acquisition management (e.g., investment decisionmaking, requirements management, architecture definition and integration with legacy systems, and testing), State cannot, for example, be assured that necessary resources will be provided (e.g., financial, human capital, and technological) and critical tasks executed.", "According to State, the roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities of foreign affairs agencies have been formally defined. However, State did not provide us with documentation to support this position, as we requested. Furthermore, agency partners that responded to our survey stated that their respective roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities for this initiative have not yet been formally defined.", "According to State, as the principal foreign affairs agency, its role is to provide administrative and management leadership and support for near- term prototype and pilot-testing activities, and it is the agent for bringing the foreign affairs agencies together. However, State said that it is not responsible for engaging agency partners as part of the near-term prototype and pilot-testing activities.", "As noted earlier, given the stated purpose and scope of these near-term activities and State\u2019s leadership role, this definition of roles is not currently a significant issue.

Using this approach, agencies can avoid discovering too late that their systems are not cost beneficial and reduce the risks associated with large, expensive projects. This approach allows overlap and smooth transition among increments because lessons learned from actual results of ongoing increments would be monitored and evaluated continuously so that these results will be available for use in defining and justifying future increments.", "The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 requires agencies to follow, to the maximum extent practical, an incremental approach to investing in IT projects. Also, OMB policy requires that investments in major systems be implemented in increments, with each increment delivering measurable benefits. More specifically, OMB\u2019s Capital Programming Guide describes the use of modular contracting, or incremental investment, including its application and benefits. In particular, OMB states that project increments should provide for the following:   Separability: Each increment should be fully funded, have substantial programmatic use that is not dependent on any subsequent increment, and be capable of performing its principal functions, even if no subsequent increments are acquired. Interoperability: Each increment should comply with a common architecture or commercially acceptable technology standards and should be compatible with and capable of being integrated with other increments.", "Performance requirements: Each increment\u2019s performance requirement should be consistent with the performance requirements of the completed overall system and should address interface requirements with other increments.", "In short, incremental investment helps to mitigate the risks inherent in acquiring/developing large systems by dividing a single, large program into smaller, independently useful components with known and defined relationships and dependencies. It is well understood that making investment decisions up front on large-scale, long-term programs is risky because their economic justification is based on costs, benefits, and risks that are difficult to forecast reliably, partially because later increments are not well understood or defined and partially because they are subject to change in light of experience on nearer term increments and changing business needs. Through incremental investment management, organizations can reduce the level of program risk and complexity faced at any one time by spreading this risk and complexity across a series of smaller investments;   permit the delivery of some part of the expected business value earlier rather than waiting until later for the total, but more uncertain, business value;   continuously monitor and evaluate the delivery of cost and benefit expectations on ongoing increments and use this information to better define and economically justify these increments; and   permit later increments to exploit technology advances or accommodate evolving business needs.", "According to modernization officials, preliminary plans provide for acquiring and investing in the overseas knowledge management system in three increments: pilot, full-scale implementation, and deferred. However, State has not yet established specific plans and management processes for acquiring the operational system because, according to State\u2019s CIO, it does not have congressional authorization to do so. We were unable to corroborate State\u2019s position as to why it has not established these plans and processes.", "In addition, modernization officials stated that the ongoing system prototyping and planned pilot-testing activities were not economically justified as a separate increment. However, these officials noted that all future incremental investments in the system will be economically justified, and the results and lessons learned from prior increments will be used to define and make investment decisions about future increment(s). Additionally, they stated that future increments will also be evaluated to ensure that return-on-investment commitments are met.", "It is critical for State to follow through on its stated commitments to implement incremental investment practices. Otherwise, it risks making a single, monolithic investment decision for the entire program. This \u201call or nothing\u201d approach to investing in IT has historically resulted in agencies investing huge sums of money in systems that do not provide commensurate benefits, and thus has been abandoned by successful organizations.

Among other things, these practices include the following:   Because the architecture is a corporate asset for systematically managing institutional change, the head or leader of the enterprise should support and sponsor the architecture, giving it a clear mandate in the form of an enterprise policy statement. Such support is crucial to gaining the commitment of all organizational components of the enterprise, all of whom should participate in developing and implementing the enterprise architecture.", "The enterprise architecture effort should be directed and overseen by an executive body, empowered by the head(s) of the organization(s), with members who represent all stakeholder organizations and have the authority to commit resources and to make and enforce decisions for their respective organizations.", "The enterprise architecture effort should be led by a Chief Architect who reports to the enterprise CIO, and it should be managed as a formal program.

Accordingly, it is critical for State to also move aggressively in the near term to (1) clearly define, through written agreements, the respective management and funding responsibilities and accountabilities of the program\u2019s agency partners and (2) institute key modernization management controls, including incremental investment management practices, enterprise architecture governance, and software acquisition management rigor and discipline. While State has verbally committed to addressing these areas, much remains to be done before State and its agency partners will be ready to proceed beyond prototyping and pilot testing and begin acquiring the system solution intended for operational deployment and use.

We also recommend that this steering committee be assigned responsibility and accountability for ensuring that a complete and approved enterprise architecture is developed and available to guide and constrain overseas-presence system modernization efforts. To assist the steering committee, we recommend that the Under Secretary direct the State CIO to establish an enterprise architecture project office, headed by the recently named Chief Architect, to develop and maintain the enterprise architecture and submit appropriate versions of this architecture to the steering committee for approval. We further recommend that the State CIO, at a minimum, ensure that the project office (1) include staff from each of the overseas-presence agencies; (2) integrate the architecture with these agencies\u2019 respective operational and systems environments; and (3) adhere, as appropriate, with the federal CIO Council\u2019s published guidance on managing enterprise architectures.", "To further address State\u2019s need to implement modernization management controls, we recommend that the Under Secretary for Management direct the State CIO to ensure that the overseas-presence system modernization office, consistent with State\u2019s project management requirements and recognized models for effective software acquisition, establishes and implements rigorous and disciplined acquisition processes, including processes for acquisition planning, contractor solicitation, requirements development and management, contractor tracking and oversight, testing and evaluation, transition to support the acquired system, and risk management.", "Until these recommended modernization management controls are in place, we also recommend that the Secretary limit further investment in the overseas-presence knowledge management modernization program to (1) conducting ongoing prototyping and limited pilot testing and (2) establishing needed modernization management controls."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report (reprinted in appendix II), State\u2019s Acting Chief Financial Officer agreed with our findings and conclusions that its management controls over near-term prototype and pilot-testing activities are adequate, but disagreed with our finding and conclusion that State\u2019s existing controls are not adequate for effectively managing the more demanding next phase of the program\u2014acquisition and deployment of the operational system. Furthermore, State disagreed with our recommendations for instituting stronger management controls before proceeding to this next phase. According to State, our recommendations should be deleted from the report because (1) we reported that management controls over near-term activities are adequate and thus corrective actions are not needed; (2) except for clearly defining and agreeing to all agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities, State\u2019s existing management controls are adequate for acquiring and deploying the operational system; and (3) the lead agency for the next phase of the program is uncertain and thus the recommendations are premature. At the same time, State said that most of the recommendations might more reasonably be submitted as suggestions for consideration to the lead agency for the next phase of the program.", "We do not agree with State\u2019s comment that its existing management controls are adequate for the next phase of the program. As stated in our report, the nature and purpose of system prototyping and pilot testing are fundamentally different; thus, the associated risks are less significant than those related to acquiring a system that is to be operationally deployed. As a result, it is widely recognized that the level of management control to effectively put in place an operational system, particularly a system like the overseas knowledge-management system that involves multiple agencies, is greater than is needed to prototype or pilot test the system. Thus, for example, while State\u2019s lack of an enterprise architecture to guide and constrain near-term prototype and pilot-testing activities does not introduce significant program risk, it would introduce considerable risk for State to begin the next program phase without this architecture. Similarly, while State\u2019s approach to managing its investment in near-term activities is adequate, effectively acquiring and deploying the operational system will require rigorous management processes that, for example, provide for incremental economic justification and measurement of system return-on-investment, and provide for fully implementing disciplined acquisition management practices in such areas as managing system requirements.", "We also do not agree with State\u2019s rationale for deleting the report\u2019s recommendations because these recommendations (1) are not intended to correct problems with management of the prototype and pilot activities, as State asserts, but rather to proactively provide a recommended road map for how to successfully manage the next phase of the program; (2) are consistent with our conclusions that existing management controls are not adequate for the next phase of the program; and (3) recognize that prudent planning requires that agency roles and responsibilities for the next phase of the program, including designation of the lead agency, be clearly defined and agreed to during this phase to better ensure program continuity and to avoid unnecessary delays.

Additionally, we interviewed State modernization program officials, including the Deputy Chief Information Officer (CIO)/Chief Knowledge Officer, Deputy Chief Knowledge Officer, and the Director for Standards, Policy, Planning, and Architecture, to discuss State\u2019s near- and long-term plans, as well as representatives of the Overseas Presence Committee and the Interagency Technology Subcommittee to discuss the status of these plans and activities, and inter- and intra-agency coordination concerns. To confirm the extent to which State had engaged its agency partners, we surveyed State\u2019s eight agency partners to determine whether they (1) were satisfied with State\u2019s efforts to engage them in the program, (2) had reviewed and approved the program plans and related documents, and (3) believed that State was adequately addressing their requirements and/or information needs.

We then obtained and analyzed documentation outlining State\u2019s investment review process for selecting, controlling, and evaluating projects since plans are currently for State to fully fund the project (prototype and pilot). Because documentation on State\u2019s investment management activities to date and future plans for this system were not available, we interviewed officials from the modernization program office [Foreign Affairs Systems Integration (FASI) Office] and Deputy CIO for Architecture, Planning, and Regulations Office to determine if State and its partners planned to use an incremental investment management strategy. We then compared available information on State\u2019s investment management plans against relevant federal requirements and guidance to identify if any variances existed.", "To determine whether an enterprise architecture exists for the system to guide and constrain investment, we reviewed relevant legislative requirements and associated OMB guidance, as well as federal CIO Council published guidance and applicable State policy and guidance,on developing, maintaining, and implementing an enterprise architecture.", "We then reviewed available documentation, including plans and management structures, a charter, process controls, and architectural artifacts, as well as interviewing FASI Program Office officials, including the Director for Standards, Policy, Planning, and Architecture, to determine the state of any enterprise architecture development and implementation efforts.

We then reviewed available best practice models on system and software acquisition management (e.g., the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) model) and compared the primary components of the Managing State Projects methodology against the primary components of SEI\u2019s model to determine if any variances existed. SEI\u2019s primary components include software acquisition planning, solicitation, requirements development and management, project office management, contractor tracking and oversight, evaluation, transition and support, and risk management.

See comments 2 through 12. 2. We did not address the adequacy of funding for near-term activities as part of this review. 3. We disagree. Our report clearly links our findings, conclusions, and recommendations. Specifically, the report states that the level of management rigor and discipline needed to effectively manage prototype and pilot-testing activities is not as demanding as that needed for acquisition and deployment of a system that is to be used operationally. For example, while State\u2019s lack of an enterprise architecture to guide and constrain prototype and pilot-testing activities does not introduce significant risk, it would introduce considerable risk for State to begin the next phase of the program without this architecture. Accordingly, we concluded that State\u2019s existing management controls were not adequate for the next phase of the program, and we made recommendations that are intended to proactively provide a framework for effectively managing the more demanding next phase of the program. We made no recommendations intended to correct problems with State\u2019s management of its near-term activities because we concluded that controls over the less demanding prototype and pilot-testing activities were adequate. 4. We disagree. Our report clearly describes how State\u2019s existing management controls are not adequate for the next phase of the program. For example, State does not yet have an enterprise architecture to effectively guide and constrain investment in the system. Our experience with federal agencies has shown that attempting to define and build major systems without first completing and using an enterprise architecture often results in systems that are duplicative, not well integrated, unnecessarily costly to maintain and interface, and not effectively optimizing mission performance. Similarly, State has not yet implemented an effective process for managing requirements for an operational system, as evidenced in the report by the fact that agency partners have not formally approved requirements for the prototype and pilot systems. Although not having formally approved requirements for building prototypes and conducting pilot tests does not introduce significant risks, it would introduce considerable risk for State to acquire a system that is to be operationally deployed without having formally approved requirements. 5. We agree that State has not proposed program and management plans beyond the prototype and pilot-testing activities. 6. We agree. State\u2019s plans provide for preparing a prototype and pilot testing evaluation report. Also, such a report will be needed by not only the lead agency for acquiring and deploying the operational system, but also all participating agencies that will need to integrate the operational system with their respective legacy systems. 7. See comments 3, 4, and 5. 8. We agree. As stated in our report, the Secretary of State was directed to lead a cabinet-level committee to implement the recommendations of the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel, which included acquiring and deploying a multiagency common platform knowledge management system. While we recognize the possibility that State might not be the lead agency for the next phase of the program, we strongly believe that, to allow for program continuity and avoid unnecessary delays, these issues must be addressed now. Since State is currently the lead agency for the program, the recommendations are being directed to the Secretary of State. 9. We agree with State\u2019s comment, and note in our report, that the roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities of State and its agency partners would need to be fully and formally defined before moving beyond planned near-term activities. Although State asserted during the course of our review, and in its comments, that its present informal structure for managing agency relationships is working and its comments assert that it provided documents to us attesting to this on numerous occasions, this documentation, while voluminous and repetitive, did not demonstrate what the current process is and whether it was working. As a result, we were forced to expand the scope of work to include a survey of State\u2019s agency partners to determine whether State had engaged them in program- related activities.", "From our survey, we were able to conclude that State had taken adequate action to engage the agencies. Nevertheless, some agencies raised concerns that must be addressed before beginning the next phase of the program. For example, one agency partner stated that it had not participated in an approval process for program planning documentation, another partner stated that it was unaware of any approval process for planning-related activities, and a third stated that it had not reviewed any of the program planning documentation. Moreover, one agency partner stated that a more formal program governance structure is needed, especially for reviewing and approving such documents as the program\u2019s concept of operations and the system\u2019s functional requirements. A similar statement was made in a meeting of the State-led Foreign Affairs Systems Integration Architectural Working Group. Specifically, it was stated that protocols needed to be established, such as officially listing the documents that would be shared so that all participants would be aware of these documents and have the opportunity to review them before making any decisions about how to proceed. While these issues are less significant for program near-term activities, they should be resolved before moving beyond system prototyping and piloting activities. Accordingly, our report contains proactive recommendations for doing so. 10. We agree with State\u2019s comment that the need to formally define agency roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities should be focused on the next phase of the program. We disagree that there is a need to eliminate a reference to insufficiency in defining existing roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities regarding near-term program prototype and pilot-testing activities because no such reference exists. In fact, our report concludes, and State acknowledges in its comments, that management controls over near-term activities are adequate. 11. See comments 3 and 4. 12.
