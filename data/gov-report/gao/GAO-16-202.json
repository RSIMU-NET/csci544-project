However,", "GAO identified 55 SRC I ammunition items that were in the physical custody of the Air Force\u2014though owned by the Army or Marine Corps\u2014but accountability was not maintained in any service's system of record while at the Air Force location. Department of Defense (DOD) policy requires that the DOD component having physical custody of materiel maintain accountability in its records regardless of the owner, but the Air Force's guidance requires that ammunition owned by other services be tracked only in a \u201cnon-accountable\u201d program. If the Air Force does not revise its guidance to require that accountability be maintained regardless of ownership, the Air Force and the owning service will not have complete records of management of the ammunition and the owning service will not have full assurance that accountability was maintained.", "GAO found that Army and Marine Corps guidance does not specify a time frame for receipting shipments of SRC I ammunition. Records showed that 12 of 21 shipments to Army depots and 5 of 30 shipments to Marine Corps locations were receipted more than 2 business days after truck arrival. Until Army and Marine Corps officials finalize and implement guidance on required time frames for receipting SRC I ammunition, officials cannot reasonably assure accountability for all shipped SRC I ammunition.", "The military services have not consistently ensured timely, complete, and accurate information to maintain full visibility of SRC I ammunition in the continental United States. For example, 93 of 1,008 shipments GAO examined were not entered in DOD's Defense Transportation Tracking System (DTTS) at the time of departure. Also, 9 of 104 shipments GAO examined in more detail had inaccurate controlled inventory item codes and were not identified in DTTS as SRC I shipments. The Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command and the military services have not collaboratively determined the specific information required for the military services to ensure timely data entry into DTTS. Further, the military services, with the aid of the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, have not conducted analysis of the completeness and accuracy of data entered into DTTS by shippers on SRC I ammunition shipments.

One category of this sensitive conventional ammunition is  identified as Security Risk Category (SRC) I ammunition, which is  nonnuclear, portable missiles and rockets in a ready-to-fire configuration.  SRC I ammunition is treated as a higher risk than other conventional  ammunition and serves as a potential threat if it were obtained and used  by unauthorized individuals or groups. SRC I ammunition requires a  higher level of protection and security than that provided for SRC II  through SRC IV conventional ammunition. Examples of SRC I  ammunition include: Stinger and Javelin missiles, the 66-mm Light Anti- Tank Weapon, and the M136 Anti-Armor Weapon. As of April 30, 2015,  there were at least 226,000 SRC I ammunition items located in the  continental United States. To help to adequately protect these items and  minimize the risk of loss or theft, the military services have a critical role  to maintain accountability and visibility of SRC I ammunition upon  acquisition until use or demilitarization. DOD has issued guidance on how  the military services should physically safeguard, track, inventory, and  ship SRC I ammunition within and between services and to contractors  for repair.", "Senate Report 113-176 (2014), accompanying S. 2410, the Carl Levin  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, included a  provision for us to review aspects of DOD\u2019s management of SRC I  ammunition. This report addresses the extent to which the military  services have maintained (1) accountability and (2) visibility of SRC I  ammunition in the continental United States.", "To determine the extent to which the military services have maintained  accountability of SRC I ammunition in the continental United States, we  reviewed DOD policy and military service guidance, including DODM  5100.76, among others, that outline accountability, physical inventories,  and shipping of SRC I ammunition in the continental United States. We  visited three Army depots, eight military service locations\u2014such as  military service installations, bases, and ammunition supply points\u2014and a  contractor with a current production contract for SRC I missiles. We  selected these locations based on a number of factors including the size  of SRC I inventory, the number of shipments to and from the location, and  the variety of SRC I ammunition being stored. We collected identifying  information on a non-generalizable random sample of over 600 SRC I  ammunition items and conducted a comparative analysis of this sample  against information in the military services\u2019 SRC I accountability systems.", "While the results cannot be generalized, they provided insights on how  accountability is maintained at military service and contractor locations.  For all Army depots, we reviewed documentation of physical inventories  completed in fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014. In addition to our site  visits, we randomly selected additional Air Force locations and obtained  documentation for their last three completed physical inventories to verify  completion, as discussed later in this report. Further, we selected a non- generalizable sample of 104 SRC I ammunition shipments sent from or to  our site visit locations. For these shipments, we obtained and reviewed  shipping documents and analyzed how the shipments were tracked to  assess whether the military services complied with DOD policy and  service-level guidance on shipping and receipting SRC I ammunition. We  also interviewed relevant officials at the Office of the Secretary of  Defense and each of the military services, which have responsibilities for  SRC I ammunition to gain an understanding of how officials maintain  accountability, complete physical inventories, and process in-bound and  out-bound shipments of SRC I ammunition. While we identified some  limitations with the overall data on SRC I ammunition by military service,  we determined it is sufficiently reliable to indicate the broad order of  magnitude of the items held by the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air  Force as of April 30, 2015.The data on the number of locations in the  continental United States that hold SRC I ammunition represents a  snapshot in time, as ammunition can be shipped to different locations,  and are subject to the same limitations we have noted. This data provides  a broad indication of the relative number of locations in the continental  United States by military service.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has maintained visibility of SRC I  ammunition in the continental United States, we obtained and analyzed  SRC I ammunition data from each of the military services\u2019 automated  information systems as of April 30, 2015.

We also analyzed data from  the Defense Transportation Tracking System (DTTS) about 1,008 SRC I  shipments reported to us by the Military Surface Deployment and  Distribution Command between November 1, 2013, and April 30, 2015 to  understand how the system provides visibility of SRC I ammunition  shipments. Using this data and additional data we obtained for our non- generalizable sample of 104 shipments described above, we assessed  whether the military services complied with requirements in the Defense  Transportation Regulation regarding the use of DTTS to track shipments  of SRC I ammunition. We interviewed relevant officials at the Office of the  Secretary of Defense, the U.S. Transportation Command  (USTRANSCOM), the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution  Command, and the military service officials to gain an understanding of  visibility of SRC I ammunition in their automated information systems,  how SRC I ammunition is defined and the elements used to extract data  from the automated information systems, and how SRC I ammunition  data is entered into their automated information systems. While we  identified some issues related to the accuracy and completeness of DTTS  data that are described in this report and may affect the reliability of the  overall number of SRC I shipments during this time frame, we determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes of analyzing  information about individual shipments in our sample and general trends  in the timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of data entry in DTTS.

Further, we found that the military  services were not regularly conducting physical inventories of SRC I  missiles and we made recommendations to strengthen inventory  accountability, which the department concurred with and implemented. In  our September 1997 report, we found the military services had different  procedures and requirements for maintaining oversight of SRC I rockets.  Specifically, we found that the Marine Corps maintained oversight and  visibility of its weapons by serial number, whereas the Army and the Navy  managed their SRC I rockets by production lot and quantity. DOD  concurred with our recommendation to manage SRC I rockets by serial  number and reissued DOD policy in 2000. In our 2000 report, we found  internal controls weaknesses at an Army ammunition depot that resulted  in a loss of accountability and control over SRC I rockets. For example,  serial number control of SRC I rockets was lost at the time of shipment  from the contractor because serial numbers listed on receiving reports  that accompanied shipments did not correspond to the actual items and  quantities of the respective shipments.", "In March 2014, we reported on DOD\u2019s management of conventional  ammunition, and found, among other things, some limitations of the  military services\u2019 use of automated information systems that affected their  ability to facilitate efficient management of conventional ammunition.

While the  Army\u2019s WARS-NT system, which is the Army\u2019s official system for tracking  SRC I ammunition, provided visibility of SRC I missiles located at the  contractor facility, WARS-NT did not have timely or complete records to  show visibility of all SRC I missiles at the contractor\u2019s site.

To determine the extent to which the military  services have maintained accountability of SRC I ammunition in the  continental United States, we reviewed DOD policy and military service  guidance, including Department of Defense Manual (DODM) 5100.76,  Physical Security of Sensitive Conventional Arms, Ammunition, and  Explosives (AA&E), (Apr. 17, 2012), among others, detailing: continuous  accountability, frequency and process for conducting physical inventories,  process for making adjustments to the electronic record if necessary,  tracking of SRC I ammunition by serial number, and the shipment of SRC  I ammunition in the continental United States. During our review, we  visited 11 military locations\u2014including 3 Army depots and 8 military  service locations, such as military service installations, bases, and  ammunition supply points, with SRC I ammunition\u2014selected based on a  number of factors including the size of SRC I inventory, the number of  shipments to and from the location, and the variety of SRC I ammunition  being stored. We also visited a contractor with a current production  contract for SRC I missiles as SRC I ammunition items are in the  contractor\u2019s custody while at the contractor\u2019s facility for repair,  maintenance, or upgrade. Additionally, we interviewed OSD and military  services officials responsible for the management of SRC I ammunition,  including inventory personnel and transportation officials, to gain an  understanding of the frequency and process for conducting physical  inventories and how shipments of SRC I ammunition are coordinated.", "We compared a non-generalizable sample of over 600 SRC I ammunition  items against the records in the military services\u2019 automated information  systems to verify accountability. For the Army we used the Logistics  Modernization Program (LMP), Standard Army Ammunition System- Modernization (SAAS-MOD), and Worldwide Ammunition Reporting  System-New Technology (WARS-NT). For the Navy and Marine Corps  we used Ordnance Information System- Wholesale (OIS-W), Ordnance  Information System-Retail (OIS-R), and Ordnance Information System- Marine Corps (OIS-MC). For the Air Force we used Combat Ammunition  System (CAS). Specifically, during our site visits to 11 military locations  and 1 contractor location, we went through storage buildings with SRC I  ammunition and selected SRC I ammunition from different pallets to  include a range of SRC I items as well as items from recent shipments,  and documented identifying information including serial and production lot  number. We verified the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps SRC I  ammunition items by serial and lot number. Due to the way the Air Force  maintains its records, we verified their SRC I ammunition to records  based on lot number and quantity.", "We analyzed DOD policy and military service guidance on frequency and  process for conducting physical inventories and reviewed supporting  documentation to determine whether the services were maintaining  accountability by conducting physical inventories according to  requirements. For Army depots, we collected documentation of completed  physical inventories for three fiscal years prior to our audit work\u2014 2012,  2013, and 2014 and conducted site visits to three Army depots to observe  a walk-through of their physical inventory process. We selected the three  Army depots to visit based on a number of factors, including range in  quantity and type of SRC I in storage and recent shipments. To  supplement our site visits, we also interviewed inventory personnel at the  remaining depots regarding the physical inventory process and process  for adjusting the electronic record, if necessary. For five military service  locations we visited, we requested documentation of the last three  completed physical inventories to obtain a variety of physical inventories  (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annually, or change in command) and we also  observed a walk-through of their physical inventory process. Further, to  supplement our site visits, we randomly selected 10 additional Air Force  locations and obtained documentation for their last three completed  physical inventories. We reviewed the inventories for our non- generalizable sample of 22 selected locations to determine whether  physical inventories were being conducted in accordance with DOD policy  and military service guidance and at required frequencies. Finally, during  our site visit with the contractor, we confirmed the contractor had  completed physical inventories of SRC I missiles in its custody as well as  discussed with officials how they conduct physical inventories of SRC I  ammunition at their location.", "We also examined the military services\u2019 guidance and procedures for  maintaining accountability for items owned by one service but in the  physical custody of another service. We analyzed DOD policy and military  service guidance on maintaining accountability for ammunition to  determine the extent to which military services\u2019 guidance aligned with  DOD policy. We also analyzed data and documents obtained from the Air  Force, Army, and Marine Corps on 55 SRC I items from 4 shipments of  SRC I ammunition in the continental United States that contained  ammunition owned by the Army or Marine Corps that was shipped to and  held in the physical custody of the Air Force but for which we had found  that accountability was not maintained on the Air Force\u2019s system of  record. We identified these items because we were unable to locate  receipts for certain shipments in the Air Force\u2019s system of record when  we reviewed it for our analysis of the timeliness of receipt of shipments of  SRC I ammunition described below. Information we report about the  number of SRC I items or shipments we identified as being owned by  another service but in the physical custody of the Air Force and not  maintained on the Air Force\u2019s accountable record is non-generalizable to  the overall universe of SRC I items but provides insights on how the Air  Force manages items in its physical custody that are owned by another  service.", "Further, we analyzed shipping documents and military service data for a  non-generalizable sample of 104 SRC I shipments, and compared  receipting time frames for these shipments to military service guidance to  analyze how accountability was maintained. When the military services  did not have documented guidance on receipting time frames, we  obtained information from military service officials about standard  procedures followed by the military service. Our sample was comprised of  shipments that occurred between November 1, 2013, and April 30, 2015,  and that were shipped to or from locations we visited or interviewed. We  selected these time frames to provide an 18-month window that provided  one prior year\u2019s data and six months that coincided with the period when  we were conducting field work. Further, we selected our sample to reflect  shipments to or from a variety of military services, locations, and location  types. Because our sample of shipments is non-generalizable, results of  our analysis cannot be used to make inferences about all SRC I  shipments within the continental United States but they provide insights  on the military services\u2019 adherence to DOD policy and service-level  guidance or standard practice regarding the shipment of SRC I  ammunition. For the 104 shipments in our sample, we obtained and  reviewed shipping documents and receipt data from the receiving military  services\u2019 accountability systems. We compared the receipt data from the  receiving military service\u2019s accountability systems to data on shipment  arrival time at the receiving location that we obtained from the Defense  Transportation Tracking System (DTTS), maintained by the Military  Surface Deployment and Distribution Command. For our analysis, we  analyzed whether shipments were receipted within 2 business days of the  day of arrival of the shipment even though either service guidance or  standard practice generally required receipting within 1 business day or  less. We allowed for 2 business days because military services\u2019  information systems may take an additional business day to record  transactions.", "Also, we analyzed military service guidance related to providing  accountability for in-transit items and compared that guidance to DOD  policy to assess whether the military services\u2019 policies and processes for  maintaining accountability for in-transit SRC I ammunition items enabled  the military services to maintain accountability of SRC I ammunition in the  continental United States. When we determined that a military service\u2019s  guidance and processes did not align with DOD policy, we requested and  reviewed additional documentation, such as analyses of gaps in  information system capabilities and documentation of planning of system  upgrades, and conducted interviews with military service officials to  determine the reasons for the differences.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has maintained visibility of SRC I  ammunition in the continental United States, we reviewed DOD policy and  military service guidance, including DODM 5100.76 and the Defense  Transportation Regulation, among others, detailing procedures to  maintain visibility of SRC I ammunition, including in-transit visibility during  shipment, satellite tracking of shipments, and timeframes for entering  shipment information into DTTS. In addition, we interviewed relevant  officials at the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the military services,  U.S. Transportation Command, and the Military Surface Deployment and  Distribution Command to gain an understanding of how visibility is  maintained in their automated information systems, how shipments of  SRC I ammunition are processed for shipping and entered into DTTS,  and how visibility is maintained while the shipment is in transit.", "We obtained SRC I ammunition data from each of the military services\u2019  automated information systems as of April 30, 2015, and analyzed this  data for timely, complete and accurate information to maintain full visibility  of SRC I ammunition in the continental United States. Specifically, we  compared this data, based on a number of elements including type of  SRC I ammunition, location in the continental United States, condition of  the SRC I ammunition, and military service ownership codes, against  information in the department\u2019s National Level Ammunition Capability  (NLAC) system, a DOD-wide repository that provides visibility of SRC I  ammunition data, to identify inconsistencies across DOD and the military  services.", "We also analyzed DOD requirements for satellite tracking from the  Defense Transportation Regulation and obtained and analyzed  information from DTTS provided by the Military Surface Deployment and  Distribution Command about satellite tracking of shipments of SRC I  ammunition in the continental United States from November 1, 2013,  through April 30, 2015, to gain an understanding of how visibility is  maintained. We analyzed data from November 1, 2013, to April 30, 2015,  to correspond to the time frame we used to select our non-generalizable  sample of shipments for review. To examine whether the military services  used satellite tracking for shipments included in our non-generalizable  sample of 104 shipments described above, we compared the  transportation control number for each shipment in our sample to  transportation control numbers associated with SRC I shipments in DTTS.  When we could not locate a shipment in DTTS by transportation control  number, we followed up with the Military Surface Deployment and  Distribution Command to obtain additional information about the  shipment, since in some cases the transportation control number was in  DTTS but not in the data provided to us since the data was provided  based on a bill-of-lading number. For the shipments that neither we nor  the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command could locate  in DTTS, we requested additional information about the shipment from  military service officials to attempt to locate the shipment in DTTS through  a means besides the transportation control number. For example, in  some cases, the shipper had not identified the shipment in DTTS by  transportation control number, and we were able to obtain and search on  the bill-of-lading number to confirm that the shipment had been tracked in  DTTS.", "We also examined the extent to which the military services provided  timely data in DTTS, in accordance with the Defense Transportation  Regulation, to ensure visibility. We analyzed data and reports provided by  the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command from DTTS to  identify the number of SRC I shipments between November 1, 2013, and  April 30, 2015, for which information had not been entered into the  system at the time of shipment departure and the number of shipments  that were not confirmed within the calendar month of arrival. Further, we  examined the extent to which the military services provided accurate and  complete data in DTTS. We compared values for key data fields in DTTS,  such as the DOD Identification Code and transportation control number,  to shipping documents for selected shipments from our sample of 104  shipments. We also analyzed the number of missing values for selected  data fields in DTTS for the 1,008 SRC I shipments in the continental  United States between November 1, 2013, and April 30, 2015, reported to  us by the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command. While  we identified some issues related to the accuracy and completeness of  DTTS data that are described in this report and may affect the reliability of  the overall number of SRC I shipments during this time frame, we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes of  analyzing information about individual shipments in our sample and  general trends in the timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of data  entry in DTTS. To obtain additional information about the timeliness,  accuracy, and completeness issues we identified and steps that were  being taken to address these issues, we conducted interviews with U.S  Transportation Command and Military Surface Deployment and  Distribution Command officials, as well as representatives from each of  the military services who are assigned to coordinate with the Military  Surface Deployment and Distribution Command on transportation issues  and reviewed additional documentation provided by the Military Surface  Deployment and Distribution Command and the military services, such as  reporting provided by the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution  Command to the military services.", "Table 4 lists the offices that we visited or contacted during our review.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2014 to February  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
