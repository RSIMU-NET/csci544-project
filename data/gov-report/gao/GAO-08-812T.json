A key element of the prescription drug benefit is the low-income subsidy, or \"extra help,\" available to Medicare beneficiaries with limited income and resources to assist them in paying their premiums and other out-of-pocket costs. To assess the Social Security Administration's (SSA) implementation of the subsidy, GAO is providing information on (1) the number of applicants approved for or denied the low-income subsidy and (2) challenges of identifying individuals eligible for the subsidy and targeting outreach efforts.

SSA approved about 570,000 applicants, denied about 403,000 applicants, and determined that no decision was required for about 281,000 applicants in fiscal year 2007. Excess income was the primary reason applicants were denied benefits, while many other applicants were denied benefits because their resources exceeded program limits. Further, SSA has collected data and established some goals to monitor its progress in implementing and administering the subsidy benefit. No reliable data are available to help SSA identify the eligible population for its outreach efforts, and millions who may be eligible have not yet applied. SSA maintains that it would not be able to establish specific goals and measures for its outreach activities, as we recommended in our May 2007 report because, of the lack of reliable data on the total eligible population. Responding to another of our recommendations, SSA is working with the Internal Revenue Service to determine if tax data can help target individuals eligible for the subsidy. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Congressional Budget Office have estimated, respectively, that about 2.6 million to over 4 million individuals who may qualify for the subsidy are not receiving it. Various barriers, such as reluctance to disclose personal financial information or lack of knowledge of the subsidy, may prevent potentially eligible Medicare beneficiaries from applying for the subsidy. To solicit applications from individuals potentially eligible for the subsidy, SSA conducted an extensive outreach campaign from May 2005 to August 2006, but has decreased its outreach activities since then. Staffing constraints in SSA field offices may also limit SSA's ability to assist individuals with the subsidy and conduct local outreach to inform the public about the subsidy."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing to discuss the  Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) progress in enrolling individuals in  the Medicare Part D Low-Income Subsidy. High prescription drug costs  can have a detrimental effect on low-income seniors and the disabled, who  are more likely than others to suffer from chronic medical problems  requiring prescription drugs. Such high costs may cause some elderly  patients to forgo or restrict their use of prescription drugs. To help the  elderly and disabled with these costs, the Congress passed the Medicare  Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA).  MMA enabled Medicare beneficiaries to enroll voluntarily in drug plans  sponsored by private health insurance companies.

As of March 2007, only the Colorado and Kansas state Medicaid  agencies had made Part D subsidy determinations.", "Under the MMA, the Congress provided SSA with a special $500 million  appropriation from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the  Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund to assist SSA in  implementing its Part D responsibilities for fiscal years 2004 and 2005, but  later extended the appropriation to fiscal year 2006. Since January 2006,  SSA officials told us that the agency has had to draw on its overall  administrative appropriation to support its Part D activities.

Accordingly, agencies should  compare actual performance data against expected goals and analyze the  differences.", "While SSA had tracked the progress of subsidy determinations since it  began processing applications in July 2005, it did not have goals for  measuring the processing time for these applications until March 2007.  SSA\u2019s goal is to process 75 percent of the subsidy applications in 60 days  and reported that it processed 93 percent of determinations within 60 days  during the first 6 months of fiscal year 2008. SSA had also been tracking  the amount of time for resolving appeals of subsidy denials, but also did  not have a performance goal to assess the timeliness of appeals decisions.  In response to our recommendation, SSA established a goal of processing  75 percent of appeals within 60 days\u2014similar to its goal for processing  subsidy applications.

According to the MMA and SSA regulations, all recipients of the  subsidy are required to have their eligibility redetermined within one year  after SSA first determines their eligibility. Future redeterminations are  required to be conducted at intervals determined by the Commissioner.  SSA\u2019s regulations provide that these periodic redeterminations be based  on the likelihood that an individual\u2019s situation may change in a way that  affects subsidy eligibility. Additionally, SSA\u2019s regulations provide that  unscheduled redeterminations may take place at any time for individuals  who report a change in their circumstances, such as marriage or divorce.  In May 2007, we recommended that SSA collect data on the processing  time for individual redetermination decisions, and establish performance  standards for such processing time. SSA disagreed with our  recommendation, stating that the agency monitors the time for completing  the overall redetermination cycle, providing adequate management  controls. While SSA still does not collect processing time data for  individual redetermination decisions, an SSA official recently told us that  it is now the agency\u2019s goal to complete redetermination decisions before  the end of each year, except for people who do not respond to SSA\u2019s  inquiries."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "No Reliable Data Are Available to Identify Eligible Population for Outreach Efforts, and Millions May Have Not Yet Applied", "paragraphs": ["No reliable data are available to help SSA identify the eligible population  for its outreach efforts, and millions who may be eligible have not yet  applied, in part due to privacy concerns and application complexity.

In the absence of reliable data for identifying the  eligible population, in 2006 SSA broadly targeted 18.6 million individuals  who might be eligible for the subsidy, which was an overestimate. SSA  identified the target population by using income data from various  government sources to screen out Medicare beneficiaries whose income  made them ineligible for the Part D subsidy. SSA realized that using these  data sources would result in an overestimate of the number of individuals  who might qualify for the subsidy, because the data provided limited  information on individuals\u2019 resources or nonwage income. SSA officials  said they took this approach to ensure that all Medicare beneficiaries who  were potentially eligible for the subsidy were made aware of the benefit  and had an opportunity to apply for it.", "SSA officials said that they would have preferred to specifically target  Medicare beneficiaries who were more likely to be eligible for the subsidy  by using tax data from IRS on individuals\u2019 wage, interest, and pension  income. Current law permits SSA to obtain income and asset data from  IRS to assist in verifying information provided on subsidy applications.  The law, however, prohibits IRS from sharing such data with SSA in the  absence of a submitted application. According to SSA officials, such data  would allow SSA to identify individuals to target outreach more directly  and to estimate how many individuals may qualify for the subsidy.  However, IRS officials told us that its data have many limitations that  could affect their usefulness. For example, IRS officials said that they have  limited data on assets for individuals whose income is less than $20,000  because these individuals do not typically have interest income, private  pensions, or dividend income from stocks that could help SSA in  estimating an individual\u2019s potential asset level. Given these limitation, IRS  officials stated that their tax data was more likely to identify individuals  who would not quality for the subsidy, rather than those who would. In  November 2006, the HHS Office of Inspector General reported that  legislation is needed to provide SSA and CMS access to income tax data to  help the agencies more effectively identify beneficiaries potentially eligible  for the subsidy.", "In our May 2007 report, we recommended that SSA develop a  comprehensive plan, with specific performance goals and measures, to  detail the agency\u2019s outreach strategy for enrolling additional individuals  who qualify for the subsidy. While SSA agreed with the recommendation in  theory, it maintains that it would be unable to implement specific goals  and measures due to the lack of reliable data on the eligible population.  SSA recently informed us that is still the agency\u2019s position. We also  recommended that SSA and IRS work together to assess the extent to  which IRS tax data would help SSA to identify individuals who might  qualify for the subsidy, possibly aiding SSA in better targeting outreach  efforts. In implementing our recommendation, SSA provided IRS with a  random sample of 200,000 individuals (of approximately 19 million  potentially eligible) who might qualify for the subsidy. IRS then provided  SSA Form 1098 and 1099 data for these individuals, with identifying  information removed. SSA could then use its methodology for IRS to  estimate potential subsidy eligibility. The Form 1098 and 1099 information  will help SSA determine if individuals have pensions and resources that  exceed the subsidy threshold.

Between 2005 and 2007,  field office staffing declined by 7.1 percent. We recently testified that this  staffing reduction may have increased customer waiting time in field  offices. Further, during the course of our recent study, several staff  reported that they often did not have adequate time to spend with  customers to explain information.

However, many of the study respondents reported  long lines at crowded SSA field offices or difficulty getting through on  local field office telephone lines. Mathematica reported that several  respondents reported that SSA field offices were overwhelmed by people  seeking services other than the low-income subsidy. In our May 2008  testimony on SSA field offices, we also reported that staffing reductions  have adversely affected field offices\u2019 ability to serve customers. In  particular, we reported that between 2002 and 2006, the average waiting  time for field office service increased by 40 percent from 15 minutes to 21  minutes, and in fiscal year 2007, more than 3 million customers waited for  over an hour to be served, according to SSA data.
