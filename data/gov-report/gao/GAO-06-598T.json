Among the programs that we  have reviewed are the following:   \u25cf  US-VISIT (the United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator  Technology) has several major goals: to enhance the security of our  citizens and visitors and ensure the integrity of the U.S. immigration  system, and at the same time to facilitate legitimate trade and travel  and protect privacy. To achieve these goals, US-VISIT is to record  the entry into and exit from the United States of selected travelers,  verify their identity, and determine their compliance with the terms  of their admission and stay. As of October 2005, US-VISIT officials  reported that about $1.4 billion had been appropriated for the  program.  \u25cf  The Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) is a Customs and  Border Protection (CBP) program to modernize trade processing  systems and support border security. Its goals include enhancing  analysis and information sharing with other government agencies;  providing an integrated, fully automated information system for  commercial import and export data; and reducing costs for the  government and the trade community though streamlining. To date,  CBP reports that the program has received almost $1.7 billion in  funding.   \u25cf  The America\u2019s Shield Initiative (ASI) program (now cancelled) was  to enhance DHS\u2019s ability to provide surveillance and protection of  the U.S. northern and southern borders through a system of sensors,  databases, and cameras. The program was also to address known  limitations of the current Integrated Surveillance Intelligence  System (ISIS) and to support DHS\u2019s antiterrorism mission, including  its need to exchange information with state, local, and federal law  enforcement organizations. As of September 2005, ASI officials  reported that about $340.3 million had been spent on the program.  As of December 2005, the program was subsumed within the Secure  Border Initiative, the department\u2019s broader border and interior  enforcement strategy.  \u25cf  The Secure Flight program is developing a system to perform  passenger prescreening for domestic flights: that is, the matching of  passenger information against terrorist watch lists to identify  persons who should undergo additional security scrutiny. The goal  is to prevent people suspected of posing a threat to aviation from  boarding commercial aircraft in the United States, while protecting  passengers\u2019 privacy and civil liberties. The program also aims to  reduce the number of people unnecessarily selected for secondary  screening. To date, TSA officials report that about $144 million has  been spent on the program.   \u25cf  The Atlas program is intended to modernize the IT infrastructure of  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The goals of the  program are to, among other things, improve information sharing,  strengthen information security, and improve workforce  productivity. ICE estimates the life cycle cost of Atlas to be roughly  $1 billion.   \u25cf  The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) is an  Internet-based system that is to collect and record information on  foreign students, exchange visitors, and their dependents\u2014before  they enter the United States, when they enter, and during their stay Through fiscal year 2006, the department expects to have spent, in  total, about $133.5 million on this program. .", "The Rescue 21 program is to replace and mo Guard\u2019s 30-year-old search and rescue communication system,  National Distress and Response System.

In brief, an enterprise architecture  provides systematic structural descriptions\u2014in useful models,  diagrams, tables, and narrative\u2014of how a given entity operates  today and how it plans to operate in the future, and it includes a  road map for transitioning from today to tomorrow. Our experience  with federal agencies has shown that attempting to modernize  systems without having an enterprise architecture often results in  systems that are duplicative, not well integrated, unnecessarily  costly to maintain, and limited in terms of optimizing mission  performance.", "To assist agencies in effectively developing, maintaining, and  implementing an enterprise architecture, we published a framework  for architecture management, grounded in federal guidance and  recognized best practices. The underpinning of this framework is a  five-stage maturity framework outlining steps toward achieving a  stable and mature enterprise architecture program. The framework  describes 31 practices or conditions, referred to as core elements,  that are needed for effective architecture management.", "We have previously reported on DHS\u2019s effort to develop its  enterprise architecture from two perspectives. First, in November  2003, we reported on DHS\u2019s architecture management program  relative to the framework described above. At that time, we found  that the department had implemented many of the practices  described in our framework. For example, the department had,  among other things, assigned architecture development,  maintenance, program management, and approval responsibilities;  created policies governing architecture development and  maintenance; and formulated plans to develop architecture products  and begun developing them. Second, in August 2004, we reported on  DHS\u2019s effort to develop enterprise architecture products, relative to  well-established, publicly available criteria on the content of  enterprise architectures. At that time, we concluded that the  department\u2019s initial enterprise architecture provided a foundation  upon which to build, but that it was nevertheless missing important  content that limited its utility. Thus, it could not be considered a  well-defined architecture. In particular, the content of this initial  version was not systematically derived from a DHS or national  corporate business strategy; rather, it was more the result of an  amalgamation of the existing architectures that several of DHS\u2019s  predecessor agencies already had, along with their respective  portfolios of system investment projects. To its credit, the  department recognized the limitations of the initial architecture and  has developed a new version. To assist DHS in evolving its  architecture, we recommended 41 actions aimed at having DHS add  needed architecture content and ensure that architecture  development best practices are employed.", "Since then, DHS reported that it had taken steps in response to our  recommendations. For example, the department issued version 2 of  its enterprise architecture in October 2004. According to DHS, this  version contained additional business/mission, service, and  technical descriptions. Also, this version was submitted to a group  of CIOs of major corporations and an enterprise architecture  consulting firm, both of which found the architecture meritorious.  Earlier this month (March 2006), the department issued another new  version of its enterprise architecture, which it calls HLS EA 2006.", "Our analysis of version 2 of the department\u2019s architecture indicates  that DHS has made progress toward development of its architecture  products, particularly descriptions of both the \u201cas-is\u201d and \u201cto-be\u201d  environments. Specifically, the scope of the \u201cas-is\u201d and \u201cto-be\u201d  environments extends to descriptions of business operations,  information and data needs and definitions, application and service  delivery vehicles, and technology profiles and standards. With  respect to the depth and detail of these descriptions (which are the  focus of most of our 41 prior recommendations), the department has  reported progress, such as (1) completing its first inventory of  information technology systems, a key input to its description of the  \u201cas-is\u201d environment; (2) establishing departmentwide technology  standards; (3) developing and beginning to implement a plan for  introducing a shared services orientation to the architecture,  particularly with regard to information services (e.g., network, data  center, e-mail, help desk, and video operations); and (4) finalizing  content for the portion of its architecture that relates to certain  border security functions (e.g., the alien detention and removal  process that is a major facet of the department\u2019s new Strategic  Border Initiative)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IT Investment Management", "paragraphs": ["Through IT investment management, organizations define and  follow a corporate process to help senior leadership make informed  decisions on competing options for investing in IT.

Our  framework identifies, among other things, effective policies and  procedures for developing and using an enterprisewide collection\u2014 or portfolio\u2014of investments; using such portfolios enables an  organization to determine priorities and make decisions among  competing options across investment categories based on analyses  of the relative organizational value and risks of all investments.", "A central tenet of the federal approach to IT investment  management is the select/control/evaluate model. During the select  phase, the organization (1) identifies and analyzes each project\u2019s  risks and returns before committing significant funds and (2) selects  those projects that will best support its mission needs. In the control  phase, the organization ensures that the project continues to meet  mission needs at the expected levels of cost and risks. If the project  is not meeting expectations or if problems have arisen, steps are  quickly taken to address the deficiencies. During the evaluate phase,  actual versus expected results are compared after a project has  been fully implemented.", "In August 2004, we reported that DHS had established an  investment management process that included departmental  oversight of major IT programs. However, this process was not yet  institutionalized: for example, most programs (about 75 percent)  had not undergone the departmental oversight process, and  resources were limited for completing control reviews in a timely  manner. At that time, the CIO and other DHS officials attributed  these shortfalls, in part, to the fact that the department\u2019s process  was maturing and needed to improve. Based on our findings, we  made recommendations aimed at strengthening the process.", "In March 2005, we again reported on this investment review  process, noting that it incorporated many best practices and  provided its senior leaders with the information required to make  well-informed investment decisions at key points in the investment  life cycle. However, we also concluded that at some key investment  decision points, DHS\u2019s process did not require senior management  attention and oversight. For example, management reviews are not  required at key system and subsystem decision points, although  such reviews (especially with complex systems that incorporate  new technology like US-VISIT) are critical to ensuring that risk is  reduced before the organization commits to the next phase of  investment. Accordingly, we made further recommendations to  improve the process.", "Further, the CIO recently reported additional steps being taken to  strengthen IT investment management. According to the CIO, DHS  has   \u25cf  established an acquisition project performance reporting system,  which requires periodic reporting of cost, schedule, and  performance measures as well as earned value metrics, as means to  monitor and control major acquisitions;  \u25cf  aligned the investment management cycle and associated milestones  with the department\u2019s annual budget preparation process to allow  business cases for major investments to be submitted to department  headquarters at the same time as the budget, rather than as a follow- on;  linked investment management systems to standardize and make  consistent the financial data used to make investment decisions;   \u25cf  verified alignment of approximately $2 billion worth of investments  via the department\u2019s portfolio management framework; and   \u25cf  completed investment oversight reviews (by total dollar value) of  over 75 percent of the department\u2019s major investments.", "The department has also developed a standard template for  capturing information about a given IT program to be used in  determining the investment\u2019s alignment with the enterprise  architecture. Such alignment is important because it ensures that  programs will be defined, designed, and developed in a way that  avoids duplication and promotes interoperability and integration.

Such a life cycle proces begins with initial concept definition and continues through  requirements determination to design, development, various  phases  of testing, implementation, and maintenance. For example, expected system capabilities should be defined in terms of requirements for  functionality (what the system is to do), performance (how well thesystem is to execute functions), data (what data are needed by what  functions, when, and in what form), interface (what interactions  with related and dependent systems are needed), and security.  Further, system requirements should be unambiguous, consiste with one another, linked (that is, traceable from one source level to another), verifiable, understood by stakeholders, and fully  documented.", "The steps in the life cycle process each have important purposes,  and they have inherent dependencies among themselves. Thus, if  earlier steps are omitted or deficient, later steps will be affected,  resulting in costly and time-consuming rework. For example, a  system can be effectively tested to determine whether it meets  requirements only if these requirements have already been  completely and correctly defined. Concurrent, incomplete, and  omitted activities in life cycle management exacerbate the program  risks.

For example, the department has successfully  delivered visitor entry identification and screening capabilities with  the first three increments of its US-VISIT program, and it is currently  implementing release four of its ACE program. At the same time,  however, US-VISIT exit capabilities are not in place, and release  four of ACE does not include needed functionality.

For example, the department reports that it  has begun its Infrastructure Transformation Program (ITP), which is  its approach to moving to a consolidated, integrated, and services- oriented IT infrastructure. According to the department, the CIO  developed and has begun implementing the ITP plan, which is to be  centrally managed but executed in a distributed manner, with  various DHS components taking the lead for different areas of  infrastructure transformation. The ITP is to create a highly secure  and survivable communications network (OneNet) for Sensitive but  Unclassified data across the department, and it is also to establish a  common and reliable e-mail system across the department. The  department reported that it had deployed the initial core of the DHS  OneNet and built the primary Network Operation Center to monitor  OneNet performance. Among the other goals of the program are  consolidated data centers to reduce costs and provide a highly  survivable and reliable computing environment. In this regard, the  department reported that it has now established an interim data  center.", "In addition, the department stated that it has extended its classified  networking capabilities by fielding 56 Secret sites on the  department\u2019s Homeland Secure Data Network and by completing  the connection of this network to SIPRNet (the Defense  Department\u2019s Secret Internet Protocol Routed Network).

In this regard, our reviews of several nonfinancial DHS IT  programs provide examples of both strengths and weaknesses in  program management. In summary, they show that DHS IT  programs are not being managed consistently: some programs are at  least partially implementing certain program management best  practices, but others are largely disregarding most of the practices.  Further, they show that most of the programs are considerably  challenged in certain key areas, such as measuring progress and  performance against program commitments and establishing human  capital capabilities.", "IT investment alignment with the enterprise architecture. An  important element of enterprise architecture management is  ensuring that IT investments comply with the architecture.  However, in several of the programs that we have reviewed,  investments have been approved without documented analysis to  support these judgments and to permit the judgments to be  independently verified. For example, DHS approved the ACE  program\u2019s alignment with the department\u2019s architecture on the  recommendation of its Enterprise Architecture Center of Excellence  and Enterprise Architecture Board. However, the Center\u2019s  evaluators did not provide a documented analysis that would allow  independent verification. According to DHS officials, they do not  have a documented methodology for evaluating programs\u2019  architecture compliance, and instead rely on the professional  expertise of Center staff. In contrast, the ASI program provides an  example of an instance in which the reviews required to ensure  architecture alignment resulted in the discovery of a significant  problem: the program had not adequately defined its relationships  and dependencies with other department programs. As a result, the  program was reconsidered and later subsumed within the new  Secure Border Initiative, the department\u2019s broader strategy for  border and interior enforcement.", "Reliable cost estimates. Reliable cost estimates are prerequisites  both for developing an economic justification for a program and for  establishing cost baselines against which to measure progress. DHS  IT programs that we reviewed have demonstrated mixed results in  this regard. For example, the ACE program has made considerable  progress in implementing our recommendation to ensure that its  development contractor\u2019s cost estimates are reconciled with  independent cost estimates, and that the derivation of both  estimates is consistent with published best practices. However, cost  estimating remains a major challenge for other DHS IT programs.  For example, Secure Flight did not have cost estimates for either  initial or full operating capability, nor did it have a life-cycle cost  estimate (estimated costs over the expected life of a program,  including direct and indirect costs and costs of operation and  maintenance). Also, for the US-VISIT program\u2019s analysis of  proposed alternatives for monitoring the exit of travelers, cost  estimates did not meet key criteria for reliable cost estimating as  established in the published best practices mentioned above. For  example, they did not include detailed work breakdown structures  defining the work to be performed, so that associated costs could be  identified and estimated. Such a work breakdown structure provides  a reliable basis for ensuring that estimates include all relevant costs.  Without reasonable cost estimates, it is not possible to produce an  adequate economic justification for choosing among alternatives,  and program performance cannot be adequately measured.", "Earned value management. To help ensure that reliable processes  are used to measure progress against cost and schedule  commitments, OMB requires agencies to manage and measure major  IT projects through use of an earned value management (EVM)  system that is compliant with specified standards. On programs we  reviewed, however, the use of EVM was as yet limited. For example,  although the ACE program had instituted the use of EVM on recent  releases, its use for one release was suspended in June 2005,  because staff assigned to the release were unfamiliar with the  technique. For another release, EVM was not used because,  according to program officials, the release had not established the  necessary cost and schedule baseline estimates against which  earned value could be measured. ACE officials told us that they plan  to establish baselines and use EVM for future work. With regard to  the US-VISIT program, although EVM is to be used in managing the  prime integration contract, it has not been used in a number of US- VISIT related contracts over the last 3 years. According to DHS, in  fiscal year 2005, 30 percent of departmental programs were using  EVM.", "Performance management and accountability. To ensure that  programs manage their performance effectively, it is important that  they define and measure progress against program commitments  and hold themselves accountable for results. These program  commitments include expected or estimated (1) capabilities and  associated use and quality; (2) benefits and mission value; (3) costs;  and (4) milestones and schedules. To be accountable, projects need  first to develop and maintain reliable and current expectations and  then to define and select metrics to measure progress against these.  However, in our reviews of DHS programs (such as those that are  required to prepare expenditure plans for Senate and House  appropriations subcommittees before obligating funding), we have  reported that program performance and accountability has been a  challenge. For example, the fiscal year 2004 expenditure plan for the  Atlas program did not provide sufficient information on program  commitments to allow the Congress to perform effective oversight.  On the other hand, although the ACE program office is still not  where it needs to be in this regard, it has made progress in this area:  it has now prepared an initial version of a program accountability  framework that includes measuring progress against costs,  milestones and schedules, and risks for select releases. However,  ACE benefit commitments are still not well defined, and the  performance targets being used were not always realistic. On other  programs, such as SEVIS, we found that while some performance  aspects of the system were being measured, others were not such as  network usage.", "Disciplined acquisition and development processes. Our reviews of  DHS programs have disclosed numerous weaknesses in key process  areas related to system acquisition and management, such as  requirements development and management, test management,  project planning, validation and verification, and contract  management oversight. For example, we reported that the Atlas  program office, which had been recently established, had not yet  implemented any of these key process areas. For the ACE program,  weaknesses in requirements definition were a major reason for  recent problems and delays, including the realization during pilot  testing that key functionality had not been defined and built into the  latest release. For US-VISIT, test plans were incomplete in that they  did not, among other things, adequately demonstrate traceability  between test cases and the requirement to be verified by testing.  Also, both ASI and Secure Flight were proceeding without complete  and up-to-date program management plans, and Secure Flight\u2019s  requirements were not well developed. In addition, key ASI  acquisition controls, such as contract management oversight, were  not yet defined. This led to a number of problems in ASI deploying,  operating, and maintaining ISIS technology. Further, ACE and US- VISIT projects have not always effectively employed independent  verification and validation.", "Risk management. Effective risk management is vital to the success  of any system acquisition. Accordingly, best practices advocate  establishing management structures and processes to proactively  identify facts and circumstances that can increase the probability of  an acquisition\u2019s failing to meet cost, schedule, and performance  commitments and then taking steps to reduce the probability of  their occurrence and impact. Our work on the ACE, US-VISIT, and  ASI programs, for example, showed that risk management programs  were in place, but not all risks were being effectively addressed. In  particular, key risks on the ACE program were not being effectively  addressed. Specifically, the ACE program schedule had introduced  significant concurrency in the development and deployment of  releases; as both prior experience on the ACE program and best  practices show, such concurrency causes contention for common  resources, which in turn produces schedule slips and cost overruns.  Also, the ACE program was passing key milestones with known  severe system defects\u2014that is, allowing development to proceed to  the next stage even though significant problems remained to be  solved. This led to a recurring pattern of addressing quality  problems with earlier releases by borrowing resources from future  releases, which led to schedule delays and cost overruns. Moreover,  it led the program to deploy one release prematurely with the  intention of gaining user acceptance sooner. However, this  premature deployment actually produced a groundswell of user  complaints and poor user satisfaction scores with the release.", "Similar risks were experienced on the Coast Guard\u2019s Rescue 21  program. For example, we reported that the Coast Guard\u2019s plan to  compress and overlap key tests introduced risks, and subsequently  the Coast Guard decided to postpone several tests.", "Security. The selection and employment of appropriate security and  privacy controls for an information system are important tasks that  can have major implications for the operations and assets and for  the protection of personal information that is collected and  maintained in the system. Security controls are the management,  operational, and technical safeguards prescribed for an information  system to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the  system and its information. Privacy controls limit the collection,  use, and disclosure of personal information.", "For several IT programs, security and privacy has been a challenge.  For example, we reported in September 2003 and again in May 2004  that the US-VISIT program office had yet to develop a security plan  as required by OMB and other federal guidance, although the  program later developed a plan that was generally consistent with  applicable guidance. However, the program office had not  conducted a security risk assessment or included in the plan when  such an assessment would be completed. OMB and other federal  guidance specifies that security plans should describe the  methodology that is used to identify system threats and  vulnerabilities and to assess the risks, and include the date the  assessment was completed.", "In addition, we reported that the Atlas program was relying on a  bureauwide security plan that did not address Atlas infrastructure  requirements. Further, Atlas had yet to develop a privacy impact  assessment to determine what effect, if any, the system would have  on individual privacy, the privacy consequences of processing  certain information, and alternatives considered to collect and  handle the information.", "On TSA\u2019s Secure Flight program, although the agency had taken  steps to implement security to protect system information and  assets, we recently reported that these steps were individually  incomplete and collectively fell short of a comprehensive program  consistent with federal guidance and associated best practices.  More specifically, OMB and other federal guidance and relevant best  practices call for agencies to, among other things, (1) conduct a  systemwide risk assessment that is based on system threats and  vulnerabilities and (2) then develop system security requirements  and related policies and procedures that govern the operation and  use of the system and address identified risks. Although TSA  developed two system security plans\u2014one for the underlying  infrastructure (hardware and software) and another for the Secure  Flight system application\u2014neither was complete. Specifically, the  infrastructure plan only partially defined the requirements to  address the risks, and the application plan did not include any  requirements addressing risks. Furthermore, we also recently  reported that TSA did not fully disclose to the public, as required  by privacy guidance, its use of personal information during the  testing phase of Secure Flight until after many of the tests had been  completed.", "Establishing and maintaining adequate staffing. Implementing  the IT management processes that I have been describing requires  that programs have the right people\u2014not only people who have the  right knowledge, skills, and abilities, but also enough of them to do  the job. Generally, all the programs we reviewed were challenged,  particularly in their initial stages, to assemble sufficient staff with  the right skill mix and to treat workforce (human capital) planning  as a management imperative. For example, we reported that both  the Atlas and the ASI programs were initiated without being  adequately staffed. In addition, in September 2003 we reported that  the US-VISIT program office had assessed its staffing needs for  acquisition management at 115 government and 117 contractor  personnel, but that at the time the program had 10 staff within the  program office and another 6 staff working closely with them.", "Since then, US-VISIT has filled 102 of its 115 planned government  positions (with plans in place to fill the remaining positions) and all  of its planned 117 contractor positions.", "However, to ensure that staffing needs continue to be met,  organizations need to manage human capital strategically, which  entails identifying the program functions that need to be performed  and the associated numbers and skill sets (core competencies)  needed to perform them, assessing the on-board workforce relative  to these needs, identifying gaps, and developing and implementing  strategies (i.e., hiring, retention, training, contracting) for filling  these gaps over the long-term. In this regard, the US-VISIT program  has made considerable progress. Specifically, we recently reported  that it has analyzed the program office\u2019s workforce to determine  diversity trends, retirement and attrition rates, and mission-critical  and leadership competency gaps, and it has updated the program\u2019s  core competency requirements to ensure alignment between the  program\u2019s human capital and business needs. In contrast, although  the ACE program has taken various informal steps to bolster its  workforce (such as providing training), it has been slow to  document and implement a human capital strategy that compares  competency-based staffing needs to on-board capabilities and  includes plans for closing shortfalls.", "In closing, let me reiterate that we have made a series of  recommendations to the department aimed at addressing both the  department\u2019s institutional IT management challenges and its IT  program-specific weaknesses. To the department\u2019s credit, it has  largely agreed with these recommendations. Although some of these  have been implemented, most are still works in process. In my view,  these recommendations provide a comprehensive framework for  strengthening DHS\u2019s management of IT and increasing the chances  of delivering promised system capabilities and benefits on time and  within budget. We look forward to working constructively with the  department in implementing these recommendations and thereby  maximizing the role that IT can play in DHS\u2019s transformation efforts.", "Mr. Chairmen, this concludes my statement.
