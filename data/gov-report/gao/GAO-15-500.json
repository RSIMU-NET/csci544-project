While the procedures reflect EPA's responsibility to exercise general management controls over the SAB and all its federal advisory committees under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), including keeping such committees free from outside influence, they do not fully account for the specific access that designated congressional committees have to the SAB under ERDDAA. For example, EPA's policy documents do not establish how EPA will determine which questions would be taken up by the SAB. EPA officials told GAO that in responding to congressional requests, EPA follows the same process that it would apply to internal requests for questions to the SAB, including considering whether the questions are science or policy driven or are important to science and the agency. However, under ERDDAA, the SAB is required to provide requested scientific advice to select committees, regardless of EPA's judgment. By clearly documenting how to handle congressional requests received under ERDDAA consistent with federal standards of internal control, EPA can provide reasonable assurance that its staff process responses consistently and in accordance with the law.", "The Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) has provided certain types of advice related to the review of national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS), but has not provided others.

An EPA official stated that CASAC has carried out its role in reviewing the air quality criteria and the NAAQS, but CASAC has never provided advice on adverse social, economic, or energy effects related to NAAQS because EPA has never asked CASAC to do so.

FACA was enacted, in part, out of concern that certain special interests  had too much influence over federal agency decision makers. The head  of each agency that uses federal advisory committees is responsible for  exercising certain controls over those advisory committees. For example,  the agency head is responsible for establishing administrative guidelines  and management controls that apply to all of the agency\u2019s advisory  committees, and for appointing a Designated Federal Officer (DFO) for  each advisory committee. Advisory committee meetings may not occur in  the absence of the DFO, who is also responsible for calling meetings,  approving meeting agendas, and adjourning meetings. As required by  FACA, the SAB and CASAC operate under charters that include  information on their objectives, scope of activities, and the officials to  whom they report.

The SAB  charter briefly noted how congressional committees may access SAB  advice, stating; \u201cWhile the SAB reports to the EPA Administrator,  congressional committees specified in ERDDAA may ask the EPA  Administrator to have SAB provide advice on a particular issue.\u201d (GAO  italics) Beyond what the charter states, however, no EPA policy specified  a process the Administrator should use to have the SAB provide advice  and review a congressional request.", "In response to a request from the SAB staff office that EPA clarify the  procedures for handling congressional committee requests, EPA, through  an April 4, 2014, memorandum informed the SAB that committee  members themselves and the federal advisory committees as a whole  should refrain from directly responding to these external requests.  Attached to the memorandum was the April 2014 policy that stated: \u201cif a  FACA committee member receives a request relating to the committee\u2019s  work from members of Congress or their staff, or congressional  committees, the member should notify the DFO, who will refer the request  to the EPA OCIR. OCIR will determine the agency\u2019s response to the  inquiry, after consulting with the relevant program office and the DFO.\u201d  This policy, however, did not provide more specific details on processing  requests from congressional committees under ERDDAA.", "In November 2014, EPA issued a clarification to the April 2014 policy,  specifying that SAB members who receive congressional requests  pursuant to ERDDAA should acknowledge receipt of the request and  indicate that EPA will provide a response. The November 2014 policy  clarification does not identify the SAB as having to provide the response.  The November 2014 policy clarification also stated that the request  should be forwarded to the appropriate DFO and that decisions on who  and how best to respond to the requests would be made by EPA on a  case-by-case basis. While the November 2014 policy clarification  provides greater specificity about processing requests, it is not consistent  with the SAB charter because the policy indicates that congressional  committee requests should be handled through the DFO, whereas the  charter indicates that they should be handled through the EPA  Administrator and provides no further information. A senior-level EPA  official stated that the agency considered that the charter and the  November 2014 policy clarification differed in the level of detail, but not in  the broad principle that the agency is the point of contact for  congressional requests to the SAB (and SAB responses to those  requests). However, under the federal standards of internal control,  agencies are to clearly document internal controls, and the  documentation is to appear in management directives, administrative  policies, or operating manuals. While EPA has documented its policies,  they are not clear, because the charter and the November 2014 policy  clarification are not consistent about which office should process  congressional requests.

By modifying the charter when it is renewed to reflect  the language in the November 2014 policy clarification\u2014that  congressional requests should be forwarded to the appropriate DFO\u2014 EPA can better ensure that its staff process congressional committee  requests consistently when the agency receives such a request.", "Moreover, neither the April 2014 policy nor the November 2014 policy  clarification clearly documents EPA\u2019s procedures for reviewing  congressional committee requests to determine which questions would be  taken up by the SAB consistent with the federal standards of internal  control. Because EPA\u2019s procedures for reviewing congressional  committee requests are not documented, it will be difficult for EPA to  provide reasonable assurance that its staff are appropriately applying  criteria when determining which questions the SAB will address. EPA  officials told us that internal deliberations in response to a congressional  request follow those that the agency would apply to internal requests for  charges to the SAB. Specifically, officials told us that EPA considers  whether the questions are science or policy driven, whether they are  important to science and the agency, and whether the SAB has already  undertaken a similar review. In addition, under ERDDAA, the SAB is  required to provide requested scientific advice to select committees,  regardless of EPA\u2019s judgment. As EPA has not fully responded to the  committee\u2019s two 2013 requests to the SAB, by clearly documenting its  procedures for reviewing congressional requests to determine which  questions should be taken up by the SAB and criteria for evaluating  requests, the agency can provide reasonable assurance that its staff  process these and other congressional committee requests consistently  and in accordance with both FACA and ERDDAA.", "Furthermore, the charter states that when scientific advice is requested  by one of the committees specified in ERDDAA, the Administrator will,  when appropriate, forward the SAB\u2019s advice to the requesting  congressional committee. Neither the charter nor the April 2014 policy  and November 2014 policy clarification specify when it would be  \u201cappropriate\u201d for the EPA Administrator to forward the SAB\u2019s advice to the  requesting committee. Such specificity would be consistent with federal  standards of internal control that call for clearly documenting internal  controls. Without such specification, the perception could be created that  EPA is withholding information from Congress that the SAB is required to  provide under ERDDAA. EPA officials stated that the EPA Administrator  does not attempt to determine whether advice of the SAB contained in  written reports should be forwarded to the requesting committee and that  all written reports are publically available on the SAB website at the same  time the report is sent to the EPA Administrator. By modifying the charter  or other policy documents to reflect when it is and when it is not  appropriate for the EPA Administrator to forward the advice to the  requesting committee, EPA can better ensure transparency in its process.", "In general, under FACA, as a federal advisory committee, the SAB\u2019s  agenda is controlled by its host agency, EPA. As such, the SAB  generally responds only to charge questions put to it by EPA although,  under ERDDAA, the SAB is specifically charged with providing advice to  its host agency as well as to designated congressional committees. In  addition, it is EPA\u2019s responsibility under GSA regulations for implementing  FACA to ensure that advisory committee members and staff understand  agency-specific statutes and regulations that may affect them, but  nothing in the SAB charter, the April 2014 policy, or the November 2014  policy clarification communicates that, ultimately, SAB must provide  scientific advice when requested by congressional committees. For  example, we found no mechanism in EPA policy for the SAB to respond  on its own initiative to a congressional committee request for scientific  advice unrelated to an existing EPA charge question. A written policy for  how the SAB should respond to a congressional committee request that  does not overlap with charge questions from EPA would be consistent  with federal internal control standards.
