Among the challenges to implementing asset management, utilities cited collecting and managing needed data and making the cultural changes necessary to integrate information and decision making across departments. Utilities also reported that the shorter-term focus of their governing bodies can hamper long-term planning efforts. EPA currently sponsors initiatives to promote the use of asset management, including educational materials, technical assistance, and research. While this is a good first step, GAO found that EPA could better coordinate some activities. For example, EPA has no central repository to facilitate information sharing within and across its drinking water and wastewater programs, which would help avoid duplication of effort. Water industry officials see a role for EPA in promoting asset management as a tool to help utilities meet infrastructure-related regulatory requirements; they also noted that establishing an EPA Web site would be useful for disseminating asset management information to utilities.

Adding to the problem is that many utilities have not  been generating enough revenues from user charges and other local  sources to cover their full cost of service.  As a result, utilities have  deferred maintenance and postponed needed capital improvements.  To  address these problems and help ensure that utilities can manage their  needs cost-effectively, some water industry and government officials  advocate the use of comprehensive asset management.  Asset management  is a systematic approach to managing capital assets in order to minimize  costs over the useful life of the assets while maintaining adequate service  to customers.   While the approach is relatively new to the U.S. water  industry, it has been used by water utilities in other countries for as long as  10 years.", "Each year, the federal government makes available billions of dollars to  help local communities finance drinking water and wastewater  infrastructure projects.  Concerns about the condition of existing  infrastructure have prompted calls to increase financial assistance and, at  the same time, ensure that the federal government\u2019s investment is  protected.  In recent years the Congress has been considering a number of  proposals that would promote the use of comprehensive asset management  by requiring utilities to develop and implement plans for maintaining,  rehabilitating, and replacing capital assets, often as a condition of obtaining  loans or other financial assistance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Federal Government Has Played a Major Role in Funding and Setting Requirements for Water Infrastructure", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has had a significant impact on the nation\u2019s  drinking water and wastewater infrastructure by (1) providing financial  assistance to build new facilities and (2) establishing regulatory  requirements that affect the technology, maintenance, and operation of  utility infrastructure.  As we reported in 2001, nine federal agencies made  available about $46.6 billion for capital improvements at water utilities  from fiscal years 1991 through 2000.  The Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA) and the Department of Agriculture alone accounted for over  85 percent of the assistance, providing $26.4 billion and $13.3 billion,  respectively, during the 10-year period; since then, the funding from these  two agencies has totaled nearly $15 billion.   EPA\u2019s financial assistance is  primarily in the form of grants to the states to capitalize the Drinking Water  and Clean Water State Revolving Funds, which are used to finance  improvements at local drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities,  respectively.  As part of the Rural Community Advancement Program,  Agriculture\u2019s Rural Utilities Service provides direct loans, loan guarantees,  and grants to construct or improve drinking water, sanitary sewer, solid  waste, and storm drainage facilities in rural communities.", "In addition to its financial investment, EPA has promulgated regulations to  implement the Safe Drinking Water Act and Clean Water Act, which have  been key factors in shaping utilities\u2019 capital needs and management  practices.  For example, under the Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA has set  standards for the quality of drinking water and identified effective  technologies for treating contaminated water.  Similarly, under the Clean  Water Act, EPA has issued national minimum technology requirements for  municipal wastewater utilities and criteria that states use to establish water  quality standards that affect the level of pollutants that such utilities are  permitted to discharge.

As table 1 shows, the projected needs range from  $485 billion to nearly $1.2 trillion.  The estimates vary considerably,  depending on assumptions about the nature of existing capital stock,  replacement rates, and financing costs.  Given the magnitude of the  projected needs, it is important that utilities adopt a strategy to manage the  repair and replacement of key assets as cost-effectively as possible and to  plan to sustain their infrastructure over the long term.", "Local drinking water and wastewater utilities rely primarily on revenues  from user rates to pay for infrastructure improvements.  According to EPA\u2019s  gap analysis, maintaining utility spending at current levels could result in a  funding gap of up to $444 billion between projected infrastructure needs  and available resources.  However, EPA also estimates that if utilities\u2019  infrastructure spending grows at a rate of 3 percent annually over and  above inflation, the gap will narrow considerably and may even disappear.   EPA\u2019s report concludes that utilities will need to use some combination of  increased spending and innovative management practices to meet the  projected needs.", "The nation\u2019s largest utilities\u2014those serving populations of at least 10,000\u2014 account for most of the projected infrastructure needs.  For example,  according to EPA data, large drinking water systems represent about   7 percent of the total number of community water systems, but account for  about 65 percent of the estimated infrastructure needs.  Similarly, about   29 percent of the wastewater treatment and collection systems are  estimated to serve populations of 10,000 or more, and such systems  account for approximately 89 percent of projected infrastructure needs for  wastewater utilities.  Most of the U.S. population is served by large drinking  water and wastewater utilities; for example, systems serving at least   10,000 people provide drinking water to over 80 percent of the population.", "Pipeline rehabilitation and replacement represents a significant portion of  the projected infrastructure needs.  According to the American Society of  Civil Engineers, U.S. drinking water and wastewater utilities are  responsible for an estimated 800,000 miles of water delivery pipelines and  between 600,000 and 800,000 miles of sewer pipelines, respectively.   According to the most recent EPA needs surveys, the investment needed  for these pipelines from 1999 through 2019 could be as much as   $137 billion.", "Several recent studies have raised concerns about the condition of the  existing pipeline network.  For example, in August 2002, we reported the  results of a nationwide survey of large drinking water and wastewater  utilities.  Based on the survey, more than one-third of the utilities had   20 percent or more of their pipelines nearing the end of their useful life; and  for 1 in 10 utilities, 50 percent or more of their pipelines were nearing the  end of their useful life.  In 2001, a major water industry association  predicted that drinking water utilities will face significant repair and  replacement costs over the next three decades, given the average life  estimates for different types of pipelines and the years since their original  installation.  Other studies have made similar predictions for the pipelines  owned by wastewater utilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Factors Have Contributed to Deteriorating Utility Infrastructure", "paragraphs": ["EPA and water industry officials cite a variety of factors that have played a  role in the deterioration of utility infrastructure; most of these factors are  linked to the officials\u2019 belief that the level of ongoing investment in the  infrastructure has not been sufficient to sustain it.   For example, according  to EPA\u2019s Assistant Administrator for Water, the pipelines and plants that  make up the nation\u2019s water infrastructure are aging, and maintenance is too  often deferred.  He predicted that consumers will face sharply rising costs  to repair and replace the infrastructure.  Similarly, as the Water  Environment Research Foundation reported in 2000, \u201cyears of reactive maintenance and minimal expenditures on sewers have left a huge backlog  of repair and renewal work.\u201d", "Our nationwide survey of large drinking water and wastewater utilities  identified problems with the level of revenues generated from user rates  and decisions on investing these revenues.  For example:   Many drinking water and wastewater utilities do not cover the full cost  of service\u2014including needed capital investments and operation and  maintenance costs\u2014through their user charges.  Specifically, a  significant percentage of the utilities serving populations of 10,000 or  more\u201429 percent of the drinking water utilities and 41 percent of the  wastewater utilities\u2014were not generating enough revenue from user  charges and other local sources to cover their costs.", "Many drinking water and wastewater utilities defer maintenance and  needed capital improvements because of insufficient funding.  About  one-third of the utilities deferred maintenance expenditures in their  most recent fiscal year; similar percentages of utilities reported  deferring minor capital improvements and major capital improvements.   About 20 percent of the utilities had deferred expenditures in all three  categories.", "For many utilities, a significant disparity exists between the actual  rehabilitation and replacement of their pipelines and the rate at which  utility managers believe rehabilitation and replacement should occur.   We found that only about 40 percent of the drinking water utilities and  35 percent of the wastewater utilities met or exceeded their desired rate  of pipeline rehabilitation and replacement.  The remaining utilities did  not meet their desired rates.  Roughly half of the utilities actually  rehabilitated or replaced 1 percent or less of their pipelines annually.", "Utility managers also lack the information they need to manage their  existing capital assets.  According to our survey, many drinking water and  wastewater utilities either do not have plans for managing their assets or  have plans that may not be adequate in scope or content.  Specifically,  nearly one-third of the utilities did not have plans for managing their  existing capital assets.  Moreover, for the utilities that did have such plans,  the plans in many instances did not cover all assets or did not contain one  or more key elements, such as an inventory of assets, assessment criteria,  information on the assets\u2019 condition, and the planned and actual  expenditures to maintain the assets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comprehensive Asset Management Focuses on Efficiently Managing Capital Assets", "paragraphs": ["Comprehensive asset management has gained increasing recognition  within the water industry as an approach that could give utilities the  information and analytical tools they need to manage existing assets more  effectively and plan for future needs.

While  the specific terminology differs, some fundamental elements of  implementing asset management appear consistently in the literature.", "Collecting and organizing detailed information on assets. Collecting  basic information about capital assets helps managers identify their  infrastructure needs and make informed decisions about the assets.  An  inventory of an organization\u2019s existing assets generally should include  (1) descriptive information about the assets, including their age, size,  construction materials, location, and installation date; (2) an assessment  of the assets\u2019 condition, along with key information on operating,  maintenance, and repair history, and the assets\u2019 expected and remaining  useful life; and (3) information on the assets\u2019 value, including historical  cost, depreciated value, and replacement cost.", "Analyzing data to set priorities and make better decisions about  assets. Under asset management, managers apply analytical techniques  to identify significant patterns or trends in the data they have collected  on capital assets; help assess risks and set priorities; and optimize  decisions on maintenance, repair, and replacement of the assets.  For  example:    Life-cycle cost analysis. Managers analyze life-cycle costs to decide  which assets to buy, considering total costs over an asset\u2019s life, not  just the initial purchase price.  Thus, when evaluating investment  alternatives, managers also consider differences in installation cost,  operating efficiency, frequency of maintenance and repairs, and other  factors to get a cradle-to-grave picture of asset costs.", "Risk/criticality assessment. Managers use risk assessment to  determine how critical the assets are to their operations, considering  both the likelihood that an asset will fail and the consequences\u2014in  terms of costs and impact on the organization\u2019s desired level of  service\u2014if the asset does fail.  Based on this analysis, managers set  priorities and target their resources accordingly.", "Integrating data and decision making across the organization.", "Managers ensure that the information collected within an organization  is consistent and organized so that it is accessible to the people who  need it.  Among other things, the organization\u2019s databases should be  fully integrated; for instance, financial and engineering data should be  compatible, and ideally each asset should have a unique identifier that is  used throughout the organization.  Regarding decision making, all  appropriate units within an organization should participate in key  decisions, which ensures that all relevant information gets considered  and encourages managers to take an organizationwide view when  setting goals and priorities.", "Linking strategy for addressing infrastructure needs to service goals,  operating budgets, and capital improvement plans.  An organization\u2019s  goals for its desired level of service\u2014in terms of product quality  standards, frequency of service disruptions, customer response time, or  other measures\u2014are a major consideration in the organization\u2019s  strategy for managing its assets.  As managers identify and rank their  infrastructure needs, they determine the types and amount of  investments needed to meet the service goals.  Decisions on asset  maintenance, rehabilitation, and replacement are, in turn, linked to the  organization\u2019s short- and long-term financial needs and are reflected in  the operating budget and capital improvement plan, as appropriate.", "Implementing the basic elements of asset management is an iterative  process that individual organizations may begin at different points.  Within  the water industry, for example, some utilities may start out by identifying  their infrastructure needs, while other utilities may take their first step by  setting goals for the level of service they want to provide.  The  interrelationship between the elements of asset management can alter an  organization\u2019s strategy for managing its assets.  For example, once an  organization has completed a risk assessment, it may scale back its efforts  to compile a detailed inventory of assets to focus initially on those assets  determined to be critical.  Similarly, as information on infrastructure needs  and priorities improves, managers reexamine the level of planned  investments, considering the impact on both revenue requirements and the  level of service that can be achieved.  According to advocates of asset  management, while many organizations are implementing certain aspects  of the process, such as maintaining an inventory of assets and tracking  maintenance, these organizations are not realizing the full potential of  comprehensive asset management unless all of the basic elements work  together as an integrated management system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strategy for Adopting and Progress toward Implementing Comprehensive Asset Management Varies", "paragraphs": ["As the description of asset management indicates, implementing this  approach is not a step-by-step, linear process.  Asset management is an  integrated system that utilities and other organizations can implement in a  number of different ways, depending on what makes sense for their  particular organization.  In the United States, some drinking water and  wastewater utilities, for example, are taking a more strategic approach,  initially investing their resources in planning for asset management.  Other  utilities are focusing initially on collecting data.  Another variation is that  some utilities are adopting asset management on a utilitywide basis, while  others are piloting the approach at a single facility or department or are  targeting critical assets utilitywide.   The level of sophistication with which  asset management concepts are applied within a utility can also vary,  depending on the size and complexity of the operations and the resources  that the utility can devote to implementation.", "Comprehensive asset management is a relatively new concept for drinking  water and wastewater utilities in the United States.  According to EPA and  major water industry organizations, few utilities are implementing  comprehensive asset management, and those that have done so are almost  exclusively larger entities.

Few utilities have been involved in the process for longer  than 2 to 3 years.", "Although relatively new to the U.S. water industry, comprehensive asset  management has been used for about 10 years by water utilities in Australia  and New Zealand, where the national governments have strongly endorsed  the concept.  In each case, the driving force behind the use of asset  management was legislation that called for water utilities to improve their  financial management.  In Australia, the law requires utilities to recover the  full cost of service, while in New Zealand the law requires utilities to  depreciate their assets annually and use cost-benefit analysis, among other  things.  The national governments of Australia and New Zealand each  published guidebooks on asset management, and engineering groups in the  two countries jointly developed a comprehensive manual on managing  infrastructure assets.", "Asset management is seen as a means of improving utility infrastructure  elsewhere in the world.  For example, in the United Kingdom, utilities must  develop asset management plans that identify the level of investment  required to maintain and improve capital assets every 5 years; annual  audits help ensure that planned improvements are made.   Similarly, in  2002, the legislature in Ontario, Canada enacted a law requiring  municipalities to develop plans for recovering the full cost of service to  ensure that drinking water and wastewater systems are adequately funded."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The Ranking Minority Member, Senate Committee on Environment and  Public Works, asked us to examine the use of comprehensive asset  management at drinking water and wastewater utilities in the United  States.

In particular,  utilities can use the information collected and analyzed to prevent  problems and allocate their maintenance resources more effectively.  For  example:    Better information enabled the Massachusetts Water Resources  Authority to improve its maintenance decisions and eliminate some  unneeded maintenance activities.  For example, in an effort to optimize  maintenance practices in one of their treatment plants, utility officials  reassessed maintenance practices for 12 equipment systems, such as  different types of pumps.  By using the assessment results to improve  maintenance planning for these assets, the utility decreased the labor  hours spent on preventive maintenance by 25 percent from the hours  recommended by the original equipment manufacturers, according to  utility officials.  Similarly, in analyzing its maintenance practices, the  Massachusetts Water Resources Authority found it was lubricating some  equipment more often than necessary.  By decreasing the frequency of  oil changes, the utility reported it saved approximately $20,000 in oil  purchase and disposal costs.  In addition, the utility extended the life of  its assets by decreasing the lubrication\u2014over-lubrication can cause  equipment parts to fail prematurely.", "Seattle Public Utilities used asset management to better target its  maintenance resources.  As part of the utility\u2019s asset management  strategy, officials used a risk management approach, calculating the  likelihood and impact of a rupture for the utility\u2019s sewer and drainage  pipes.  To determine the likelihood of rupture, officials considered such  factors as a pipe\u2019s age, material, and proximity to a historical landfill or  steep slope.  To determine the impact of a rupture, they examined  factors such as a pipe\u2019s size, location, and historical cost of repair.  As a  result of this analysis, utility officials identified 15 percent of their pipes  as high risk, or \u201ccritical\u201d\u2014such as larger, older pipes located beneath  downtown Seattle.  They shifted resources to maintain and rehabilitate  these pipes.  The officials considered the remaining 85 percent of pipes  as noncritical, or, lower risk, because their failure was less likely or  because a breakage would affect a limited number of customers, be  repaired relatively quickly, and require minimal resources.  For these  pipes, the utility decided not to perform any preventive maintenance  activities, only making repairs as needed.  By taking this approach,  utility officials believe they are using their staff resources more  efficiently and that, over time, they will reduce their maintenance costs.", "Comprehensive asset management also helps managers to make more  informed decisions about whether to rehabilitate or replace assets, and  once they decide on replacement, to make better capital investment  decisions.  For example:   According to utility managers at the Louisville Water Company,  the  utility developed its Pipe Evaluation Model in the early 1990s as a tool  for ranking its 3,300 miles of aging pipes and water mains for  rehabilitation and replacement.  The pipe program includes many of the  key principles and practices of comprehensive asset management:  for  instance, it integrated data about the age of the pipes with data about  their maintenance history.  In analyzing this information, managers  discovered that two vintages of pipes\u2014those built between 1862 and  1865 and between 1926 and 1931\u2014had the highest number of breaks per  100 miles of pipeline.  Consequently, they decided to replace the pipes  from those two periods.  The model also showed that pipes installed  between 1866 and 1925 were fairly reliable, thus these pipes were  targeted for rehabilitation rather than replacement.  The utility is lining  the interior of these pipes with cement, which is expected to extend  their life by about 40 years.  Furthermore, utility managers told us that  their pipe model and other practices that use asset management  principles have helped reduce the frequency of water main breaks from  26 to 22.7 per hundred miles and the frequency of leaks from joints from  8.2 to 5.6 per hundred miles.", "In implementing its asset management approach, managers at the  Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District reassessed a proposed investment in new wastewater treatment tanks and decided on a less  expensive option, thereby saving the utility approximately $12 million.   During this reassessment, managers found that increasing preventive  maintenance on existing tanks would lower the risk of shutdown more  cost-effectively than adding a new set of tanks.  Utility officials  commented that their implementation of asset management helped  change their decision-making process by, among other things, bringing  together staff from different departments to ensure more complete  information, and more effectively using the data to understand  investment options.", "As a part of its asset management strategy, Seattle Public Utilities  established an asset management committee, comprised of senior  management from various departments, to ensure appropriate decision  making about the utility\u2019s capital improvement projects.  For every  capital improvement project with an expected cost over $250,000,  project managers must submit a plan to the committee that (1) defines  the problem to be solved, (2) examines project alternatives,   (3) estimates the life-cycle costs of the alternatives, (4) analyzes the  possible risks associated with the project, and (5) recommends an  alternative.  According to utility officials, implementing this process has  led to deferring, eliminating, or altering several capital improvement  projects, and contributing to a reduction in the utility\u2019s 2004 capital  improvement project budget for water of more than 8 percent.  For  instance, after drafting new water pressure standards, the utility  eliminated the need for some new water mains.  It developed an  alternative plan to provide more localized solutions to increase water  pressure, resulting in expected savings of $3 million.  In another case,  the utility reassessed alternatives to replacing a sewer line located on a  deteriorating trestle, ultimately opting to restore and maintain the  existing wood trestle and make spot repairs to the sewer line, which  resulted in an estimated savings of $1.3 million.", "Finally, comprehensive asset management helps utilities share information  across departments and coordinate planning and decision making.  In this  way, utility managers can reduce duplication of efforts and improve the  allocation of staff time and other resources.  For example, managers at  Eastern Municipal Water District used asset management to improve their  business practices, which they saw as compartmentalized and inefficient.   In one instance, they examined their decentralized maintenance activities.   The utility had two maintenance crews who worked throughout the  system, in different shifts and reported to managers at four different  facilities.  In addition, the utility\u2019s work order system was inefficient; for  example, when different crew members independently reported the same  maintenance need, managers did not notice the duplication because the  problem was described in different terms (e.g., as a \u201cbreaker failure\u201d by one  crew member and as a \u201cpump failure\u201d by another).  Finally, in some  instances, work crews would arrive at a site only to find that needed  maintenance work had already been completed.  To improve the system,  utility officials (1) centralized maintenance by making one person  responsible for scrutinizing and setting priorities for all work orders and  (2) established a standardized classification of assets, which helped  maintenance staff use the same terminology when preparing work orders.   Utility officials report that taking these steps allowed them to identify and  eliminate work orders that were unnecessary, already completed, or  duplicates, which ultimately reduced their maintenance work backlog by  50 percent.", "The private sector companies we visited agreed that using a comprehensive  asset management approach improved their decision making.  Specifically,  by improving their data, analyzing these data, and centralizing management  decision making, managers at SBC Communications, Inc., reported that  they have made better capital investment decisions and allocated resources  more efficiently.  Managers at The Gillette Company reported that they  consider life-cycle costs and other factors to assess investment alternatives  and, ultimately, make better investment decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comprehensive Asset Management Can Help Utilities Justify Rate Increases and Proposed Projects to Their Customers and Governing Bodies", "paragraphs": ["The utilities we contacted reported that comprehensive asset management  also benefits their relations with external stakeholders by (1) making a  sound case for rate increases to local governing bodies and ratepayers;   (2) improving their bond rating with credit rating agencies, and (3) better  demonstrating compliance with federal and state regulations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Making a Sound Case for Rate Increases", "paragraphs": ["Some utilities have used, or expect to use, the information collected  through comprehensive asset management to persuade elected officials to  invest in drinking water and wastewater infrastructure through rate  increases.

The board approved a  set-aside of $600,000 for an infrastructure rehabilitation and replacement  fund as a part of the requested rate increase in 1993, and, according to one  utility official, has been supportive of including funds for asset  rehabilitation and replacement as a part of rate requests since then.   Furthermore, the utility manager requested that the amount of the set-aside  gradually increase to $3 million over the next 5 years. According to this  official, the board not only approved this request, it also increased the rates  to support the fund sooner than the utility manager had requested.   According to several other utilities that have begun to implement  comprehensive asset management, this approach should enable them to  justify needed rate increases from their governing bodies.  Similarly,  Australian and New Zealand officials we interviewed stated that the data  from asset management helps utilities make a more credible case for rate  increases from their governing bodies.", "Utility managers can also use the information they provide to their  governing boards as a basis for evaluating and deciding on trade-offs  between service levels and rates.  For example, according to an official at  South Australian Water Corporation, using asset management practices, he  was able to suggest a range of funding alternatives to the utility\u2019s governing  body.  The utility managers conducted statistical modeling on the asset  information they collected (e.g., pipe performance history and financial  information) and, using this analysis, predicted the approximate number of  pipe breaks at various levels of funding.

For example, officials at Hunter Water Corporation  reported significant savings in real terms between fiscal years 1990 and  2001:  a 37 percent reduction in operating costs; improved service  standards for customers, as measured by such factors as water quality and  the number of sewer overflows; and a reduction of more than 30 percent in  water rates for customers.  Hunter Water officials believe that they  achieved these efficiencies as a result of asset management.", "Though utility officials have made some attempts to quantify the impact of  asset management, they also cited reasons for exercising caution in  interpreting reported savings and other benefits.  First, benefits such as  operating cost reductions should not be considered in isolation of other  utility costs.  A utility cannot consider reductions in operating costs a net  benefit if, for instance, savings in operational costs are offset by an  increase in the utility\u2019s capital expenditures.  Furthermore, reductions in  operating costs may be caused by increases in capital expenditures  because, for example, newer assets may require less maintenance and  fewer repairs.  In the case of the Hunter Water Corporation, the utility\u2019s  capital expenditures were at about the same level in 2001 as in 1991,  despite some fluctuation over the period.", "Second, other factors might have contributed to financial and other  benefits.

In addition,  utilities may choose to align their data collection with their ongoing  maintenance and replacement activities.  These approaches, however, may  require new technology, which may mean a financial investment.

For example:  According to an official at Des Moines Water Works, the utility  discovered that the manufacturer\u2019s recommended maintenance  practices often conflicted with the utility\u2019s experience with the same  asset.  This official pointed out that the manufacturer\u2019s estimate for  maintenance was always higher than the utility\u2019s experience.  Given  these inconsistencies, the official noted, all utilities would benefit from  the development of a central industry clearinghouse that provided  information about the recommended maintenance practices for certain  assets.", "Similarly, an official at East Bay Municipal Utility District noted a  significant difference between the manufacturer\u2019s recommended  maintenance practices and the utility\u2019s experience with optimized  maintenance.

The toolkit is currently being field  tested and is scheduled for release in 2006.  Among other things, it includes  self-audit instruments to help utility managers to analyze their systems\u2019  needs, training materials, and a summary of lessons learned in the field.", "In addition to various informational materials on asset management, EPA  has sponsored a number of training and technical assistance programs.   For example, the Office of Wastewater Management, along with  representatives from a major utility and an engineering firm, developed a   2-day seminar on asset management, which will be held at several locations  around the country during fiscal year 2004.  For smaller drinking water and  wastewater utilities, EPA funds state and university-based centers that  provide training and technical assistance to small utilities on a variety of  matters, including asset management.  Specifically  EPA\u2019s Office of the Chief Financial Officer funds nine university-based  \u201cenvironmental finance centers\u201d that assist local communities in  seeking financing for environmental facilities, including municipal  drinking water and wastewater utilities.  In fiscal year 2003, the nine  centers shared a total of $2 million in funding from the Office of the  Chief Financial Officer; some centers also receive funds from EPA  program offices for specific projects.  According to an official in EPA\u2019s  Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water, at least three of the finance  centers have efforts related to asset management planned or underway  to benefit drinking water utilities.  For example, the centers at Boise  State University and the University of Maryland provide on-site and  classroom training on establishing an asset inventory; collecting data on  the age, useful life, and value of capital assets; recordkeeping; financing;  and setting rates high enough to cover the full cost of service.   Regarding the latter topic, Boise State\u2019s finance center developed a  simplified software program, called CAPFinance, which can help  smaller systems collect and analyze the data they need in order to set  adequate user rates; much of this information can be used to create a  rudimentary asset management program.", "Another eight university-based technical assistance centers receive  funding under the Safe Drinking Water Act to help ensure that small  drinking water systems have the capacity they need to meet regulatory  requirements and provide safe drinking water.  In fiscal year 2003, the  eight centers shared about $3.6 million in funding from the Office of  Ground Water and Drinking Water.  According to an official from that  office, three of the centers are holding workshops or developing  guidance manuals that focus on sustaining the financial viability of small  systems in some way; the official believes that much of this material is  relevant to implementing asset management.", "The Office of Wastewater Management funds 46 state and university- based environmental training centers under the Clean Water Act to train  wastewater utility officials on financial management, operations and  maintenance, and other topics.  According to an official with EPA\u2019s  wastewater program, one of the 46 centers is developing a series of six  training courses to help small wastewater utilities implement some of  the basic elements of asset management, such as inventorying system  assets and assessing their condition.  Once this effort is completed, the  center will disseminate the course materials to the remaining 45 centers  so that staff from the other centers will be able to teach the asset  management courses to operators of small wastewater utilities across  the country.", "EPA has also funded research projects related to asset management.  For  example, one project\u2014sponsored by EPA, the Water Environment  Federation, and the Association of Metropolitan Sewerage Agencies\u2014 examined the interrelationship between asset management and other  management initiatives, such as environmental management systems, that  have received some attention within the water industry.  The project found  that to varying degrees, the initiatives share a common focus on continuous  improvement through self-assessment, benchmarking, and the use of best  practices and performance measures.  The final report, issued in  September 2002, concluded that while the initiatives overlap substantially,  they are generally compatible.", "EPA also contributed $75,000 toward a 2002 report by the Water  Environment Research Foundation, which summarized the results of a   2-day workshop held to develop a research agenda for asset management.   Workshop participants, who included utility managers, regulators, and  industry consultants, identified areas in which they need improved tools  and technical approaches, established criteria for evaluating asset  management research needs, and identified and set priorities for specific  research projects.  According to the foundation\u2019s report, the workshop  ultimately recommended 11 research projects, 2 of which will get  underway in 2004.  EPA is contributing $200,000 to one of these projects,  which will develop protocols for assessing the condition and performance  of infrastructure assets and predictive models for correlating the two.  The  foundation will fund the second project, which is scheduled to begin in  March 2004, and will develop guidance on strategic planning for asset  management.  According to EPA, the second project will also develop a  Web-based collection of best practices on asset management; utilities will  be able to purchase licenses to gain access to the materials.", "The remaining research projects identified in the workshop highlight the  need for practical tools to help utilities implement the most fundamental  aspects of asset management.  They include projects to   establish methodologies for determining asset value, compiling  inventories, and capturing and compiling information on the assets\u2019  attributes;  develop methodologies for calculating life-cycle costs for infrastructure   construct predictive models for infrastructure assets that project life- cycle costs and risks;  identify best practices for operating and maintaining infrastructure  assets by asset category, condition, and performance requirements; and   identify best practices for integrating water and wastewater utility  databases.", "In addition, workshop participants recommended a project to assess the  feasibility of establishing an Asset Management Standards Board for the  drinking water and wastewater industry."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA\u2019s Efforts to Promote Asset Management Could Be Strengthened by Leveraging Ongoing Efforts Within and Outside the Agency", "paragraphs": ["EPA could build on its efforts to promote asset management at drinking  water and wastewater utilities by better coordinating ongoing and planned  initiatives in the agency\u2019s drinking water and wastewater programs.

For example, the  Office of the Chief Financial Officer, the Office of Ground Water and  Drinking Water, and the Office of Wastewater Management have funded  parallel but separate efforts to develop handbooks, software, or other  training materials to help small drinking water and wastewater utilities  implement asset management or related activities such as improving  financial viability.  According to our interviews with EPA officials and  representatives of the university-based training and technical assistance  centers, no central repository exists for EPA to track what the university- based centers are doing and ensure that they have the information they  need to avoid duplication and take advantage of related work done by  others.  The centers that share information do so primarily within their own  network, as in the case of the environmental finance centers, or share  information on an ad hoc basis.  As a result, the centers are likely to miss  some opportunities to exchange information.  Similarly, the drinking water  and wastewater program offices do not regularly exchange information on  what they or their centers are doing to develop informational materials,  training, or technical assistance on asset management.", "EPA officials explained that, to some extent, the organizational framework  within which the centers operate contributes to limited information sharing  and duplication of effort.  As a result, EPA is not maximizing the resources  it devotes to encouraging utilities\u2019 use of asset management.  In the case of  the environmental finance centers, for example, each one negotiates a  work plan with the EPA regional office it serves.  Although EPA  headquarters also has some influence over what the centers work on, the  centers primarily focus on regional priorities and work with the states  within the regional office\u2019s jurisdiction.  Occasionally, EPA\u2019s drinking water  and wastewater program offices fund projects at the environmental finance  centers that are independent of their regional work plans.  For example, the  drinking water program provided some funds to the center at Boise State to  develop an evaluation tool that states can use to assess utilities\u2019  qualifications for obtaining financial assistance from state revolving loan  funds.  For the most part, however, the training and technical assistance  centers operate autonomously and do not have a formal mechanism for  regularly exchanging information among the different center networks or  between the drinking water and wastewater programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Could Supplement Its Efforts to Promote Asset Management by Using Information Available from Other Federal Agencies", "paragraphs": ["EPA has not taken advantage of the guidance, training, and implementation  tools available from other federal agencies, which would help EPA leverage  its resources.  For the purposes of our review, we focused on the  Department of Transportation\u2019s Federal Highway Administration because it  has been involved in promoting asset management for about a decade and  has been at the forefront of developing useful tools and training materials.   In 1999, the Federal Highway Administration established an Office of Asset  Management to develop tools and other materials on asset management  and encourage state transportation agencies to adopt asset management  programs and practices.", "According to officials within the Office of Asset Management, the basic  elements of asset management are the same regardless of the type of entity  responsible for managing the assets or the type of assets being managed.   Simply put, every organization needs to know the assets it has, their  condition, how they are performing, and the costs and benefits of  alternatives for managing the assets.  Over the years, the Office of Asset  Management has published several guidance documents on asset  management and its basic elements.  While the purpose of the guidance  was to assist state transportation agencies, Transportation officials believe  that the general principles contained in their publications are universally  applicable.  The office\u2019s guidance includes, for example,  a general primer on the fundamental concepts of asset management;    a primer on data integration that lays out the benefits of and tools for  integrating data, the steps to follow in linking or combining large data  files, potential obstacles to data integration and ways to overcome them,  and experiences of agencies that have integrated their data; and    a primer on life-cycle cost analysis that provides information on how to  apply this methodology for comparing investment alternatives and  describes uncertainties regarding when and how to use life-cycle cost  analysis and what assumptions should be made during the course of the  analysis.", "Transportation\u2019s Office of Asset Management has also developed a  software program to assist states in estimating how different levels of  investment in highway maintenance will affect both user costs and the  highways\u2019 future condition and performance.  In addition, to disseminate  information on asset management, the office established a Web site that  includes its most recent tools and guidance and links to external Web sites  with related asset management information, including a link to an asset  management Web site jointly sponsored with the American Association of  State Highway and Transportation Officials.", "As EPA began its efforts to explore the potential of comprehensive asset  management to help address utility infrastructure needs, officials from the  Office of Water met with staff from Transportation\u2019s Office of Asset  Management and obtained a detailed briefing on its asset management  program.  Although EPA officials expressed concerns about having  relatively limited resources to promote asset management, they have so far  not pursued a closer relationship with Transportation or other federal  agencies with experience in the field.

However, they stopped short of endorsing  legislative proposals that would require utilities to develop and implement  plans for maintaining, rehabilitating, and replacing capital assets, often as a  condition of obtaining loans or other financial assistance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Water Industry Officials See Role for EPA in Linking Asset Management to Regulatory Requirements and Other Initiatives Aimed at Improving Utility Management", "paragraphs": ["To obtain views on the role that EPA might play in encouraging the use of  asset management, we talked with officials from water industry  associations and the 15 utilities that we selected for structured interviews.   With few exceptions, the officials agreed that EPA should be promoting  asset management in some way, although opinions varied on what activities  would be most appropriate.  One of the options that garnered the support  of many was a greater leadership role for EPA in promoting the use of asset  management.  For example, 11 of the 15 utilities indicated that based on  their own experience, asset management can help utilities comply with  certain regulatory requirements that focus in whole or in part on the  adequacy of utility infrastructure and the management practices that affect  it.  While EPA recognizes the link between asset management and  regulatory compliance\u2014and has noted the connection in some agency  publications and training\u2014some utility officials believe that EPA should  increase its efforts in this regard.  As examples of regulatory requirements  for which asset management is particularly germane, officials from  industry associations and individual utilities cited both the existing  \u201ccapacity development\u201d requirements under EPA\u2019s drinking water program  and regulations for capacity, management, operation, and maintenance  under consideration in the wastewater program, as follows:  Capacity development requirements for drinking water utilities.  To  be eligible for full funding under the Safe Drinking Water Act\u2019s State  Revolving Fund program, state regulatory agencies are required to have  strategies to assist drinking water utilities in acquiring and maintaining  the financial, managerial, and technical capacity to consistently provide  safe drinking water.  To assess capacity, states evaluate, among other  things, the condition of the utilities\u2019 infrastructure, the adequacy of  maintenance and capital improvement programs, and the adequacy of  revenues from user rates to cover the full cost of service.  Drinking  water utilities that are determined to lack capacity are not eligible for  financial assistance from the revolving loan fund.", "Capacity, management, operation, and maintenance requirements for  wastewater utilities. As part of its wastewater management program  under the Clean Water Act, EPA is considering regulations designed to  improve the performance of treatment facilities and protect the nation's  collection system infrastructure by enhancing and maintaining system  capacity (i.e., peak wastewater flows), reducing equipment and  operational failures, and extending the life of sewage treatment  equipment.  Among other things, wastewater utilities would be required  to prepare capacity, management, operation, and maintenance plans for  their operations.  The regulations would also require utilities to assess  the condition of their physical infrastructure and determine which  components need to be repaired or replaced.", "According to industry officials, implementing asset management is  consistent with meeting these requirements, and it enhances utilities\u2019  ability to comply with them.  For the requirements being considered for  wastewater utilities, for example, EPA has concluded that three basic  components are a facility inventory, a condition assessment, and asset  valuation\u2014all of which are important elements of asset management.   Consequently, the officials believe that it makes sense for EPA to place  more emphasis on the use of comprehensive asset management.", "Some water industry officials also told us that EPA should use the  relationship between asset management practices and the financial  reporting requirements under Governmental Accounting Standards Board  Statement 34 as a means of promoting the use of asset management.  Under  these new requirements, state and local governments are required to report  information about public infrastructure assets, including their drinking  water and wastewater facilities.  Specifically, the governments must either  report depreciation of their capital assets or implement an asset  management system.", "Given the infrastructure-related regulatory requirements and utilities\u2019 other  concerns about the condition of their assets, it is not surprising that 11 of  the 15 utilities we interviewed in depth saw a need for EPA to set up a  clearinghouse of information on comprehensive asset management.   Several utilities suggested that EPA establish a Web site that would serve as  a central repository of such information.  This site could provide drinking  water and wastewater utilities with direct and easy access to information  that would help them better manage their infrastructure.  For example, the  Web site could gather in one place the guidance manuals, tools, and  training materials developed by EPA or funded through research grants and  its training and technical assistance centers.  The site could also contain  links to asset management tools and guidance developed by domestic and  international water associations or other federal agencies, such as  Transportation\u2019s Office of Asset Management.  Several officials also  commented that it might be useful to have a site where drinking water and  wastewater utilities could share lessons learned from implementing asset  management.  Other utilities also supported the idea of a Web site, but were  uncertain about whether EPA was the appropriate place for it.

All but one of the proposals made having  the plans a condition of obtaining federal financial assistance.  The  proposals are consistent with what we have found to be the leading  practices in capital decision making.  As we reported in 1998, for example,  routinely assessing the condition of assets allows managers to evaluate the  capabilities of existing assets, plan for future replacements, and calculate  the cost of deferred maintenance.  However, according to key  stakeholders, implementing and enforcing requirements for asset  management could be problematic at this time.", "We asked water industry groups, associations of state regulators, and  individual utilities for their views on the proposed mandate of asset  management plans.  While most of them endorse asset management, they  raised several concerns about a statutory requirement.  For example:  Officials from water industry associations believe that drinking water  and wastewater utilities are already overburdened by existing  regulatory requirements and that many utilities lack the resources to  meet an additional requirement for developing asset management plans.", "The Association of State Drinking Water Administrators and the  Association of State and Interstate Water Pollution Control  Administrators both said that the states lack the resources to oversee  compliance and determine the adequacy of asset management plans.   Both the state and industry associations questioned the feasibility of  defining what would constitute an adequate plan.", "Officials at 12 of the 15 utilities where we conducted in-depth interviews  had serious reservations about a requirement.  For example, some utility  managers were concerned that EPA and the states would attempt to  standardize asset management and limit the flexibility that utilities need  to tailor asset management to their own circumstances.  Another  concern was that the states lack financial and technical resources and  thus are ill equipped to determine whether utilities\u2019 asset management  plans are adequate.  Finally, some utility officials also questioned the  burden that such a requirement would place on small utilities.", "Other utility officials either support a requirement or support the concept  of asset management but question whether mandating such a requirement  is an appropriate role for the federal government.  One of the officials  commented that whether or not asset management is required, utilities  should manage their infrastructure responsibly and charge rates sufficient  to cover the full cost of service.
