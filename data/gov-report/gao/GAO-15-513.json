Small businesses with at least one employee make up about 20 percent of the small business population, but produce about 71 percent of total small business income.", "Small businesses undertake a number of tax compliance-related activities that create burden. These activities can be grouped into general categories such as income tax activities, employer-related tax activities, and third-party information reporting activities. The tax compliance burden associated with these activities varies depending on the businesses' asset size, filing entity type (e.g., sole proprietor, partnership), number of employees, and industry type. According to IRS research, compliance burden increases with the size of businesses, whether measured in terms of assets, receipts, or employment. IRS also measured money and time burden as a portion of total business receipts, total assets, and burden per employee. Across all three measures, IRS results were consistent with the assumption that small businesses face significant fixed compliance costs combined with decreasing marginal costs as the business grows.", "IRS's decision-making framework for administering the tax system includes consideration of small business compliance burden. For example, IRS's strategic plan identifies reducing taxpayer burden as a strategic goal. IRS provided examples of how it works with internal and external stakeholders to reduce taxpayer burden on small businesses. For example, IRS collaborated with Treasury and external stakeholders to develop a simplified method for some small businesses to calculate a home office deduction, which was introduced in January 2013. Previously, businesses had to complete a complex property depreciation calculation.", "To improve tax compliance among small businesses, in 2012, IRS began piloting a program that compares payment data from payment settlement entities (such as credit card companies) with income reported by small businesses. IRS is testing ways to use payment data to detect underreporting of taxable income while minimizing small business taxpayer burden. While IRS's plans for evaluating the pilot include many key evaluation elements that GAO identified, other elements are missing. For example, IRS has defined high level pilot goals such as improving voluntary compliance and reducing the tax gap, but has not established measures for determining progress against these goals. Additionally, the plan did not adequately document evaluative questions, data collection needs, or the evaluative criteria necessary to assess whether pilot activities produced the intended results. Without these and other elements, IRS cannot ensure it is making evidence-based decisions about expanding and integrating pilot activities into broader small business compliance improvement efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To improve the evaluation of the payment card pilot, GAO recommends that IRS clearly define the stages of the pilot and establish measurable goals for determining when the pilot progresses from one stage to the next and develop an evaluation plan for the overall pilot that includes evaluation questions, complete descriptions of needed data, and evaluation criteria.

This tool is an Excel spreadsheet that  uses some of the data used in the more elaborate burden estimation  models discussed previously in this report. The tool provides staff with an  estimate of the number of taxpayers who would be affected by a specific  potential tax form change, as well as a rough indication of whether the  effect on compliance burden would be significant.

IRS has a website page that defines  taxpayer burden, provides links to submit ideas for burden reduction, and  outlines how IRS selects burden reduction initiatives. Another example of  IRS outreach to the small business community is the quarterly Small  Business Forum. IRS officials told us that they use the information from  these forums to inform their decision-making process for practices and  policies that affect small businesses. For example, IRS used feedback  from forum participants to refine the language used in burden surveys it  administers to the business community, and used what was learned to  inform its current burden models. Similar to internal stakeholders, external  stakeholders can make burden reduction suggestions using Form 13285- A, Reducing Tax Burden on America\u2019s Taxpayers (Referral Form for Use  by the Public), which allows them to describe the issue causing taxpayer  burden, the affected population, and the proposed solution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Small Business Representatives We Spoke with Identified Areas That Contribute to Compliance Burden", "paragraphs": ["We also interviewed small business representatives (external  stakeholders) who acknowledged IRS\u2019s external stakeholder outreach  efforts and how they have been effective in identifying opportunities to  reduce compliance burden.

These areas include issues related to IRS customer service,  filing requirements, lack of or delayed official guidance, and compliance  contacts. According to these representatives, when they call IRS, they  can have long wait times, be disconnected, or be directed to IRS staff  who are unable to provide the needed assistance. We have recently  reported on these issues as well.", "Further, several representatives shared the perspective that complex  filing requirements contribute to compliance burden. While small  businesses sometimes anticipate significant tax relief through tax credits  and deductions such as the small employer health care credit and  mileage and vehicle deductions, some small businesses may not be  claiming these credits due to the time, cost, and complexity associated  with claiming them. One concern we heard from small business  representatives was that after a tax practitioner expends resources to  compile the necessary documentation and calculate the credit, their client  (the small business) is ineligible to claim the credit. This could result in  additional taxpayer burden if tax preparers bill their clients for calculating  the credit when it is not claimed.", "In addition to facing burdens due to new and complex tax provisions,  representatives we spoke with also expressed concern over the  compliance burden associated with delayed or missing official guidance,  particularly for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act employer   Representatives also noted that deadlines for responding to  mandate.certain IRS notices can be difficult for small businesses when the  requested information is not readily available.

First, since  taxpayers know IRS is also receiving this income information, they are  more likely to include it on their tax return. Second, taxpayers have  another source of information they can use to help calculate or verify  business income.", "Payment card reporting also provides IRS with an information source it  can use to compare against the income reported by small business  taxpayers on their tax returns. As such, it can serve as a tool for  identifying noncompliant taxpayers, including those who failed to file a tax  return at all and those who underreported their income. This type of  comparison is a common IRS enforcement technique.

The Form 1099-K reports the gross amount of  payment card and third party network transactions made through a  payment settlement entity. This does not match the gross receipts line on  tax returns because Form 1099-K transactions may include items like  sales tax, gratuities, and cash back, all of which are not income.  Furthermore, tax return gross receipts can include cash and check  revenue, which is not captured on Form 1099-K.

There are no universally accepted  criteria for defining the small business population. OTA estimates address  some of the limitations of describing the small business population using  estimates based solely on the type of tax return that is filed by excluding  certain tax returns that may not be actual businesses. Not all tax returns  that report business income represent business entities with the principal  purpose to generate revenue or to engage in substantive business  activity. For example, some C corporations can serve as investment  vehicles that engage in little or no business activity. Further, partnerships  may be created to redistribute profits generated by another partnership  and may not generate income themselves. Filers of Form 1040,  Schedule C, may be independent contractors who may more closely  resemble employees than small businesses. Additionally, rental income  for some individuals may be incidental and not represent business  activities. Uncertainty within OTA estimates can come from: (1)  assumptions that were made to distinguish small businesses engaged in  substantial and substantive business activities from other entities that file  the same tax return; and (2) that the estimates are based on sampled  taxpayer data and subject to sampling error. Consequently, results that  are slightly higher or lower than those reported in this particular analysis  may be equally valid for describing the numbers of businesses in each  subgroup and the size of their incomes.

Using these estimates  may understate the number of small businesses where individual  taxpayers can own multiple small businesses. For example, individual  taxpayers can file multiple schedules to report business activity (profit,  loss, and supplemental income and loss from rental real estate activity)  from different lines of business. The number of schedules filed is greater  than the number of Form 1040 tax returns to which these schedules are  attached due to some returns having multiple schedules. The total  income estimates are the sum of all business income reported on tax  returns, including gross receipts, rents, dividends, capital gains, royalties,  and interest. Total income for Schedule E filers is limited to rental real  estate activity from Part I of that schedule to avoid attributing income from  pass-through entities or from royalties to these businesses.", "The OTA analysis had access to taxpayer data made available by IRS  Statistics of Income (SOI). Available data from SOI samples indicate that  the sampling errors for the total number of filers and total business  receipts for each type of taxpayer is less than +/- 6 percent at the 95  percent confidence level. Sampling errors of subpopulations may be  higher where tax returns have been sampled at lower rates. Data were  not available to determine sampling errors for the OTA total income  measure; however, business receipts make up such a substantial portion  of the OTA total income that we would not expect the sampling error to be  significantly greater for the OTA total income estimates than it is for the  SOI estimates for business receipts. For C corporations, S corporations,  partnerships, and sole proprietorships in 2010, the OTA number of filers  is within +/- 2 percent of SOI estimates of the number of filers. OTA total  income estimates are higher (within + 20 percent) of SOI total receipts  estimates for these filers because OTA\u2019s total income measure includes  types of income other than business receipts.", "The estimates used in this report are based on thousands of returns from  the 2010 SOI Individual, Corporate, and Partnership Studies.

The first test is a de  minimis activity test that requires taxpayers to report total income or total  deductions greater than $10,000, or that their sum be greater than  $15,000. The second test requires total deductions be greater than  $5,000, which indicates substantive business activity based on expenses  related to employees, inventories, and investment, among other things.  The application of these two tests results in the exclusion of 46.7 percent  of the 44.6 million total tax returns, but only 0.6 percent of the total $33.3  trillion in total income represented by these tax returns.", "Using this threshold of $10 million or less in both total income and total  deductions, small businesses represent 99 percent of tax returns  generating substantial income and engaged in substantive business  activities (and more than 95 percent of tax returns for each type of tax  return).
