First, the security environment and the continuing strength of the insurgency have made it difficult for the United States to transfer security responsibilities to Iraqi forces and progressively draw down U.S. forces. The security situation in Iraq has deteriorated since June 2003, with significant increases in attacks against Iraqi and coalition forces. In addition, the security situation has affected the cost and schedule of rebuilding efforts. The State Department has reported that security costs represent 16 to 22 percent of the overall costs of major infrastructure projects. Second, inadequate performance data and measures make it difficult to determine the overall progress and impact of U.S. reconstruction efforts. The United States has set broad goals for providing essential services in Iraq, but limited performance measures present challenges in determining the overall impact of U.S. projects. Third, the U.S. reconstruction program has encountered difficulties with Iraq's inability to sustain new and rehabilitated infrastructure projects and to address basic maintenance needs in the water, sanitation, and electricity sectors. U.S. agencies are working to develop better performance data and plans for sustaining rehabilitated infrastructure. As the new Iraqi government forms, it must plan to secure the financial resources it will need to continue the reconstruction and stabilization efforts begun by the United States and international community. Iraq will likely need more than the $56 billion that the World Bank, United Nations, and CPA estimated it would require for reconstruction and stabilization efforts from 2004 to 2007. More severely degraded infrastructure, post-2003 conflict looting and sabotage, and additional security costs have added to the country's basic reconstruction needs. However, it is unclear how Iraq will finance these additional requirements. While the United States has borne the primary financial responsibility for rebuilding and stabilizing Iraq, its commitments are largely obligated and future commitments are not finalized. Further, U.S. appropriations were never intended to meet all Iraqi needs. In addition, international donors have mostly committed loans that the government of Iraq is just beginning to tap. Iraq's ability to financially contribute to its own rebuilding and stabilization efforts will depend on the new government's efforts to increase revenues obtained from crude oil exports, reduce energy and food subsidies, control government operating expenses, provide for a growing security force, and repay $84 billion in external debt and war reparations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss U.S. efforts to rebuild and  stabilize Iraq.

In May 2003, the CPA  dissolved the military organizations of the former regime and began the  process of creating or reestablishing new Iraqi security forces, including  the police and a new Iraqi army. Over time, multinational force  commanders assumed responsibility for recruiting and training some Iraqi  defense and police forces in their areas of responsibility. In May 2004, the  President issued a National Security Presidential Directive, which stated  that, after the transition of power to the Iraqi government, the Department  of State (State), through its ambassador to Iraq, would be responsible for  all U.S. activities in Iraq except for security and military operations. U.S.  activities relating to security and military operations would be the  responsibility of the Department of Defense (DOD). The Presidential  Directive required the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) to direct all  U.S. government efforts to organize, equip, and train Iraqi security forces.  The Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq, which operates  under Multi-National Force-Iraq (MNF-I), now leads coalition efforts to  train, equip, and organize Iraqi security forces.", "Other U.S. government agencies also play significant roles in the  reconstruction effort. The U.S. Agency for International Development  (USAID) is responsible for projects to restore Iraq\u2019s infrastructure, support  healthcare and education initiatives, expand economic opportunities for  Iraqis, and foster improved governance. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  provides engineering and technical services to USAID, State, and military  forces in Iraq. In December 2005, the responsibilities of the Project  Contracting Office (PCO), a temporary organization responsible for  program, project, asset, and financial management of construction and  nonconstruction activities, were merged with those of the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers Gulf Region Division.", "On June 28, 2004, the CPA transferred power to an interim sovereign Iraqi  government, the CPA was officially dissolved, and Iraq\u2019s transitional  period began. Under Iraq\u2019s transitional law, the transitional period  included the completion of a draft constitution in October 2005 and two  subsequent elections\u2014a referendum on the constitution and an election  for a permanent government. The Iraqi people approved the constitution  on October 15, 2005, and voted for representatives to the Iraq Council of  Representatives on December 15, 2005. As of February 3, 2006, the  Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq had not certified the election  results for representatives.", "Once certified, the representatives are to form a permanent government.  According to U.S. officials and Iraqi constitutional experts, the new Iraqi  government is likely to confront the same issues it confronted prior to the  referendum\u2014the power of the central government, control of Iraq\u2019s  natural resources, and the application of Islamic law. According to U.S.  officials, once the Iraqi legislature commences work, it will form a  committee that has 4 months to recommend amendments to the  constitution.

As we reported in March 2005, the insurgency in Iraq\u2014 particularly the Sunni insurgency\u2014grew in complexity, intensity, and  lethality from June 2003 through early 2005. According to a February 2006  testimony by the Director of National Intelligence, insurgents are using  increasingly lethal improvised explosive devices and continue to adapt to  coalition countermeasures.", "As shown in figure 1, enemy-initiated attacks against the coalition, its Iraqi  partners, and infrastructure increased in number over time. The highest  peak occurred during October 2005, around the time of Ramadan and the  October referendum on Iraq\u2019s constitution. This followed earlier peaks in  August and November 2004 and January 2005. According to a senior U.S.  military officer, attack levels ebb and flow as the various insurgent  groups\u2014almost all of which are an intrinsic part of Iraq\u2019s population\u2014 rearm and attack again.", "As the administration has reported, insurgents share the goal of expelling  the coalition from Iraq and destabilizing the Iraqi government to pursue  their individual and, at times, conflicting goals. Iraqi Sunnis make up the  largest portion of the insurgency and present the most significant threat to  stability in Iraq. In February 2006, the Director of National Intelligence  reported that the Iraqi Sunnis\u2019 disaffection is likely to remain high in 2006,  even if a broad, inclusive national government emerges. These insurgents  continue to demonstrate the ability to recruit, supply, and attack coalition  and Iraqi security forces. Their leaders continue to exploit Islamic themes,  nationalism, and personal grievances to fuel opposition to the government  and recruit more fighters. According to the Director, the most extreme  Sunni jihadists, such as al-Qaeda in Iraq, will remain unreconciled and  continue to attack Iraqi and coalition forces. The remainder of the  insurgency consists of radical Shia groups, some of whom are supported  by Iran, violent extremists, criminals, and, to a lesser degree, foreign  fighters. According to the Director of National Intelligence, Iran provides  guidance and training to select Iraqi Shia political groups and weapons and  training to Shia militant groups to enable anticoalition attacks. Iran also  has contributed to the increasing lethality of anticoalition attacks by  enabling Shia militants to build improvised explosive devices with  explosively formed projectiles, similar to those developed by Iran and  Lebanese Hizballah.", "The continuing strength of the insurgency has made it difficult for the  multinational force to develop effective and loyal Iraqi security forces,  transfer security responsibilities to them, and progressively draw down  U.S. forces in Iraq. The Secretary of Defense and MNF-I recently reported  progress in developing Iraqi security forces, saying that these forces  continue to grow in number, take on more responsibilities, and increase  their lead in counterinsurgency operations in some parts of Iraq. For  example, in December 2005 and January 2006, MNF-I reported that Iraqi  army battalions and brigades had assumed control of battle space in parts  of Ninewa, Qadisiyah, Babil, and Wasit provinces. According to the  Director for National Intelligence, Iraqi security forces are taking on more- demanding missions, making incremental progress toward operational  independence, and becoming more capable of providing security. In the  meantime, coalition forces continue to support and assist the majority of  Iraqi security forces as they develop the capability to operate  independently.", "However, recent reports have recognized limitations in the effectiveness of  Iraqi security forces. For example, DOD\u2019s October 2005 report notes that  Iraqi forces will not be able to operate independently for some time  because they need logistical capabilities, ministry capacity, and command  and control and intelligence structures. In the November 2005 National  Strategy for Victory in Iraq, the administration cited a number of  challenges to developing effective Iraqi security forces, including the need  to guard against infiltration by elements whose first loyalties are to  institutions other than the Iraqi government and to address the militias and  armed groups that are outside the formal security sector and government  control. Moreover, according to the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s  February 2006 report, Iraqi security forces are experiencing difficulty in  managing ethnic and sectarian divisions among their units and personnel.  GAO\u2019s classified report on Iraq\u2019s security situation provided further  information and analysis on the challenges to developing Iraqi security  forces and the conditions for the phased drawdown of U.S. and other  coalition forces."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Security Situation and Management Issues Have Affected Rebuilding Efforts", "paragraphs": ["The security situation in Iraq has affected the cost and schedule of  reconstruction efforts. Security conditions have, in part, led to project  delays and increased costs for security services. Although it is difficult to  quantify the costs and delays resulting from poor security conditions, both  agency and contractor officials acknowledged that security costs have  diverted a considerable amount of reconstruction resources and have led  to canceling or reducing the scope of some reconstruction projects. For  example, in March 2005, USAID cancelled two task orders related to  power generation that totaled nearly $15 million to help pay for the  increased security costs incurred at another power generation project in  southern Baghdad. In another example, work was suspended at a sewer  repair project in central Iraq for 4 months in 2004 due to security  concerns. In January 2006, State reported that direct and indirect security  costs represent 16 to 22 percent of the overall cost of major infrastructure  reconstruction projects.", "In addition, the security environment in Iraq has led to severe restrictions  on the movement of civilian staff around the country and reductions of a  U.S. presence at reconstruction sites, according to U.S. agency officials  and contractors. For example, the Project Contracting Office reported in  February 2006, the number of attacks on convoys and casualties had  increased from 20 convoys attacked and 11 casualties in October 2005 to  33 convoys attacked and 34 casualties in January 2006. In another  example, work at a wastewater plant in central Iraq was halted for  approximately 2 months in early 2005 because insurgent threats drove  away subcontractors and made the work too hazardous to perform. In the  assistance provided to support the electoral process, U.S.-funded grantees  and contractors also faced security restrictions that hampered their  movements and limited the scope of their work. For example, IFES was  not able to send its advisors to most of the governorate-level elections  administration offices, which hampered training and operations at those  facilities leading up to Iraq\u2019s Election Day on January 30, 2005.", "While poor security conditions have slowed reconstruction and increased  costs, a variety of management challenges also have adversely affected the  implementation of the U.S. reconstruction program. In September 2005,  we reported that management challenges such as low initial cost estimates  and delays in funding and awarding task orders have led to the reduced  scope of the water and sanitation program and delays in starting projects.  In addition, U.S. agency and contractor officials have cited difficulties in  initially defining project scope, schedule, and cost, as well as concerns  with project execution, as further impeding progress and increasing  program costs. These difficulties include lack of agreement among U.S.  agencies, contractors, and Iraqi authorities; high staff turnover; an  inflationary environment that makes it difficult to submit accurate pricing;  unanticipated project site conditions; and uncertain ownership of project  sites.", "Our ongoing work on Iraq\u2019s energy sectors and the management of design- build contracts will provide additional information on the issues that have  affected the pace and costs of reconstruction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Actions to Integrate Military and Civilian Rebuilding and Stabilization Efforts", "paragraphs": ["The Administration has taken steps to develop a more comprehensive,  integrated approach to combating the insurgency and stabilizing Iraq. The  National Strategy for Victory in Iraq lays out an integrated political,  military, and economic strategy that goes beyond offensive military  operations and the development of Iraqi security forces in combating the  insurgency. Specifically, it calls for cooperation with and support for local  governmental institutions, the prompt dispersal of aid for quick and visible  reconstruction, and central government authorities who pay attention to  local needs.", "Toward that end, U.S. agencies are developing tools for integrating  political, economic, and security activities in the field. For example,  USAID is developing the Focused Stabilization Strategic City Initiative that  will fund social and economic stabilization activities in communities  within 10 strategic cities. The program is intended to jump-start the  development of effective local government service delivery by directing  local energies from insurgency activities toward productive economic and  social opportunities. The U.S. embassy in Baghdad and MNF-I are also  developing provincial assistance teams as a component of an integrated  counterinsurgency strategy. These teams would consist of coalition  military and civilian personnel who would assist Iraq\u2019s provincial  governments with (1) developing a transparent and sustained capability to  govern; (2) promoting increased security, rule of law, and political and  economic development; and (3) providing the provincial administration  necessary to meet the basic needs of the population.

However, the  data available do not indicate the adequacy of equipment levels, staffing  levels, or quality of care provided to the Iraqi population. Monitoring the  staffing, training, and equipment levels at health facilities may help gauge  the effectiveness of the U.S. reconstruction program and its impact on the  Iraqi people.", "In the electricity sector, U.S. agencies have primarily reported on  generation measures such as levels of added or restored generation  capacity and daily power generation of electricity; numbers of projects  completed; and average daily hours of power.

In September 2005, we  recommended that the Secretary of State address the issue of  sustainability in the water and sanitation sector. State agreed with our  recommendation and stated that it is currently working with the Iraqi  government to assess the additional resources needed to operate and  maintain water and sanitation facilities that have been constructed or  repaired by the United States.", "In the electricity sector, the Iraqis\u2019 capacity to operate and maintain the  power plant infrastructure and equipment provided by the United States  remains a challenge at both the plant and ministry levels. As a result, the  infrastructure and equipment remain at risk of damage following their  transfer to the Iraqis. In our interviews with Iraqi power plant officials  from 13 locations throughout Iraq, the officials stated that their training  did not adequately prepare them to operate and maintain the new U.S.- provided gas turbine engines. Due to limited access to natural gas, some  Iraqi power plants are using low-grade oil to fuel their natural gas  combustion engines. The use of oil-based fuels, without adequate  equipment modification and fuel treatment, decreases the power output of  the turbines by up to 50 percent, requires three times more maintenance,  and could result in equipment failure and damage that significantly  reduces the life of the equipment, according to U.S. and Iraqi power plant  officials.

About $10 billion, or 70 percent, of the $13.6 billion pledged in  support of Iraq reconstruction is in the form of loans, primarily from the  World Bank, the IMF, and Japan. In September 2004, the IMF provided a  $436 million emergency post-conflict assistance loan to facilitate Iraqi debt  relief, and in December 2005, Iraq secured a $685 million Stand-By  Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF. On November 29, 2005, the World Bank  approved a $100 million loan within a $500 million program for  concessional international development assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Iraq Must Address Budget Constraints to Contribute to Future Rebuilding and Stabilization Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Iraq\u2019s fiscal ability to contribute to its own rebuilding is constrained by the  amount of revenues obtained from crude oil exports, continuing subsidies  for food and energy, growing costs for government salaries and pensions,  increased demands for an expanding security force, and war reparations  and external debt.", "Crude oil exports account for nearly 90 percent of the Iraqi government  revenues in 2006, according to the IMF. Largely supporting Iraq\u2019s  government operations and subsidies, crude oil export revenues are  dependent upon export levels and market price. The Iraqi 2006 budget has  projected that Iraq\u2019s crude oil export revenues will grow at an annual  growth rate of 17 percent per year (based on an average production level  of 2 million bpd in 2005 to 3.6 million bpd in 2010), estimating an average  market price of about $46 per barrel. Oil exports are projected to increase  from 1.4 million bpd in 2005 to 1.7 million bpd in 2006, according to the  IMF. Iraq\u2019s current crude oil export capacity is theoretically as high as 2.5  million bpd, according to the Energy Information Administration at the  Department of Energy. However, Iraq\u2019s crude oil export levels have  averaged 1.4 million bpd as of December 2005, in part due to attacks on  the energy infrastructure and pipelines. In January 2006, crude oil export  levels fell to an average of about 1.1 million bpd.", "Further, a combination of insurgent attacks on crude oil and product  pipelines, dilapidated infrastructure, and poor operations and maintenance  have hindered domestic refining and have required Iraq to import  significant portions of liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, kerosene, and  diesel. According to State, the Iraqi Oil Ministry estimates that the current  average import cost of fuels is roughly $500 million each month.", "Current government subsidies constrain opportunities for growth and  investment and have kept prices for food, oil, and electricity low. Before  the war, at least 60 percent of Iraqis depended on monthly rations\u2014known  as the public distribution system (PDS)\u2014provided by the UN Oil for Food  program to meet household needs. The PDS continues to provide food  subsidies to Iraqis. In addition, Iraqis pay below-market prices for refined  fuels and, in the absence of effective meters, for electricity and water. Low  prices have encouraged over-consumption and have fueled smuggling to  neighboring countries. Food and energy subsidies account for about 18  percent of Iraq\u2019s projected gross domestic product (GDP) for 2006.", "As part of its Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF, Iraq plans to reduce the  government subsidy of petroleum products, which would free up oil  revenues to fund additional needs and reduce smuggling. According to the  IMF, by the end of 2006, the Iraqi government plans to complete a series of  adjustments to bring fuel prices closer to those of other Gulf countries.  However, it is unclear whether the Iraqi government will have the political  commitment to continue to raise fuel prices.", "Generous wage and pension benefits have added to budgetary pressures.  Partly due to increases in these benefits, the Iraqi government\u2019s operating  expenditures are projected to increase by over 24 percent from 2005 to  2006, according to the IMF. As a result, wages and pensions constitute  about 21 percent of projected GDP for 2006. The IMF noted that it is  important for the government to keep non-defense wages and pensions  under firm control to contain the growth of civil service wages. As a first  step, the Iraqi government plans to complete a census of all public service  employees by June 2006.", "Iraq plans to spend more resources on its own defense. Iraq\u2019s security- related spending is currently projected to be about $5.3 billion in 2006,  growing from 7 to about 13 percent of projected GDP. The amount reflects  rising costs of security and the transfer of security responsibilities from  the United States to Iraq.", "The Iraqi government also owes over $84 billion to victims of its invasion  of Kuwait and international creditors. As of December 2005, Iraq owed  about $33 billion in unpaid awards resulting from its invasion and  occupation of Kuwait. As directed by the UN, Iraq currently deposits 5  percent of its oil proceeds into a UN compensation fund. Final payment  of these awards could extend through 2020 depending on the growth of  Iraq\u2019s oil proceeds. In addition, the IMF estimated that Iraq\u2019s external debt  was about $51 billion at the end of 2005."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["For the past 2\u00bd years, the United States has provided $30 billion with the  intent of developing capable Iraqi security forces, rebuilding a looted and  worn infrastructure, and supporting democratic elections. However, the  United States has confronted a lethal insurgency that has taken many lives  and made rebuilding Iraq a costly and challenging endeavor. It is unclear  when Iraqi security forces will be able to operate independently, thereby  enabling the United States to reduce its military presence.", "Similarly, it is unclear how U.S. efforts are helping Iraq obtain clean water,  reliable electricity, or competent health care. Measuring the outcomes of  U.S. efforts is important to ensure that the U.S. dollars spent are making a  difference in the daily lives of the Iraqi people. In addition, the United  States must ensure that the billions of dollars it has already invested in  Iraq\u2019s infrastructure are not wasted. The Iraqis need additional training  and preparation to operate and maintain the power plants, water and  sewage treatment facilities, and health care centers the United States has  rebuilt or restored. In response to our reports, State has begun to develop  metrics for measuring progress and plans for sustaining the U.S.-built  infrastructure. The administration\u2019s next budget will reveal its level of  commitment to these challenges.", "But the challenges are not exclusively those of the United States. The  Iraqis face the challenge of forming a government that has the support of  all ethnic and religious groups. They also face the challenge of addressing  those constitutional issues left unresolved from the October referendum\u2014 power of the central government, control of Iraq\u2019s natural resources, and  the application of Islamic law. The new government also faces the equally  difficult challenges of reducing subsidies, controlling public salaries and  pensions, and sustaining the growing number of security forces. This will  not be easy, but it is necessary for the Iraqi government to begin to  contribute to its own rebuilding and stabilization efforts and to encourage  investment by the international community and private sector.", "We continue to review U.S. efforts to train and equip Iraqi security forces,  develop the oil and electricity sectors, reduce corruption, and enhance the  capacity of Iraqi ministries. Specifically, we will examine efforts to  stabilize Iraq and develop its security forces, including the challenge of  ensuring that Iraq can independently fund, sustain, and support its new  security forces; assess issues related to the development of Iraq\u2019s energy  sector, including the sectors\u2019 needs as well as challenges such as  corruption; and examine capacity-building efforts in the Iraqi ministries.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
