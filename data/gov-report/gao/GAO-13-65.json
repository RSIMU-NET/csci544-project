Strategic workforce planning focuses on developing long-term strategies for acquiring, developing, and retaining an organization's total workforce, including federal staff and contractors, to meet the needs of the future. GAO has previously identified workforce-related challenges faced by DHS components. In light of these ongoing challenges, GAO was asked to review DHS's strategic workforce planning efforts. This report assesses whether DHS has incorporated strategic workforce planning leading principles into the department's management of strategic workforce planning efforts. GAO reviewed DHS strategies and guidance related to strategic workforce planning, compared them with leading principles identified in previous GAO work, and discussed ongoing strategic workforce planning efforts with officials from the seven components selected because they constitute the majority of DHS personnel."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has taken some relatively recent steps to enhance strategic workforce planning across the department. These steps are generally consistent with leading principles, but the department has not yet implemented an effective oversight approach for monitoring and evaluating components' progress. Specifically, recent steps DHS has taken to develop and implement strategic workforce planning efforts are consistent with the leading principles GAO has reported that include involving management and stakeholders, identifying skills and competencies, developing strategies to fill gaps, and building capability through training. For example, the department demonstrated stakeholder involvement by including component-level stakeholders in the development of the DHS Workforce Strategy. Though DHS has taken steps to implement strategic workforce planning, recent internal audits, as well as GAO's previous work, identified challenges related to workforce planning at the component level that could impair the continued implementation of recently initiated strategic workforce planning efforts. For example, GAO reported in July 2009 that the Federal Protective Service's (FPS) workforce planning was limited because FPS headquarters did not collect data on its workforce's knowledge, skills, and abilities and subsequently could not determine optimal staffing levels or determine how to modify its workforce planning strategies accordingly, amongst others. GAO recommended that FPS take steps to address these issues. FPS officials agreed with our recommendations, and in June 2010 drafted a staffing plan consistent with our recommendation, but as of November 2012, FPS has not gained approval of its staffing plan.", "Although DHS began taking positive steps for managing strategic workforce planning in 2011, DHS officials have not yet taken steps to implement an effective oversight approach for monitoring and evaluating components' progress in implementing strategic workforce planning. According to this principle, agencies should measure the effectiveness of the workforce plan and help ensure that the strategies work as intended by monitoring and evaluating the contributions workforce plans make to strategic results. To do this, agencies should determine how well the agency implemented its workforce plan and the contribution that its implementation made toward achieving programmatic goals. However, the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) has developed limited performance measures to provide a basis for monitoring and evaluating departmentwide strategic workforce planning efforts. GAO's analysis identified performance measures that reported on only 2 of the 15 elements in DHS's strategic workforce planning model. OCHCO relies on an informal process to evaluate component workforce planning, though processes exist that it could leverage to provide oversight. For example, OCHCO performs internal audits and requires components to develop annual operations plans to implement the department's workforce strategy. However, the results of the audits are not used to evaluate components' workforce planning. Without (1) performance measures that more comprehensively address DHS's strategic workforce planning process, and (2) policies and procedures for ensuring monitoring and evaluation of departmentwide workforce planning, DHS's OCHCO does not have reasonable assurance that such efforts will be institutionalized. Further, the department will not be able to produce departmentwide evidence of component alignment with DHS strategic workforce planning guidance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that, among other actions, the Secretary of Homeland Security (1) identify and document additional performance measures to assess workforce planning efforts and (2) document policies and procedures regarding the use of internal audit results.

For example, we reported in December 2011, as a  result of the balanced workforce efforts, the Transportation Security  Administration (TSA) hired 12 individuals in watch officer support  positions, which involve collecting information and monitoring domestic  events that affect air passenger security, positions that had previously  been filled by contractors. Program officials said they plan to convert the  remaining contractor positions to positions for federal employees in the  near future.

We reported in  March 2012 that DHS has demonstrated top leadership commitment  by identifying roles and responsibilities at the departmental level for its  key management initiatives, including those in the human capital  management area, it included in the December 2011 Integrated  Strategy for High Risk Management. At the component level,  BWPMO began efforts in 2011 to obtain input from component  stakeholders and communicated information departmentwide via  councils and committees, such as the Workforce Planning Council,  which meets monthly. In addition, from June through October 2011,  BWPMO regularly held committee meetings of its Workforce  Indicators Working Group to incorporate component input into new  strategic workforce planning initiatives, such as providing common  definition of terms so that human capital data, such as rates of  attrition, reported by components are uniform. DHS also included  component input in the development of the DHS Workforce Strategy  Fiscal Years 2011-2016. Internal audits found evidence that  components are taking steps to involve top managers and  stakeholders. For example, internal audits of CBP in December 2011  found that agency workforce planning officials meet with their  program-level counterparts at least three times a year to discuss  changes within their workforce, develop strategies to retain the  workforce, and to provide updated workforce analysis statistics.", "Identifying critical skills and competencies: Our work has shown  that in order to effectively meet department challenges, agencies must  identify the workforce skills and competencies that are critical to  achieving strategic goals and identify how the agency will obtain these  requirements. OCHCO began working with components in 2011 to  help identify critical skills and competencies needed to achieve their  current and future workforce needs to achieve the department\u2019s  missions. OCHCO provided components guidance for identifying  critical skills and competencies, among other things, and DHS also  developed a common framework for DHS competencies to be used  across all components through DHS\u2019s Competency Working Group.  Specifically, this framework includes a standard set of  departmentwide competencies that would apply to all staff, which  would be augmented by two further sets of competencies within each  component: one set specific to all occupations and the other set  specific to individual jobs. OCHCO also worked directly with  components to identify MCOs. Internal audits found evidence that  components are taking steps to identify critical skills and  competencies, as well as the gaps that exist. For example, auditors  found in their March 2010 audit that TSA identified mission-critical  positions throughout its organization and that information related to  the competencies necessary to fill mission-critical positions was  housed in a tool utilized as part of a midlevel leadership development  program.", "Developing strategies for addressing gaps: Our work on strategic  workforce planning principles indicates that once an agency identifies  the critical skills and competencies needed, strategies should be  developed to address gaps in the number, skills and competencies,  and deployment of the workforce needed for the future. Developing  such strategies creates a road map for an agency to use to move from  the current to the future workforce needed to achieve program goals.  In September 2011, OCHCO began participating in the  governmentwide Executive Steering Committee and Integrated  Product Team as part of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)  and Department of Defense (DOD)-led Strategic Human Capital High  Risk Initiative to develop strategies for addressing workforce skill  gaps. According to BWPMO officials, its efforts on this  governmentwide initiative supplemented the gap analysis detailed in  the DHS Workforce Planning Guide, which BWMPO officials planned  to update with additional tools and templates developed based on  information from the governmentwide initiative. BWPMO officials  reported they plan to complete the update by the end of November  2012. In addition, DHS required components to develop an initial  assessment strategy for developing plans to address the skill gaps by  the end of fiscal year 2012, and the department reported in June 2012  that 100 percent of its components had developed an initial  assessment strategy. For example, officials at the U.S. Secret Service  (USSS) said they developed a series of action plans to ensure full  staffing of the Uniformed Division officer position, a position  designated as a high-risk MCO through efforts related to the work of  the governmentwide high-risk initiative. This included the identification  and analysis of staffing gaps and the development of action plans to  close them.", "Building workforce planning capability: Our work on strategic  workforce planning principles indicates that agencies should build the  capability needed to address administrative, education, and other  requirements important to supporting the workforce strategy. BWPMO  leadership hosted the May 2011 Strategic Workforce Planning  Summit, which involved human capital officials from each component.  The summit provided training for component officials on strategic  workforce planning to identify workforce indicators, competency and  skill gaps, and revise MCOs. The training also included building  components\u2019 planning capability to address current and future  workforce needs using alternative futures scenarios. Officials at FEMA  credited the summit with providing them the training they needed to  better define their MCOs. In addition, representatives from each of the  seven major components we interviewed said that OCHCO staff  provided multiple opportunities for building their workforce planning  capability through shared knowledge, including leading principles,  identifying challenges and solutions, and general sharing of  information between DHS and the components and also among the  components. OCHCO has also provided resources for components to  work directly with each other regarding sharing workforce leading  principles. For example, BWPMO manages a shared website that  allows officials at each component to share information and utilize  resources, such as presentations or leading principles shared by other  components. Internal audits found evidence that components are  also building workforce planning capability. For example, in March  2012, internal auditors reported that Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE) had established communities of practice  composed of eight offices tasked with addressing the strategic  direction of human capital and improving communications for  accuracy and timeliness among the ICE human capital leaders.", "While DHS has taken relatively recent steps, since January 2011, to  implement strategic workforce planning, recent internal audits, as well as  our previous work, identified challenges related to workforce planning at  the component level.

Additionally, HCPP uses internal audits in its  evaluation of component-level human capital-related efforts, but BWPMO  has not used the results of these audits to evaluate the implementation of  the components\u2019 workforce planning efforts.", "The department\u2019s Workforce Strategy requires components to submit  annual operational plans to OCHCO that describe, among other things,  how their strategic workforce planning supports the strategy\u2019s goals and  objectives. Specifically, the annual operational plans are the method by  which components report to the Secretary of Homeland Security and the  CHCO on component-specific actions in support of the department\u2019s  goals, objectives, and associated performance measures identified in the  Workforce Strategy. OCHCO is responsible for overseeing the  implementation of the Workforce Strategy and also for providing oversight  and feedback on the components\u2019 annual operational plans, among other  things. In order for these annual plans to be an effective tool for  component leadership to ensure that their workforce planning efforts are  aligned to the department\u2019s Workforce Strategy, component officials need  departmental feedback in time to make any corrections or revisions so  they can fully develop the operational plans prior to the start of the fiscal  year and then implement them once the fiscal year begins.", "However, OCHCO has not provided feedback on operational plans in  time for the components to revise and implement their plans before the  start of the fiscal year. Specifically, when we spoke with component  officials from April through May 2012, they said they had previously  provided their fiscal year 2012 operational plans to OCHCO for review,  but at that time had not yet received feedback on these plans. An official  from the OCHCO Chief of Staff\u2019s office, the office responsible for  overseeing the implementation of the workforce strategy and for providing  feedback on the components operational plans, said that as of September  2012, nearly 1 year after the beginning of fiscal year 2012, the  components\u2019 had not received feedback on their operational plans for  fiscal year 2012, and subsequently the department had not begun  working with components to develop their plans for fiscal year 2013.  Further, fiscal year 2013 had already begun yet OCHCO had not  completed the process for finalizing the fiscal year 2012\u2019s plans. This  official agreed that components\u2019 operational plans should be finalized and  in place prior to the start of the fiscal year for which they are intended in  order to guide components\u2019 operations for the coming year.", "When we asked the official from the OCHCO Chief of Staff\u2019s office  whether the component operational plans were an effective tool for the  department to use in its evaluation of component-level workforce  planning, the official acknowledged that the plans do not serve as an  effective management tool for OCHCO to evaluate component workforce  strategy-related activities, including workforce planning. The plans do not  serve as an effective management tool because there have been delays  in preparing, reviewing, and approving component annual operational  plans, as well as in providing feedback. Such feedback serves as the  basis for revising and finalizing the plans, as well as providing baseline  information to develop the following year\u2019s plans. OCHCO officials agreed  that they have not provided components with feedback regarding their  operational plans in a timely manner, which has delayed the  implementation of the fiscal year 2012 plans as well as the development  of fiscal year 2013 plans. OCHCO officials agreed these plans should  have been developed and implemented prior to the start of the fiscal year  for which they are to be used to evaluate the implementation of the DHS  Workforce Strategy. As a result, without timely feedback and  implementation, OCHCO is unable to use the annual operational plans to  determine the effectiveness of components\u2019 efforts to implement the  department\u2019s workforce strategy.", "In addition to OCHCO\u2019s requirement that components report annually on  the status of their implementation of workforce planning efforts, HCPP  conducts internal audits called Human Resources Operations Audits on  each operational component every 3 years. Our analysis determined  that 11 out of 44 total outcomes in the HROAs related to workforce  planning. Within the first section of the HROA, strategic alignment, there  are three outcomes that explicitly assess components\u2019 workforce planning  efforts. For example, one outcome assesses whether workforce planning  is strategically approached. In addition to the three outcomes explicitly  identified in the audits as related to workforce planning, our analysis  determined there are an additional eight outcomes within the audits that  relate to the strategic workforce planning leading principles our previous  work has identified. For example, one outcome DHS components are  assessed against is whether they have documented and communicated  human capital accountability policies, processes, measures, and results  throughout their organization. This outcome directly relates to the  strategic workforce planning leading principle regarding monitoring and  evaluating.", "The most recently completed audits conducted on the seven operational  components included in our review revealed that five of the seven  components had not taken needed steps to ensure that human capital  accountability policies, processes, measures, and results are documented  and communicated throughout the organization. Additionally, four  components had not fully incorporated systems to continually assess and  improve human capital planning and investment as well as their impact on  mission accomplishment. For example, in their most recent HROAs, CBP  and TSA met all four outcomes pertaining to accountability; however,  audits of the other five components included recommendations to develop  accountability programs. For example, in March 2012 auditors  recommended that ICE officials develop a formalized accountability  program that describes a system for measuring accountability goals and  compliance with applicable legal authorities and continue developing  standardized policies and procedures that will be used to hold program  areas accountable. Similarly, USCIS\u2019s most recent audit report in August 2009 recommended that USCIS officials develop and implement a  human capital accountability plan.", "Further, HCPP and BWPMO, the two offices in OCHCO responsible for  providing oversight of components\u2019 workforce planning, have not  coordinated their efforts. Specifically, within OCHCO, HCPP uses the  HROAs to evaluate components\u2019 compliance with certain statues and  regulations, among other things, while BWPMO, the OCHCO office  primarily responsible for departmentwide workforce planning, had no  knowledge that HROAs included workforce planning-related required  actions and recommendations.", "According to the OCHCO Human Resources Audit Manual, the guide  used by audit teams to perform HROAs on the components, the  component is responsible for preparing an action plan for the accepted  required actions and recommendations. This plan must be submitted to  the audit team lead for review and approval and must include a timeline of  activities to fulfill each action and must identify the documentation that will  be provided to the audit team lead upon completion of each item.", "When we asked OCHCO officials how the required action plans were  evaluated, they said that as part of their follow-up and tracking of  component HROA responses, HCPP reviews component action plans  and closes out audit reports. This process includes issuing the final audit  results to the component and, in response, the component develops an  action plan. Once HCPP receives the required component action plan,  HCPP staff evaluates the plan to determine its sufficiency in addressing  the required actions from the audits and adds notes to the report to  indicate their final determination or provide further direction to the  component. Finally, HCPP issues a close out report to the component  documenting the status of the findings.", "Despite BWPMO\u2019s responsibility for departmentwide workforce planning,  officials in that office did not use the workforce planning-related portions  of the HCPP HROAs to evaluate component workforce planning. When  we asked BWPMO officials how they used the results of these audits for  departmental management and oversight, they said that they were not  aware that the HROAs included recommendations or required  components to take certain actions pertaining to workforce planning.  Thus, these officials said that they had not integrated the results of these  audits into their strategic workforce planning efforts. Because HCPP  performs the human resources operational audits and BWPMO had not  used the results to assess compliance, the BWPMO officials relied on  informal discussions with component officials to gather information on the  status of component strategic workforce planning efforts.", "As a result of our inquiries, BWPMO officials said they planned to  coordinate with HCPP in the future to ensure that workforce planning  analysis conducted during the audits is consistent with BWPMO  workforce planning efforts, and that the results of required actions and  recommendations from the final audit reports related to workforce  planning are evaluated across components. However, BWPMO had no  documented plans regarding using these audits to evaluate components\u2019  implementation of strategic workforce planning efforts. Though BWPMO  and HCPP officials stated they planned to revise the Human Resources  Audit Manual to incorporate changes, as of November 2012, BWPMO  was unable to provide specific information regarding how these audits  would be used in the future. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government calls for agencies to have appropriate documentation of  transactions and internal controls, which should appear in management  directives, administrative policies, or operating manuals. Moreover, the  standards state that such policies and procedures should provide  reasonable assurance that ongoing monitoring and evaluation is  institutionalized in the agency\u2019s operations. Without policies and  procedures in place to ensure that monitoring and evaluation is  institutionalized, OCHCO will continue to have limited oversight of the  implementation of strategic workforce planning at the component level.", "In addition, although components are required to develop annual  operational plans to report on their efforts to implement the department\u2019s  workforce strategy and the HROAs are performed on components to  assess the extent to which they are contributing to mission  accomplishment, among other things, the two efforts are not linked. In  conjunction with additional strategic workforce planning performance  measures, incorporating the results of human resources operations  audits, including the status of addressing required actions and  recommendations, in the components\u2019 annual operational plans could  provide OCHCO with a greater ability to oversee departmentwide  strategic workforce planning. Moreover, monitoring and evaluating the  results of components\u2019 implementation of OCHCO\u2019s strategic workforce  planning policies and procedures is essential to ensure that issues and  concerns identified in prior internal audits are consistently and  comprehensively resolved and to provide a means of assessing the  impact of OCHCO\u2019s recent initiatives."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["DHS\u2019s ability to successfully meet its multiple, diverse, and essential  missions involves the efforts of more than 240,000 employees, the vast  majority of which work within the seven operational components. To  ensure DHS has the workforce it needs to accomplish these missions,  and effectively manage the human capital challenges it is facing along  with the government as a whole, such as increasing turnover, the  department needs to align its strategic planning with programmatic goals  and budgetary realities to develop long-term strategies for acquiring,  developing, and retaining staff to achieve these goals. DHS has recently  taken steps to implement more strategic, departmentwide workforce  planning by working collaboratively with components though various  committees and councils to focus the department on strategic workforce  planning. Nonetheless, as DHS moves forward, it will need to determine  how to assess its progress and ensure components are achieving  workforce planning goals. DHS currently has limited performance  measures and lacks policies and procedures regarding how to use the  results of audits for departmental oversight of component workforce  planning. Without additional performance measures related to workforce  planning to hold components accountable for making progress in  implementing these efforts, DHS\u2019s OCHCO does not have an effective  means of monitoring progress. Similarly, without policies and procedures  for integrating the results of audits into component workforce plans and  annual reports, DHS lacks reasonable assurance that evaluation of such  efforts will be institutionalized, nor can it provide evidence of component  alignment with departmental strategic workforce planning guidance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that DHS strategic workforce planning is effectively  implemented departmentwide, we recommend that the Secretary of  Homeland Security direct the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer to  take the following three actions to provide a basis to monitor and assess  the effectiveness of departmentwide strategic workforce planning:  identify and document additional performance measures, such as  measures to monitor component efforts to develop and implement  action plans to address workforce supply and demand discrepancies,  and use them to assess and report on components\u2019 progress in  implementing DHS\u2019s strategic workforce planning process; document policies and procedures for the Balanced Workforce  Program Management Office and the Human Capital Policy and  Programs Office to use the results of audits related to component- level workforce planning; and  integrate the results of these audits with components\u2019 annual  operational plans and review the plans and provide timely feedback to  enhance components\u2019 implementation of strategic workforce planning  efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from DHS.
