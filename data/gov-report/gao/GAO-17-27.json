Survey respondents identified several factors that contributed to equipment failures that led to disruptions, such as equipment operating beyond its intended life; poor equipment condition; and equipment not being properly maintained. Survey respondents reported over $29 million in financial impacts for fiscal years 2009 through 2015. Installation officials reported experiencing operational impacts such as a week-long shut down of operations at an Army facility on Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey.", "Information about utility disruptions is not consistently available to DOD utility owners and managers at the installation level. Specifically, 151 out of 364 survey respondents stated that they did not have information on utility disruptions for any fiscal year from 2009 through 2015. An overarching reason GAO found for disruption information not being available is that the services vary in the extent to which each has issued guidance to collect and retain utility disruption information at the installation level. The Army has some guidance to report utility disruptions, but we found that some installations did not consistently have this information available. The Air Force and Marine Corps do not have current guidance directing the installations to track utility disruption information. The Navy issued new guidance in 2015 which, if implemented as directed, may improve the collection of utility disruption information. According to installation and headquarters officials, there are benefits to collecting utility disruption information since it can be used to identify repairs and to prioritize funding for those repairs. However, without guidance directing installations to collect information about all types of utility disruptions, service officials may not have the information needed to make informed decisions or to compete effectively for limited repair funds.", "DOD's implementation of the Sustainment Management System (SMS), a software tool to conduct standardized condition assessments, may not provide it with comparable and reliable facility condition index (FCI) data -- a metric used to make strategic investment decisions. In 2013, to improve the reliability of FCI data, DOD directed the services to use SMS which standardizes the way the services conduct condition assessments and calculate the FCI. According to officials, the SMS module for utility systems is still in development, but modules for other facilities, such as buildings, are complete and in use. While the SMS process is intended to provide DOD with credible FCI data, GAO found the process could result in differences in the FCI because the services are able to customize settings, called condition standards, within the process. Variation among the condition standards could result in facilities having differences in the FCI although the assessed physical conditions of the facilities are the same. As a result, the FCI data would not be comparable. Without taking steps to ensure that the services' condition standards for the utilities module, which is under development, will provide the department with comparable and reliable FCI data, the SMS utilities module may not provide DOD information that is comparable across the department."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To improve utility system information, GAO is recommending that the Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps take steps or provide guidance to consistently collect disruption information, and that while the SMS utilities module is under development, DOD take steps to ensure that the services apply condition standards consistently. DOD concurred with the recommendations to collect disruption data and partially concurred with the other recommendation stating that it would determine if further consistent condition standards are needed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Department of Defense (DOD) installations serve as platforms from which  the department employs forces across the full spectrum of military  operations. These installations rely on the use of utilities, such as  electricity and water, to accomplish their missions. For example, reliable  electric and water utility services are critical to the launch missions at  Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. Without electricity to power  key communication and radar functions and water to absorb the excess  heat and noise generated during rocket launches, a launch mission would  have to be cancelled. Risks to the reliable provision of utility services on  DOD installations can come from a variety of sources, such as extreme  weather, mechanical failures, and even cyberattacks. For example, in  2015 we found that Vandenberg Air Force Base had experienced  electrical disruptions in 2010 and 2013 due to failures from on-base  equipment, resulting in delayed satellite launches.", "In 2015 we also found that disruptions caused by the failure of DOD- owned utility infrastructure, such as the disruption described above, may  have played a larger role in disruptions experienced by DOD installations  than had been indicated by DOD\u2019s annual reporting on disruptions. We  found that because DOD had not specifically identified and logged  instances of disruptions caused by the failure of DOD-owned utility  infrastructure, the department did not have comprehensive information  about utility disruptions. Given the possibility that disruptions result in  serious operational impacts, decision makers need reliable information to  ensure that resources are available to take necessary steps at  installations and across the department to increase resilience.  Furthermore, according to a DOD official, an ongoing DOD study found  that the reliability of energy utility infrastructure on an installation is an  important factor to consider when determining the cost-effectiveness of  energy resilience strategies to enhance mission assurance.", "According to DOD\u2019s real property inventory from fiscal year 2014, DOD  manages nearly 562,000 facilities with a combined plant replacement  value that the department estimates at about $880 billion. This includes  more than 181,000-utility facilities with a plant replacement value of more  than $158 billion. According to DOD, all facilities, to include utility  infrastructure, are to be sustained and recapitalized, as necessary, to  ensure that they are in the right condition to support the department\u2019s  missions. However, according to DOD, the department has been  accepting significant risk in its recent budgets for facilities, to include  utility infrastructure. For example, in April 2016, the Acting Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment testified  that DOD has been accepting significant risk in its budgets for maintaining  facilities because its fiscal year 2017 budget request was 10 percent less  from the previous year and the department and has seen worsening  condition ratings for its facilities.", "Senate Report 114-49 accompanying S. 1376, a bill for the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, included a provision for  us to review information on utility disruptions on DOD installations due to  the failure of DOD-owned infrastructure, among other things.

Our survey included  questions about the disruptions caused by equipment failure, the impacts  of those disruptions, and the characteristics of the DOD-owned utility  systems, among other things. To inform the design of our survey  instrument and help ensure the validity and reliability of our testimonial  survey evidence, we discussed the survey topics and appropriate  recipients with officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)  and the military services, developed the survey with GAO subject matter  analysts and technical survey experts, and conducted pretests with  officials who had work experience managing and operating DOD-owned  utility systems. Furthermore, the survey instrument was independently  reviewed by a survey design expert within GAO.", "We based the analysis in this report on 364 completed surveys, which is  an 80 percent response rate.

In cases where we use these estimates, we  describe the results as estimates and we generally refer to the entire  population of \u201cutility systems\u201d or \u201cutility managers.\u201d Because some  questions did not apply to all respondents, some of the questions in our  survey were answered by an insufficient number of respondents to  reliably generate an estimate of the overall population. In these cases,  rather than presenting a population estimate, we report on the number of  respondents in our sample who answered that question. To obtain  additional information about the impact of utility disruptions caused by the  failure of DOD-owned utility infrastructure, we conducted follow-up  interviews with selected respondents who reported the most disruptions.  We asked respondents to describe the impacts of specific disruptions and  we also collected and reviewed documentation, such as records in  maintenance information systems and project proposals.", "To assess the extent to which owners and managers of DOD-owned  utility systems have information about disruptions caused by equipment  failures, we included a question in our survey regarding the availability of  information on disruptions for fiscal years 2009 through 2015 and a  question about the usefulness of disruption information in managing utility  systems. Based on the survey responses, we followed up with 143 survey  respondents who reported not having any information on disruptions for  any fiscal year, in order to confirm their responses and to determine the  reasons why information was not available. We also interviewed service  officials regarding policies and practices related to the collection and use  of utility disruption information. Finally, we compared installation practices  to standards regarding the identification, analysis and response to risks  as described in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government.

Additionally, we  collected and reviewed documents such as briefings, training documents,  and a user guide that describe how the new standardized condition  assessment process will assess and rate the condition of utility systems  and related infrastructure. We also conducted interviews with DOD and  service officials regarding the development of the standardized process  and how the department intends to use the information to inform  decisions.

According to  our review of records maintained by the Office of the Assistant Secretary  of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment, as of January 1,  2015, the military services own or have been operating and maintaining  as many as 1,954 electric, potable water, wastewater, and natural gas  utility systems located in the United States, in its territories, or overseas  (see table 1). From these 1,954 systems, we determined that 1,075 of  these electric, water, wastewater and natural gas utility systems were  owned by the active component of one of the four military services and  located on an installation with a plant replacement value of $100 million or  more.", "In addition, the records maintained by the Office of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment indicate  that DOD has privatized 570 electric, water, wastewater and natural gas  utility systems. According to DOD, since 1997 the department has been  attempting to privatize its utility systems because military installations  have been unable to maintain reliable utility systems due to inadequate  funding and competing installation management priorities. DOD officials  stated that privatization is the preferred method for modernizing and  recapitalizing utility systems and services by allowing military installations  to benefit from private-sector financing and efficiencies. We previously  reported that with private-sector financing, installations obtain major  upgrades to their utility systems and pay for these improvements over  time through the utility services contracts using operation and  maintenance funds.

This executive order created the Federal Real Property  Council, established the role of the senior real property officer, and  authorized the creation of a centralized real property database. The  Federal Real Property Council worked with the General Services  Administration to develop and enhance an inventory system known as the  Federal Real Property Profile, which was designed to meet the executive  order\u2019s requirement for a centralized database that includes all real  property under the control of executive branch agencies. The 2013  Federal Real Property Council guidance for real property inventory  reporting defines 25 real property data elements.

DOD guidance requires that each  service maintain a current inventory count and up-to-date information  regarding, among other things, the FCI of each facility in its inventory.  DOD calculates the FCI as defined by the Federal Real Property Council,  and records the FCI in its Real Property Assets Database.

For example, in October 2008 we reported that six real property holding  agencies, including DOD, respectively use different methods to define  and estimate their repair and maintenance backlogs. Further, we  reported that the backlog estimates do not necessarily reflect the costs  that agencies expect to incur to repair and maintain assets essential to  their missions or to avert risks to their missions. For example, the General  Services Administration identified $7 billion in repair needs for work to be  done from fiscal year 2007 and within the next 10 years on its facilities,  and DOD provided an FCI value for its facilities. We recommended that  the Office of Management and Budget, in conjunction with the Federal  Real Property Council and in consultation with the Federal Accounting  Standards Advisory Board, should explore the potential for developing a  uniform reporting requirement in the Federal Real Property Profile that  would capture the government\u2019s fiscal exposure related to real property  repair and maintenance. We further recommended that such a reporting  requirement should include a standardized definition of repair and  maintenance costs related to all assets that agencies determine to be  important to their mission, and therefore capture the government\u2019s fiscal  exposure related to its real property assets. The Office of Management  and Budget generally concurred with the report and agreed with our  recommendation. Our recommendation was implemented in 2011 when  the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board, as supported by the  Office of Management and Budget and in coordination with other federal  agencies, amended existing standards for financial reporting of deferred  repairs and maintenance to establish uniformity across reporting  agencies.", "We also previously reviewed DOD\u2019s efforts to manage its real property  inventory, including the need for continued management attention to  support installation facilities and operations, among other things.

Specifically, we found that DOD took steps to verify the accuracy of its  inventory of real property and to develop a facilities sustainment model  that provides a consistent and reasonable framework for preparing  estimates of DOD\u2019s annual facility sustainment funding requirements. In  addition, since 2011 DOD has continued to take steps to improve its  ability to assess and record the condition of its infrastructure. One  improvement is the development of a standardized process for assessing  facility conditions. In 2016 we reported that individual services have  reported varying levels of progress in implementing this process. We  recommended that DOD revise its guidance to clarify how the services  are to indicate when a facility condition rating recorded in DOD\u2019s Real  Property Assets Database is based on the standardized process.

For example, an official from Naval Station Great  Lakes, Illinois, stated that the water system is more than 90 years old \u2014  beyond its serviceable life which she estimates at about 50-60 years. The  increasing age of the system causes the system\u2019s condition to deteriorate  and results in more unplanned disruptions. In another example, Air Force  officials from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, stated that the  majority of the installation\u2019s water distribution pipes were originally  installed in the 1940\u2019s and due to the age of these pipes there is an  increased risk for a significant disruption. However, officials stated that  they are currently not experiencing frequent or severe disruptions to the  water system due to equipment failure.", "Based on our survey results, the majority of DOD-owned utility systems  are between 55 and 65 years old but have also completed a repair project  that replaced a significant part or parts of the system in the last 15 years.  Specifically, we estimate, based on information reported in our survey  responses, that approximately 25 percent of DOD-owned utility systems  were originally installed between 1941 and 1950 and approximately 24  percent between 1951 and 1960 (see figure 3).", "To supplement the information about the age of the utility systems,  through our survey we also collected information on when a significant  part or parts of the system was repaired or replaced. Over time parts of  the utility systems are repaired and replaced through maintenance  activities because certain parts have a shorter serviceable life than  others. Describing the age of the system based on when the system was  originally installed does not capture the fact that parts have been replaced  over time and that certain components of a system may be newer than  other components. Based on our survey results, more than half of DOD- owned utility systems have had a significant part or parts of the systems  replaced in the last 15 years. Specifically, we estimate that approximately  16 percent of DOD-owned utility systems have most recently completed a  significant repair between 2001 and 2010, and 37 percent between 2011  and 2015 (see figure 4).", "In addition, according to our survey results the poor condition of  equipment is a contributing factor leading to disruptions. For example,  officials from Naval Station Mayport, Florida, stated that some of the  disruptions they reported in the survey were caused by electrical  equipment that was in poor condition. Specifically, the officials reported  that the existing distribution system serving the installation\u2019s on-base  housing is unreliable, not in compliance with code, poorly designed, and  past its expected useful lifespan of 50 years.", "Furthermore, according to some installation officials we interviewed, the  utility systems experienced failures because the systems have not been  properly maintained. For example, officials from Joint Base Lewis- McChord, Washington, stated that some of the disruptions they reported  resulted from the lack of expertise to perform maintenance. Specifically,  these officials stated that a well failed in the summer of 2015 because  prior repairs to the well were performed improperly, in part because they  were performed by personnel without specialized training, and tools had  been mistakenly left inside the well. In other examples, officials told us  that they are aware of necessary repairs, however, they have been  unable to complete them due to lack of funding. According to responses  provided to our survey, we estimate that approximately 29, 32, and 35  percent of DOD-owned utility systems experienced funding shortfalls for  fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2015 respectively.", "To mitigate the funding shortfall, based on the survey responses we  estimate that approximately 33 percent of utility managers deferred entire  planned maintenance and repair projects and 41 percent deferred  portions of planned maintenance and repair projects. In an interview  with officials from Naval Station Bremerton, they stated that an electrical  substation has experienced several failures, disrupting electricity to  shipyard operations, because there are several condition deficiencies and  it is poorly configured (i.e., the substation has a mixture of different parts  and equipment that do not function efficiently together), making the  operation and maintenance of the substation challenging. Officials  reported that they have known about these issues with the substation for  years, but they have not submitted a project to update the system  because they believed it would not compete well for funding. Officials said  that a lack of available funding for the electric system has caused them to  delay a utility infrastructure project on this substation, a critical component  of the electric system. In another example, an official from Naval Station  Great Lakes, Illinois, stated that an assessment study of the water system  recommended a phased recapitalization of the system, however, these  repairs have been deferred due to lack of funding.

For example, an official from MacDill Air Force Base, Florida,  stated that they did not report any financial impacts of disruptions  because it would have been too difficult and time consuming to manually  search through all of the records to identify the costs. In addition, officials  from Naval Station Bremerton explained that any estimate of the costs  associated with the fiscal impacts of the disruptions would be unreliable  because they could not definitively calculate the total costs of all of the  repair work performed for each disruption.

According to Navy officials, the study determined that the  unplanned outages were mostly caused by the equipment failure of Navy- owned utility equipment and that the outages had led to delays in repair  efforts and approximately $58 million in lost productivity.", "In addition, based on our survey responses, disruptions caused by the  failure of DOD-owned equipment cause a range of operational impacts. In  our survey, we asked the respondents who reported one or more utility  disruptions to report how common various operational impacts were.  Based on their responses, in fiscal year 2015, we estimate that  approximately 39 percent of DOD-owned utility managers commonly or  very commonly experienced no operational impacts from disruptions,  approximately 51 percent commonly or very commonly experienced  minor operational impacts, and approximately 27 percent commonly or  very commonly experienced moderate operational impacts, such as  delays or reduced capability of some assets. Further, major operational  impacts were less common. Also in fiscal year 2015, we estimate that  approximately 9 percent of DOD-owned utility managers commonly or  very commonly experienced major operational impacts.", "Our interviews with installation officials provided additional examples of  operational impacts of disruptions. For example, an official from Joint  Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey, provided an example of a  moderate operational impact. He stated that a power line exploded on the  Lakehurst annex and caused an electric disruption to a major Army  facility. The official explained that the power line that exploded was  installed in 1945 and was past its expected service life. Operations at the  Army facility were shut down for an entire week while staff arranged to  have several large generators installed at the facility. The facility ran on  generator power for the next 3 weeks while contracted repairs to the line  were completed. Figure 5 shows a burnt electrical feeder cable that  caused a major disruption to this Army facility.", "Similarly, in another example the Naval Undersea Warfare Center located  in Keyport, Washington, officials stated that in 2013 a complete base  electrical disruption was caused when a battery failed at a switching  station and then led to cascading failures across the base. Officials stated  that operations at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center stopped because  there was minimal back-up electricity generating capability at the time.", "In addition, the lack of preventive maintenance has led to disruptions.  Officials from Naval Auxiliary Landing Field San Clemente Island,  California, stated that the installation experienced an 8-hour island-wide  electrical disruption because seven utility poles caught fire in May 2014.  Officials were able to re-route power to some areas of the island, but  some areas were without power for the full 8 hours. The utility poles  caught fire because the insulator \u2013 a specific type of support used to  attach an electrical distribution line to the utility pole that prevents the  electricity from flowing to the pole itself \u2013 was corroded and covered with  salt, dust and debris. The salt and dirt formed a conductive layer on the  insulator that can create a \u201cflashover\u201d where the electricity flashes over  the corroded and polluted insulator and can lead to a fire on the utility  pole. Officials stated that these insulators can be washed to mitigate the  potential for such incidents. However, the system needs to be shut down  in order to perform the work, and, because of the installation\u2019s continuous  training operation schedule, it is difficult to schedule this maintenance.", "In another example, Navy officials from Naval Station Mayport, Florida,  stated that a series of electric disruptions in enlisted housing resulted in a  proposed $2.9 million project for improvements to the distribution system.  According to the project documentation from April 2015 we reviewed, the  poor condition of the infrastructure had caused 20 disruptions in the past  two years. Some of the disruptions affected the entire neighborhood, and  the disruptions lasted between 6 and 20 hours each.", "Navy officials from Naval Support Facility Indian Head, Maryland, stated  that in 2012 the installation\u2019s water system experienced a major rupture to  a segment of pipe that typically carries approximately 4,000 gallons per  minute. The rupture caused a drop in pressure that decreased the volume  of water going through the pipe to about 700 to 800 gallons per minute.  This disruption caused a temporary shut-down in mission activities  because the drop in water pressure impacted the fire suppression  capabilities. The officials stated that they ultimately replaced 5 of their 60  miles of water pipe due to this incident which cost approximately $2.0  million. Figure 6 shows a water pipe rupture at Naval Support Facility,  Indian Head, Maryland.", "In situations with smaller leaks in the water pipes, it may be more difficult  to find the problem.

According to our survey responses, 151 out of 364 survey respondents  reported that they did not have information on utility disruptions for any  fiscal year from 2009 through 2015. By contrast, 213 out of 364 survey  respondents stated that they had information on disruptions for at least  one fiscal year, and the availability of information on disruptions increased  for the more recent years.", "We followed up with the respondents who reported not having information  on disruptions to confirm their responses and to determine why such  information was not available. We confirmed that 53 respondents did not  have information, 52 stated that they did have information, several of  whom said that they misread the question and their answer should have  been that they had information but experienced no disruptions, and 38 did  not respond to our follow-up. In addition, we did not follow up with 8  respondents, 6 of whom said that they were unfamiliar with the system or  whom did not believe they had the information necessary to complete the  survey, and 2 of whom submitted survey responses after we began our  follow up efforts.", "The 53 respondents who reported not having disruption information  provided various reasons why the information was not available. Some  reasons include that the maintenance of the system is provided by a  contractor and the contract does not require the collection and reporting  of the disruption information; that the maintainers of utilities do not always  indicate in the records they keep the cause of the outage, such as  disruptions caused by equipment failure, versus other causes, such as  storm damage; and that the maintenance history is not always available  due to personnel turnover. In addition, some respondents reported that  they might be able to determine the number of disruptions caused by  equipment failure, but that they would need to manually search through  the maintenance records which is a time-consuming task.", "An overarching reason we found for disruption information not being  available is that the services vary in the extent to which each has issued  guidance to collect and retain utility disruption information at the  installation level. Specifically,", "The Army has an annual requirement for utility managers to report a  wide range of information about utility systems through the Installation  Status Report process. This process requires utility managers to  report unplanned electric utility disruptions and interruptions to water  distribution infrastructure. Further, the process has requirements to  report instances of equipment failure for water treatment and  distribution equipment and wastewater treatment and collection  equipment. There is not a specific requirement to report disruptions of  natural gas systems, but there is a requirement to report on surveys  done to detect the presence of leaks in the distribution piping.  However, we found that some of the Army installations did not  consistently have information about disruptions.", "The Air Force does not have a requirement for installations to collect  and retain utility disruption data. Air Force installation officials stated  that there used to be an instruction from a major Air Force command  that required the reporting of utility disruption information, but that this  instruction was superseded and the reporting requirement for utility  disruptions was not included in the new guidance.", "The Marine Corps also does not have a requirement for installations  to collect and retain utility disruption data. A Marine Corps  headquarters official stated that he was considering developing such  guidance.", "The Navy issued guidance in September 2015 to improve its ability to  collect timely and accurate information about utility disruptions that  occur on Navy installations by requiring the collection and reporting of  disruption data beginning in fiscal year 2016. According to the  guidance, the Navy needs accurate utility disruption data in order to  make informed decisions for utility investments because disruption  data is a key factor utilized in prioritizing utility repair projects, among  other things. In the guidance, the Navy included specific instructions  for how the utility disruption data were to be documented at the  installation level. Specifically, the guidance instructs the public works  departments or base operations and support contractors to track all  utility outages in the Navy\u2019s maintenance work order information  system known as \u201cMAXIMO\u201d. For example, for unplanned utility  outages lasting greater than 5 minutes, the installation officials or  contracting staff are to enter information about the incident, response  and repair in a MAXIMO work order outage log. In addition,  installation officials or contracting staff are required to identify the  cause of the utility outage and to enter that numerical code into  MAXIMO (that is, 0 for false alarm, 1 for loss of commercial  power/utility, 2 for weather-related disruptions, 3 for equipment  failures, and so on). Furthermore, the guidance states that any new  base operating and support contracts should include a provision for  the contractors to report utility disruption information into MAXIMO  and to include instructions on how to report that information.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  management should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to  achieving the defined objectives, and that analyzing and estimating the  significance of risks provides the basis for responding to the risks. In  addition, we reviewed reports from federal agencies and utility  management organizations that recommend that utility system managers  record and use information about the disruptions that occur on their  systems in order to manage their systems effectively. For example,  according to the American Public Power Association, reliability statistics  calculated by using data on disruption frequency and duration constitute a  quantitative basis for good decision making.", "The collection and retention of utility disruption information is useful for  two reasons. First, installation-level officials stated that disruption  information is useful in operating and maintaining the utility system.  Based on the responses to our survey, we estimate that 82 percent of  utility managers considered this information to be somewhat or very  useful. In addition, installation officials we interviewed identified several  ways in which they used disruption information. For example, at Naval  Station Great Lakes, Illinois, an official stated that while she was not  aware of a policy requiring that she track disruptions to the utility systems,  she did track disruptions on the water system, including information on  the disruption\u2019s location and date. She stated that she used the  information to focus on areas of the water system that were experiencing  multiple disruptions, to plan maintenance, and to inform funding  decisions. In addition, an official from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, stated  that he tracks outages because it is considered a good engineering  practice. He stated that tracking disruptions on the electric system helped  him to determine reliability, operations and maintenance budgets,  preventative maintenance requirements, and areas of the system that  needed more attention.", "Second, utility disruption information may help installations compete for  project repair funding. According to Army, Navy, and Air Force officials,  they use disruption information, among other information, when  prioritizing funding for utility repairs in a particular budget year. For  example, the Air Force\u2019s risk-based project funding model uses utility  outage information, among other variables, to prioritize projects. Also, as  discussed above, the Navy\u2019s utility project prioritization process to make  risk-based investment decisions uses utility disruption information, among  other variables, to determine the highest priority projects. According to the  Navy\u2019s guidance, the prioritization process helps them ensure that limited  repair funding is directed to the most important projects.", "Installations that collect and retain information about utility disruptions  may be better able to manage and operate the utility system and compete  for scarce project funds because they have the available data to justify  the project. A Marine Corps official stated that he was considering  developing a requirement for installations to track utility disruption  information. In addition, as stated above, the Navy recently issued  guidance to improve its ability to track utility disruptions because it needs  this information to make informed decisions. The Navy\u2019s guidance, if  implemented as directed, may help installations track utility disruption  information and thus enable them to make sound decisions. On the other  hand, installation-level utility system owners and managers who do not  have access to information about disruptions may not have the  information they need to make informed decisions or to compete  effectively for limited repair funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Is Implementing a Standardized Condition Assessment Process to Improve Data Reliability, but It Could Result in Differences in the Facility Condition Index across the Services DOD Is Implementing a Standardized Condition Assessment Process to Improve Data Reliability", "paragraphs": ["DOD is currently implementing a standardized condition assessment  process to improve the data reliability of its facility condition data.

Prior to 2013 the guidance issued by OSD did not require a  standardized condition assessment process, and the respective services  used different methodologies to assess the condition of their facilities,  including utility systems. As a result of the services\u2019 nonstandardized  approach, OSD determined that the FCI data lacked credibility as a  measure of DOD facility quality.", "According to the 2013 OSD memorandum, the department needed to  implement the standardized assessment process to ensure that it had  consistent and reliable condition data in order to make sound strategic  investment decisions. According to an OSD official, the department relies  on the FCI to make these decisions, in part, because the FCI allows OSD  to assess the department\u2019s and the individual services\u2019 abilities to  maintain the facilities at the condition necessary to achieve the  department\u2019s missions. In addition, decision makers use the FCI to  monitor progress toward department-wide goals and to prevent further  accumulation of deferred maintenance. Those goals include the  establishment of an inventory-wide 80 percent minimum FCI score for  each military service to meet annually for the facilities they manage,  beginning in fiscal year 2016. Another goal is the identification of facilities  in failing condition, with an FCI of below 60, in support of the  department\u2019s efforts to reduce the inventory of failing facilities.", "Our survey results indicate that operators of DOD-owned utility systems  stated that knowledge about the condition of the infrastructure is useful.  Specifically based on our survey responses, we estimate that utility  managers consider knowledge about the condition of the system to have  a somewhat or very positive effect on the ability to avoid or prevent  equipment failure (68 percent); to manage risk associated with equipment  failure (72 percent); to identify funding needs (76 percent); and to extend  the utility system\u2019s usable service life (71 percent), among other things.", "The 2013 OSD memorandum directed the services to use the  Sustainment Management System (SMS) software, developed by the  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Construction Engineering Research  Laboratory, as the standardized condition assessment process.

According to the 2013 OSD memorandum, the services are  required to use SMS both to derive and to record the FCIs of facilities  supported by SMS in their respective real property databases by  September 2017. For assets not yet supported by SMS, such as utilities,  the 2013 OSD memorandum directed the services to perform inspections  with qualified personnel to determine existing physical deficiencies and to  estimate the cost of maintenance and repairs using industry cost  guides.

Further, according to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials, their  organization and the Air Force are the two organizations working on  development of the utilities SMS module, but representatives from the  other services have participated in the utilities SMS working committee  meetings. In addition, according to Air Force Officials, the Air Force has  provided funding to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to fund the  development of the initial version of the SMS utilities module for electric  and potable water utility systems. However, according to U.S. Army  Corps of Engineer officials, additional funding from the other services is  needed to further develop the capabilities of the electric and water  modules and to develop additional modules for other utility systems, such  as for wastewater or natural gas systems.", "U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials responsible for developing DOD\u2019s  initial version of the utilities module stated that the initial version uses a  simplified condition assessment process. The simplified condition  assessment process uses two variables, age and expected service life, to  determine the condition of the utility infrastructure. Alternatively, in SMS  modules for other facilities, such as buildings, more comprehensive  assessment processes are used to determine the condition of the facility.  These comprehensive assessment processes provide objective and  repeatable inspections on various facility components based on  knowledge of component criticality, the expected and observed  deterioration of components, among other things. Upon completion of the  inspection any identified defects are recorded and categorized by distress  type (for example, blistered, broken, damaged, cracked, or corroded),  among other things.", "According to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials, the rating criteria for  future versions of the SMS utilities module will be established with  consideration of existing rating systems from within DOD and industry.  For example, Navy officials told us that they provided funding to U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers in fiscal year 2015 to evaluate the integration of  Navy utility condition assessment rating methods into the SMS utilities  module. This study examines the Navy\u2019s utility condition assessment and  risk-based rating methods for integration into the SMS condition  assessment process for utilities.

According to one installation official  at Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma, the official would like to be able to  use the disruption information with the SMS module to support repair and  investment decisions. The installation officials stated that age may not  always be a good indicator of condition for a utility system, as a  component or part might be relatively new but causing disruptions  nonetheless.

These  condition standards may vary depending upon how critical a particular  component is to the overall facility or mission and each service develops  their own condition standards. For example, U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers hypothetically explained that on the one hand the Navy may  want to set a high condition standard for a water system that is used to  supply water to cool nuclear reactors for its home-ported nuclear  submarines because this is a critical mission. On the other hand, the  Army may want to set a lower condition standard for its water system that  is used to supply water for grounds maintenance because this is a lower  priority.", "These standards are compared to the current condition assessment of  the facility. Differences between the standards and the assessment  determine when repair work is needed for a particular piece of  infrastructure, and whether or not repair work is needed affects the FCI  calculation. If the inspected condition is above the condition standard then  the SMS system does not identify any repair work. If the inspected  condition falls below the condition standard then the SMS system  identifies the necessary repair work. SMS estimates the costs of the  identified repair work and then the system users determine if they want to  conduct the repairs. The SMS system uses the estimated cost of the  repair as the numerator in the FCI equation.", "According to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials, the services have  not yet developed condition standards for their utilities because the SMS  module for utilities is still being developed. However, the services have  developed condition standards for use in other SMS modules and U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers officials stated that the design of the SMS  module for utilities will be similar to other existing SMS modules. Further,  the officials stated that the condition standards for the utilities module will  operate similarly to how the condition standards operate in existing SMS  modules. Therefore, to conduct our analysis we reviewed the condition  standards used by the services in an existing SMS module for buildings,  called \u201cBUILDER\u201d.", "The services have grouped condition standards into categories, such as  high, medium, and low. According to U.S. Army Corps of Engineer  officials, condition standards in the high category would be assigned to  facilities that are mission-critical or generally more important to maintain.  For example, officials at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, stated  that the installation\u2019s electric and water systems are critical to supporting  the launch mission, however, the wastewater system is not as essential.  Specifically, the electric system powers equipment for communication and  radar tracking and the water system provides water to the launch pads to  absorb excess heat and noise generated during launches. If the utility  SMS module is implemented at Cape Canaveral, an Air Force official  indicated that they would likely assign high condition standards to the  electric and water systems and a lower condition standard to the  wastewater system.", "We found that while the four services generally use similar categories of  condition standards \u2013 such as high, medium, and low \u2013 they respectively  assign different numerical values to standards within the same category.  For example, each service has a category called \u201cmedium,\u201d but the  values range from 60 to 75 depending on the service. Figure 8 depicts the  service condition standards for the BUILDER SMS module.", "To illustrate how different condition standards affect the FCI calculation,  we developed a notional example, as illustrated in table 5, showing an  electric distribution system. The example assumes that each  hypothetical organization owns and operates an electric distribution  system, A through D, and each system has exactly the same  infrastructure \u2013 overhead power lines, a transformer, and a switching  station \u2014 was installed at the same time, and has the exact same plant  replacement value ($500,000). Also, each part of the system has the  same assessed physical condition from SMS. However, each hypothetical  organization has different condition standards for this notional electric  distribution system. We used the \u201cMedium/Intermediate\u201d condition  standard found in figure 8 for this notional example. We created notional  maintenance and repair costs for cases when the assessed physical  condition from SMS was lower than the condition standard. As shown in  our example, the result of differences in the condition standards is that  the FCIs are different, even though the assessed physical condition is the  same. In this notional example, hypothetical organizations A, B, and D  appear to have repair needs, while hypothetical organization C does not  appear to have any repair needs. Table 5 illustrates how different  condition standards from four hypothetical organizations produce different  FCI values.", "According to the 2013 OSD memorandum, the department requires  reliable condition information, in the form of the FCI, to manage the  department\u2019s facilities and to make informed investment decisions. OSD  officials stated that the FCI is one of multiple sources of information that  can be used to support the department\u2019s investment decisions concerning  a single asset or portfolio of assets. Further, according to Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government, to be useful, information  should be accurate, complete, and credible, among other factors.", "However, DOD has not taken action to ensure that the condition  standards to be developed by the services for the utilities module will  provide the department with comparable and reliable FCI data. According  to DOD officials, the services should have the flexibility to set the  condition standards for their utility infrastructure and other facilities as  they deem appropriate based on mission criticality and other factors.  DOD officials stated that the services need to have the flexibility to  prioritize the condition of some utility systems and facilities above others  so that they can direct their limited repair and maintenance budgets to the  most important needs. We agree that some facilities may need to be put  in the high standard versus the low or medium standard based on mission  criticality, but it is unclear why the standards vary within the same  category (i.e., high, medium low). Further, according to the OSD 2013  memorandum, DOD is implementing a new standardized process to  assess the condition of its facilities because its previous guidance allowed  the services to implement an unstandardized approach to assessing the  condition of their facilities, which resulted in a FCI that lacked credibility.", "OSD officials also stated that they had not compared the services\u2019  existing condition standards and that they would consider looking into the  differences of these standards across the services. Without taking steps  to ensure that the services\u2019 condition standards for the utilities module  and other modules will provide the department with comparable and  reliable FCI data, the SMS utilities module, currently under development,  may not provide DOD information that is comparable across the  department\u2019s facilities.

We determined that some military  services had guidance in place that required installations to collect and  report some utility disruption data, and others did not. The Army has a  service-wide requirement to collect and report electric and water utility  disruption data, instances of equipment failure for water and wastewater  systems, and to perform leak detection surveys for natural gas systems.  However, we found that some of the Army installations did not  consistently have information about disruptions available. The Air Force  and Marine Corps do not have a service-wide requirement to collect and  report utility disruption data. The Navy issued new reporting guidance  beginning in fiscal year 2016 that if implemented as directed may provide  the Navy installations with the guidance and procedures necessary to  collect disruption information to make informed decisions for utility  investments. The majority of DOD-owned utility system owners and  managers consider this type of information to be beneficial, for example  some officials stated they use this information to determine where  resources need to be focused to maintain the utility infrastructure.

The fifth stratum comprises all utilities located on U.S. military  installations outside the United States. The reason we used a fifth stratum  for the systems outside of the United States was because the ownership  status of these systems was not clear from the records maintained by the  department. By separating these systems into their own strata we could  draw our sample in such a way that we would still be able to generalize  the survey results for the utility systems within the United States even if  all of the overseas systems were in fact not owned by one of the military  services nor did the services pay for the majority of the operation and  maintenance of the utility system. Furthermore, in order to verify that the  systems we included in our sample were within our scope, we included a  question in the survey which asked respondents to state if the system  was owned by the military service and if the service was responsible for  paying the majority of the operation and maintenance of the system, as  discussed below.", "In each stratum we used systematic random selection to identify the  systems to include in the sample.

In total, we  distributed 453 surveys."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Analysis of Respondents", "paragraphs": ["Out of the 453 surveys distributed, 379 managers or operators of DOD- owned utility systems completed the survey for a response rate of 84  percent. To verify that the completed surveys were within our scope, we  analyzed the results of a question in the survey which asked respondents  to state if the system was owned by the military service and if the service  was responsible for paying the majority of the operation and maintenance  of the system. We determined that 15 respondents reported that the utility  system was neither owned by the military service nor operated and  maintained using a majority of appropriated funds. We removed these 15  surveys from our list of completed surveys, which resulted in a list of 364  completed and in-scope surveys. The analysis in this report is based on  those 364 survey responses.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random  selections, our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we  might have drawn. Since each sample could have provided different  estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular  sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval. This is the interval  that would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the  samples we could have drawn. Confidence intervals are provided along  with each sample estimate in the report. Generally in this report the  results of this survey are presented as statistical estimates about the  population of 1,075 electric, water, wastewater, or natural gas utility  systems described above. In cases where we are using these estimates,  we describe the results as estimates and generally refer to the entire  population of \u201cutility systems\u201d or \u201cutility managers.\u201d Because some  questions did not apply to all respondents, some of the questions in our  survey were answered by an insufficient number of respondents to  reliably generate an estimate of the overall population. In these cases,  rather than presenting a population estimate, we reported on the number  of respondents in our sample who answered that question.", "To obtain additional information about the impact of utility disruptions  caused by the failure of DOD-owned utility infrastructure, we conducted  follow-up interviews with a selected set of respondents who reported the  most disruptions. We asked respondents to describe the impacts of  specific disruptions and we also collected and reviewed documentation,  such as records in maintenance information systems and project  proposals.", "To assess the extent to which owners and managers of DOD-owned  utility systems have information about disruptions caused by equipment  failures, we included a question in our survey regarding the availability of  information on disruptions from fiscal year 2009 through 2015 and a  question about the usefulness of disruption information in managing utility  systems. Based on the survey responses, we followed-up with all 146  survey respondents who reported not having any information on  disruptions for any fiscal year to confirm their responses and to determine  the reasons why information was not available. We received responses  from 89 survey respondents. We also interviewed service officials  regarding policies and practices related to the collection and use of utility  disruption information. Finally, we compared installation practices to  standards regarding the identification, analysis, and response to risks as  described in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government.  In addition, we reviewed reports from federal agencies and utility  management organizations, such as management guides issued by the  Environmental Protection Agency and the American Public Power  Association, which describe the information that is useful in the  management and operation of utility systems.", "To assess the extent to which the department\u2019s implementation of a  standardized facility condition assessment process provides DOD  consistent information about the condition of utility systems, we reviewed  policy documents and reports regarding DOD\u2019s efforts to improve the  reliability of the condition information it collects to manage its  infrastructure. We reviewed policies and documents describing the  development and implementation of a new standardized condition  assessment process, called the Sustainment Management System,  developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and how DOD plans to  use the condition information to monitor and oversee the achievement of  department-wide goals. Additionally, we collected and reviewed  documents such as briefings, training documents, and user guides that  describe how the new standardized condition assessment process will  assess and rate the condition of utility systems and related infrastructure.  We also conducted interviews with DOD officials and the military services  regarding the development of the standardized process and how the  department intends to use the information to inform decisions. Finally, we  compared DOD\u2019s process for generating the condition information with  standards regarding the use and management of data as described in  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2015 to November 2016,  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
