Health centers' revenue comes from a variety of sources, including reimbursements from Medicaid, Medicare, private insurance, and federal and state grants. While total health center revenue increased from 2010 through 2017, the share of revenue from each source changed in different ways. In particular, revenue from federal and state grants decreased from 38.0 percent of total revenue in 2010 to about 30.2 percent of total revenue in 2017 while reimbursements from Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance increased. Over the same time period, the number of health centers increased from 1,124 centers in 2010 to 1,373 centers in 2017. In addition, the number of patients served over the same time period increased by 7.7 million patients, from 19.5 million to 27.2 million.", "GAO's analysis of Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) data shows that from fiscal years 2011 through 2017, health centers received approximately $15.8 billion in federal grants funded by the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF), which was established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010. Of this total amount, 79.7 percent\u2014or $12.6 billion\u2014was awarded for the purpose of maintaining operations at existing health centers (see figure). According to HRSA officials, these CHCF grants are used to fill the gap between what it costs to operate a health center and the amount of revenue a health center receives. As such, officials explained, the awards are a primary means through which health centers provide health care services that may be uncompensated, including services for uninsured patients or services not typically reimbursed by other payers, such as adult dental care. The remaining $3.2 billion in CHCF grants were made to increase the amount of services provided at existing health centers; increase the number of health centers and sites; and other special initiatives, such as implementing health information technology."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Health centers were established to increase the availability of primary and  preventive health care services for low-income people living in medically  underserved areas.

Regardless of type, health centers are required to provide  health care to individuals who are members of the health center\u2019s target  population or to all individuals located in the health center\u2019s service area,  regardless of their ability to pay. In some communities, these centers may  be the only primary care providers available to certain vulnerable  populations.

To corroborate  the list of awards provided by HRSA, we reviewed descriptions of the  grants contained in the funding opportunity announcements and grant  award announcements for a random sample of 10 percent of the 52  awards made, including those for the largest grants.

Community health centers. These health centers serve the general  population with limited access to health care. They are required to  provide primary health services to all residents who reside in the  center\u2019s service area. More than three-quarters of health centers are  community health centers.  2.  Health centers for the homeless. These health centers provide  primary care services to individuals who lack permanent housing or  live in temporary facilities or transitional housing. These centers are  required to provide substance abuse services and supportive services  targeted to the homeless population.  3.  Health centers for residents of public housing. These health centers  provide primary health care services to residents of public housing  and individuals living in areas immediately accessible to public  housing.  4.  Migrant health centers. These health centers provide primary care to  migratory agricultural workers (individuals whose principal  employment is in agriculture and who establish temporary residences  for work purposes) and seasonal agricultural workers (individuals  whose principal employment is in agriculture on a seasonal basis but  do not migrate for the work).", "HRSA\u2019s Section 330 grants are funded by a combination of discretionary  appropriations and, since 2011, mandatory appropriations provided from  the CHCF.

HRSA officials also told us that the total amount of  CHCF appropriations may differ from the total amount of awards funded  because, for example, appropriations may be (1) used for administrative  costs, (2) reduced because of sequestration, or (3) carried over between  fiscal years.", "Health centers are required to provide comprehensive primary health  services, including preventive, diagnostic, treatment, and emergency  health services. (See table 1.) All services that health centers provide  must be available to patients at the center regardless of patient payment  source or ability to pay and must be available (either directly or under a  referral arrangement) to patients at all health center service sites.  Services are provided by clinical staff\u2014including physicians, nurses,  dentists, and mental health and substance abuse professionals\u2014or  through contracts or cooperative arrangements with other providers.", "In addition to the services they provide, health centers are also required  to document the unmet health needs of the residents in their service area  and to periodically review their service areas to determine whether the  services provided are available and accessible to area residents promptly  and as appropriate. Health centers also must have a sliding fee scale  based on a patient\u2019s ability to pay and to be governed by a community  board of which at least 51 percent of the members are patients of the  health center.

This amount  included funding to increase the availability of specific health care  services, such as dental care, as well as funding to support health  centers\u2019 efforts to extend service hours or increase the number of  available providers. Specifically, these grants were awarded for the  following:", "Behavioral and mental health, substance abuse. Three grants totaling  about $400.8 million were awarded to expand access to behavioral  health, mental health, and substance abuse services.

Most of the funding to increase  access to health centers\u2014about $648.5 million of the $1.1 billion\u2014 was provided through what are called NAP awards. According to  HRSA officials, there are two primary ways these funds can be  used\u2014either to allow a new organization to become a health center  (about 30 percent of grant applicants) or for an existing health center  to add one or more service sites (about 70 percent of grant  applicants). HRSA officials told us that they funded 1,059 NAP  awards to new and existing health centers from fiscal year 2011  through 2017 for a combined total of 1,609 proposed new health  centers or sites.

HRSA awarded construction grants totaling  about $411.3 million through the Health Infrastructure Investment  Program to help existing health centers alter, renovate, expand, or  construct a facility. According to HRSA officials, construction grants  may increase the number of health center sites or may result in the  consolidation of sites while still expanding access to care.", "Health Center Planning Grants. HRSA awarded a Health Center  Planning grant in fiscal year 2011 for about $10.3 million to support  planning and development of comprehensive primary care health  centers.", "Collectively, a total of 5,536 new health center sites were added in the  United States from fiscal year 2011 through 2017. Of these new sites,  3,838 were in urban locations and 1,698 were in rural locations. While  many of these new health center sites were from NAP awards, as  previously described, other grants either funded by the CHCF or by  discretionary appropriations may have contributed to the establishment of  new health center sites. For example, HRSA officials told us that health  center sites may be added through a change of scope to their service  area competition award or through other types of grants funded by the  CHCF, such as grants to increase adult dental services. However,  according to HRSA officials, the data do not allow for directly associating  the number of new sites with those grants, as the grants may be used for  multiple purposes.
