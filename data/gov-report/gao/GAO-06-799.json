Donor-advised funds are separate accounts held by a public charity to receive contributions from donors who may recommend, but not control, charitable distributions from the account. Supporting organizations are public charities that are to carry out their tax-exempt purpose by supporting one or more tax-exempt organizations, usually other public charities. Compared with private foundations, donor-advised funds and supporting organizations give donors less control over how their donation will be used but provide donors more favorable tax deductions, lower administration costs, less IRS oversight, and fewer reporting requirements. Donor-advised funds hold billions of dollars in assets, and supporting organizations and private foundations hold hundreds of billions of dollars in assets. Public charities and private foundations must annually file an IRS Form 990 or Form 990-PF, respectively, to report their activities. However, donor-advised fund data are limited because organizations that maintain the funds are not required to separately report fund data from other financial data on Form 990. Although some supporting organization characteristics can be determined from Form 990 data, other characteristics, such as the rate at which payments are made to charities and details about the recipients of loans from the organization, cannot be reliably determined. Concerns have arisen about the \"payout\" rate to charities, and Congress is considering a minimum payout requirement, similar to the one for private foundations. Further, supporting organizations are not required to report their supported organizations' identification numbers, making it more difficult to track the relationship between organizations. To collect additional data, IRS revised Form 990 for 2003 and 2005 and is considering further revisions, but no firm plans have been determined. According to IRS managers, examinations reveal that some donor-advised funds and supporting organizations are used in abusive schemes to unallowably benefit donors or related parties or give donors excess control of charitable assets and operations. In some cases, IRS is able to clearly determine noncompliance and assign appropriate corrective actions. However, in other cases, IRS faces challenges gathering evidence or addressing activities that do not seem to benefit charities, but do not violate any law or regulation, such as when a supporting organization loans money, at market rate, to a donor, director, or officer of the organization. Promoters, who are individuals or entities who facilitate abusive schemes, further complicate IRS's examination efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year, millions of donors give hundreds of billions of dollars to  charities. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimated that for tax year  2002, charitable contributions totaled over $229 billion, the largest portion  coming from individuals and foundations. In addition to traditional public  charities and private foundations, donors may make charitable  contributions through the use of donor-advised funds and supporting  organizations. Donor-advised funds are generally separate funds or  accounts established and maintained by a public charity to receive  contributions from a single donor or a group of donors. While the donor  may recommend charitable distributions from the account, the charity  must be free to accept or reject the donor\u2019s recommendations. Supporting  organizations are public charities that are to carry out their tax-exempt  purpose by supporting one or more tax-exempt organizations, usually  other public charities. IRS has recognized that while the majority of tax- exempt organizations are trying to comply with tax law, a significant  compliance challenge involves the use of donor-advised funds and  supporting organizations in abusive arrangements benefiting individuals or  organizations other than charities. Concerns about these abuses have led  to proposed legislation imposing requirements on the operation of donor- advised funds and supporting organizations.", "As requested, we are providing information on (1) federal laws and  regulations regarding donor-advised funds and supporting organizations,  as compared to private foundations; (2) financial and organizational  characteristics, such as loan recipients, of donor-advised funds, supporting  organizations, and private foundations, to the extent data are available;  and (3) types of potential or actual noncompliance and promotion  methods involving donor-advised funds and supporting organizations and  the challenges identifying them. In addition, we agreed to provide  information about noncash contribution valuation methods and marketing  methods involving donor-advised funds and supporting organizations,  which are discussed in appendixes III and IV.", "To compare current federal laws and regulations for donor-advised funds  and supporting organizations to those for private foundations, we  reviewed the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), Department of the Treasury  regulations, and IRS publications as they related to the purpose and  operation of these entities. To determine financial and organizational  characteristics of donor-advised funds, supporting organizations, and  private foundations, we analyzed IRS Forms 990 and 990-PF data, as well  as reviewed survey data that external organizations collected on donor- advised funds. Unless otherwise noted, tax year 2003 was the most recent  year of data available at the time of our analysis. We converted 2003 dollar  amounts to 2005 constant dollars. To identify types of noncompliance and  promotion methods involving donor-advised funds and supporting  organizations, we reviewed documents from IRS as well as from our  literature search. For each objective, we spoke to various IRS managers  and individuals knowledgeable about the tax-exempt community. We  conducted our review from July 2005 through May 2006 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["IRC section 501(c) specifies 28 types of entities that are eligible for tax- exempt status and over 1.6 million entities have been recognized as  exempt as of 2005. One subset of these tax-exempt entities is classified as  501(c)(3) charitable organizations, of which slightly over 1 million existed  in 2005, according to IRS. In 1969, Congress directed that all 501(c)(3)  organizations would be private foundations unless they qualify for  exclusion from that status under IRC section 509. This change subdivided  section 501(c)(3) organizations into two general categories\u2014\u201dpublic  charities\u201d and \u201cprivate foundations.\u201d", "Within the public charities classification, Congress created supporting  organizations, which are defined in section 509(a)(3) as public charities  organized to support one or more public charities, including churches and  certain governmental units, and certain other tax-exempt entities, such as  membership-based organizations (e.g., unions and professional  organizations). Supporting organizations are classified as public charities  not because they are themselves publicly supported, but because they are  to support another public charity with which they are to maintain a strong  relationship. In creating supporting organizations, Congress recognized  that it can be beneficial and prudent to place certain assets or activities in  a separate legal entity to insulate assets from liability or to facilitate  separation of functions for programmatic, accounting, or other reasons,  according to the Panel on the Nonprofit Sector Final Report.", "Donor-advised funds are generally separate accounts operated by tax- exempt public charities to receive contributions from a single donor or  group of donors. Donors can advise on the distributions from the account.  For the contribution to qualify as a completed gift, the charity must have  ultimate control over how the assets in the account are invested and  distributed. According to our interviews with knowledgeable individuals  and recent Senate testimony, donor-advised funds have generally been in  existence since the 1930s and have traditionally been operated by  community foundations. In the 1990s, financial investment firms began  establishing \u201ccommercial funds,\u201d which are tax-exempt public charities  that operate donor-advised fund accounts. Investment of contributions to  the fund accounts is controlled by the commercial fund\u2019s board, which  hires the investment firm that established the commercial fund to manage  the fund\u2019s assets.", "Generally, an entity must apply to IRS to obtain tax-exempt recognition.  Most organizations seeking recognition from federal income tax must use  specific forms, including Form 1023 (Application for Recognition of  Exemption under Section 501(c)(3) of the IRC) or Form 1024 (Application  for Recognition of Exemption under Section 501(a)) as well as other  documentation. After receiving tax-exempt recognition, public charitable  entities must annually file a Form 990 information return to report their  financial transactions and activities for a tax year. Charities that have less  than $100,000 in gross receipts and $250,000 in year-end assets may use  Form 990-EZ. Entities with gross receipts below $25,000, and certain types  of entities, such as churches and certain entities associated with churches,  generally are not required to file. Form 990 collects information on  revenues, expenses, and assets, and has accompanying schedules.  Schedule A of Form 990 covers several areas such as compensation,  lobbying expenditures, and revenue sources. Schedule B covers the source  of contributions to charities and certain other exempt entities. Congress  has granted public access to Form 990 data in recognition of the  importance of public oversight to inform donors about how their money is  spent and to stem potential abuses. Private foundations, regardless of their  amounts of gross receipts or assets, are required file a Form 990-PF  information return annually.", "IRS oversight of tax-exempt entities generally relies on two activities.  First, IRS reviews applications for tax-exempt status to determine whether  a tax-exempt purpose is envisioned. IRS approves those applications that  are properly completed and for which the applicant can demonstrate to  the satisfaction of IRS that its activities or proposed activities meet the  requirements of the section under which exemption is claimed. Second,  IRS annually examines selected Forms 990 to determine whether the  exempt entities meet various requirements (such as properly reporting  unrelated business income tax). In general, IRS attempts to select entities  that it believes are likely to have violated requirements. Based on  examination evidence, IRS can accept the Form 990 as filed or change the  status of the entity, impose excise taxes for certain types of violations, or  revoke the exempt status if the violations are serious enough. As  appropriate, IRS can also assess other types of taxes, such as employment  taxes or unrelated business income taxes.", "In 2004, the Senate Committee on Finance asked a panel of experts to  make recommendations to Congress to improve oversight, transparency,  and governance in the tax-exempt sector. To do so, the Independent  Sector convened a Panel on the Nonprofit Sector in October 2004, which  included 24 nonprofit and philanthropic leaders. The Panel issued a final  report in June 2005 with over 120 recommendations, several focusing on  donor-advised funds and supporting organizations. On the basis of this  report and other information, Congress has considered proposals to  impose more restrictions and requirements on donor-advised funds and  supporting organizations to better ensure that their contributions advance  charitable rather than private interests and that their donors do not exert  control or receive private benefits. Provisions in legislative proposals that  apply to donor-advised funds have included providing a formal definition  of a fund, setting minimum payout requirements, and placing restrictions  on dealings with those who may privately benefit from charitable  activities. Provisions related to supporting organizations have included  those that would apply certain private foundation rules and restrictions,  such as those on the annual payout requirement and excess business  holding rules."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To compare the federal laws and regulations on donor-advised funds and  supporting organizations with those for private foundations, we reviewed  the IRC, Treasury regulations, IRS publications, and various other  documents describing these laws and regulations.

We used the surveys to obtain  data on donor-advised funds because this information was not identifiable  on the Form 990. To determine the reliability of the donor-advised fund  data, we interviewed The Chronicle of Philanthropy staff about their  survey methodology. To obtain supporting organization and other tax- exempt charitable organization data fields, we obtained data from IRS\u2019s  Returns Inventory and Classification System (RICS) for tax years 1999  through 2003, the 5 most recent years of data available at the time of our  analysis. Because not all the data fields we wanted were available from  RICS, we obtained additional Form 990 data fields from GuideStar, an  organization that electronically captures Form 990 data for public access.  To assess the reliability of the RICS and GuideStar data, we interviewed  agency officials and conducted electronic data testing. In addition, we  reviewed a selection of Forms 990 submitted to IRS to confirm that the  values on the form matched those in the database. While we identified  some minor discrepancies, we determined that the Form 990 data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. The data files we obtained included  the population of tax-exempt charities filing returns for those years,  including supporting organizations and private foundations. Using  computer software to analyze these data files, we determined summary  statistics and converted dollar amounts to 2005 constant dollars. For our  discussion on \u201cpayout\u201d rate, compensation, and Form 990 revisions, we  performed literature searches and interviewed 20 knowledgeable  individuals from IRS\u2019s Statistics of Income (SOI) program and Tax-Exempt  & Government Entities (TE/GE) division, Urban Institute, and  Congressional Research Service (CRS).", "To describe the types of noncompliance and promotion methods involving  donor-advised funds and supporting organizations, we reviewed IRS  summaries of examination cases. To obtain anecdotal information about  noncompliance involving donor-advised funds and supporting  organizations, we also interviewed 4 managers at IRS who oversee  examinations of donor-advised funds and supporting organizations and 7  individuals knowledgeable about the tax-exempt community who work at  organizations such as the Council on Foundations and the Independent  Sector. We also interviewed 6 financial professionals and 11 community  foundation managers on how donor-advised funds and supporting  organizations are promoted to clients for abusive transactions. We also  reviewed an IRS research report on developing abusive promoter leads  through searching the Internet.", "To provide additional information on noncash contribution valuation  methods (see app. III), we reviewed IRS publications and forms and  interviewed an IRS field specialist working on valuation issues in the Large  and Mid-Sized Business operating division.

At the same time, federal tax law generally imposes  fewer restrictions and requirements on donor-advised funds and  supporting organizations, but provides them and their donors less control  over the use and investment of the charitable assets compared to private  foundations; in fact, section 501(c)(3) and federal regulations do not  specifically mention donor-advised funds.", "As a general principle, the more control that a donor has over the use of  the charitable contributions and assets, the more regulations and  restrictions apply. Table 1 discusses how federal tax law views donor- advised funds and supporting organizations compared to private  foundations across a number of variables.", "Among the three types of charitable-giving vehicles, donor-advised funds  allow donors to create a long-term vehicle for supporting charities with  relatively less administrative burden because the fund is managed by a  third party. Furthermore, donor-advised funds are not required to file  separate tax returns, file for tax-exempt status, or adhere to private  foundation rules. The donor can make a gift and take an income tax  deduction for that tax year, and at that time or later, advise which charities  should receive the distribution. However, in doing so, the donor gives up  control over the distribution of the gift to charities.", "Supporting organizations are public charities that are to support one or  more public charities or certain other tax-exempt organizations. They fall  in between a donor-advised fund and a private foundation in terms of  restrictions and sanctions versus donor control over the use of the  charitable assets. For example, donors who create a supporting  organization avoid private foundation excise taxes and other rules and  face fewer restrictions on the deductibility of their donations at the  expense of having less control compared to donors at a private  foundation, such as involvement on the board. The level of control that the  supported charity has over the supporting organization varies by the three  basic types of supporting organizations. Type I supporting organizations  are \u201coperated, supervised, or controlled by\u201d the supported charitable  organization. Type II supporting organizations are \u201csupervised or  controlled in connection with\u201d the supported organization. In contrast,  Type III supporting organizations only are \u201coperated in connection with\u201d  the supported organization (see fig. 2).", "In reforming the rules for charitable organizations in 1969, Congress made  changes to restrict and regulate private foundations more than public  charities. Private foundations are generally funded and controlled by a  single or small number of donors and therefore may be prone to potential  abuses, particularly by disqualified persons. As a result, private  foundations are subject to anti-abuse rules and related sanctions that are  not applicable to donor-advised funds, supporting organizations, and  public charities as a whole. For example, public charities, including donor- advised fund operators and supporting organizations, are subject to  restrictions and two related excise taxes for activities involving political  expenditures (section 4955) and excess benefit transactions (section  4958). In contrast, private foundations are subject to six excise taxes for  activities involving  investment income (section 4940);    self-dealing (section 4941);  failure to distribute income (section 4942);    excess business holdings (section 4943);   investments that jeopardize the charitable purpose (section 4944); and    certain \u201ctaxable expenditures\u201d (section 4945).", "Although public charities, such as donor-advised fund operators and  supporting organizations, and private foundations are subject to different  restrictions on transactions with disqualified persons, both excess benefit  and self-dealing restrictions are intended to prevent inurement or undue  private benefit, which are prohibited for all section 501(c)3 organizations.  Inurement is the transfer or use of the charity\u2019s assets or income to or for  the benefit of a charity\u2019s insiders. All transactions that more than  incidentally benefit insiders, other than reasonable compensation and  arm\u2019s length transactions, are prohibited inurement transactions. Private  benefit is a broader concept, and may involve a transfer or use of a  charity\u2019s assets or income by private persons who are not necessarily  insiders. Some private benefit may be allowed, but if present, must be no  more than incidental to the exempt purpose being served.", "Unlike with donor-advised funds and supporting organizations, a private  foundation is required under section 4942 to distribute annually a  minimum amount of its funds, equal to approximately 5 percent of the fair  market value of the foundation\u2019s noncharitable use of assets (generally,  stocks and other investments that compose the foundation\u2019s endowment).  In 1984, Congress passed legislation that clarified what expenses can be  included towards meeting this minimum \u201cpayout\u201d requirement. If this  \u201cpayout\u201d rate is unmet, the foundation is subject to paying taxes on the  undistributed amount."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Donor-Advised Funds, Supporting Organizations, and Private Foundations Hold Billions of Dollars in Assets, but Some Organizational Characteristics Cannot Be Reliably Determined from Form 990 Data", "paragraphs": ["Donor-advised funds hold billions of dollars in assets, and supporting  organizations and private foundations hold hundreds of billions of dollars  in assets.

Using 2003 data from Forms 990 and 990-PF, we found differences  between supporting organizations and private foundations. For instance,  in 2003, private foundations tended to report more total assets and  contributions received but fewer revenues and expenses compared to  supporting organizations. However, certain other characteristics of  supporting organizations cannot be reliably determined from the Form 990  because this information is either not required to be reported or may be  misreported for various reasons, according to IRS. Specifically, supporting  organizations are not required to report a payout rate or to pay out a  minimum amount of funds to charities, as private foundations must do.

However, supporting organizations reported more  revenue but also more expenses by 2003 compared to private foundations.  Furthermore, comparing 1999 to 2003, supporting organizations tended to  report growth in all of these areas while private foundations reported  declines in revenue and contributions received. We were unable to  determine the reasons for these changes, but the year-to-year variations  during 2000, 2001, and 2002, in part due to a significant stock market  decline during this time, provided some insights (see app. II for summary  tables with annual data).

As a result, directly comparing  supporting organizations and private foundations or other tax-exempt  charitable organizations can pose challenges. Being able to make these  comparisons is important in order to address concerns, such as how much  and how often supporting organizations pay out to charities, since, like  private foundations, supporting organizations can be used to accumulate  contributions prior to distributing the money to charity, but, unlike private  foundations, they do not have a minimum payout requirement to support  charities that must be annually reported.", "Because supporting organizations do not have this payout requirement,  they do not explicitly report a payout rate, as is required for private  foundations. Certain lines on the Form 990-PF allow IRS, and the public, to  determine whether private foundations have met their required payout  rate. For supporting organizations, factors that are included in the payout  calculation for private foundations might not be readily determined from  the Form 990. Absent being able to identify these additional data and  clarifying how they are to be accounted for in a supporting organization  payout rate, consistently comparing supporting organizations\u2019 and private  foundations\u2019 payout rates cannot be done. Similarly, for donor-advised  funds, payout rate has not been statutorily required or defined and  consequently is also not required to be reported on the Form 990, and  available data do not allow a payout rate to be determined.", "Despite these difficulties, researchers have studied different ways to  compute a payout rate for supporting organizations. A 2005 Urban  Institute study found that supporting organization payout rates could vary  due to factors such as the purpose of the organization and which lines on  the Form 990 were included in determining how much support was  provided. The study pointed out that differences in supporting  organization payout rates may reflect differences in the purpose and  operation of the supporting organizations, rather than the amount of  charitable support provided. For example, some supporting organizations  provide operational services to their supported charities, rather than  provide grants. Supporting organizations can serve to pool or manage  investments or endowments for their supported organization, hold real  estate, or provide services, such as office or property management. Payout  rates for these types of supporting organizations might indeed be low or  infrequent, since these organizations do not hold and distribute charitable  funds like other supporting organizations or private foundations whose  primary purpose is grant-making.", "While the Form 990 includes a supporting organization\u2019s grants and net  assets, using only those lines to determine a payout rate may provide an  incomplete picture of the supporting organization\u2019s charitable activity. In  2002, supporting organizations reported over $7 billion in grants as  transfers of charitable support. However, in the Urban Institute study,  researchers found that transfers of support from a supporting organization  to its supported organizations were reported on 1 or more of at least 10  lines on the Form 990. While the amounts reported on these lines might  include transfers of support, the Form 990 line data alone are generally not  enough to determine how much of the amount reported, if any, supports  charities. For example, they found that organizations they sampled  sometimes reported transfers of support to a supported organization on  the line for rental expenses. However, only by examining Form 990-related  documentation, which an Urban Institute researcher said required  considerable effort, could they determine this result. In 2003, supporting  organizations reported over $431 million on this Form 990 line, but  without significant effort, one cannot determine how much, if any, of this  amount consisted of transfers of support to supported organizations.", "Another challenge in using Form 990 data to determine financial  characteristics arises when analyzing compensation paid to executives and  employees of tax-exempt organizations, such as supporting organizations.  In 1999 and 2003, supporting organizations reported over $894 million and  over $1 billion, respectively, in total executive compensation. Private  foundations reported almost $739 million in 1999 and about $812 million in  2003 in total executive compensation (see app. II for data tables).  Organizations are required to report compensation for certain employees  on the Form 990 and Schedule A. However, according to IRS managers,  misreporting is not uncommon, although some may be unintentional, in  such areas as deferred executive compensation, payments made to  relatives, and compensation paid from related entities, such as a for-profit  subsidiary of a tax-exempt organization paying the salary of an employee  or board member of its parent tax-exempt organization. In addition, an IRS  researcher had concerns that compensation could be overreported for tax- exempt organizations within a network, such as a health care network of  hospitals. In such networks, which commonly include supporting  organizations, compensation for board members can be misreported on  the Forms 990 when related organizations have common board members.", "IRS is currently working on an initiative to identify and stop abuses by  public charities and private foundations that pay excessive compensation  and benefits to their officers and other insiders. Beginning in late 2004, IRS  contacted a broad spectrum of over 1,800 public charities and private  foundations seeking information about their compensation practices and  procedures. IRS also just started a new phase of the initiative, involving an  additional 250 contacts about loans to officers, directors, and key  employees. The goals for the initiative are to  learn how exempt organizations determine and manage compensation;    gauge the existence and effectiveness of exempt organizations\u2019  controls over compensation issues;  learn how exempt organizations report compensation on Forms 990  and 990-PF;    address instances of questionable compensation practices, as well as  compensation of specific individuals; and  increase exempt organizations\u2019 awareness of compensation-related tax  issues.", "The initial results of the compensation initiative will be included in a  report that is expected to be completed in late August or September 2006.

In addition, an IRS manager said that having supported  organizations\u2019 EINs would facilitate IRS\u2019s ability to track how  compensation is treated between supporting organizations and supported  organizations. IRS emphasized that any form changes must be balanced  against the increased burden on taxpayers of supplying additional  information.", "Other organizational characteristics for which IRS collects limited data on  Form 990 include relationships with foreign entities, noncash  contributions, loan recipients, and donor information. We were unable to  closely evaluate these characteristics because IRS had limited data and  information to provide and because of time constraints. Although the costs  and burdens of collecting additional data to determine these  organizational characteristics and protecting taxpayer privacy are  legitimate concerns, IRS has acknowledged the need for greater  transparency and better data to track the flow of funds between donors  and charities.

Board control can occur directly by controlling more than 50  percent of board voting power or veto power granted to disqualified  persons. Alternatively, board control can occur indirectly through a  disqualified person influencing board members who are not disqualified  persons, according to IRS managers. Retaining access to assets can also  signify direct or indirect control of a supporting organization. In one case,  IRS has questioned whether or not a donor controlled the operations and  investments of the supporting organization that the donor founded,  although the donor did not receive private benefit.

Second, IRS has no established  population of donor-advised funds for which to estimate a noncompliance  rate.

Although exempt organizations must maintain documentation  that they operate exclusively for exempt purposes, the existence and  quality of these documents may differ among organizations, according to  IRS managers.

Despite regulatory guidance, IRS is unable to  identify all noncompliant situations because it cannot always identify  influence on board members by disqualified persons, especially when  attempting to identify a disqualified person\u2019s indirect influence.  Nomination of a majority of board members by a disqualified person  may signify this influence, but IRS cannot consistently track the  origination of a board nomination. Only in some cases are trust  documents and meeting minutes available that may document the  nomination process, according to IRS.

The donor, serving as the business\u2019s general  partner, retains some ownership of the partnership and has a  management responsibility or controls voting stock. According to an  IRS manager, unless the supporting organization has other assets, this  situation would likely allow the donor to have effective control over  the assets of the supporting organization. In some situations, the  business may claim that the general partner lacks controlling power, in  which case IRS managers said examiners must rely on available  evidence, such as partnership agreements, to determine the  donor/partner\u2019s control over the business.

No laws or regulations require annual minimum payouts to  charities from donor-advised funds, but according to IRS management,  idle assets are unlikely to result in benefits. Conversely, a donor- advised fund may be idle in paying out to build an endowment. If a  supporting organization has a low payout rate, however, IRS said this  can sometimes signify that it is not fulfilling its requirement. Legislation  has been introduced in Congress to impose a minimum payout on  donor-advised funds and supporting organizations.

Loans made by public  charities to officers, directors, donors, and others are legal, provided  that they are repaid and not made at terms lower than the market rate.  According to IRS, charities could justify these loans as an investment.  However, these loans may carry risk or introduce a conflict of interest.  For example, if a borrower has some form of control over the  organization, such as that of a board member or executive, it is less  likely that the organization will take legal action if the loan is not  repaid. Also, loans may prevent assets from being paid out to charitable  purposes. Furthermore, if a loan is made as part of an employee  compensation package, in some cases it may be classified as an excess  benefit under IRC section 4958, according to IRS management.  Additionally, these loans may signify control by disqualified persons.  Even if a loan\u2019s interest rate is reasonable, or the borrower is not an  employee or in control of the organization, the terms of the loan may  give a borrower other benefits, thus making a case that the  organization serves private rather than public purposes.

For example,  material from a financial planner offered a hypothetical estate plan  proposing that a supporting organization hold a wealthy donor\u2019s personal  assets, thus facilitating a reduction in estate taxes upon the donor\u2019s death.  The plan proposed transferring land owned by the donor to the supporting  organization, who would offer the sale of the land to the donor\u2019s heirs at  about 10 percent of its fair market value.

He added  that artwork, while well-publicized in terms of valuation issues, is less of a  concern since the dollar amounts involved are small compared to other  types of noncash contributions. In addition, the IRS manager identified the  following challenges to addressing noncompliance, gathered from about  100 examination cases:    donors are sometimes vague when describing the contribution on Form  8283, impeding IRS\u2019s understanding and ability to address any  problems;    donors can submit Form 8283 upon examination, creating problems  with detecting problems early;    corporate donors of patents can structure the contribution (e.g., pay  maintenance fees on the patent) so that the donee is not required to file  a Form 8282 upon disposition of the contribution;    no requirement exists that noncash contribution amounts reported on a  donor\u2019s tax return and a charity\u2019s Form 990 must match;    donors take improper deductions without adverse impact to the    multiple appraisals of contribution value are not helpful because  appraisals are very subjective.", "To address some of these concerns, IRS has several initiatives looking at  specific types of noncash contributions, such as vehicle donations and art  valuations.

Factors that may  influence a donor\u2019s decision include: types of causes they wish to support,  the size and type of donation they wish to give, and their desired  involvement level in directing the use of their donation. For example,  some donors, who desire to donate to a specific community or to have in- depth information on charities receiving their funds, might find that a  donor-advised fund administered by a community foundation is an  appealing option. Community foundations, which typically have a local  focus, may do particularly well at performing due diligence on charities  receiving their funds, according to one estate planner. Due diligence may  include identifying organizations listed in IRS Publication 78, or  interacting with exempt organizations that are potential recipients of  funds, according to community foundation managers.", "To evaluate giving options in relation to their goals, donors may seek  information from accountants, financial planners, lawyers, community  foundations, the Internet, and tax-exempt organizations, among others.  Some exempt organizations\u2019 efforts to market donation options tend to be  limited, according to a study by a nonprofit philanthropic research and  development organization. This makes personal and business relationships  important ways for donors to learn about donor-advised funds and  supporting organizations, according to community foundation managers.  Because many donor-advised funds are administered by community  foundations or are housed in charities affiliated with commercial  investment firms, such as Vanguard and Fidelity, these relationships may  be particularly important sources for introducing donors to donor-advised  funds, according to a community foundation manager interviewed by The  Chronicle of Philanthropy. According to several community foundation  managers, many donors to community foundation donor advised funds are  referred from professional advisers. Recognizing the importance of these  relationships, some community foundations have launched specific  outreach efforts aimed at financial advisers and other professionals who  could refer donor-advised fund clients.", "In addition to discussions with professionals, donors may encounter or be  presented with a variety of material explaining charitable giving options.  Material may contain details of giving options in relation to both tax  incentives to the donor and charitable benefits for the exempt  organization. Some firms advertise services for clients in magazines or  national publications, according to IRS managers and an estate lawyer,  while others depend on the Internet. Descriptions of professional services  can include outlines of charitable giving options, some of which attempt to  explain giving options based on the legal, practical, and charitable  characteristics of each option. For example, some community  foundations, philanthropy organizations, and investment firms provide  tables or descriptions comparing various combinations of donor-advised  funds, supporting organizations, private foundations, and other donation  options.
