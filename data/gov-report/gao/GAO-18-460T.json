Further, subsequent OMB  guidance on the law\u2019s implementation, issued in June 2015, directed  agency CIOs to define processes and policies for their agencies which  ensure that they certify that IT resources are adequately implementing  incremental development.", "However, in May 2014, we reported that 66 of 89 selected investments  at five major agencies did not plan to deliver capabilities in 6-month  cycles, and less than half of these investments planned to deliver  functionality in 12-month cycles. We also reported that only one of the five  agencies had complete incremental development policies. Accordingly,  we recommended that OMB clarify its guidance on incremental  development and that the selected agencies update their associated  policies to comply with OMB\u2019s revised guidance (once made available),  and consider the factors identified in our report when doing so.", "Four of the six agencies agreed with our recommendations or had no  comments, one agency partially agreed, and the remaining agency  disagreed with the recommendations. The agency that disagreed did not  believe that its recommendations should be dependent upon OMB taking  action to update guidance. In response, we noted that only one of the  recommendations to that agency depended upon OMB action, and we  maintained that the action was warranted and could be implemented.", "Subsequently, in August 2016, we reported that agencies had not fully  implemented incremental development practices for their software  development projects. Specifically, we noted that, as of August 31, 2015,  22 federal agencies had reported on the Dashboard that 300 of 469  active software development projects (64 percent) were planning to  deliver usable functionality every 6 months for fiscal year 2016, as  required by OMB guidance. The remaining 169 projects (or 36 percent)  that were reported as not planning to deliver functionality every 6 months,  agencies provided a variety of explanations for not achieving that goal.  These included project complexity, the lack of an established project  release schedule, or that the project was not a software development  project.", "Further, in conducting an in-depth review of seven selected agencies\u2019  software development projects, we determined that 129 out of 287  software development projects delivered functionality every 6 months for  fiscal year 2015 (45 percent) and 113 out of 206 software projects (55  percent) planned to do so in fiscal year 2016. However, significant  differences existed between the delivery rates that the agencies reported  to us and what they reported on the Dashboard. For example, for four  agencies (the Departments of Commerce, Education, Health and Human  Services, and the Treasury), the percentage of delivery reported to us  was at least 10 percentage points lower than what was reported on the  Dashboard. These differences were due to (1) our identification of fewer  software development projects than agencies reported on the Dashboard and (2) the fact that information reported to us was generally more current  than the information reported on the Dashboard.", "We concluded that, by not having up-to-date information on the  Dashboard about whether the project is a software development project  and about the extent to which projects are delivering functionality, these  seven agencies were at risk that OMB and key stakeholders may make  decisions regarding the agencies\u2019 investments without the most current  and accurate information. As such, we recommended that the seven  selected agencies review major IT investment project data reported on  the Dashboard and update the information as appropriate, ensuring that  these data are consistent across all reporting channels.", "Finally, while OMB has issued guidance requiring agency CIOs to certify  that each major IT investment\u2019s plan for the current year adequately  implements incremental development, only three agencies (the  Departments of Commerce, Homeland Security, and Transportation) had  defined processes and policies intended to ensure that the CIOs certify  that major IT investments are adequately implementing incremental  development. Accordingly, we recommended that the remaining four  agencies\u2014the Departments of Defense, Education, Health and Human  Services, and the Treasury\u2014establish policies and processes for  certifying that major IT investments adequately use incremental  development.", "The Departments of Education and Health and Human Services agreed  with our recommendation, while the Department of Defense disagreed  and stated that its existing policies address the use of incremental  development. However, we noted that the department\u2019s policies did not  comply with OMB\u2019s guidance and that we continued to believe our  recommendation was appropriate. The Department of the Treasury did  not comment on its recommendation.", "More recently, in November 2017, we reported that agencies needed to  improve their certification of incremental development. Specifically,  agencies reported that 103 of 166 major IT software development  investments (62 percent) were certified by the agency CIO for  implementing adequate incremental development in fiscal year 2017, as  required by FITARA as of August 2016. Table 1 identifies the number of  federal agency major IT software development investments certified for  adequate incremental development, as reported on the IT Dashboard for  fiscal year 2017.", "Officials from 21 of the 24 agencies in our review reported that challenges  hindered their ability to implement incremental development, which  included: (1) inefficient governance processes; (2) procurement delays;  and (3) organizational changes associated with transitioning from a  traditional software methodology that takes years to deliver a product, to  incremental development, which delivers products in shorter time frames.  Nevertheless, 21 agencies reported that the certification process was  beneficial because they used the information from the process to assist  with identifying investments that could more effectively use an  incremental approach, and used lessons learned to improve the agencies\u2019  incremental processes.", "In addition, as of August 2017, only 4 of the 24 agencies had clearly  defined CIO incremental development certification policies and processes  that contained descriptions of the role of the CIO in the process and how  the CIO\u2019s certification will be documented; and included definitions of  incremental development and time frames for delivering functionality  consistent with OMB guidance. Figure 7 summarizes our analysis of  agencies\u2019 policies for CIO certification of the adequate use of incremental  development in IT investments.", "Lastly, we reported that OMB\u2019s capital planning guidance for fiscal year  2018 (issued in June 2016) lacked clarity regarding how agencies were  to address the requirement for certifying adequate incremental  development. While the 2018 guidance stated that agency CIOs are to  provide the certifications needed to demonstrate compliance with  FITARA, the guidance did not include a specific reference to the provision  requiring CIO certification of adequate incremental development. We  noted that, as a result of this change, OMB placed the burden on  agencies to know and understand how to demonstrate compliance with  FITARA\u2019s incremental development provision. Further, because of the  lack of clarity in the guidance as to what agencies were to provide, OMB  could not demonstrate how the fiscal year 2018 guidance ensured that  agencies provided the certifications specifically called for in the law.", "In August 2017, OMB issued its fiscal year 2019 guidance, which  addressed the weaknesses we identified in the previous fiscal year\u2019s  guidance. Specifically, the revised guidance requires agency CIOs to  make an explicit statement regarding the extent to which the CIO is able  to certify the use of incremental development, and to include a copy of  that statement in the agency\u2019s public congressional budget justification  materials. As part of the statement, an agency CIO must also identify  which specific bureaus or offices are using incremental development on  all of their investments.", "In our November 2017 report, we made 19 recommendations to 17  agencies to improve reporting and certification of incremental  development. Eleven agencies agreed with our recommendations, 1  partially agreed, and 5 did not state whether they agreed or disagreed.  OMB disagreed with several of our conclusions, which we continued to  believe were valid.", "In total, from May 2014 through November 2017, we made 42  recommendations to OMB and agencies to improve their implementation  of incremental development.

This policy requires agencies to conduct an  annual, agency-wide IT portfolio review to, among other things, reduce  commodity IT spending. Such areas of spending could include software  licenses.", "In May 2014, we reported on federal agencies\u2019 management of software  licenses and determined that better management was needed to achieve  significant savings government-wide. In particular, 22 of the 24 major  agencies did not have comprehensive license policies and only 2 had  comprehensive license inventories. In addition, we identified five leading  software license management practices, and the agencies\u2019  implementation of these practices varied.", "As a result of agencies\u2019 mixed management of software licensing,  agencies\u2019 oversight of software license spending was limited or lacking,  thus potentially leading to missed savings. However, the potential savings  could be significant considering that, in fiscal year 2012, 1 major federal  agency reported saving approximately $181 million by consolidating its  enterprise license agreements, even when its oversight process was ad  hoc. Accordingly, we recommended that OMB issue needed guidance to  agencies; we also made 135 recommendations to the 24 agencies to  improve their policies and practices for managing licenses. Among other  things, we recommended that the agencies regularly track and maintain a  comprehensive inventory of software licenses and analyze the inventory  to identify opportunities to reduce costs and better inform investment  decision making.", "Most agencies generally agreed with the recommendations or had no  comments.

For instance, most of the 22 selected agencies did not  identify all of their IT contracts. The selected agencies identified 78,249  IT-related contracts, to which they obligated $14.7 billion in fiscal year  2016. However, we identified 31,493 additional contracts with $4.5 billion  obligated, raising the total amount obligated to IT contracts in fiscal year  2016 to at least $19.2 billion.

For example, the Department of State did  not identify 1 percent of its IT contract obligation dollars. Conversely, 8  agencies did not identify over 40 percent of their IT-related contract  obligation dollars. Many of the selected agencies that did not identify  these IT acquisitions did not follow OMB guidance. Specifically, 14 of the  22 agencies did not involve the acquisition office in their process to  identify IT acquisitions for CIO review, as required by OMB. In addition, 7  agencies did not establish guidance to aid officials in recognizing IT. Until  agencies involve the acquisitions office in their IT identification processes  and establish supporting guidance, they cannot ensure that they will  identify all IT acquisitions. Without proper identification of IT acquisitions,  agencies and CIOs cannot effectively provide oversight of these  acquisitions.", "In addition to not identifying all IT contracts, 14 of the 22 selected  agencies did not fully satisfy OMB\u2019s requirement that the CIO review and  approve IT acquisition plans or strategies. Further, only 11 of 96 randomly  selected IT contracts at 10 agencies that we evaluated were CIO- reviewed and approved as required by OMB\u2019s guidance. The 85 IT  contracts not reviewed had a total possible value of approximately $23.8  billion.", "Until agencies ensure that CIOs are able to review and approve all IT  acquisitions, CIOs will continue to have limited visibility and input into  their agencies\u2019 planned IT expenditures and will not be able to use the  increased authority that FITARA\u2019s contract approval provision is intended  to provide. Further, agencies will likely miss an opportunity to strengthen  CIOs\u2019 authority and the oversight of IT acquisitions. As a result, agencies  may award IT contracts that are duplicative, wasteful, or poorly  conceived.", "As a result of this report, we made 39 recommendations, including that  agencies ensure that acquisition offices are involved in identifying IT and  issue related guidance and ensure that IT acquisitions are reviewed  according to OMB guidance.

Ensuring program staff have the necessary  knowledge and skills is a factor commonly identified as critical to the  success of major investments. If agencies are to ensure that this critical  success factor has been met, then IT skill gaps need to be adequately  assessed and addressed through a workforce planning process.", "In this regard, we reported that four workforce planning steps and eight  key activities can assist agencies in assessing and addressing IT  knowledge and skill gaps. Specifically, these four steps are: (1) setting  the strategic direction for IT workforce planning, (2) analyzing the  workforce to identify skill gaps, (3) developing and implementing  strategies to address IT skill gaps, and (4) monitoring and reporting  progress in addressing skill gaps. Each of the four steps is supported by  key activities (as summarized in table 3).", "However, in our November 2016 report, we determined that the five  agencies that we selected for in-depth analysis had not fully implemented  key workforce planning steps and activities.For example, four of these  agencies had not demonstrated an established IT workforce planning  process.
