Two central findings from a 2013 GAO report remain current:", "No overarching federal privacy law governs the collection and sale of personal information among private-sector companies , including information resellers (data brokers). Instead, a variety of laws are tailored to specific purposes, situations, or entities. For example, the Fair Credit Reporting Act limits use and distribution of personal information collected or used to help determine eligibility for such things as credit or employment. Other laws apply to health care providers, financial institutions, or to online collection of information about children.", "Gaps exist in the federal privacy framework . With regard to data that private-sector entities use for marketing, no federal statute provides consumers the right to learn what information is held about them and who holds it. In many cases, consumers also do not have the legal right to control the collection or sharing with third parties of sensitive personal information (such as their shopping habits and health interests) for marketing purposes. In 2013 and in 2015, GAO also reported that the statutory framework for consumer privacy did not fully address new technologies\u2014such as online tracking and facial recognition\u2014and the vastly increased marketplace for personal information, including the proliferation of information sharing among third parties.", "In two 2019 reports, GAO found additional gaps in the federal privacy framework and potential limitations in regulatory authority under current privacy law. Internet content providers and internet service providers collect, use, and share information from customers to enable their services, support advertising, and for other purposes. Although the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) generally has addressed internet privacy through its unfair and deceptive practices authority, and other agencies have used industry-specific statutes, there is no comprehensive federal privacy statute with specific internet privacy standards for the private sector. GAO also reported that the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, a key law governing the security of consumer information, does not provide FTC with civil penalty authority for violations of the privacy and data security provisions of the act. New and more advanced technologies and changes in the marketplace for consumer information have vastly increased the amount and nature of personal information collected and the number of parties using or sharing it. Such changes warrant reconsideration of how well the current privacy framework protects personal information."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In 2013, GAO recommended that Congress consider strengthening the consumer privacy framework to reflect the effects of changing technologies and markets.

Information resellers (also  known as data brokers) are companies that collect and resell information  on individuals. Privacy concerns about resellers stem, in part, from  consumers not always knowing what personal information is collected  and how it is used. Moreover, growing use of the internet, social media,  and mobile applications has intensified privacy concerns because these  media make it much easier to gather personal information, track online  behavior, and monitor individuals\u2019 locations and activities.", "My remarks today are primarily based on our September 2013 report on  privacy issues related to the consumer data that information resellers  collect, use, and sell, and on our 2015 and 2019 High Risk Reports. In  2013, we found that the framework of federal laws relating to the privacy  of consumer information had gaps. We recommended that Congress  consider strengthening the consumer privacy framework to reflect  changes in technology and the marketplace. In our 2015 High Risk  Report, we expanded an area of concern\u2014cybersecurity\u2014to include  protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information. We also  conducted more recent work in the consumer privacy area on facial  recognition technology, financial technology, internet privacy, and  consumer data protection. In our 2019 High Risk Report, we reiterated  our recommendation that Congress consider what additional actions are  needed to protect consumer privacy. My statement will focus on the (1)  existing federal laws and regulations related to the privacy of consumer  information held by information resellers and (2) any gaps that may exist  in this legal framework.", "For our September 2013 report (GAO-13-663), we reviewed and  analyzed relevant laws, regulations, and enforcement actions. We  interviewed representatives of federal agencies, trade associations,  consumer and privacy groups, and resellers to obtain their views on data  privacy laws related to resellers. The work for our 2015 report on facial  recognition technology (GAO-15-621), 2018 report on financial  technology (GAO-18-254), and January and February 2019 reports on  internet privacy and consumer data protection (GAO-19-52 and  GAO-19-196) included analyzing laws and regulations and interviewing  representatives of federal agencies, regulators in other countries, market  participants, consumer advocacy groups, and academia. For this  statement, we verified that findings of our previous reports about gaps in  the statutory framework for consumer information privacy remain relevant.  More details about our scope and methodology can be found in our  published reports.", "We conducted the performance audit on which the majority of this  statement is based from August 2012 through September 2013, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Resellers maintain large, sophisticated databases with consumer  information that can include credit histories, insurance claims, criminal  records, employment histories, incomes, ethnicities, purchase histories,  and interests.

Resellers also may obtain personal information from the profile or public  information areas of websites, including social media sites, or from  information on blogs or discussion forums. Depending on the context,  information from these sources may be publicly available or nonpublic.", "In 1973, a U.S. government advisory committee first proposed the Fair  Information Practice Principles for protecting the privacy and security of  personal information. While these principles are not legal requirements,  they provide a framework for balancing privacy with other interests. In  2013, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  (OECD) developed a revised version of the principles (see table 1).", "The Fair Information Practice Principles served as the basis for the  Privacy Act of 1974\u2014which governs the collection, maintenance, use,  and dissemination of personal information by federal agencies. The  principles also were the basis for many Federal Trade Commission (FTC)  and Department of Commerce privacy recommendations and for a  framework for consumer data privacy the White House issued in 2012."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Laws Apply in Specific Circumstances to Consumer Data That Resellers Hold", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in 2013 and as continues to be the case, no overarching  federal privacy law governs the collection, use, and sale of personal  information among private-sector companies, including information  resellers. There are also no federal laws designed specifically to address  all the products sold and information maintained by information resellers.  Federal laws addressing privacy issues in the private sector are generally  narrowly tailored to specific purposes, situations, types of information, or  sectors or entities\u2014such as data related to financial transactions,  personal health, and eligibility for credit. These laws include provisions  that limit the disclosure of certain types of information to a third party  without an individual\u2019s consent, or prohibit certain types of data collection.  The primary laws include the following:  Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). FCRA protects the security and  confidentiality of personal information collected or used to help make  decisions about individuals\u2019 eligibility for credit, insurance, or  employment. It applies to consumer reporting agencies that provide  consumer reports. Accordingly, FCRA applies to the three nationwide  consumer reporting agencies (commonly called credit bureaus) and to  any other information resellers that resell consumer reports for use by  others. FCRA limits resellers\u2019 use and distribution of personal data\u2014for  example, by allowing consumers to opt out of allowing consumer  reporting agencies to share their personal information with third parties for  prescreened marketing offers.", "Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). GLBA protects nonpublic personal  information that individuals provide to financial institutions or that such  institutions maintain. GLBA sharing and disclosure restrictions apply to  financial institutions or entities that receive nonpublic personal information  from such institutions. For example, a third party that receives nonpublic  personal information from a financial institution to process consumers\u2019  account transactions may not use the information or resell it for marketing  purposes.", "Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996  (HIPAA). HIPAA establishes a set of national standards to protect  certain health information. The HIPAA privacy rule governs the use and  disclosure of an individual\u2019s health information for purposes including  marketing. With some exceptions, the rule requires an individual\u2019s  written authorization before a covered entity\u2014a health care provider that  transmits health information electronically in connection with covered  transactions, health care clearinghouse, or health plan\u2014may use or  disclose the information for marketing. The rule does not directly restrict  the use, disclosure, or resale of protected health information by resellers  or others not considered covered entities under the rule.", "Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA  and its implementing regulations apply to the collection of information\u2014 such as name, email, or location\u2014that would allow someone to identify or  contact a child under 13. Covered website and online service operators  must obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting such information.  COPPA may not directly affect information resellers, but the covered  entities are potential sources of information for resellers.", "Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA). ECPA  prohibits the interception and disclosure of electronic communications by  third parties unless an exception applies (such as one party to the  communication consenting to disclosure). For example, the act would  prevent an internet service provider from selling the content of its  customers\u2019 emails to a reseller for marketing purposes, unless the  customers had consented to disclosure. However, ECPA provides more  limited protection for information considered to be \u201cnon-content,\u201d such as  a customer\u2019s name and address.", "Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), Section 5. The FTC Act  prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.  Although the act does not explicitly grant FTC the specific authority to  protect privacy, FTC has interpreted it to apply to deceptions or violations  of written privacy policies. For example, if a retailer\u2019s written privacy policy  stated customers\u2019 personal information would not be shared with resellers  and the retailer later sold information to such parties, FTC could bring an  enforcement action against the retailer for unfair and deceptive practices.", "Some states also have enacted laws designed to regulate resellers\u2019  sharing of personal information about consumers. For example, in 2018,  Vermont passed a law that contains, among other requirements,  consumer protection provisions related to data brokers.

FCRA provides individuals with certain  access rights, but only when information is used for credit eligibility  purposes. And GLBA\u2019s provisions allowing consumers to opt out of  having their personal information shared with third parties apply only in  specific circumstances. Otherwise, under federal law, individuals  generally cannot require that their personal information not be collected,  used, and shared.

In our 2015 report we concluded that the future  trajectory of this technology raised questions about consumer privacy.  We found that federal law does not expressly address the circumstances  under which commercial entities can use facial recognition technology to  identify or track individuals, or when consumer knowledge or consent  should be required for the technology\u2019s use. Furthermore, in most  contexts federal law does not address how personal data derived from  the technology may be used or shared. The privacy issues stakeholders  raised about facial recognition technology and other biometric  technologies in use at the time of our 2015 report served as yet another  example of the need to adapt federal privacy law to reflect new  technologies.

For example, fintech lenders offer a variety of  loans such as consumer and small business loans and operate almost  exclusively online. In our 2018 report, we noted that while these lenders  may still assess borrowers\u2019 creditworthiness with credit scores, they also  may analyze large amounts of additional or alternative sources of data to  determine creditworthiness. We also found that some fintech firms may  collect more consumer data than traditional lenders. For example, fintech  lenders may have sensitive information such as consumers\u2019 educational  background or utility payment information, and according to certain  stakeholders, these data may contain errors that cannot be disputed by  consumers under FCRA.", "Furthermore, some data aggregators may hold consumer data without  disclosing what rights consumers have to delete the data or prevent the  data from being shared with other parties. A leak of these or other data  held by fintech firms may expose characteristics that people view as  sensitive. GLBA generally requires fintech firms and traditional financial  institutions to safeguard nonpublic personal information about  customers. Our 2018 report discussed that some fintech firms use new  technologies or mobile device features to mitigate data privacy risks and  that some regulators have issued guidance to consumers publicizing  practices that help maintain privacy when using online products and  services, including those provided by fintech firms. Regulators also have  issued GLBA guidance to businesses, including fintech firms,  recommending that they adopt policies and procedures to prevent, detect,  and address privacy threats."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Internet Privacy Issues", "paragraphs": ["Online tracking. In our 2013 report, we found that no federal privacy law  explicitly addresses the full range of practices to track or collect data from  consumers\u2019 online activity. Cookies allow website operators to recall  information such as user name and address, credit card number, and  purchases in a shopping cart. Resellers can match information in cookies  and their databases to augment consumer profiles. Third parties also can  synchronize their cookie files with resellers\u2019 files. Advertisers can use  third-party cookies\u2014placed on a computer by a domain other than the  site being visited\u2014to track visits to the websites on which they advertise.  While current federal law does not, with some exceptions, explicitly  address web tracking, FTC has taken enforcement actions related to web  tracking under its authority to enforce the prohibition on unfair or  deceptive acts. For example, in 2011, FTC settled charges with Google  for $22.5 million after alleging that Google violated an earlier privacy  settlement with FTC when it misrepresented to users of Apple\u2019s Safari  web browser that it would not track and serve targeted advertisements to  Safari users. Google agreed to disable its advertising tracking cookies.", "Mobile devices. In 2013, we also explained that no federal law  comprehensively governs applications software for mobile devices.  Application developers, mobile carriers, advertisers, and others may  collect an individual\u2019s information through services provided on a mobile  device. However, FTC has taken enforcement action against companies  for use of mobile applications that violate COPPA and FCRA. The  agency also has taken action under the FTC Act. We and others have  reported that the capability of mobile devices to provide consumer\u2019s  location engenders privacy risks, particularly if companies use or share  location data without consumers\u2019 knowledge. ECPA might not apply if  location data were not deemed content and would not govern entities that  are not covered by ECPA. But FTC could pursue enforcement action if a  company\u2019s collection or use of the information violated COPPA.", "More recently, in January of this year, we issued a report on internet  privacy that reinforces what we reported in 2013. To varying extents,  internet content providers and internet service providers collect, use, and  share information from their customers to enable their services, support  advertising, and for other purposes. Consumers access such services  through mobile phones and tablets, computers, and other internet- connected devices. However, there is no comprehensive federal privacy  statute with specific standards. FTC has been addressing internet privacy  through its unfair and deceptive practices authority, among other statutes,  and other agencies have been addressing this issue using industry- specific statutes. We concluded that recent developments regarding  internet privacy suggest that this is an appropriate time for Congress to  consider comprehensive internet privacy legislation. To address such  privacy concerns, states and other countries have adopted privacy rules.  For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation,  which came into force in May 2018, is a set of privacy rules that give  consumers control over the collection, use, and sharing of their personal  information, and California passed its own privacy law in June 2018 that  becomes effective in 2020."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Regulatory Authorities under Current Law May Be Limited", "paragraphs": ["In February of this year, we reported that FTC does not have civil penalty  authority for initial violations of GLBA\u2019s privacy and safeguarding  requirements, which, unlike FCRA, includes a provision directing federal  regulators and FTC to establish standards for financial institutions to  protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security of  customer records. To obtain monetary redress for these violations, FTC  must identify affected consumers and any monetary harm they may have  experienced. However, harm resulting from privacy and security violations  (such as a data breach) can be difficult to measure and can occur years  in the future, making it difficult to trace a particular harm to a specific  breach. As a result, FTC lacks a practical enforcement tool for imposing  civil money penalties that could help to deter companies from violating  data security provisions of GLBA and its implementing regulations. We  recommended that Congress consider giving FTC civil penalty authority  to enforce GLBA\u2019s safeguarding provisions.", "Additionally, in our January 2019 report, we found that FTC had not yet  issued regulations for internet privacy other than those protecting financial  privacy and the internet privacy of children, which were required by law.  FTC uses its statutory authority under the FTC Act to protect consumers  from unfair and deceptive trade practices. For FTC Act violations, FTC  may promulgate regulations but is required to use procedures that differ  from traditional notice-and-comment processes and that FTC staff said  add time and complexity. In addition, under this authority, FTC can  generally only levy civil money penalties after a company has violated an  FTC final consent order. In our recommendation that Congress consider  developing comprehensive internet privacy legislation, we also suggested  that such legislation consider providing rulemaking and civil money  penalty authorities to the proper agency or agencies.", "In summary, new technologies have vastly changed the amount of  personal information private companies collect and how they use it. But  our current privacy framework does not fully address these changes.  Laws protecting privacy interests are tailored to specific sectors and uses.  And, consumers have little control over how their information is collected,  used, and shared with third parties for marketing purposes. As a result,  current privacy law is not always aligned with the Fair Information  Practice Principles, which the Department of Commerce and others have  said should serve as the foundation for commercial data privacy. Thus,  the privacy framework warrants reconsideration by Congress in relation to  consumer interests, new technologies, and other issues.", "Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and Members of the  Committee, this concludes my statement.
