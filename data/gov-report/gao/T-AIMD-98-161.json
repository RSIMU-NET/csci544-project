As the world\u2019s most advanced and most dependent user of information technology, the United States possesses close to half of all computer capacity and 60 percent of Internet assets. As a result, the coming century change presents a particularly sweeping and urgent challenge for entities in this country.", "For this reason, we have designated the Year 2000 computing problem as a high-risk area for the federal government, and have published guidanceto help organizations successfully address the issue. Since early 1997 we have issued over 35 products detailing specific findings and recommendations related to the Year 2000 readiness of a wide range of federal agencies.", "The common theme of these reports has been that serious vulnerabilities remain in addressing the federal government\u2019s Year 2000 readiness. Much more action is needed to ensure that federal agencies satisfactorily mitigate Year 2000 risks to avoid debilitating consequences. Vital economic sectors of the nation are also vulnerable. These include state and local governments; telecommunications; banking and finance; health, safety, and emergency services; transportation; utilities; and manufacturing and small business.", "While actions by government and industry are underway throughout the nation, the creation of the President\u2019s Council on Year 2000 Conversion represents an opportunity to orchestrate the leadership and public/private partnerships essential to confronting the unprecedented challenges that our nation faces. My testimony today will briefly outline our views on what additional actions must be taken to reduce the nation\u2019s Year 2000 risks, and what our inquiries into Year 2000 readiness found at Social Security, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) and Medicare, and at the Department of the Treasury."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Risk of Year 2000 Disruptions Requires Leadership", "paragraphs": ["The public faces the risk that critical services could be severely disrupted by the Year 2000 computing crisis. Financial transactions could be delayed, airline flights grounded, and national defense affected. The many interdependencies that exist among the levels of governments and within key economic sectors of our nation could cause a single failure to have wide-ranging repercussions. While managers in the government and the private sector are acting to mitigate these risks, a significant amount of work remains.", "The federal government is extremely vulnerable to the Year 2000 issue due to its widespread dependence on computer systems to process financial transactions, deliver vital public services, and carry out its operations. This challenge is made more difficult by the age and poor documentation of many of the government\u2019s existing systems and its lackluster track record in modernizing systems to deliver expected improvements and meet promised deadlines.", "Year 2000-related problems have already occurred. For example, an automated Defense Logistics Agency system erroneously deactivated 90,000 inventoried items as the result of an incorrect date calculation. According to the agency, if the problem had not been corrected (which took 400 work hours), the impact would have seriously hampered its mission to deliver materiel in a timely manner.", "Our reviews of federal agency Year 2000 programs have found uneven progress, and our reports contain numerous recommendations, which the agencies have almost universally agreed to implement. Among them are the need to establish priorities, solidify data exchange agreements, and develop contingency plans.", "One of the largest, and largely unknown, risks relates to the global nature of the problem. With the advent of electronic communication and international commerce, the United States and the rest of the world have become critically dependent on computers. However, with this electronic dependence and massive exchanging of data comes increasing risk that uncorrected Year 2000 problems in other countries will adversely affect the United States. And there are indications of Year 2000 readiness problems internationally. In September 1997, the Gartner Group, a private research firm acknowledged for its expertise in Year 2000 computing issues, surveyed 2,400 companies in 17 countries and concluded that \u201chirty percent of all companies have not started dealing with the year 2000 problem.\u201d"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Additional Actions Must Be Taken to Reduce Nation\u2019s Year 2000 Risks", "paragraphs": ["As 2000 approaches, the scope of the risks that the century change could bring has become more clear, and the federal government\u2019s actions have intensified. This past February, an executive order was issued establishing the President\u2019s Council on Year 2000 Conversion. The Council Chair is to oversee federal agency Year 2000 efforts as well as be the spokesman in national and international forums, coordinate with state and local governments, promote appropriate federal roles with respect to private-sector activities, and report to the President on a quarterly basis.", "As we testified in March, there are a number of actions we believe the Council must take to avert this crisis. In a report issued just last week, we detailed specific recommendations. The following summarizes a few of the key areas in which we recommend action:", "Because departments and agencies have taken longer than recommended to assess the readiness of their systems, it is unlikely that they will be able to renovate and fully test all mission-critical systems by January 1, 2000. Consequently, setting priorities is essential, with the focus being on systems most critical to our health and safety, financial well being, national security, or the economy.", "Agencies must start business continuity and contingency planning now to safeguard their ability to deliver a minimum acceptable level of services in the event of Year 2000-induced failures. In March we issued an exposure draft of a guide providing information on business continuity and contingency planning issues common to most large enterprises; OMB recently adopted this guide as a model for federal agencies. Agencies developing such plans only for systems currently behind schedule, however, are not addressing the need to ensure business continuity in the event of unforeseen failures. Further, such plans should not be limited to the risks posed by the Year 2000-induced failures of internal information systems, but must include the potential Year 2000 failures of others, including business partners and infrastructure service providers.", "The Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) assessment of the current status of federal Year 2000 progress is predominantly based on agency reports that have not been consistently verified or independently reviewed. Without such independent reviews, OMB and the President\u2019s Council on Year 2000 Conversion have little assurance that they are receiving accurate information. Accordingly, agencies must have independent verification strategies involving inspectors general or other independent organizations.", "As a nation, we do not know where we stand overall with regard to Year 2000 risks and readiness. No nationwide assessment\u2014including the private and public sectors\u2014has been undertaken to gauge this. In partnership with the private sector and state and local governments, the President\u2019s Council could orchestrate such an assessment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Social Security Administration", "paragraphs": ["At this point I would like to address our findings at specific agencies, beginning with the Social Security Administration. We see significant progress at SSA, and it is essential that this progress continue. SSA has been anticipating the change of century since 1989, initiating an early response to the potential crisis. It made important early progress in assessing and renovating mission-critical mainframe systems\u2014those necessary to prevent the disruption of benefits\u2014and has been a leader among federal agencies.", "Three key risks remained, however, as discussed in our report of last October and testimony of this past March. One major risk concerned Year 2000 compliance of the 54 state Disability Determination Services (DDS) that provide vital support to the agency in administering SSA\u2019s disability programs. The second major risk concerned data exchanges, ensuring that information obtained from these thousands of outside sources\u2014such as other federal agencies, state agencies, and private businesses\u2014was not \u201ccorrupted\u201d by data being passed from systems not Year 2000 compliant. Third, such risks were compounded by the lack of contingency plans to ensure business continuity in the event of systems failure.", "We recommended several specific actions to mitigate these risks. These included (1) strengthening monitoring and oversight of state DDS Year 2000 activities, (2) expeditiously completing the assessment of mission-critical systems at DDS offices and using those results to establish specific plans of action, (3) discussing the status of DDS Year 2000 activities in SSA\u2019s quarterly reports to OMB, (4) quickly completing SSA\u2019s Year 2000 compliance coordination with all data exchange partners, and (5) developing specific contingency plans that articulate clear strategies for ensuring the continuity of core business functions.", "At the request of this Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Social Security and the Senate Special Committee on Aging, we are monitoring SSA\u2019s implementation of our recommendations. SSA has agreed with all of our recommendations, and actions to implement them have either been taken or are underway.", "Regarding state DDSs, SSA has enhanced its monitoring and oversight by establishing a full-time DDS project team, designating project managers and coordinators, and requesting biweekly status reports. Further, almost all states have now submitted initial Year 2000 plans; SSA now reports that 22 DDSs have had their systems renovated\\ tested, and implemented. In addition, beginning with its November 1997 report, SSA has included information on DDSs in its quarterly reports to OMB.", "SSA has also identified its external data exchanges and is in the process of coordinating with its partners to make the exchanges Year 2000 compliant. Further, SSA began working with the Department of the Treasury in March of this year to test for the disbursement of benefit checks and other direct deposit payments.", "Finally, in accordance with our guidance, SSA has completed a high-level, overall plan for business continuity. This plan represents a sound framework from which SSA can build its specific contingency plans. These specific plans\u2014for each core business area\u2014need to be developed to ensure that operations continue uninterrupted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicare and the Health Care Financing Administration", "paragraphs": ["As the nation\u2019s largest health insurer, Medicare expects to process over a billion claims and pay $288 billion in benefits annually by 2000. The consequences, then, of its systems\u2019 not being Year 2000 compliant could be enormous. In a report issued last May, we discussed the critical managerial and technical challenges facing the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) in its efforts to ensure the viability of systems to handle Medicare transactions into the next century.", "We found that HCFA had not required systems contractors to submit Year 2000 plans for approval. Further, it did not have contracts or other specific legal agreements with any contractors, other than one recently selected contractor, stating how or when the Year 2000 problem would be corrected, or whether contractors would certify that they would correct the problem.", "HCFA had also not identified critical areas of responsibility for Year 2000 activities. Although HCFA\u2019s regional offices have a role in overseeing contractor efforts, their specific Year 2000 responsibilities had not been defined, nor had guidance been prepared on how to monitor or evaluate contractor performance. While HCFA had been assessing the impact of the century change on its internal systems, it had not completed a similar review of Medicare contractors\u2019 claims processing systems. Further, HCFA had not required its contractors to prepare an assessment of the severity of impact of potential Year 2000 problems.", "Plans for independent validation of contractors\u2019 strategies and test plans were also lacking. Likewise, while HCFA had asked contractors to identify their system interfaces, it had no plans for approving the contractors\u2019 approaches for addressing interface and data exchange issues. Moreover, HCFA had not developed contingency plans to address continuity of business operations in the event of Year 2000-induced failures. HCFA officials were again relying on the contractors themselves to identify and complete the necessary work in time to avoid problems. Yet the contractors had not developed contingency plans\u2014and did not intend to\u2014because they considered this HCFA\u2019s responsibility.", "To address these deficiencies in HCFA\u2019s approach, we made several recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. These included identifying responsibilities for managing and monitoring Year 2000 actions, preparing an assessment of the severity of impact and timing of potential Year 2000 problems, and developing contingency plans. We also recommended that HCFA require its contractors to submit for review and approval (1) plans for identifying and correcting potential problems, including certification that their changes would correct the problems, (2) validation strategies and test plans for systems, and (3) plans for addressing interface and data exchange issues.", "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has agreed to implement our recommendations. For example, HCFA has established the position of Chief Information Officer (CIO); this individual has made the Year 2000 issue his top priority. HCFA has also established a Year 2000 organization, and the issue is included in HCFA\u2019s information technology investment process and annual performance plan goals. It is also developing business continuity and contingency plans, with a draft plan set for release this month. Further, the Medicare carriers\u2019 manual has been revised to require such contingency planning.", "It should be noted, however, that since our report of last year, HHS\u2019 and OMB\u2019s concerns about the Medicare contractors\u2019 systems have become more evident. For example, according to HHS\u2019 February 1998 quarterly Year 2000 report, \u201cHCFA\u2019s Medicare contractor systems continue to be of great concern to the Department.\u201d In addition, in its summary of all agencies\u2019 February 1998 reports, OMB concluded that HHS was making insufficient progress on Year 2000 due in large part to HCFA\u2019s delays.", "There are also indications that the agency has not documented the severity of impact of Year 2000-related failures\u2014in other words, how its core business functions would be affected if its automated information systems failed because of Year 2000-related problems. For example, if Medicare systems failed, the number of health services providers who would not be paid, paid late, or in incorrect amounts is unknown. HCFA has recently begun contingency planning that may address some of these issues. We are currently evaluating the effectiveness of HCFA\u2019s actions, at the request of the Senate Special Committee on Aging."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department of the Treasury", "paragraphs": ["With respect to the Department of the Treasury, we must first point out that\u2014unlike with Social Security and Medicare\u2014we have not completed a thorough assessment of the Department\u2019s Year 2000 readiness. However, we can describe some of what we have seen, and what Treasury officials themselves report. In addition, we have undertaken detailed work at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which will be discussed in a separate statement today.", "Treasury\u2019s role in delivering government services, such as Social Security and Medicare payments, is vital. Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service (FMS), for instance, as the government\u2019s cash receipts and disbursements agent and financial manager, represents the crossroads of financial activity for the federal government. However, the Department\u2019s progress in making systems Year 2000 compliant has been mixed. Bureaus such as its Office of Thrift Supervision are making good progress in converting their systems and in overseeing the conversion activities of the financial institutions that they regulate and inspect. In contrast, FMS is falling seriously behind schedule in converting some of its systems. Treasury Year 2000 program officials are aware of these and other related risks facing the Department, and have established program management structures and processes to address them, which we are presently evaluating.", "To perform their core business functions, Treasury and its bureaus rely on a vast\u2014and in many cases antiquated\u2014collection of systems, thereby complicating Year 2000 renovations. To integrate many of the bureaus\u2019 systems and permit them to interact and exchange information with a wide assortment of federal, state, and local government and private-sector data exchange partners (over 6,800, according to the Department), Treasury operates and maintains the largest non-Defense telecommunications network in the federal government.", "The responsibilities of Treasury\u2019s Year 2000 program office are basically twofold: guiding, monitoring, and reporting on the conversion activities of its bureaus; and converting and reporting on Departmentwide telecommunications systems that support its bureaus. To guide, monitor, and report on bureau activities, Treasury has (1) established a departmental program office and designated a program manager within the CIO organization, (2) established Year 2000 working groups and designated work group project managers to focus on major categories of systems, (3) issued a departmental Year 2000 conversion strategy, guidance, and standards, and (4) established monthly progress reporting requirements. Additionally, it used its existing CIO Council as a forum for Year 2000 information exchanges between the Department and bureau CIOs, hired a contractor to validate the information being reported by its bureaus, and developed draft guidance governing the process to be used in certifying systems as compliant and for verification and validation of certification determinations.", "As a result of this program office oversight, Treasury has a good appreciation of where its attention must be focused. Program officials recognize that progress among the bureaus has been uneven, as has progress within individual agencies for certain categories of systems. For example, they stated that FMS is Treasury\u2019s highest priority because of its slow progress to date and the criticality of its role in managing the government\u2019s finances. As a result, according to the Department\u2019s Year 2000 program manager, FMS progress and activities are tracked on a daily basis and, consequently, FMS Year 2000 management effectiveness has improved.", "Department Year 2000 officials further report that telecommunications systems and non-information technology (IT) areas, such as systems embedded in facilities and equipment, are not as far along as other IT areas, such as financial and management information systems, because work in these areas started late. To address this risk, Treasury has established working groups and project managers for both telecommunications and non-IT systems, along with formal processes for guiding, monitoring, and reporting on these areas.", "To address the conversion of its telecommunications systems, the program office has established a telecommunications working group and designated a project manager. A risk management plan has also been established, as has a test facility to permit all telecommunications systems components to be tested before being placed in operation. In addition, a contractor has been hired to perform independent verification and validation of telecommunications conversion activities.", "Despite these actions, Treasury and its bureaus face other major risks that must be managed effectively if key systems are to be ready in time. For example, the assessment phase\u2014during which the compliance of mission-critical systems is determined\u2014has not been completed. This is worrisome because it reduces the amount of time left for critical renovation, validation, and implementation activities. Treasury\u2019s milestone for assessing all mission-critical systems was July 1997. However, as of the end of March 1998, FMS still had not completed assessing the compliance of five of its mission-critical systems. For example, according to Treasury\u2019s latest status report, FMS is awaiting a contractor proposal for renovating a system called GOALS I\u2014for Government On-Line Accounting Link System I. This system plays a critical role in processing interagency payments and collections. Of particular note is that the need to assess GOALS I for renovation arose only recently, when it became apparent that GOALS II, intended to replace GOALS I, will not be ready in time.", "For non-IT systems, Treasury\u2019s components are farther behind. As of mid-March, systems in 3 of Treasury\u2019s 14 bureaus had still not been inventoried. Of the systems in the 11 inventoried bureaus, many remain to be assessed.", "A final risk area is that contingency plans for ensuring continuity of business operations have not yet been developed. As our guidance points out, business area priorities and system dependencies must be examined in light of possible Year 2000-induced failures; contingency planning to help ensure continuity of business operations must then be developed and tested.", "Although Treasury\u2019s Year 2000 program office recognizes the importance of business continuity planning and has issued guidance in this area, bureaus have not yet completed such plans, and are at risk of being unable to complete them in time. For example, IRS plans to develop contingency plans only for those business areas relying on systems whose conversions are behind schedule. With this approach, IRS will have no ready response to unexpected Year 2000-induced problems. Further exacerbating this problem is that devising and activating manual or contract processes to ensure continuity of operations could be a daunting task. According to a Treasury contractor, it may be difficult for some Treasury components, such as FMS, to formulate an approach to operating in a nonautomated environment.", "In conclusion, the change of century will present many difficult challenges in information technology and in ensuring the continuity of business operations, and has the potential to cause serious disruption to the nation and to government entities on which the public depends, including SSA, Medicare, and Treasury. These risks can be mitigated and disruptions minimized with proper attention and management. While these agencies and programs have been working to mitigate their Year 2000 risks, further action must be taken to ensure continuity of mission-critical business operations. Continued congressional oversight through hearings such as this can help ensure that such attention is sustained and that appropriate actions are taken to address this crisis.", "Madam Chairwoman, this concludes my statement.
