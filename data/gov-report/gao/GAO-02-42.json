State has taken a major step toward implementing Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 requirements by producing a fiscal year 2002 plan that is superior to earlier efforts.

Our review includes a discussion of State\u2019s past performance and future performance targets for counterterrorism and other key foreign policy efforts, which were developed prior to the terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C., on September 11, 2001. We recognize the events of that day and subsequent days may greatly alter State\u2019s approach to its strategic goals and objectives in many of the areas we examined for this review, particularly those involving counterterrorism. We hope that this report provides the department and others with insights that will assist them when developing new efforts to counter terrorism and protect American citizens, assets, and interests, both at home and abroad.", "In this review, we focused on the same outcomes we addressed in our June 2000 review of the department\u2019s fiscal year 1999 performance report and fiscal year 2001 performance plan to provide a baseline by which to measure the department\u2019s performance from year to year. These selected key outcomes are as follows:   eliminate the threat from weapons of mass destruction;   expand foreign markets for U.S. products and services;   enhance the ability of American citizens to travel and live abroad securely; reduce international crime and availability and/or use of illegal drugs; and reduce international terrorist attacks, especially against the United States and its citizens.", "As agreed, using the selected key outcomes for State as a framework, we (1) assessed the progress State has made in achieving these outcomes and the strategies the department has in place to achieve them and (2) compared State\u2019s fiscal year 2000 performance report and fiscal year 2002 performance plan with the department\u2019s prior year performance report and plan for these outcomes. Additionally, we agreed to analyze how State addressed its major management challenges, including the governmentwide high-risk areas of human capital and information security, that we and State\u2019s Inspector General identified.

New and valuable information on the plans, goals, and strategies of federal agencies has been provided since federal agencies began implementing GPRA. Under GPRA, annual performance plans are to clearly inform the Congress and the public of (1) the annual performance goals for agencies\u2019 major programs and activities, (2) the measures that will be used to gauge performance, (3) the strategies and resources required to achieve the performance goals, and (4) the procedures that will be used to verify and validate performance information. These annual plans, issued after transmittal of the President\u2019s budget, provide a direct linkage between an agency\u2019s longer-term goals and mission and day-to-day activities. Annual performance reports are to subsequently describe the degree to which performance goals were met. The issuance of the agencies\u2019 performance reports, due by March 31 of each year, represents a new and potentially more substantive phase in the implementation of GPRA\u2014the opportunity to assess federal agencies\u2019 actual performance for the prior fiscal year and to consider what steps are needed to improve performance and reduce costs in the future.", "The Department of State is the lead government agency representing U.S. interests overseas. As such, it is vested with a wide range of responsibilities, including formulating U.S. policy on diverse international issues, coordinating and implementing U.S. government programs and activities overseas, and influencing other countries to adopt policies and practices consistent with U.S. interests. The department, among other things, monitors and reports political, economic, and other developments in foreign countries; assists U.S. business overseas; provides services to U.S. citizens abroad; issues passports and visas; participates in international drug control programs; and manages facilities and provides security for U.S. personnel stationed at embassies and consulates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assessment of State\u2019s Progress and Strategies in Accomplishing Selected Key Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["This section discusses our analysis of State\u2019s performance in achieving its selected key outcomes and the strategies the department has in place, particularly regarding human capital and information technology, for accomplishing these outcomes. In discussing these outcomes, we have also provided information drawn from our prior work on the extent to which State verified and validated its performance data.", "It is difficult to determine the level of progress toward achieving the five key outcomes that are discussed in the performance report for fiscal year 2000. For some key outcomes, it is unclear what State was trying to accomplish, due to a lack of linkages between activity-based performance measures and outcomes and a failure to report on many of the performance indicators outlined in the plan for 2000. The department provided little discussion on why progress in meeting certain performance targets was not reported, why other performance targets were not met, and what strategies would be used to achieve the unmet (and unreported) performance targets. State\u2019s performance plan for 2002 discusses strategies to meet performance goals and more clearly links the key outcomes to strategies and performance indicators. In addition, the department developed new performance indicators for some key outcomes. However, as we reported in June 2000, many indicators continue to be output rather than outcome oriented, and some indicators are not readily measurable.", "The performance report for 2000 and the performance plan for 2002 discussed issues of data verification and validation for four of the five outcomes. In the performance report, State discussed data sources and the unit responsible for verifying data quality for four outcomes, but it did not discuss the frequency of data collection and the efforts taken to validate the data for three of those four outcomes (weapons of mass destruction, Americans traveling and living abroad, and counterterrorism). The 2002 plan discussed (1) the sources and management of performance data for four outcomes (weapons of mass destruction, Americans traveling and living abroad, international crime, and counterterrorism); (2) the frequency of data collection for two outcomes (international crime and counterterrorism); and (3) the validation of data for two outcomes (weapons of mass destruction and Americans traveling and living abroad). The department did not discuss how it will collect and validate performance data for the outcome of expanding foreign markets for U.S. goods and services.", "The performance report and performance plan provided detailed discussions of departmentwide strategic human capital and information technology efforts under the Diplomatic Readiness initiatives. However, other than for a few instances\u2014such as State\u2019s efforts to use the Internet for disseminating information on consular services and travel safety\u2014the report generally did not discuss these issues within the context of achieving the key outcomes. The performance plan for 2002 listed the number of staff positions the department requested for all five key outcomes, but it did not explain how changes in the number of these positions would affect the achievement of the outcomes. The performance plan included a detailed discussion of information technology issues related to providing services to American citizens traveling and living abroad, but it did not do so for the remaining four outcomes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Threat From Weapons of Mass Destruction", "paragraphs": ["State reported it achieved one of its four planned performance targets for this outcome, made progress toward achieving a second, did not achieve a third target, and made no progress toward its fourth target. However, for the two indicators for which State reported progress, one performance target was not achieved and progress toward the other was unclear because State did not provide a full description of its actual accomplishment.", "State\u2019s strategic goal for this key outcome was to eliminate the threat to the United States and its allies from weapons of mass destruction and destabilizing conventional arms. State\u2019s fiscal year 2000 performance plan identified one performance goal regarding the negotiation and implementation of nonproliferation treaties, agreements, and controls with Russia and the other Newly Independent States. To measure achievement of this goal, State focused on four performance indicators: (1) establishment of nonproliferation export controls in Russia and the other Newly Independent States, (2) progress on the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty III (START III) with Russia, (3) accession of Newly Independent States to the Chemical Weapons Convention, and (4) agreement between the United States and Russia on antiballistic missile defense and theater missile defense demarcation. Under nonproliferation activities, State\u2019s target was to have export controls in place in all 12 Newly Independent States, with a majority of these countries enforcing them. Actual performance showed that five countries (Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine) have the controls in place, and one (Ukraine) enforces them. State did not explain why the targets under this outcome were not met. For the second performance indicator, State reported that the United States and Russia held preliminary discussions about arms reductions under START III during 2000. While important, the result does not meet the target for 2000 of having a treaty signed by the United States and Russia. Under the third indicator, the department stated that 12 additional countries ratified or acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention, but it is unclear whether this achievement meets the planned target of 2 additional Newly Independent States joining the convention because the department did not report the countries that joined. Finally, State reported it made no progress related to antiballistic missile defense and theater missile defense demarcation because Russia was not willing to engage in formal discussions.", "The performance report discussed strategies to achieve the unmet performance goal of having all 12 Newly Independent States institute nonproliferation export controls and having the majority enforce them. The department stated that it has expanded into two distinct export control offices\u2014one focused on policy and the other on sanctions and assistance. However, State did not report why the performance targets were not met; thus it is difficult to determine how this strategy will help the department achieve the unmet target in the future. The report did not discuss why the START III negotiations were delayed or a likely time frame for when the negotiations would be completed and the treaty signed, nor did the report discuss the actions State will take to meet its targets for theater and antiballistic missile defense demarcation.", "Overall, the fiscal year 2002 plan provides a more clear definition of State\u2019s intended strategies and performance regarding weapons of mass destruction by organizing the performance goals and indicators in a more logical fashion. State\u2019s unified approach eliminated many goals and indicators that resulted from State\u2019s prior year approach that was devolved to the regional level. By focusing on agencywide, rather than regional, objectives and limiting its planning to nonmandated activities, State reduced the number of performance goals for this key outcome from 75 for fiscal year 2001 to 7 for 2002 and the number of performance indicators from 64 to 15. In addition, State will continue to use two categories for judging 2002 performance for this outcome\u2014successful and minimally successful\u2014each of which has specific associated levels of performance. However, some of the performance indicators and targets identified continue to lack valid measures of progress. For example, one new indicator measuring performance toward missile defense defines \u201csuccessful\u201d performance as \u201cundertak appropriate actions to implement U.S. Government decisions on missile defense.\u201d As in prior plans, State identified the agencies with which coordination is needed for each performance goal, yet failed to discuss the nature and extent of the coordination necessary or the new strategies that may be needed.", "In the performance report, State addressed data verification by stating the sources of data. The performance plan for 2002 provided the same information on data verification, in addition to the units responsible for data collection and management. However, the department did not indicate how it would verify the data.

State has deleted that indicator from its subsequent performance plan.", "State has two strategic goals in the trade area that we treated as one key outcome: (1) opening foreign markets to increase trade and free flow of goods, services, and capital and (2) expanding U.S. exports to $1.2 trillion by early in the 21st century. Performance goals and indicators were generally objective and measurable. Under the first of the selected outcomes\u2014opening markets\u2014four of five indicators were results oriented. However, it was difficult to see the relationship between one performance indicator\u2014number of countries maintaining a 90-day stock of petroleum\u2014and the outcome of opening markets to U.S. goods and services. Performance indicators for the second selected outcome, expanding U.S. exports, were also objective and measurable.

However, from our assessment, State had successfully achieved only three targets\u2014 the number of countries signing more liberal aviation agreements; the total sales of U.S. telecommunication and information technology equipment; and the total foreign operations revenues of U.S. telecommunications, including satellite services. For another indicator, the number of Newly Independent States and former Communist countries acceding to the World Trade Organization, State targeted four countries\u2014Georgia, Croatia, Lithuania, and Moldova. State said it successfully met the target because three countries joined the organization in 2000. However, only one of the targeted countries, Georgia, joined the organization during fiscal year 2000, while another joining country, Albania, was not on State\u2019s initial list. Croatia completed its entry requirement during fiscal year 2000, but did not formally join until November 30, 2000. Lithuania and Moldova did not join until well into fiscal year 2001. On the final indicator, the number of countries maintaining a 90-day petroleum stock reserve, we agree that State successfully met the target of having two target countries\u2014the Czech Republic and South Korea\u2014maintain 90-day petroleum reserves. However, the fact that seven other countries previously maintaining the desired level of oil stocks fell out of compliance with the standard negates this achievement. Regardless of whether State achieved the performance target, as we reported in June 2000, it is difficult to see a linkage between the number of countries maintaining a 90-day petroleum stock and the goal of expanding foreign markets for U.S. products and services. As such, State has dropped this indicator for both 2001 and 2002 performance.", "Although State did not establish clear fiscal year 2002 performance goals for this part of the key outcome, it did discuss the strategies to achieve the outcome and the indicators and performance targets it will use to judge progress. State will continue to work toward strengthening international frameworks for open markets for goods, services, and investment; integrating social policy goals into the international agenda for reforming economic policies and rules; ensuring openness of international markets for e-commerce and biotechnology; and integrating developing and transition economies into the world economy. To monitor performance, State will focus on 11 indicators.

In developing the 2000 performance plan in 1998, State set 3 targets related to bilateral investment treaties to be achieved in fiscal year 2000: (1) sign 4 additional treaties with undetermined countries, (2) conduct 8 ongoing treaty negotiations, and (3) engage in preparatory discussions with 50 countries. The target for the number of treaties signed was actually achieved during 1999, and State concentrated its efforts in 2000 \u201con obtaining advice and consent from the Senate on 10 previously signed treaties and engag in negotiations with 8 countries.\u201d The department did not indicate whether it was preparing discussions with additional countries.

State\u2019s two performance goals are to (1) provide support to U.S. businesses competing worldwide and (2) increase exports of oil and gas field equipment and services, telecommunications equipment and services, and agricultural produce. Strategies include promoting business and exports, supporting U.S. foreign direct investments, and promoting corporate responsibility and best practices. State will assess progress toward achieving the outcome using eight performance indicators that are generally objective and measurable. Although all of the indicators have specific baselines for 2000 and performance targets for 2002, most, such as the number of presentations to business audiences, are activity based. However, two indicators\u2014(1) telecommunications and information technology equipment sales and (2) agricultural exports\u2014are outcome oriented.

This performance goal was clearly defined, results oriented, and measurable. Furthermore, State established four measurable and objective performance indicators. However, one of the key services that State provides American citizens traveling abroad\u2014timely, effective passport issuance\u2014is not an indicator under this key outcome. Neither the performance plan for fiscal year 2000 nor the fiscal year 2000 performance report provides performance information on this prominent activity, although the 2000 report provides a narrative description of what State considers improved passport service.", "State dropped two of the four indicators prescribed by the performance plan for fiscal year 2000. The department reported that one of the indicators, status of the American Citizen Services system\u2019s Year 2000 compliance, is no longer applicable. For the other indicator, memoranda of understanding between State and commercial airlines serving U.S. citizen passengers in the event of an air disaster, State reported that specific memoranda are no longer necessary because new legislation and regulations serve the same purpose and that the target has been successfully achieved. In the report, State did not specifically cite the relevant legislative and regulatory changes.", "For the performance indicator of Internet usage to disseminate information on consular services and travel safety, State surpassed its target of receiving 150,000 hits per day on its Web page, averaging 240,000 hits per day. State also said it achieved its customer satisfaction targets for this indicator. However, it is difficult to determine whether the 2000 target for percent of users who found the information helpful was met. State reported that user satisfaction with consular Web site information was 90 percent, which was 5-percentage points below the target for 2000. State cited three primary sources of user dissatisfaction: (1) inability to get questions answered by telephone, (2) unwillingness or inability to call the passport information 900 (toll) telephone number, and (3) no listing of the winners of the Diversity Visa lottery. However, two of the reasons cited reflected dissatisfaction with telephone-based customer service rather than Web site content. Nonetheless, State said it met the target and therefore all aspects of the indicator. Further complicating the issue, State did not provide data on the relative influence the three sources of dissatisfaction had on the overall user satisfaction rate. Thus, the explanations seem incomplete.", "State also reported that it successfully met the final performance target, reducing the case workload per officer to left-behind parents in child abduction cases from 140 cases to 80, despite an actual reduction to 90 cases per worker. State officials told us they declared success for this performance indicator because the reduction was significant. However, State provided no explanation of why it was not successful in reducing the workload to 80 cases per officer. The department stated that progress toward achieving this target was due in large part to increasing the number of full-time staff from 11 to 26.", "In addition, State\u2019s strategy for enhancing American citizen services under the performance plan covering fiscal year 2000 indicated that the department would work closely with foreign governments to improve treatment of U.S. citizens incarcerated abroad, promote greater participation in multilateral treaties to which the United States is a party, and help other agencies provide efficient distribution of benefits overseas. Yet State provided no indicators or targets to measure progress in these areas. The 2000 performance report does not include these activities as strategies State used in fulfilling this goal. The plan also states that ratification of the Hague Convention on International Adoptions was expected and that State must make preparations for dealing with the increased workload the convention would entail. But State did not report on what preparations, if any, had been made for the convention\u2019s ratification or a resulting increase in workload.", "Although one of the key services State provides American citizens traveling abroad is the timely and effective issuance of passports, neither the 2000 performance plan nor the 2000 performance report provides performance information on this service.

Performance targets for 2002 include pilot testing and deploying systems that track international parental child abduction cases and international adoption cases. In addition, the system will track U.S. citizens who have been arrested overseas and instances of their mistreatment. State also will report on two passport service indicators: the number issued and the status of efforts to introduce digital passport photos.

To achieve these goals, State plans to continue using training-related items as strategies. In addition, State plans to work with other countries to develop new anticrime and antismuggling/trafficking operations, begin negotiating an international anticorruption agreement, and work with multilateral agencies to implement the Transnational Organized Crime Convention and related protocols. While some of the associated indicators are not easily quantifiable, performance requirements are generally results oriented.", "To achieve the objective related to reducing the entry of illegal drugs into the United States, State plans to employ numerous strategies to reduce the cultivation of illicit coca and opium poppy and foreign cultivation of marijuana.

The fiscal year 2000 report dropped the level or number of attacks as a performance indicator.", "For 2002, State\u2019s performance goals are to reduce the number of attacks, bring terrorists to justice, reduce or eliminate state sponsored terrorist acts, delegitimize the use of terror as a political tool, enhance international response, and strengthen international cooperation and operational capabilities to counter terrorism. To achieve these goals, State has developed strategies that strengthen international conventions and resolutions and U.S. laws; isolate sources of support, including freezing financial assets; and train foreign officials in counterterrorism through bilateral exercises. State will measure progress in 2002 using seven new indicators. State said it will report on the number of terrorist attacks and the rate of deaths and casualties against baseline data for fiscal year 2000, with performance targets to reduce the levels of each. The department also established an indicator and baseline for the number of countries signing and implementing international treaties on counterterrorism; however, part of the performance target for this indicator is unclear, focusing on \u201cincreased effective recourse to treaties for extraditions and renditions.\u201d Two indicators\u2014the level of cooperation and coordination among friendly governments and the level of professionalism, training, and quality of key equipment in key friendly countries\u2014are not easily measurable. State established baselines for each, stating the current level is fair or good, but it does not explain what is meant by these categories, nor how one measures \u201cincreased professionalism\u201d or \u201cimproved coordination.\u201d State used a similar baseline for another indicator, the successful collection of evidence and obtaining witness cooperation for prosecutions under U.S. laws, but the performance target\u2014increased use of foreign collected evidence and witnesses in U.S. prosecutions\u2014seems quantifiable and, we believe, should have a consistent baseline.", "Due to the sensitive nature of the information for the remaining two indicators\u2014(1) identification of terrorist threats and prevention of terrorist attacks and (2) the level of fund-raising activity on behalf of terrorist groups\u2014State reported no baseline data. Performance for the former indicator will be measured by assessing the number and lethality of attacks. The target for the latter indicator is a reduction in funds raised through front organizations.", "In the performance report, State addressed data verification by discussing the sources of performance data and the units responsible for data collection and management. The performance plan for 2002 also included a statement of the frequency of data collection, but it did not discuss how the data would be validated. The performance plan also stated that the number of staff positions for this outcome would be reduced by 23 percent (58 positions), but it did not state which areas would be affected by the cuts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comparison of State\u2019s Fiscal Year 2000 Performance Report and Fiscal Year 2002 Performance Plan With the Prior Year Report and Plan for Selected Key Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["For the selected key outcomes, this section describes major improvements or remaining weaknesses in State\u2019s (1) fiscal year 2000 performance report compared with its fiscal year 1999 report and (2) fiscal year 2002 performance plan compared with its fiscal year 2001 plan.

Two major weaknesses are that (1) many indicators continue to be activity based rather than outcome oriented and (2) relationships between some key outcomes and strategies and indicators remain unclear. In addition, State changed some indicators, or the methodologies for measuring them, with little or no discussion on why it did so; and like 1999, the department failed to report on many of the performance indicators defined by its plan for 2000. Moreover, State did not discuss strategies for addressing unmet (and unreported) performance targets and did not provide assessments of how performance in fiscal year 2000 could affect estimated performance levels for 2001."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Little Connection Between State\u2019s Actions and the Achievement of Key Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["The 2000 performance report continues to rely on activity- or output-based indicators, rather than outcome-oriented indicators; and State did not establish connections between its actions and the success or failure of key outcomes. We recognize that the nature of State\u2019s mission and operating environment makes it difficult for the department to avoid either having very broad key outcomes that are then not addressed sufficiently by the indicators or broad indicators that make it difficult to assess State\u2019s role in the outcome. Given this difficulty, we find it commendable that most reported indicators are quantifiable and that all reported indicators have baselines and targets. Nevertheless, as we suggested in 1999, there are opportunities to better describe State\u2019s outputs and clarify how they affect outcomes. For example, assessing whether terrorist attacks were reduced requires either a comparison of the relative number of terrorist attacks or a count of instances when specific attacks were prevented. In the 1999 report, one of the indicators for this issue was the \u201clevel of terrorist attacks against American citizens and interests.\u201d This indicator provided a direct measure of whether the goal was met (outcome), but it is unclear on what action the United States took (output) to influence the outcome. Rather than linking an action or strategy to the indicator, as noted above, in its 2000 report State did not report the number or severity of terrorist attacks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unclear Relationships Among Key Outcomes, Strategies, and Indicators", "paragraphs": ["The relationships between some strategies and key outcomes were not always apparent. For example, State does not clearly explain how some strategies, such as establishing law enforcement academies in southern Africa and New Mexico, related to the key outcome of minimizing the impact of international crime and stemming the flow of illegal drugs. State also reported on some indicators that were not clearly linked to key outcomes. For example, it is not clear how a nation maintaining a 90-day stock of petroleum reserves becomes a more open market for U.S. goods and services. In addition, reducing the caseload of overseas child- abduction investigators appears more closely related to reducing the impact of international crime on American citizens than providing efficient, knowledgeable, and courteous services to Americans traveling and living abroad.", "Furthermore, the relationship between performance indicators and strategies were not always clear. In particular, it is unclear whether each strategy is designed to pursue specific indicators under a performance goal or whether the strategies are part of a more general effort. For example, three of the five indicators for the key outcome, \u201copening foreign markets\u201d to U.S. goods and services, related to a single strategy\u2014 \u201dadvancing civil aviation, transport, telecommunications, and energy initiatives\u201d\u2014while most of the remaining nine strategies had no readily associated indicators."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Little or No Explanation for Changes to Performance Indicators", "paragraphs": ["Some indicators to measure performance in 1999 were changed in 2000 without explanation, which makes it difficult to track performance from one year to the next. For some indicators used in 1999, measurement methodologies were altered with no discussion in either the performance plan or performance report for 2000, resulting in orders of magnitude differences. For the indicator \u201csales of U.S. telecommunications and information technology equipment,\u201d State\u2019s 1999 performance report showed a 1998 baseline of $18.9 billion in sales and a 1999 target of $20.6 billion, but it did not provide actual performance for 1999. For the same indicator in 2000, State reported a 1998 baseline of $111 billion in sales, a 1999 actual level of $123 billion, a 2000 target of $120 billion, and a 2000 actual level of $140 billion. It is apparent that State changed the methodology for assessing this indicator, but the department did not explain why it did so.", "In addition, State changed past performance results for some indicators. For example, regarding expansion of markets for U.S. products and services, the actual level for the total exports of goods for 1999 cited in State\u2019s 1999 performance report was $693 billion. However, the 2000 performance report adjusted the 1999 actual level for the total exports of goods to $673 billion. State provided no explanation for this change. If the fiscal year 2000 report\u2019s actual level for 1999 is correct, then State did not reach its 1999 performance target of $685 billion that it reported it had successfully met in its 1999 performance report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comparison of Performance Plans for Fiscal Years 2001 and 2002", "paragraphs": ["In contrast to the performance report, State\u2019s 2002 plan represents a major improvement over 2001 by (1) focusing more on the overall agency level, rather than upon geographic regions; (2) eliminating redundant performance goals and indicators, and goals and indicators that were not clearly linked to outcomes; and (3) associating performance with necessary resources. However, the plan still has certain weaknesses. Many performance goals and indicators continue to be activity based rather than outcome oriented, and some performance indicators remain vague and unmeasurable. Furthermore, although State listed its partner agencies, offices, and bureaus; it did not explain its roles and responsibilities in these partnerships.", "State\u2019s performance plan for 2002 uses a more unified, agencywide approach than the regional focus used in the 2001 plan. This approach resulted in more clarity and the elimination of redundant material. State agreed with our 2000 assessment that the goals and objectives in the 2001 performance plan were overly scattered. State formed key outcome teams that identified performance goals for the department, rather than have the various bureaus set their own goals. Using this approach, State achieved a drastic reduction in the number of performance goals and indicators across all outcomes. For example, in 2000, we reported that State\u2019s plan for 2001 had 75 performance goals and 64 performance measures over 5 regions for its efforts to reduce threats from weapons of mass destruction. In the 2002 plan, State reduced the number of performance goals and measures to 7 and 15, respectively. By deleting redundancies, combining related or subsidiary goals and indicators, and eliminating goals and indicators not clearly linked to key outcomes, State devised a performance plan for 2002 that is more focused and is more useful for understanding its intentions and for monitoring progress against baselines.", "Another improvement over the plan for fiscal year 2001 is the inclusion of a resources summary for the selected outcomes. The performance plan for 2002 presented a summary chart showing the actual funding and number of positions for fiscal year 2000 and the estimated funding and number of positions for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 for each key outcome. However, the plan did not indicate how these resources would be applied to the various goals and strategies within the outcomes.", "Nonetheless, some deficiencies remain with State\u2019s 2002 plan. Many indicators continue to be activity based rather than outcome oriented. For example, regarding expansion of U.S. exports by $1.2 trillion, five of eight indicators describe outputs of activities, four of which tallied the number of meetings, conferences, and training opportunities, while the fifth indicator measured the status of the launching of an intranet Web site. In addition, a number of performance targets are vague and not measurable. For example, the target for \u201cstatus of bilateral investment policy dialogues\u201d for the opening of foreign markets outcome is undefined (\u201cmeasurable progress on improvement of investment climates\u201d). Similarly, it is unclear how progress will be measured for the counterterrorism indicator \u201clevel of coordination among friendly governments\u201d (\u201cimproved coordination in countries, including close allies, countries with major terrorist presence, and those receiving [antiterrorism and Foreign Emergency Support Team] training\u201d). In addition, it will be difficult to measure a \u201ceepening of new energy investment. . . resulting in increased flows of energy equipment and service exports from U.S. firms\u201d for oil and gas exports, even assuming a baseline for judging was provided. A better performance target would be the total value of oil and gas sector exports.", "Finally, although State provides a list of the agencies, offices, and bureaus working together to achieve the outcomes, it does not explain how the organizations interact or their respective roles. State\u2019s role in establishing international law enforcement academies and increasing the technical capabilities of law enforcement and judicial institutions, for example, is not as apparent as the roles played by some of its partnered agencies, such as the Department of Justice. Although State may be involved in negotiating agreements for establishing law enforcement academies and other training institutions, other organizations, such as the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development and Assistance Training, actually provide the training services."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State\u2019s Efforts to Address Its Major Management Challenges Identified by GAO", "paragraphs": ["We have identified two governmentwide high-risk areas: strategic human capital management and information security.

The department reported that one of its performance goals for 2002 is to be staffed with a fully skilled workforce. State reported the number of employees in training and related programs and other efforts to better prepare its existing workforce, declaring these efforts to be successful.

State did not detail performance goals, strategies, or measures to address one of these challenges\u2014rightsizing U.S. overseas presence\u2014in the performance plan. For that challenge, State reported it had been unable to achieve a consensus with other agencies, which is essential since rightsizing is an interagency effort.

Although we identified several areas where improvements can be made, such as developing indicators that are focused on results instead of outputs, we believe that the improved plan lays the groundwork for State to provide a more clear assessment of its performance and progress next year.
