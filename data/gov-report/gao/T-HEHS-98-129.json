This model is intended to address concerns about our educational system, including unresponsive school district bureaucracies, restrictive rules, and a lack of accountability for student performance. In addition, charter schools provide opportunities for parents and others to create schools that reflect their visions for their children\u2019s education, including design, governance, and delivery features. Charter schools are generally designed to operate with more autonomy from state and local rules and regulations than are other public schools. In exchange for this autonomy, charter schools are held accountable for meeting the terms of their charters, which may include achieving stipulated academic outcomes. Schools that do not meet the terms of their charters face revocation of their charters.", "Today, I will discuss charter schools\u2019 experiences in accessing selected federal funds\u2014namely, start-up grants and grants under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), factors that help and hinder charter schools in accessing title I and IDEA funds, and charter school operators\u2019 opinions about whether they are receiving a fair share of these funds. Finally, I will discuss state and federal efforts intended to help charter schools gain access to title I and IDEA funds. My discussion is based on the results of a study that we are conducting at your request. We are now preparing our final report, which we expect to issue in April.", "For this study, we have conducted case studies in seven states that collectively accounted for 91 percent of charter schools operating in the 1996-97 school year and surveyed by telephone a sample of 41 charter schools in these states. We also spoke with state department of education officials in each state and visited several charter schools located in four of the seven states. Because of our sampling methodology, our results can be applied to the charter schools operating in our sample states. (App. I provides additional information about our sample.)", "In summary, slightly more than half of the schools we surveyed received fiscal year 1996 start-up grants ranging from $7,000 to $84,000; the average grant amount was $36,000. The schools used the start-up grant funds for a variety of purposes, including curriculum materials and equipment, other technology, and facilities renovation or leasing. About two-fifths of the charter schools we surveyed received title I funds, and slightly more than half of the schools received IDEA funds or IDEA-funded special education services. Most charter school operators we surveyed who expressed an opinion told us they believe they received a fair share of federal title I and IDEA funds. Nonetheless, charter school operators also cited a variety of barriers to accessing title I and IDEA funds, including (1) difficulties in establishing program eligibility, (2) workload demands, and (3) a lack of program and administrative experience. They reported that outreach and technical assistance were critical to helping them access federal funds.", "Several states and the Department of Education have begun initiatives to help charter schools\u2019 access federal funds. Some states, for example, are revising or developing alternative allocation policies and procedures to better accommodate charter schools\u2019 access to federal funds and providing training and technical assistance to charter school operators.

In general, they are established under state law, do not charge tuition, and are nonsectarian. State charter school laws and policies vary widely regarding the degree of autonomy provided to the schools, the number of charter schools that may be established, the qualifications of charter school applicants and teachers, and the accountability criteria that charter schools must meet. As of September 1997, 29 states and the District of Columbia had enacted laws authorizing charter schools, according to the Center for Education Reform. In school year 1996-97, over 100,000 students were enrolled in nearly 500 charter schools in 16 states and the District of Columbia. (App. II shows the states with charter school laws as of September 1997 and the number of charter schools operating during the school year by state.)", "To explore the effects of various education reform efforts, in January 1997, the Congress began holding hearings in Washington, D.C., and around the country. Among other reform efforts, the Congress has focused on the development of charter schools. Charter school operators and others at the hearings raised concerns about charter schools\u2019 receiving the share of federal title I and IDEA grant funds they are eligible to receive. These concerns were raised in part because of differences in the way charter schools receive funds. Some charter schools receive funds directly from their states, while other charter schools depend on their local school districts for title I and IDEA program benefits. In addition to learning more about this issue, the Congress has expressed interest in learning how charter schools use federal funds intended to help them get started as new schools."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Public Charter Schools Grant Program", "paragraphs": ["To improve understanding of the charter school model, the Congress authorized the Public Charter Schools Program (start-up grants) as part of its 1994 reauthorization of ESEA. Under the program, the federal government provides financial assistance for the design and initial implementation of charter schools. The Department of Education has the authority to competitively award grants to states with laws authorizing the operation of charter schools. In evaluating state grant applications, the Department must use a peer review process and judge states\u2019 applications on the basis of several criteria, including the (1) contribution that a state\u2019s program will make toward helping educationally disadvantaged and other students in achieving state content and student performance standards, (2) degree of flexibility that a state will offer charter schools, and (3) likelihood that a state\u2019s program will improve students\u2019 educational results.", "States that receive grants, in turn, award subgrants to charter schools. (If a state does not apply for a grant, individual or groups of charter schools may apply directly for grants to the Department.) States may use up to 5 percent of their grant award for administration and may set aside 20 percent for establishing a charter school revolving loan fund. Grants awarded to charter schools must be used for either (1) the planning and design of a charter school, which may include establishing achievement and assessment standards and providing professional development for teachers and other staff, or (2) the initial implementation of a charter school, which may include informing the community about the school, acquiring equipment and supplies, developing curricula, or initial operational costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Title I and IDEA Programs", "paragraphs": ["Although dozens of financial aid programs exist for public elementary and secondary schools, two programs, title I and IDEA, are by far the largest federal programs.

Charter schools receive title I and IDEA funds from their SEAs therefore in states that treat charter schools as LEAs (called the independent model). LEAs allocate title I funds to schools in their districts. In addition, LEAs provide special education and related services to eligible children enrolled in their schools and use IDEA funds to help pay the costs of doing so. Charter schools in states that treat these schools as dependents of an LEA (called the dependent model) benefit from the title I and IDEA programs on the same basis as do the LEAs\u2019 other schools. The seven states in our review used both the independent and dependent funding models. Although Massachusetts and Minnesota consider all charter schools as independent LEAs, California and Colorado consider all charter schools as dependent members of a school district.

The federal statute and regulations lay out complex criteria and conditions that LEAs use in deciding how to allocate funds to their schools, which results in shifting title I funds received by LEAs to individual schools with relatively higher percentages of students from low-income families. An individual school that is part of an LEA in a high-poverty area therefore might have to have enrolled a higher percentage of low-income children to receive title I funds than it would have if the school were treated as an independent LEA. In this case, a charter school that would have received title I funds as an independent LEA may not receive title I funds under the dependent model because other schools in the LEA served higher percentages of low-income children."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IDEA Program", "paragraphs": ["The IDEA federal grant program is designed to help states pay for the costs of providing a free appropriate public education to all eligible children with disabilities between the ages of 3 and 21 living in the state, depending on state law or practice.

The most funding that a state may receive for any fiscal year is capped at 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure multiplied by the number of eligible children with disabilities in the state who receive special education and related services.", "Under the current formula, states must distribute at least 75 percent of the IDEA funds they receive from the Department to LEAs and may reserve the rest for state-level activities. In general, SEAs allocate IDEA funds to eligible LEAs on the basis of their relative share of their state\u2019s total number of eligible children receiving special education and related services.", "The benefits that individual schools may receive from IDEA funds vary by state. States may allocate IDEA funds to LEAs or to other agencies included in the act\u2019s definition of LEAs. These other agencies include, for example, regional educational service agencies authorized by state law to develop, manage, and provide services or programs to LEAs. Some states allocate IDEA funds to regional educational service agencies for providing special education and related services to children with disabilities enrolled in the schools of one or more LEAs, including charter schools.

For example, three charter school officials told us that because they had no prior year\u2019s enrollment or student eligibility data, they were not eligible under state guidelines for federal funds. School officials noted that besides this being a problem for new schools, using even 1-year-old enrollment data can significantly understate the number of title I-eligible students enrolled in schools that are incrementally increasing the number of grades they serve. Other school officials reported difficulty in collecting required student eligibility data because some families are reluctant, due to privacy concerns, to return surveys sent home with students asking for the amount of household income.", "Competing workload demands were another barrier reported by charter school officials. In our survey, several school officials emphasized that other administrative and educational responsibilities left them little time and resources to devote to accessing title I and IDEA funds. These officials often played many roles at their schools, including principal, office manager, nurse, and janitor. In addition, even though a majority of a charter school operators who noted in our survey that the title I and IDEA application processes were only somewhat or not at all difficult, some operators told us that, nonetheless, it was not worth their while to pursue these funds.

They told us that such inexperience may likely discourage individuals from pursuing federal funding for their schools. Some operators told us that their lack of experience with the title I and IDEA programs was a barrier to accessing these funds. In addition, charter schools represent new and additional responsibilities for districts and SEAs that administer federal programs.
