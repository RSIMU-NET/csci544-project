Supporters of a nationwide interstate banking law have argued that geographic restrictions no longer make sense in today\u2019s integrated financial and credit markets and, further, undermine the ability of U.S. banks to compete domestically and internationally. Opponents, however, feared that relaxing geographic restrictions could result in a concentration of economic power among a relatively small number of banks. Given these conflicting views, you asked us to review the experiences of some states that have had interstate banking for some period of time. Congress recently passed legislation lifting some restrictions on interstate banking and branching. On September 29, 1994, the President signed into law the Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act, hereafter termed the Interstate Banking Efficiency Act.", "In our November 1993 report, we reported on interstate banking and its (1) potential effect on the banking industry\u2019s structure nationwide; (2) implications for the safety and soundness of the banking industry, the Bank Insurance Fund, and the economy; and (3) associated risks and ways to minimize them. In that report, we said that the best way to minimize the potential risks to the quality and availability of banking services arising from interstate banking is to ensure that markets remain competitive through vigilant antitrust enforcement and that laws and regulations governing credit availability are enforced.", "This report discusses the experiences of three western states\u2014California, Washington, and Arizona\u2014which have operated in an environment permitting interstate banking and in-state branching. Specifically, we evaluated their experiences to determine whether these geographic laws have had any effect on the (1) market share and number of large banks,(2) viability of smaller banks, and (3) availability of credit to small businesses. This report provides useful information for Congress and regulators on the potential impact on states of lifting certain geographic restrictions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the passage of the Interstate Banking Efficiency Act, Congress largely had ceded to the states the power to determine how bank holding companies could branch within states or expand across state lines. Generally, states could permit a bank holding company to expand by (1) interstate banking\u2014acquiring bank subsidiaries outside its home state; (2) interstate branching\u2014establishing branches outside its home state; and (3) in-state branching\u2014acquiring branches throughout all or part of its home state.", "Section 3(d) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, commonly known as the Douglas Amendment, prohibited bank holding companies from acquiring a bank subsidiary in another state unless the state where the acquired bank was located specifically permitted such acquisitions. The Douglas Amendment had two central purposes: (1) to help alleviate concerns that economic power could be concentrated among a relatively small number of nationwide banking institutions and (2) to keep national and state-chartered banks on an even footing by giving states, not the federal government, authority over interstate banking. The McFadden Act of 1927 generally barred interstate branching for all national banks and all state-chartered banks that were members of the Federal Reserve System.A national bank was allowed to branch within its headquarters state to the extent that state law authorized branching by state banks.", "Over time, most states relaxed their interstate banking laws by enacting laws authorizing out-of-state bank holding companies to acquire in-state banks and bank holding companies. Many of these state laws had nationwide triggers, which allowed holding companies from anywhere in the country to acquire banks in those states. By year-end 1993, all but one state\u2014Hawaii\u2014permitted some form of interstate banking. Most states had laws permitting in-state branching. However, only eight states permitted interstate branching, and only for state-chartered Federal Reserve nonmember banks.", "Although most states had relaxed their interstate banking laws, some bankers urged Congress to enact a nationwide banking and branching law to facilitate the banking industry\u2019s ability to compete. They argued that without a nationwide law, banking companies must deal with each state separately, and that this was an expensive and inefficient process. Proponents of a nationwide interstate banking and branching law believed that removing restrictions would strengthen the banking industry and benefit customers by (1) increasing competition and geographic diversification, (2) reducing the need for customers to maintain separate accounts in different states, and (3) offering a wider range of products and services that are generally associated with larger banking companies.Opponents feared such actions would lead to adverse effects such as excessively concentrating assets and deposits under large banks\u2019 control, impairing smaller banks\u2019 survival, and reducing small businesses\u2019 access to credit.", "Congress passed a nationwide interstate banking and branching law, the Interstate Banking Efficiency Act, during the second session of the 103rd Congress. This act authorizes the Federal Reserve Board, effective 1 year from the date of enactment, to permit adequately capitalized and adequately managed bank holding companies to acquire banks located anywhere in the United States outside of the acquirer\u2019s home state without regard to state laws. In addition, the act provides for interstate mergers and branching by FDIC insured banks in states where such activity is permitted. First, beginning June 1, 1997, banks may merge across state lines so long as the states involved have not enacted laws which expressly prohibit interstate mergers before that date. Interstate mergers earlier than June 1, 1997, are allowed in states having laws that expressly allow them. Second, out-of-state banks may acquire branches, without acquiring the bank itself, but only if the state where the branch is located permits such transactions. Finally, the act permits national and state nonmember banks to enter states for the first time through the establishment of a new branch, if the state has a law expressly permitting such branching."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Three States Offer a Contrast", "paragraphs": ["The three states we focused on\u2014California, Washington, and Arizona\u2014allowed us to examine interstate banking and in-state branching provisions in a variety of banking and economic environments. According to many observers, California\u2019s large size, diversified economy, and relatively consolidated banking industry provides one example of how the nation might fare under nationwide banking and branching. California law has permitted in-state branching since the early 1900s and interstate banking since 1987. Several large California banks have branched throughout the state, but out-of-state banks have no significant presence.", "In contrast, once Washington and Arizona introduced interstate banking, out-of-state bank holding companies acquired the majority of the banking assets in each state. Washington had some restrictions on in-state branching until 1985 and passed interstate banking in two phases. First, in 1983, out-of-state banks were allowed to purchase failing in-state banks in Washington. Second, in 1987, out-of-state bank holding companies were permitted to purchase healthy Washington banks as long as the state where the acquirer was headquartered permitted reciprocal arrangements for bank holding companies headquartered in Washington. Arizona has had in-state branching since the 1870s and interstate banking since 1986.", "California, the most populous state in the nation, was considered economically sound until the early 1990s. Washington is a middle-sized state that since the mid-1980s has, for the most part, exhibited steady but more moderate economic growth than California. Arizona, also a middle-sized state, has in recent years experienced rapid economic growth followed by an abrupt downturn. All three states had relatively high rates of economic growth from 1984 through 1990. California\u2019s and Washington\u2019s gross state products grew 60 percent and 58 percent, respectively, while the national gross domestic product grew 46 percent during this 6-year period. Despite its economic problems, Arizona\u2014whose gross state product grew by 52 percent\u2014also grew at a faster rate than the nation as a whole. Although its real estate market suffered greatly, the remainder of Arizona\u2019s economy continued to grow.", "The three states fared differently in the national recession that began in 1990. California began to suffer from the effects of the recession in 1990; as of year-end 1993, economists saw its recovery lagging behind the nation\u2019s. Washington, in contrast, did not begin to suffer the effects of the recession until mid-1991, and economists did not expect the recession to be as prolonged or as deep as it was in California. Finally, Arizona had experienced economic problems well before the national recession began in 1990. In the late 1980s, Arizona\u2019s economy was severely hit by a variety of factors, the most frequently cited being the collapse of the real estate market. However, according to economists in the state, Arizona, like the nation, has started its economic recovery."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["In examining the experiences of the three states, we focused on a broader period\u2014December 1984 through June 1993\u2014than the period when interstate banking laws became effective in those states. We did this because the three states phased in the relaxation of interstate banking laws over time. For example, California began lifting interstate banking restrictions in 1987; Washington in 1983; and Arizona in 1986. Further, two of the states\u2014California and Arizona\u2014have permitted in-state branching for many decades. In addition, many geographic restrictions on banking were removed by states permitting out-of-state banks to expand into the states we examined; many mergers among financial institutions occurred (some involving the largest banks in the western states); and a nationwide recession took place.", "In each of the three states, to evaluate the degree of market share among large and smaller banks, we (1) analyzed call report data maintained by FDIC on banks\u2019 profitability and market share, along with data on mergers, failures, and new charters maintained by both federal and state regulators; (2) reviewed economic research; and (3) met with regulators, bankers, and other interested parties. To assess the availability of credit for small businesses, we examined banks\u2019 asset portfolio data, interviewed bankers, and met with focus groups in 11 markets. Our focus groups were composed of individuals who helped businesses apply for bank financing, SBA officials, officials of city and county departments of economic development, and former bankers.", "Although the focus group results could not be statistically generalized as representative of small businesses, they offered us a practical means of obtaining a small business perspective on credit availability. Further, since the scope of our work was limited to California, Arizona, and Washington, we could not extrapolate our observations to other states.", "FDIC provided written comments on a draft of this report. These comments are presented and evaluated on page 17 and 18 and are reprinted in appendix V. We also requested comments from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Reserve. OCC said it had no substantive comments and the Federal Reserve did not provide comments, which is its policy when we do not make recommendations.", "We conducted our work from June 1992 through June 1994 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We present a more detailed discussion of our scope and methodology in appendix I."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Large Banks\u2019 Market Share in the Three States Changed Little", "paragraphs": ["Studies have shown a link between the removal of branching restrictions and banking industry consolidation within a state. On the basis of such studies, many observers predicted that nationwide interstate banking and branching would also lead to consolidation. Such consolidation had not occurred in the three states covered by this report, in part perhaps, because the bank concentration levels for these three states were already high. For example, of the states with a large banking presence, California had the second highest concentration level\u2014with the three largest banks accounting for 62.3 percent of banks\u2019 assets. Of the states with a medium banking presence, Arizona and Washington had the highest and second highest concentration levels, with the three largest banks accounting for 82.6 percent and 62.4 percent of total bank assets, respectively.", "Figure 1 shows that the market share the largest banks controlled within each of these states fluctuated over the period we reviewed. However, by mid-1993, these market shares either approximated 1984 levels or fell below those levels.", "In all three states, some large banks increased their market share, while others saw their share decline or were acquired. Perhaps the most significant event was the 1992 merger of two large bank holding companies, BankAmerica Corporation and Security Pacific Corporation. The merger left BankAmerica with the largest or second largest bank in each of the three states. Table 1 shows the change in the market share of BankAmerica\u2019s subsidiaries and their position in each state from 1984 to 1993. The subsidiaries\u2019 market share in each state would have been greater, if federal and state regulators had not encouraged BankAmerica to divest some of the branches of its subsidiaries in markets where they felt competition might adversely be affected because of its large presence. For example, without the 1992 divestiture in Washington state, BankAmerica\u2019s subsidiary\u2014Seattle-First National Bank\u2014would have had $1.5 billion more in assets than it did as of mid-1993."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Smaller Banks Remained Viable", "paragraphs": ["Throughout the period we focused on, smaller banks as a group remained viable in the three states. In fact, smaller banks were often among the most profitable banks in California and Washington when measured by return on assets. In Arizona, purchases by out-of-state bank holding companies helped maintain the viability of smaller banks through the infusion of capital. Although smaller banks\u2019 share of the market declined temporarily in Washington and Arizona, by June 1993 it had regained or even slightly exceeded its 1984 market share levels. (See fig. 2.)", "Smaller banks as a group were recapturing market share. However, the smallest banks were losing market share to other small banks with assets from $100 million to $1 billion. Table 2 shows that banks with assets of less than $100 million declined in number and market share in the three states, while those with assets from $100 million to $1 billion increased in number and market share.", "Regulators, bankers, and many industry experts we spoke with believed that California\u2019s long history of in-state branching showed that smaller banks could successfully exist alongside large banks with statewide networks. Smaller banks would always survive, they contended, because such banks carved out special niches that large banks were unable or unwilling to fill.", "The number of smaller banks first rose and then fell in California between 1984 and mid-1993, but the market share of smaller banks generally increased throughout this period. Regulators and bankers we spoke with attributed the reduced number more to an economic downturn than to competition from large banks with extensive branch networks. They attributed this decline to economic cycles because smaller banks tend to be more dependent on local economic fluctuations than larger, more diversified banks.", "In Washington and Arizona, smaller banks had both out-of-state and in-state ownership. We therefore analyzed trends for these banks both as a single group within each state and by ownership in- or out-of-state. In both states, the market share of smaller banks as a group increased during the first year that these states permitted interstate acquisitions of healthy banks (i.e., 1986 in Arizona and 1987 in Washington). These gains, however, were achieved by out-of-state, not in-state banks.", "In succeeding years, the market share of smaller banks in both states declined. In Arizona, according to a state regulator, this reduction probably occurred because the economic downturn caused many smaller banks to fail. In Washington, we found that the decline was primarily due to one out-of-state bank holding company acquiring several in-state smaller banks and building them into a large bank.", "In both states, however, new smaller banks eventually formed. As a result, smaller banks (i.e., in-state and out-of-state banks combined) regained or exceeded the market share they held in 1984, before the states permitted the acquisition of healthy banks within their borders by out-of-state banks. In Washington, the formation of additional in-state smaller banks helped this bank category to regain almost all of the market share it had held in 1984. In Arizona, however, while in-state smaller banks made gains, their 1993 market share declined to about 60 percent of what it was in 1984 (see fig. 3). This decline had more to do with Arizona\u2019s \u201cboom and bust\u201d economy than with geographic deregulation, according to regulators and industry experts.", "In all three states, some markets lacked smaller banks. In each state, we found there were at least three rural counties that lacked smaller banks. Also, focus group participants reported that there were few smaller banks in inner cities in all three states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Effect on Availability of Credit to Small Businesses", "paragraphs": ["Small businesses are crucial to this country\u2019s competitive future. They have traditionally been substantial contributors to both national economic growth and new job creation. In 1989, the most recent year for which data were available at the time of our review, small businesses comprised 93 percent of all businesses in the nation. Opponents of interstate banking are concerned that lifting geographic restrictions will result in greater consolidation of large banks. In their view, such consolidation would harm small businesses because large banks would be less likely than small banks to make small business loans.", "Much recent research has focused on credit conditions that affect small businesses. Frequently, such research concluded that small businesses have had more difficulty obtaining credit over the last decade for various reasons. The authors of some of these studies attributed the decline in small business lending primarily to the reduced demand for these types of loans. Others, however, stated that there were a number of reasons for credit difficulties, some of which related to interstate banking, banking industry consolidation, and increased regulatory scrutiny.", "Focus group participants and bankers in all three states reported localized difficulties for some types of small businesses seeking loans. Businesses viewed as experiencing credit difficulties included (1) those whose financial statements did not fit standardized criteria, such as nonprofit firms or companies whose profits are cyclical; (2) those borrowing small amounts that do not provide reasonable profits for the bank; (3) businesses that are new or have not had 3 years of profitability; and (4) established companies in \u201chigh-risk\u201d industries, such as restaurants (because of high failure rates) or sawmills (because of the poor health of the timber industry). These difficulties, however, were attributed to a number of causes, including a slow economy, tighter regulation, and the lack of a large smaller bank presence in certain areas.", "Although nonbanks and other financial providers met some of the needs of small businesses, banks were still viewed by bankers and focus group participants as the major source of credit. Representatives of large banks we interviewed viewed further consolidation resulting from interstate banking and branching as a means to provide credit more efficiently. However, others we interviewed viewed these changes as threatening the interests of small businesses. The most common opinion expressed in focus groups was that although large banks have benefited many small businesses by increasing the volume of small business lending, increased consolidation could cause some small businesses to experience reduced access to credit. Further, focus group participants and many bankers from smaller banks believed that small businesses in certain markets such as rural areas and inner cities may experience problems obtaining credit where there are insufficient credit alternatives to branches of large, interstate banks.", "We could not ascertain in the three states covered whether large banks would be less likely to provide credit to small businesses because available data were limited. Regulators have data on the commercial lending activity of banks; however, prior to June 1993, these data did not separately identify the amount of lending made to small businesses. Our analysis of June 1993 call report data, the first report with small business lending data separately identified, showed that large banks in California provided the least amount of small business loans in terms of absolute dollars as compared to smaller banks. Further, the amount represented a smaller proportion of their total assets as compared to smaller banks. In Arizona and Washington state, large banks provided the highest amount of small business loans in terms of absolute dollars as compared to smaller banks, but the amount smaller banks provided represented a greater proportion of their total assets.", "Several studies have suggested that small businesses may encounter increased difficulties obtaining credit in an unrestricted branching environment because of large banks\u2019 loan decisionmaking processes. Large banks generally have processes where lending criteria are standardized and loan decisionmaking is centralized and removed from the local level. Under a centralized and standardized process, local branch managers no longer make loans on the basis of both a financial and a character analysis of the borrower; instead, loan officers working in a central location make loans according to standardized financial criteria. Under such a system, large banks might turn down small business applicants who might otherwise have obtained loans on the basis of other financial considerations, such as conditions unique to a local market or borrower.", "Representatives from large banks told us that standardizing loan decisionmaking processes encourages small business lending because it reduces a bank\u2019s administrative costs and increases a bank\u2019s confidence that loans will be repaid. Focus group participants, however, added that this practice could cause banks to deny loans to businesses that did not meet the standard criteria, because central decisionmakers lacked personal knowledge of the borrowers or markets that might temper their decisions.", "Focus group participants also identified bank mergers as having the potential to adversely affect small business credit. They believed that small business credit could be affected because the number of banks serving small businesses would be reduced and because the newly merged banks may have a lending philosophy that would not be supportive of small businesses. While some focus group participants viewed some mergers as increasing funds available to small businesses because of a bank\u2019s capital and lending philosophy, the more common perception among focus group participants was that mergers involving large banks tended to make credit less available to small businesses within a local area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC.

However, it believed that our categorization of smaller banks (i.e., those with less than $1 billion in assets) might be too broad to disclose interesting trends. FDIC provided data dividing this category into those banks with (1) less than $100 million in assets and (2) from $100 million to $1 billion in assets.

In support of this position, it provided data on the absolute dollar amounts large banks committed to small business lending reported in June 1993 call reports.

We had also reviewed the same data and made a similar observation in our draft report that large banks have benefited many small businesses. We are not in disagreement with FDIC and have made changes in the report to more clearly reflect this.", "FDIC also noted that if problems exist in small business credit access, regulatory efforts and banking laws will address these issues. We agree that laws and regulation can be an important means to help ensure access to credit. However, it is also important to monitor the effects of lifting restrictions on interstate banking and branching to make sure that markets remain competitive and to determine whether changes to laws and regulations are needed.

In discussions with our California focus groups, we found a possible indirect effect of in-state branching on small business credit availability. This effect was that small businesses had difficulties in obtaining certain types of loans because of the increased centralization and standardization of lending decisions. These difficulties consisted of some small businesses either not being able to obtain credit or eventually obtaining it only after approaching several banks. This lengthy search for a lender was reportedly costly and resulted in missed opportunities.", "The most prevalent view among bankers from smaller banks we interviewed and focus group participants was that centralized and standardized decisionmaking was one of several factors that impaired credit availability for some types of small businesses.

However, if 10 loans like it were to be made, the bank would run the risk that one of these 10 would fail, which would eliminate all profits from the other 9 loans. Because the scoring model could not predict which of the 10 borrowers would be the one most likely to default, the bank must decline all the loan applications in this category. Although the scoring system might protect the bank from defaults and increase the bank\u2019s total amount of small business lending, it could result in the bank rejecting loan applications that could have been repaid by the would-be borrowers.", "Focus group participants and some bankers described the types of small businesses likely to have problems obtaining loans as those businesses whose financial statements were unusual, such as nonprofit firms or companies whose profits were cyclical; needing small loans, such as loans for less than $100,000, or unsecured lines of working capital; that were new or did not have 3 years of profitability; and that were well-run, established companies in \u201chigh-risk\u201d industries, which in California included real estate and timber.", "Most bankers at large banks told us that centralized decisionmaking encourages small business lending.

For example, participants told us that when an out-of-state bank bought a thrift in northern California, it began providing greatly needed small business loans. Another participant, who operated the state\u2019s equivalent to the SBA loan guaranty program, cited a smaller bank that had been a strong agricultural and small business lender.

One of the banks in town could justify lending only $950,000. According to a participant who was the administrator of a loan fund, the problem was that this bank analyzed the loan using criteria that were appropriate for an urban, not a rural, area. The bank emphasized the lease analysis in its decisionmaking and was concerned because there were few other potential occupants for this type of building should the facility fail and the building become vacant.

The purchase, however, did not take place until a year later, in April 1993, because Independent had difficulty raising the required capital. As of this date, Independent was Arizona\u2019s fifth largest bank company\u2014the only large in-state bank\u2014and was operating its banks under the name Caliber Bank.", "As a result of the divestiture, Bank of America Arizona became the state\u2019s second largest bank with approximately $10 billion in assets and 28 percent in market share.", "As had been the case in Washington, at the time of our review there had not been a study on whether competition within the state had declined because of the merger, according to federal regulators.

From 1985 through 1987, 12 new banks were formed, in contrast with only 4 between 1988 and 1992. All new smaller bank charters were for in-state banks, because de novo entry was prohibited for interstate banks until mid-1992. Capital availability, not a saturated banking market, was the primary reason for the decline in the creation of new smaller banks, according to a state banking regulator.", "Table IV.3 shows the number of in-state and out-of-state acquisitions of smaller banks from 1986 through 1992. Some of these acquisitions resulted in a change of ownership from in-state to out-of-state, while others resulted in the disappearance of a bank, because the acquirer was already present in the Arizona market. Twenty-nine of the 39 acquisitions were in-state smaller banks purchased by out-of-state holding companies. Many were single smaller banks that continued to be operated as single entities after the acquisitions.", "Table IV.3 also shows that the greatest number of acquisitions occurred from 1986 through 1988, almost all of which were of solvent institutions. From 1989 through 1992, the frequency of acquisitions declined somewhat and most were of failed institutions.", "Table IV.4 shows the market share trends for interstate and in-state smaller banks. Between 1985 and 1990, in-state smaller banks steadily lost market share, with their greatest losses occurring in 1986, when the economy was still healthy and interstate banking first passed. Interstate smaller banks, on the other hand, gained in market share until 1989 and then declined as the economy faltered. Nevertheless, throughout the middle to late 1980s, interstate smaller banks held a larger share of the market than did in-state smaller banks. It was not until 1991, when in-state smaller banks began to increase in market share (partly through the creation of three new banks) and interstate banks continued to decrease, that this trend was reversed.", "While smaller banks as a group were recapturing market share, a divergent trend was occurring within the group.

Therefore, we looked at lending patterns by both bank size and ownership to determine whether significant differences existed between (1) large and smaller banks and (2) out-of-state banks and in-state banks.

Large banks had $2.1 million invested in small business loans, or 6.7 percent of their assets.

Examples of corporate policies included (1) categories of riskiness for various types of lending or industries and (2) procedures and approval levels for loans of various types or amounts. Industries and types of lending characterized as \u201chigh risk\u201d included commercial real estate related lending, restaurants, and high-technology companies.

That is, some small businesses that were once able to get loans can no longer do so.", "Arizona focus groups strongly believed that remote decisionmaking\u2014whether in evaluating individual loans at centralized locations or in setting broad credit policies at a corporate level\u2014led banks to refuse some loans. Each group explained in detail how centralization and standardization impeded loans to small businesses.", "One focus group participant, a senior credit officer at a major loan fund, described a successful general contractor based in Sierra Vista, a rural town about 60 miles south of Tucson. This contractor needed a $300,000 loan to buy the building and the attached land that he rented for the company\u2019s Tucson projects. The credit officer evaluated the loan, found it to be a solid, creditworthy deal, and committed his fund to financing one-half of the amount. However, he was unable to obtain funding of the remaining half from one of the large banks whose branches were the only banks in Sierra Vista. For several reasons, the contractor found it impractical to use a bank outside of Sierra Vista, thus, he had no financial alternatives to the large banks. According to the credit officer, a local loan officer of one of the large banks agreed that the loan was creditworthy but was unable to convince the bank\u2019s officials in Phoenix to approve the loan.", "The credit officer blamed centralized decisionmaking processes for preventing the large banks from funding the loan. Corporate-level polices requiring additional layers of review and documentation for construction-related loans, he believed, led subsidiaries in Arizona to turn down most construction loans, even when they were, in his view, creditworthy.", "A second experience was related by the executive director of a loan fund to illustrate that the borrower\u2019s character and community commitment was not always taken into account by large banks. A well-established Tucson construction company, which had been profitable during the 1980s, suffered a 1-year significant loss in the early 1990s. Over the objections of local loan officers at the bank where this company had long been a customer, the bank\u2019s final decisionmakers in Phoenix decided not to renew the company\u2019s $200,000 line of credit. The local loan officers felt that, given the long-term relationship, the character of the borrower, and the fact that the company was a major employer in the community, the credit line should have been extended. The Phoenix officials, however, based their decision on the fact that the company was in a high-risk industry and had suffered a serious loss. The loan fund director, who provided a loan so that the company could pay off the large bank and make necessary changes to return to profitability, viewed this case as an example of how remote decisionmaking could lead large banks to abandon long-term customers facing temporary financial problems.", "Several interstate bankers also shared the perspective that, in some respects, centralization and standardization had made it more difficult for some small businesses to obtain credit. Two noted the necessity of having lending officers in local areas because personnel housed at centralized locations did not always understand the unique features of a local market. A third mentioned that standardization and centralization could impair credit access because some small businesses did not maintain the type of documentation centralized and standardized systems required to make loan decisions.", "Participants did not, however, perceive large banks as uniformly unresponsive to small business needs. On the basis of their experiences with individual banks, they saw some as better than others. The overriding determinant, according to not only focus group participants but several bankers as well, is a bank\u2019s management philosophy and the degree to which it maintains a local market presence.", "Further, several bankers we spoke with from Arizona\u2019s interstate banks echoed the perspective of large bankers in the other two states that centralization and standardization had allowed banks with extensive branch networks to become more active in the small business market because it lowered their internal cost of providing small business loans. Focus group participants, however, tended to work with small businesses that were, in their view, creditworthy but did not easily fit standardized criteria or policies found in a centralized and standardized system.", "The types of small businesses seen as susceptible to credit availability problems were similar to those described in California and Washington.

In regard to small business lending, however, many focus group participants felt that out-of-state banks had centralized their operations to such an extent that they lost touch with the community and that this had made small business credit more difficult in some areas. Acquisition-related reasons cited for credit difficulty included (1) temporary inefficiencies during the transition in management, (2) a decrease in the number of banks in local communities, and (3) changes in the newly formed bank\u2019s lending philosophy.", "A focus group participant involved in attracting new businesses to Arizona explained how transitional inefficiencies can make it more time consuming for small businesses to obtain credit. He believed that these types of difficulties could temporarily hinder the economic growth of a market. For example, a California-based company that manufactured and refurbished railroad cars needed a $700,000 loan to expand into Arizona. An Arizona bank approved the loan but was bought by another bank before the loan could be made. The acquiring bank, which had just centralized its approval process, required the company to submit a new application to the loan-making center because the loan pertained to a high-risk lending area. The company, feeling that it had already spent more than enough time trying to get a loan from the first bank, went instead to a smaller bank in the area.", "A second merger-related cause of small business credit difficulty mentioned in some markets was a reduction in competition that could occur when an out-of-state bank already in an area acquires another bank in the same area. This scenario is more likely to occur after a state has permitted interstate banking for several years, when out-of-state banks have already entered a state and are looking to expand their market share in communities in which they are already located.", "A well-known example of the loss of a competitor is the merger between BankAmerica Corporation and Security Pacific Corporation in 1992, because both had bank branches located in many of the same markets across the state. Apart from this merger, in 4 of the state\u2019s 15 counties between 1985 and 1990, large out-of-state banks absorbed smaller banks that had not been replaced by new local banks as of year-end 1992.", "A third case in which mergers can impair small business credit in local markets is when a bank that de-emphasizes small business lending takes over a local bank that has been an active small business lender. Unfortunately, we were unable to determine whether out-of-state banks altered the lending strategies of the banks they took over in particular local markets or in regard specifically to small business lending, because data were unavailable. However, we were able to determine whether these banks altered the total amount of lending or the overall lending strategy statewide upon entering the state by comparing loan portfolios before and after acquisitions. We limited this analysis to the three largest interstate banks\u2014Security Pacific Bank Arizona, Citibank Arizona, and Chase Bank of Arizona\u2014that bought institutions between 1986 and 1988 so we could compare acquiring banks with sound acquired banks.", "Table IV.7 shows that Security Pacific Bank Arizona and Chase Bank of Arizona made more total loans on average than did the banks their holding companies took over, but that Citibank Arizona made somewhat less. Security Pacific Bank Arizona increased its total lending by increasing all three types of loans: consumer, commercial real estate, and C&I loans. Security Pacific Bank Arizona was also the only one of the three banks that undertook more total commercial lending than consumer lending. Chase Bank of Arizona, on the other hand, increased total lending by increasing its consumer lending and made fewer commercial loans than the bank it acquired. Finally, Citibank Arizona made fewer loans than the banks it acquired, and like Chase Bank Arizona, emphasized consumer over commercial lending. The strategy of these two banks began before the recession in Arizona eliminated many of the commercial lending opportunities.", "Security Pacific Corporation also purchased two smaller banks in 1989 and 1990 with total loans of $21.1 million and two thrifts in 1991 with total assets of $1,544.3 million (loan data were not available).", "Citicorp also purchased four smaller banks between 1989 and 1990 with loans totaling $60.2 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Credit Seen as Tight in Markets That Reportedly Lacked Sufficient Alternatives to Large Banks", "paragraphs": ["As in California and Washington, standardization, centralization, and consolidation were seen as causing problems for small business credit availability, particularly where it was believed that there were insufficient alternatives to large banks.

Also, the total number of smaller banks had diminished by 36 percent from 1986 through mid-1993, and those that remained reportedly had small capital bases.", "Rural areas were often highlighted as experiencing the most severe credit problems. In contrast, one area in the state specifically mentioned by several participants as having little unmet demand was Tucson.", "Focus group participants contended that rural areas in particular lacked sufficient numbers of smaller banks.
