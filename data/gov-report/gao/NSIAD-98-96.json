Although a study was initiated, it was not finalized and no proposals or recommendations were approved. During the 1995 base realignment and closure (BRAC) process, DLA examined the military value of the eastern and western regional headquarters and found that they rated nearly equal. At that time, DLA officials concluded that changing the command and control structure would present significant risks in the efficient management of day-to-day operations and the ability to effectively support two major regional conflicts simultaneously. Further, they determined that span of control of future operations and the requirement to continue to accommodate contingency, mobilization, and future total force requirements made two regions essential."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Site Selection Process", "paragraphs": ["Subsequent to BRAC 1995, DLA officials revisited the consolidation issue and began another study. According to DLA headquarters officials, a preliminary assessment was made and the study was terminated before any recommendations were made. Meanwhile, DLA continued to restructure its distribution organization. Then, in February 1997, DLA reinitiated an effort to consolidate the two regions. This was expected to result in the creation of a single distribution command, known as the Defense Distribution Center. Under this plan, the center was to assume the regional distribution functions and manage the two primary distribution sites and all remaining distribution depots.", "Two steering groups were established to work concurrently on the consolidation effort. A \u201cmissions and functions steering group\u201d was established to determine the distribution center staffing requirements and organizational design. A \u201csite selection steering group\u201d (hereafter referred to as the steering group) was established to develop a decision process to determine a recommended site. The Principal Deputy Director of DLA was responsible for selecting the site in consultation with the DLA Director and other senior officials who made up DLA\u2019s executive leadership team.", "The site selection process included the use of a contractor, KPMG Peat Marwick, LLP to assist the steering group in developing the decision model and identifying the data needed.

Subsequent changes to the process, made at the request of the selecting official, did not correct these weaknesses and created concerns about the perception of bias.

Therefore, the first data request asked officials at the competing sites for facility requirements and costs based on the requirements of 400 staff. Subsequently, the missions and functions steering group provided an estimated personnel strength of 347 persons, which was used in the second data request. In both instances, the competing locations were not given a more detailed breakdown of the operational functions or the number of persons associated with them.", "Respondents from the regional locations stated that they could only estimate floor plan requirements and then compute associated costs. According to a KPMG official, the floor plans developed by each site contained certain unrealistic aspects and did not present a clear picture of the investment costs that would be required.", "Although the structure and functions of the new headquarters were determined prior to the third data request by the mission and functions steering group, DLA officials considered the information too sensitive to release to the competing locations because it could lead to speculation about layoffs. For the third data collection effort, requested by the selecting official, a DLA facilities engineer provided the regional respondents with the number of functions and the number of staff per function, but not the identity of the functions. As a result, the third data request also resulted in hypothetical floor plans and associated costs. Officials at the eastern location told us that, after becoming aware of the final plans for staffing, they made some good guesses in identifying some of the functions and could have implemented their floor plan if required to do so. However, they did not believe the floor plan presented the optimal solution. For example, although they knew they needed a law library, they did not know which function it would be associated with; therefore, their floor plan resulted in locating their legal staff offices at one end of one building and the law library at the opposite end of a second building. Although some changes were to be expected, according to regional officials, the lack of definitive information meant that neither site\u2019s floor plan would have been fully implemented if selected.", "DLA officials are still in the process of finalizing the floor plan for their headquarters location in New Cumberland, but the officials said they do not expect the costs to exceed the estimates provided in the site selection competition. Nevertheless, questions still exist regarding what differences might have existed between the plans and costs initially provided by the two competing locations if they had had a clearer picture of the performing functions and space requirements.", "Both steering group members and regional respondents said the lack of information on personnel and facilities hampered their ability to perform their tasks.

This approach is also used to assign different weights between cost and noncost variables to distinguish their relative importance. However, DLA\u2019s site selection steering group assigned different weights to individual cost criteria, which produced a distorted picture of the comparative costs of the two competing locations. For example, a dollar spent on a service order became more significant or of more value than a dollar spent on real property maintenance. The distortion caused by this weighting was so significant for the second data request that, even though the eastern location was $3.8 million more expensive than the western location based on a straight comparison of costs, the assignment of points made it appear that the eastern location had come out ahead in the cost categories. (See app. I for the results of the second data request.)", "The DOD Inspector General representative who participated in the steering group\u2019s proceedings told us that he had questioned the weighting of individual cost elements and recommended to the group that costs be evaluated on a straight comparison basis between locations. Further, KPMG officials told us that they had also told the group repeatedly that this methodology was not comparing dollars equally. Individual steering group members we spoke with could not recall their rationale for a disproportionate ranking of dollars and did not understand the potential impact of their actions until they saw the results of the second data request."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Subjective Evaluation of Two Noncost Criteria", "paragraphs": ["Specific criteria for evaluating work environment and commute time were not established because the steering group could not determine data sources for these two noncost criteria. Thus, steering group members subjectively determined point values for these criteria at each location. For work environment, members told us they considered everything from distance between the parking lot and the office to perceived lifestyles to ongoing working relationships. For commute time, because some members had been to each location only twice, their experience with commute time consisted of traveling between their hotel and the site. Some members argued that commute time was not really a valid criterion, because it was a matter of personal choice. The subjectivity of these responses and the inconsistency in what members considered made the determinations of questionable value.

He stated that he did this to better ensure the comparability of data between the sites. This produced the requirement for a third data request. The selecting official decided that equal points should be awarded to each site for personnel costs, that real property maintenance costs be reassessed, and that changes should be made to requirements for furniture and space.

As a result, following a briefing on the second data request analysis, the selecting official, acting independently of the steering group, decided to eliminate personnel costs as a consideration. The selecting official reasoned that the grade structure of the new headquarters should be independent of the chosen site, making personnel costs irrelevant, so he gave equal points to both locations. (See app. II for the results of the third data request.) The steering group, however, had considered personnel cost to be an important criterion and had based it on average grade levels of the current structure at each location. The steering group reasoned that, although the employees of the new site would be downsized, the grade structure at the new headquarters would be similar to that of the region where it was located. DLA headquarters officials told us that in setting up the new distribution headquarters at New Cumberland, they expect to restructure and downgrade positions at that location to meet the requirements for the new organization. To what extent this would lessen the higher personnel costs for the eastern location is unclear given employee bumping rights and save pay provisions that would likely be associated with such restructuring. Also, the importance of personnel costs as a decision factor should not be minimized since savings in this area can mean the potential for significant recurring savings in the long term. The results of the second data request showed that the eastern location had higher average grade levels, resulting in a $3.1 million difference in personnel costs between the two locations over a 5-year period.

The selecting official told us that he did this in the interest of obtaining more realistic data. For the second data request, the steering group used the Navy Public Works Center real property maintenance estimates used in the 1995 BRAC process. These estimates had been reviewed in 1995 by the DOD Inspector General, who found the procedures used to be reasonable and the cost estimates to be consistently generated, generally supported, and reasonably accurate. According to the facilities engineer responsible for the second data request, the data had also been used in DLA\u2019s real property maintenance project development, budgeting, and execution processes. The DLA facilities engineer made minor changes to the Navy Public Works Center data as part of his data validation efforts before approving their use for the second data request analysis.", "The selecting official told us he believed that the data used in the second data request were not realistic, based on his personal knowledge of the conditions of the two sites, past experience in the distribution area, and knowledge of flaws in repair and maintenance data used for BRAC. He reasoned that the BRAC data were not comparable because the Navy Public Works Center had different people with different perceptions and evaluation criteria assess the individual sites. For example, he said the eastern location\u2019s database included about $47,000 for the cost of painting a building with a dryvit exterior, which, according to the facilities engineer, does not need cyclic painting. However, the facilities engineer had already removed this item from the eastern location\u2019s database during his validation of the second data request.", "A DLA facilities engineer, not previously involved in the process, reassessed real property maintenance costs for the third data request, producing a significant change in costs between the two locations. The results of the second data request had shown a difference of about $643,000 in the real property maintenance category in favor of the western location. The results of the third data request produced a difference of about $182,000 in favor of the eastern location.", "For the third data request, the facilities engineer went one step further than the previous engineer and had the sites submit justification for removing additional projects from the Navy Public Works Center database. The projects submitted for removal included some cyclical projects that the respondents did not believe were needed during the 5-year time frame covered by the analysis. The eastern location submitted and received approval for removing about $791,000 worth of projects. According to western location officials, they had one such project, valued at $95,000, but they did not submit it because their efforts to have it removed during the second data request were unsuccessful. Both facilities engineers said that if the western location had resubmitted this project for the third data request it would have been considered and may have been removed. The removal of this item alone would not have significantly impacted the cost or point spread in the final analysis of the third data request.", "However, the facilities engineers later identified an error of about $210,000 in the western location\u2019s database for costs that KPMG agreed should have been excluded. The correction reducing the western location\u2019s real property maintenance costs was not made in the final analysis because, according to KPMG, it was identified after the third data request analysis was completed. Although these reductions\u2014the possible removal of the $95,000 project and the $210,000 correction\u2014in the western location\u2019s costs would have changed the dollar and point spread advantage for real property maintenance costs from the eastern site to the western site, they would not have been enough alone to effect the overall outcome of the study.

The facilities engineer who developed the third data request told us that the requirements were instituted to ensure a level playing field. However, some steering group members disagreed with the changes and told us that the requirements gave an advantage to the eastern location, which already had modular systems furniture required by the new data request.", "In developing the second data request, the steering group had voted to disregard the selecting official\u2019s direction for the new headquarters to include modular systems furniture. While DLA officials told us that such furniture was used at two other newly renovated sites, various steering committee members told us they did not believe that an official standard requiring such furniture currently existed within DLA. Nonetheless, this became a requirement under the third data request, consistent with the selecting official\u2019s earlier guidance. The facilities engineer who developed the data request required that the competing regions resubmit floor plans to include the systems furniture and stipulated that its life expectancy not exceed 10 years within the 5-year time frame covered by the analysis. As a result of these new requirements, the western location submitted a cost of about $901,000 for purchasing new systems furniture in the third data request because it could not verify the age of the systems furniture stored in its warehouse.", "Moreover, in addition to requiring systems furniture, the third data request included other new requirements such as a minimum of 22 meeting rooms and floor-to-ceiling walls for conference rooms and offices to meet what the facilities engineer described as an idealistic view of what DLA offices should look like. The engineer said that he used these requirements to ensure that both proposals would be based on comparable work space. Neither the steering group nor officials from the competing locations agreed with all of these requirements. For example, they protested the need for 22 meeting rooms, calling it excessive and wasteful. Officials at both locations told us that they currently had more people with fewer meeting rooms and had encountered no difficulties in doing their work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact of Changes", "paragraphs": ["The changes made for the third data request analysis had the effect of improving the position of the eastern location, including shifting the cost advantage (on an absolute dollar basis) to the eastern location.

Although one can assign different weights to costs as compared to a straight cost comparison, it is not a methodology that we have typically seen in such analyses, and as noted in our report, steering group members we spoke with could not recall their rationale for using this approach. Furthermore, both the Defense Logistics Agency\u2019s (DLA) contractor and the DOD Inspector General advised against such a methodology. Varying weights can be assigned to evaluation criteria in this type of analysis to distinguish the relative importance of individual criteria, particularly when distinguishing between cost and noncost variables. However, assigning different weights to individual cost criteria, reduced DLA\u2019s ability to perform the most meaningful comparison of cost. We saw no reason that costs should not have been evaluated on a straight comparison basis to provide a more accurate picture of costs. 3. On the basis of our discussions with steering group members and our review of the site selection backup documentation, we do not believe that the steering group had and used a valid basis for evaluating work environment and commute time. Each steering group member ranked each of the sites between 1 and 10 for quality of work environment and then commute time, with 10 being the most favorable score. Average scores were calculated and the highest average scores received the maximum points in the site selection analysis. The weakness in this method was that the basis for the ranking was not clearly established. Work environment and commute time were not clearly defined; had they been, the steering group might have identified objective measures for assessing these criteria. No data were used, and group members\u2019 knowledge of commute times and working environment was limited. As a result some group members used commutes from nearby hotels and based working environment on personal working relationships. Alternatively, we note that another DLA site selection study, pertaining to the issue of consolidating cataloging functions, used quantitative factors to assess quality of life at work, including factors such as individual office space per person; average commute time measured in average number of miles traveled; availability of public transportation; types and numbers of amenities such as day care, gym, and credit union; parking fees; and distance to the airport. Clearly, the method used in the current study raised questions about the soundness of the method used to evaluate these two criteria. According to steering group meeting minutes, senior DLA leadership expressed concern about the subjective evaluation of these criteria. Additionally, while it is true that these criteria constituted only 10 percent of the total points assigned overall, they constituted 50 percent of the noncost criteria. 4. To what extent time requirements did not allow for consultation with the site selection steering group about the changes requested by the selecting official is unclear. The time constraint\u2014making the site selection decision by the end of the fiscal year\u2014appeared to have been self-imposed. Additionally, we agree that comparable data and information should have been used in the site selection process. However, to avoid questions about the objectivity of the evaluation, standards need to be clearly stated and agreed to up front. The selecting official had approved the site selection decision support model before data collection efforts were initiated to ensure the objectivity of the process. While it is within his authority and discretion to make changes, he did not do so until after he saw the results of the second data request analysis and did so without consulting the steering group. His actions did not correct the weaknesses we identified but resulted in negating personnel costs, reassessing real property, and establishing new facilities standards\u2014the impact of which dramatically altered the resulting costs and point values in the site selection analysis. These actions make it difficult for us to be certain that DLA had the best comparable data it needed for its analysis. 5. We agree that locality pay was not relevant after Fort Belvoir was removed from the site selection process. As DOD stated, the locality pay was the same for both of the remaining sites. However, the steering group was correct in initially identifying personnel costs as an important criterion. The importance of personnel costs should not be minimized since savings in this area can mean the potential for significant recurring savings in the long term. As our report notes, the results of the second data request showed that the eastern location had higher average grade levels, resulting in a $3.1 million difference in personnel costs between the two locations over a 5-year period. While it may be difficult to project bumping rights along with voluntary early retirement and separation incentive pay, it can be done. For example, DLA officials planned to conduct a mock reduction-in-force to determine the effects on personnel, but had not yet done so. It should also be noted that, absent definitive data, DLA and other DOD components previously used standard factors in prior base closure rounds to project some personnel impacts and costs. 6. While we agree that the real property maintenance data should have been comparable, DLA\u2019s site selection backup documentation indicated that the data were reviewed and some modifications were made to it to ensure comparability between the two competing locations before it was used in the second data request analysis. Our concern relates to the decision-making process. The DLA Chief of the Real Property Maintenance Team was approved by the steering group as the facilities engineer responsible for validating the data. He told us that he validated the data as a routine matter of prudent facilities engineering management. During his data validation of the responses to the second data request, he removed the requirement for the eastern site to repaint a nonpaintable exterior surface. Subsequently, the selecting official told us that he based his decision to reassess real property maintenance on his personal knowledge and experience. Having the data reassessed after they had already been validated raised concerns among various steering group members about the perception of bias. 7. DLA officials suggested that not requiring systems furniture and other facilities requirements would result in a substandard work environment and indicated that these requirements were used at two other DLA locations not part of this site selection process. We have modified our report to reflect DLA\u2019s point about these other locations. However, as noted in our report, members of the steering group told us they did not perceive this as an official DLA standard for furniture and workspace.", "The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
