GAO has had long-standing concerns about FDA's ability to oversee the increasingly global supply chain, an issue highlighted in GAO's High Risk Series for the last 10 years. GAO recommended in 2008 (GAO-08-970) that FDA increase the number of inspections of foreign drug establishments. GAO found in 2010 (GAO-10-961) and 2016 (GAO-17-143) that FDA was conducting more of these foreign drug inspections, but GAO also reported that FDA may have never inspected many establishments manufacturing drugs for the U.S. market.", "This statement is based on ongoing work and provides preliminary GAO observations on 1) the number of foreign inspections FDA has conducted, 2) inspection staffing levels, and 3) challenges unique to foreign inspections.

Howevever, the total number of foreign inspections surpassed the number of domestic inspections in 2015, and a growing percentage of FDA's foreign inspections (43 percent in 2018) were conducted in China and India, where most establishments that ship drugs to the United States were located. FDA officials attributed the decline, in part, to vacancies among investigators available to conduct inspections. GAO previously noted the vital role that inspections play in FDA's oversight of foreign establishments.", "FDA has vacancies among each of the groups of investigators who conduct foreign inspections. FDA had 190 investigators in the United States who conduct the majority of foreign inspections, but an additional 58 positions were vacant. FDA was in the process of filling 26 of these vacancies, with 32 remaining. However, according to FDA officials, it could be 2 to 3 years before new staff are experienced enough to conduct foreign inspections. FDA also faces persistent vacancies among investigators in its foreign offices.", "FDA investigators identified persistent challenges conducting foreign inspections, raising questions about the equivalence of foreign to domestic inspections. For example, while domestic inspections are almost always unannounced, FDA's practice of preannouncing foreign inspections up to 12 weeks in advance may give manufacturers the opportunity to fix problems. Investigators from FDA's China and India offices do conduct some unannounced inspections, but they are involved in a small percentage of inspections in these countries (27 percent and 10 percent, respectively). Further, FDA continues to rely on translators provided by the foreign establishments being inspected, which investigators said can raise questions about the accuracy of information FDA investigators collect."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO will continue to assess these issues as part of ongoing work, and make recommendations as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our ongoing work on the Food  and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) oversight of drugs manufactured  overseas.

This date  range was selected to allow for an analysis of trends over time through  2018, the last full fiscal year of data available when we began our  analysis. To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed related  documentation, interviewed knowledgeable agency officials, conducted  electronic data testing for missing data and outliers, and compared the  data to published information from the same database. On the basis of  these steps, we found these data sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  our reporting objectives.

This model analyzes several factors, including inherent product  risk, establishment type, inspection history, and time since last inspection,  to develop a list of establishments that FDA considers to be a priority for  inspection.

In addition, warning letters may notify foreign  establishments that FDA may refuse entry of their drugs at the border or  recommend disapproval of any new drug applications listing the  establishment until sufficient corrections are made. FDA may take other  regulatory actions if it identifies serious deficiencies during the inspection  of a foreign establishment. For example, FDA may issue an import alert,  which instructs FDA staff that they may detain drugs manufactured by the  violative establishment that have been offered for entry into the United  States. In addition, FDA may conduct regulatory meetings with the  violative establishment.

However, officials told us that this effort  contributed to the decline in the number of foreign inspections conducted  because of how data inaccuracies affected the process for selecting  establishments for inspection. Specifically, after selecting uninspected  foreign establishments for inspection, FDA determined that a sizeable  percentage of these establishments were not actually subject to  inspection (e.g., about 40 percent of those assigned to the China Office in  fiscal years 2017 and 2018). These foreign establishments were thus  removed from the list for inspection for the given year.

FDA  officials attributed the vacancies to multiple factors: investigator  retirements, investigator movement to other parts of FDA, and the need to  hire to additional investigator positions using generic drug user fees.  Officials also said that a reorganization within ORA led to a reduced  number of investigators who conduct drug manufacturing establishment  inspections.

In our 2010 report, we recommended that  FDA develop a strategic workforce plan to help recruit and retain foreign  office staff. FDA released such a plan in March 2016, but the long- standing vacancies in the foreign offices raise questions about its  implementation. FDA officials told us that one challenge in recruiting  investigators for the foreign offices is that well-qualified investigators for  those positions need foreign inspection experience. For example, an  official in FDA\u2019s India office told us that foreign inspections can be  challenging and the India office does not have the resources to develop  or train new investigators. Therefore, it is important to recruit investigators  who have experience conducting foreign inspections, and such  investigators are recruited from ORA. Thus, vacancies in the other two  groups of investigators can influence the number of staff available to  apply for positions in the foreign offices. Further, according to FDA  officials, after employees have accepted an in-country position, the  agency can experience significant delays before they are staffed in the  office due to delays in processing assignments. For example, an official in  FDA\u2019s India office said that investigators need to complete a week-long  security training program and must obtain the security clearance needed  to work at the U.S. Embassy, which is where FDA\u2019s foreign office is  located. However, the official told us that there are limited availabilities for  that training and background checks for security clearances can take  time. According to this official, FDA investigators do not usually receive  first priority for the training. FDA estimates that it can take as little as 1  year to over 2 years to clear background and medical checks and arrive  at a foreign office. For example, an investigator in FDA\u2019s China office told  us that as a result of these requirements and other issues, it took nearly 2  years for the investigator to arrive at the office after FDA had accepted  the investigator\u2019s application. According to FDA\u2019s own strategic workforce  plan for the foreign offices, these types of delays have resulted in staff  changing their decision after accepting a position in the foreign offices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Persistent Challenges Unique To Foreign Inspections Raise Questions About Their Equivalence To Domestic Inspections", "paragraphs": ["Our preliminary analysis indicates that FDA continues to face unique  challenges when inspecting foreign drug establishments\u2014as compared to  domestic establishments\u2014that raise questions about the equivalence of  these inspections.

Of the four  challenge areas identified, three areas\u2014preannouncing inspections,  language barriers, and lack of flexibility\u2014were also raised in our 2008  report.", "Preannouncing Inspections. As we reported in 2008, the amount of  notice FDA generally gives to foreign drug establishments in advance of  an inspection is different than for domestic establishments. Domestic  drug establishment inspections are almost always unannounced, whereas  foreign establishments generally receive advance notice of an FDA  inspection. According to FDA officials, FDA is not required to  preannounce foreign inspections. However, they said the agency  generally does so to avoid wasting agency resources, obtain the  establishment\u2019s assistance to make travel arrangements, and ensure the  safety of investigators when traveling in country.", "FDA does conduct some unannounced foreign inspections, particularly if  the investigators conducting the inspection are based in FDA\u2019s foreign  offices. However, FDA officials told us that FDA does not have data on  the frequency with which foreign drug inspections are unannounced, nor  the extent to which the amount of notice provided to foreign  establishments varies. According to FDA officials, this is because FDA  does not have a data field in its database to systematically track this  information. However, the officials estimated that the agency generally  gives 12 weeks of notice to establishments that investigators are coming  when investigators are traveling from the United States. While  investigators in FDA\u2019s China and India offices do conduct unannounced  or short-notice inspections, these staff do not perform most of the  inspections in these countries. (See table 3).", "Our preliminary work indicates that preannouncing foreign inspections  can create challenges and raises questions about the equivalence to  domestic inspections. Of the 18 investigators we interviewed, 14 said that  there are downsides to preannouncing foreign inspections, particularly  that providing advance notice gives foreign establishments the  opportunity to fix problems before the investigator arrives. For example,  when an inspection is preannounced, it gives establishments time to  clean up their facility and update or generate new operating procedures.  However, establishments are expected to be in a constant state of  compliance and always ready for an FDA inspection, and several  investigators told us seeing the true day-to-day operating environment for  an establishment is more likely during an unannounced inspection.", "Of the 18 investigators we interviewed, 12 said that unannounced  inspections are generally preferable to preannounced inspections. One  investigator told us that, although they believe the best way to ensure  industry compliance to CGMPs is for establishments to not know when  FDA is coming for an inspection, there is no data that would allow the  agency to evaluate whether unannounced inspections are better than  preannounced inspections. In addition, some investigators told us that it is  still possible to identify serious deficiencies during preannounced  inspections. For example, investigators can still identify issues by looking  at the firm\u2019s electronic records, including time-stamped data relating to  the creation, modification, or deletion of a record. Three investigators also  told us that in some cases there can be benefits to announcing  inspections in advance. For example, for preapproval inspections,  announcing the inspection in advance gives the establishment time to  organize the documentation and staff needed to conduct the inspection.", "Language Barriers. Our preliminary work indicates that language  barriers\u2014which we first reported as a challenge to conducting foreign  inspections in our 2008 report\u2014can add time to inspections and raise  questions about the accuracy of information FDA investigators collect and  thus about the equivalence to domestic inspections. FDA generally does  not send translators on inspections in foreign countries. Rather,  investigators rely on the drug establishment to provide translation  services, which can be an English-speaking employee of the  establishment being inspected, an external translator hired by the  establishment, or an English-speaking consultant hired by the  establishment.", "Of the 18 investigators that we interviewed, 14 said that language barriers  can be a challenge to conducting foreign inspections and were especially  challenging in parts of Asia, including China and Japan. Seven  investigators told us this is less of a challenge for inspections conducted  in other foreign countries, including India and countries in Europe,  because workers at establishments in these countries are more likely to  speak English, and documentation is also more likely to be in English.  Investigators told us that compared to domestic inspections, it can be  more challenging and take longer to complete typical inspection-related  activities, such as reviewing documentation or interviewing employees, if  the investigator needs to rely on translation.", "Fourteen of the 18 investigators we interviewed said that there can be  concerns related to relying on establishment staff and independent  translators. Specifically, 11 investigators told us there can be  uncertainties regarding the accuracy of the information being translated,  particularly when investigators rely on the translation provided by an  employee of the establishment being inspected. For instance, one  investigator said that there is more risk of conflict of interest if the  establishment uses its own employees to translate. Another investigator  said that they went to a drug establishment in China that told FDA it had  English-speaking employees to translate the inspection, but that this was  not the case, and the investigator had to use an application on their  phone to translate the interviews. In addition, the firm representative  providing the translation may be someone that does not have the  technical language needed, which can make it harder to communicate  with firm staff and facilitate the inspection. One investigator told us that  the independent translators hired by firms are sometimes consultants  and, in those instances, it can seem like the consultants are coaching the  firm during the inspection.", "FDA officials told us that when they conduct unannounced for-cause  inspections in China, investigators bring locally employed staff who work  in FDA\u2019s China office to act as translators. The investigators we  interviewed said that in such instances, they valued knowing that the  translation they were getting was accurate. However, FDA does not have  the resources to provide locally employed staff on every inspection,  according to an FDA official. We will continue to examine this issue with  FDA as part of our ongoing work.", "Lack of Flexibility. Our preliminary work indicates that, as we first  reported in 2008, the overseas travel schedule can present unique  challenges for FDA\u2019s domestically based investigators\u2014including both  ORA investigators and members of the dedicated foreign dug cadre\u2014 who conduct the majority of foreign inspections. Eight of the 12  dedicated foreign drug cadre investigators that we interviewed told us that  there is little flexibility to extend foreign inspections conducted by  domestically based investigators because the inspections they conduct  on an overseas trip are scheduled back-to-back in 3-week trips that may  involve three different countries. This raises questions about their  equivalence to domestic inspections. For instance, extending one  inspection would limit the amount of time the investigator has to complete  their other scheduled inspections, some investigators told us. In addition,  eight investigators told us that domestically based staff are generally  unable to extend the total amount of time spent on an overseas trip\u2014one  investigator told us that an investigator would have to find something  really bad to justify an extension. In contrast, FDA officials told us that  inspections conducted by in-country investigators in China or India, and  domestic inspections in the United States, are generally scheduled one at  a time and can thus more easily be extended if the investigator needs  additional time to pursue potential deficiencies. However, in-country  investigators are not involved in the majority of inspections conducted in  China or India.", "Three investigators from the dedicated foreign drug cadre told us that  when they travel overseas, they adjust their inspection approach to help  ensure they finish foreign inspections on time. For example, one  investigator told us an investigator may start the inspection in an area of  the establishment that was noted as having issues during the last  inspection. However, one investigator said that sometimes it is not  possible to cover everything in depth during a foreign inspection. Another  investigator told us that they focus on identifying the most serious issues  during a foreign inspection, and that less serious issues can be identified  in the establishment inspection report for reference in the next inspection.  Five investigators also noted that they work long hours during their  inspection to ensure they can complete the needed work. While FDA  may assign more than one investigator to an inspection to complete  needed work, one investigator said that FDA does not usually assign  more than one person to an inspection because investigators are  expected to have the experience to conduct inspections by themselves.  From fiscal years 2012 to 2018, the majority of both foreign and domestic  inspections were conducted by one person\u201477 percent and 66 percent,  respectively.", "Post-Inspection Classification Process. According to FDA officials,  starting in fiscal year 2018, FDA implemented a new post-inspection  classification process: when an ORA investigator recommends an OAI  classification following an inspection, ORA compliance is required to send  that inspection report to CDER for review within 45 calendar days from  the inspection closeout. Among other things, the process was intended to  help ensure FDA can communicate inspection results to domestic and  foreign establishments within 90 days of the inspection closeout, as  committed to under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of  2017(GDUFA II). FDA officials told us that the changes also required an  additional ORA review for foreign inspection reports to align that process  with the process for domestic inspection reports. Although the 45-day  reporting time frame for potential OAI classifications is a requirement for  both domestic and foreign inspections, adding the additional level of  review within ORA effectively shortened the amount of time investigators  have to document findings for foreign inspections.", "Our preliminary work indicates that the post-inspection reporting time  frames can create challenges for domestic investigators that conduct  foreign inspections and raise questions about the equivalence to  domestic inspections. Eight of the 18 investigators that we interviewed  said shortening the time for completing reports and adding a level of  review has made it more challenging to meet reporting requirements,  especially if serious deficiencies are identified during the inspection.  Investigators told us that for a potential OAI inspection, they now need to  send the inspection report to their supervisor for endorsement within 10  days of the closeout of a foreign inspection, regardless of when the  investigator\u2019s next inspection is scheduled for, or whether the investigator  has to travel from overseas back to the United States after the inspection.  For example, if a domestic investigator finds serious deficiencies on the  first inspection, thus indicating an initial OAI classification, the investigator  needs to write and send the related inspection report to the ORA  supervisor for endorsement before returning home from the 3-week  overseas trip to meet the required time frame. One investigator told us  that, as a result of the time pressures, post-inspection reports may be  less thorough, and that some inspection observations could be better  supported if investigators had more time to write the reports.", "In conclusion, foreign manufacturing establishments continue to be a  critical source of drugs for millions of Americans, and FDA inspections are  a key tool to ensure the quality of these drugs. Over the years since we  first examined this issue, FDA has made significant changes to adapt to  the globalization of the drug supply chain and has greatly increased the  number of inspections that it conducts of foreign establishments. Notably,  it has markedly increased the percentage of foreign inspections  conducted to monitor drugs already on the market, which we previously  noted were vital to FDA oversight of foreign establishments. However, the  agency continues to be faced with many of the same challenges in the  oversight of foreign establishments that we identified in our 2008 report.  Our preliminary work has identified inspection decreases, related in part  to FDA challenges filling investigator vacancies. We have also identified a  variety of unique challenges that investigators face in foreign inspections.  As we continue to conduct our work, we will further examine the  cumulative effect of these challenges that raise questions about FDA\u2019s  ability to conduct equivalent inspections in foreign establishments. We will  examine the extent to which FDA has assessed its oversight of drugs  manufactured overseas and the steps it is taking to mitigate any risks,  and make recommendations as appropriate.", "Chair DeGette, Ranking Member Guthrie, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
