In particular, grantees are required to prepare planning documents known as Analyses of Impediments (AI), which are to identify impediments to fair housing (such as restrictive zoning or segregated housing) and actions to overcome them. HUD has oversight responsibility for AIs. This report (1) assesses both the conformance of CDBG and HOME grantees AIs' with HUD guidance pertaining to their timeliness and content and their potential usefulness as planning tools and (2) identifies factors in HUD's requirements and oversight that may help explain any AI weaknesses. GAO requested AIs from a representative sample of the nearly 1,200 grantees, compared the 441 AIs received (95 percent response based on final sample of 466) with HUD guidance and conducted work at HUD headquarters and 10 offices nationwide."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["On the basis of the 441 AIs reviewed, GAO estimates that 29 percent of all CDBG and HOME grantees' AIs were prepared in 2004 or earlier, including 11 percent from the 1990s, and thus may be outdated. HUD guidance recommends that grantees update their AIs at least every 5 years. GAO also did not receive AIs from 25 grantees, suggesting that, in some cases, the required documents may not be maintained, and several grantees provided documents that did not appear to be AIs because of their brevity and lack of content. GAO reviewed 60 of the current AIs (those dating from 2005 through 2010) and found that most of these documents included several key elements in the format suggested in HUD's guidance, such as the identification of impediments to fair housing and recommendations to overcome them. (See table below for common impediments identified in 30 of these 60 current AIs.) However, the vast majority of these 60 AIs did not include time frames for implementing their recommendations or the signatures of top elected officials, as HUD guidance recommends, raising questions about the AI's usefulness as a planning document. As a result, it is unclear whether the AI is an effective tool for grantees that receive federal CDBG and HOME funds to identify and address impediments to fair housing. HUD's limited regulatory requirements and oversight may help explain why many AIs are outdated or have other weaknesses. Specifically, HUD regulations do not establish requirements for updating AIs or their format, and grantees are not required to submit AIs to the department for review. A 2009 HUD internal study on AIs, department officials, and GAO's work at 10 offices identified critical deficiencies in these requirements. For example, HUD officials rarely request grantees' AIs during on-site reviews to assess their compliance with overall CDBG and HOME program requirements, limiting the department's capacity to assess AIs' timeliness and content. While HUD initiated a process to revise its AI regulatory requirements in 2009, what the rule will entail or when it will be completed is not clear. In the absence of a department-wide initiative to enhance AI requirements and oversight, many grantees may place a low priority on ensuring that their AIs serve as effective fair housing planning tools."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that, through regulation, HUD require grantees to update their AIs periodically, follow a specific format, and submit them for review. HUD neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendations but noted recent efforts to improve compliance and oversight."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Fair Housing Act (FHAct) of 1968, as amended, prohibits  discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing on the basis of  race or color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status, or disability.  Section 808(e) (5) of the FHAct also requires the Department of Housing  and Urban Development (HUD) to administer its housing and urban  development programs, including formula grant programs such as the  Community Development Block Grant program (CDBG) and HOME  Investment Partnerships Program (HOME), in a manner that affirmatively  furthers fair housing (AFFH)\u2014that is, that eliminates housing  discrimination, promotes fair housing choice, and fosters compliance with  the nondiscrimination provisions of the FHAct. In fiscal year 2009, these  programs provided over $5 billion in funding to nearly 1,200 eligible  communities and jurisdictions and the median grant size was about $1.4  million. To help fulfill the AFFH requirement, HUD regulations require  grant recipients, such as municipalities and counties, to    prepare a planning document known as an Analysis of Impediments to  Fair Housing Choice (AI), which is to identify any potential impediments  to fair housing choice within the jurisdiction (such as exclusive zoning  laws or segregated housing patterns); take appropriate actions to overcome the effects of any impediments  identified in the AI, such as revising zoning ordinances; and   maintain records reflecting the analysis and actions taken.", "HUD views the AI as a tool that serves as the foundation for fair housing  planning by municipalities, counties, and other grantees that receive  federal funds through their participation in the CDBG, HOME, and other  grant programs. The department is also responsible for overseeing and  enforcing grantees\u2019 compliance with AFFH requirements and guidance,  including those pertaining to their AIs.", "Grantees\u2019 compliance with AFFH requirements and the effectiveness of  HUD\u2019s oversight and enforcement have been called into question through  litigation and reports and testimonies for some years. In August 2009, the  Department of Justice and HUD announced a fair housing settlement with  Westchester County in New York, a CDBG grantee that was required to  conduct an AI. A federal district court had concluded that the county was  aware that racial and ethnic segregation and discrimination persisted in its  municipalities, but its AI made no mention of these practices or any plan  to address them. The litigation ended in an agreement that required the  county to invest $51.6 million in affordable housing over the next 7 years  and to undertake and fund marketing, public education, and other  outreach efforts to promote fair and affordable housing. Further, fair  housing groups have conducted studies and stated in testimony that many  grantees fail to prepare substantive AIs and that HUD\u2019s oversight and  enforcement of the AI requirements have been minimal. In 2009, HUD  completed an internal study, which found that many AIs were outdated or  appeared to have been prepared in a cursory fashion and found that the  department\u2019s oversight was limited. Associations that represent grantees,  such as the U.S. Conference of Mayors, have stated that their members are  committed to furthering fair housing but have noted a variety of challenges  involved in doing so, including limited funding for conducting the AIs and  a lack of clear HUD guidance on preparing an AI. HUD officials have  stated that the department has not always fulfilled its obligation to assist  grantees in meeting AFFH requirements but is in the process of developing  a rule that will provide the guidance grantees need.", "Given your questions about grantees\u2019 compliance with AFFH  requirements, particularly the quality of their AIs, and HUD\u2019s oversight  activities, you asked that we conduct a review of relevant issues.  Specifically, our report (1) assesses both the conformance of CDBG and  HOME grantees\u2019 AIs with HUD guidance pertaining to their timeliness and  content, as well as the AIs\u2019 potential usefulness as fair housing planning  tools, and (2) identifies factors that may help explain any potential  weaknesses in grantees AIs, particularly factors related to HUD\u2019s  regulatory requirements and oversight and enforcement approaches.", "To address the first objective, we selected a representative sample of 473  CDBG and HOME grantees from the total population of 1,209 fiscal year  2009 program participants and requested their most recent AIs. We  received AIs from 441 of the 466 grantees in our final sample, for a  response rate of 95 percent. We reviewed these 441 AIs to, among other  things, estimate the extent to which all CDBG and HOME program  grantees had updated their AIs in accordance with HUD guidance and an  internal department study on AI compliance. Further, we analyzed a  nonrepresentative subset of 60 of the 281 current AIs we received (those  prepared from 2005 through 2010 that were among the total of 441 AIs  provided) to determine whether grantees or an external party had  prepared the documents, and compared them with HUD guidance to  determine whether they followed the department\u2019s recommended format.  Finally, we reviewed 30 AIs from this nonrepresentative subset to  categorize commonly identified types of potential impediments to fair  housing choice.", "For the second objective, we reviewed HUD\u2019s policies, procedures, and  guidance for overseeing and enforcing the AFFH requirement, particularly  pertaining to AIs, as well as information on resource levels for these  activities. We also reviewed the 2009 internal HUD study on AI compliance  and oversight; annual reports that grantees are required to submit to HUD  that, among other items, may discuss AFFH activities; public testimony by  senior HUD officials; and documentation and data on enforcement  activity. In addition, we interviewed HUD officials at headquarters and in  three regional and seven field offices that we selected on the basis of  varying criteria, including the size of the jurisdiction, as measured by the  number of grantees within each jurisdiction; geographic location; and  potential risk of nonconformance, as measured by the estimated incidence  of outdated or missing AIs. Appendix I provides more details about our  objectives, scope, and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2009 to September  2010, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

These programs include the following:    CDBG program: The CDBG program is authorized by Title I of the  Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended. The  program provides annual grants to states, metropolitan areas, and urban  counties to fund an extensive array of community development activities,  such as providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and  expanding economic opportunities that primarily benefit Americans of   modest financial means. The CDBG program was funded at about $3.6  billion in fiscal year 2009, making CDBG the largest grant program, with  the largest number of grantees.", "HOME program: The HOME program is the largest government-sponsored  affordable housing production program. HOME was authorized under Title  II of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990, as  amended, and provides grants to states and localities, often in partnership  with local nonprofit groups. These grants are used to fund a wide range of  activities that build, buy, and rehabilitate affordable housing for rent or  sale and provide direct rental assistance to low-income people. The  program was funded at about $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2009.", "HOPWA program: HOPWA is intended to address the urgent housing  needs of low-income Americans living with HIV/AIDs, who are  disproportionately represented in low-income minority communities.  HOPWA funds may be used for a wide range of housing, social services,  program planning, and development costs. HOPWA funds also may be  used for health care and mental health services, chemical dependency  treatment, nutritional services, case management, assistance with daily  living, and other supportive services. HOPWA was funded at about $310  million in fiscal year 2009.", "ESG program: The ESG provides homeless persons with basic shelter and  essential supportive services. It also provides short-term homeless  prevention assistance to persons at imminent risk of losing their own  housing due to eviction, foreclosure, or utility shutoffs.

HUD defines the AI  as a comprehensive review of potential impediments and barriers to the  right to be treated fairly when seeking housing. The AI is expected to  cover public and private policies, practices, and procedures affecting  housing choice and assess how they all affect the location, availability, and  accessibility of housing. Grantees are also to develop strategies and  actions to overcome these barriers based on history, circumstances, and  experiences. In effect, the AI is a tool that is intended to serve as the basis  for fair housing planning; provide essential information to policymakers,  administrative staff, housing providers, lenders, and fair housing advocate;  and assist in building public support for fair housing efforts. Grantees may  use a portion of their CDBG and other grant funds to prepare their AIs,  and AIs may be prepared by the grantees themselves or under contract  with external parties, such as fair housing groups, consultants,  universities, or others.", "While HUD regulations require grantees to prepare AIs, other requirements  pertaining to these local planning documents are limited. For example,  HUD has not issued regulations specifying how often grantees should  update their AIs or the specific elements that should be included in them.  HUD regulations also do not require grantees to submit their AIs to the  department for review and approval. Instead, CDBG and HOME grantees  are to annually certify to HUD that they are meeting AFFH requirements,  which include having prepared an AI, taking steps to address identified  impediments, and maintaining records of their actions. HUD generally  accepts grantees annual AFFH certifications, including that they have  prepared AIs, and will not initiate further reviews unless evidence to the  contrary emerges from complaints or through the department\u2019s routine  monitoring activities.", "While HUD has not issued regulations that specifically define when the  grantees\u2019 must update their AIs, or what elements they must include, it has  issued recommended guidance on these subjects. As discussed in this  report, for example, HUD has issued guidance recommending that  grantees update their AIs every 3 to 5 years. In 1996, HUD also issued a fair  housing guide, which included a suggested format for AIs and other  important fair housing planning elements (see table 1). The format and  elements include an introduction and executive summary; jurisdictional  and background data, such as demographic data and analysis; and an  evaluation of the jurisdiction\u2019s current fair housing legal status, such as a  listing and description of fair housing related complaints that have been  filed and their status or resolution.

These AFFH activity reports include the  following:    Consolidated Plan (ConPlan): The ConPlan, which grantees must file with  HUD for review and approval every 5 years, is a planning document that  identifies low- and moderate-income housing needs within a community  and specifies how grantees intend to use federal funds to address those  needs.

The CAPER must include, among other things, actions taken  to affirmatively further fair housing. HUD is responsible for reviewing the  accuracy of the CAPER.

CPD is  responsible for helping ensure that grantees are in overall compliance with  CDBG and other grant program requirements. For example, CPD is  responsible for ensuring that grantees spend federal funds on approved  activities, such as affordable housing creation and community  development. To carry out their oversight activities, CPD staff are to  review and approve grantees\u2019 ConPlans, Annual Action Plans, and CAPERs  and conduct on-site monitoring reviews of a limited sample of high-risk  grantees each year to assess their compliance with various program  requirements, including those pertaining to AFFH. HUD has the authority  to disapprove a ConPlan if the grantee\u2019s AFFH certification is inaccurate  or missing. Disapproval of a ConPlan may result in withholding CDBG and  other formula grant funds until the grantee submits an adequate AFFH  certification within an established time frame. While CPD serves as HUD\u2019s  main liaison with grantees, FHEO maintains final authority to determine  and resolve matters involving fair housing compliance, including the AFFH  requirement. In carrying out their responsibilities, FHEO staff may use the  results of CPD\u2019s oversight activities, such as its reviews of grantees\u2019  reports and on-site monitoring reviews.

Specifically, we estimate that 29 percent of all AIs were  prepared in 2004 or earlier, including 11 percent that date from the 1990s.  Because many grantees\u2019 AIs are outdated, they may not provide a reliable  basis to identify and mitigate current impediments to fair housing that may  exist within their communities. We also (1) did not receive AIs from 25  grantees despite repeated requests that they provide them, which suggests  that, in some cases, grantees may not maintain the documents as is  required; and (2) several grantees provided documents with their status as  AIs not clear due to their brevity and lack of content. While the majority of  grantees may have current AIs, we question the usefulness of many such  AIs as fair housing planning documents.

The most commonly  cited impediments to fair housing choice were zoning restrictions,  inadequate public services in low-and moderate-income areas, lending  discrimination, and a lack of public awareness about fair housing rights.  Further, we found that current AIs generally contained several basic  elements suggested in HUD\u2019s guidance, such as demographic data and  analysis, and recommendations to overcome identified impediments.  However, a significant majority of the current AIs did not identify time  frames for implementing the recommendations or contain the signatures  of top elected officials as is also suggested in HUD\u2019s guidance. As a result,  these AIs may not provide a reliable basis for measuring the grantees\u2019  progress in overcoming impediments or reasonable assurance that top  elected officials endorse the recommendations in the AI and are  accountable for implementing them. In sum, our review found limited  assurances that grantees are placing needed emphasis on preparing AIs as  effective planning tools to identify and address potential impediments to  fair housing as required by statutes governing the CDBG and HOME  programs and HUD regulations and guidance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "An Estimated 29 Percent of AIs Are Outdated and Thus May Not Provide a Reliable Basis for Identifying and Mitigating Current Impediments to Fair Housing", "paragraphs": ["We estimate that while 64 percent of all grantees have current AIs, 29  percent may be outdated having been prepared in 2004 or earlier  (including 11 percent from the 1990s), and the date for 6 percent could not  be determined (fig. 1). While HUD has not officially defined what  constitutes an outdated AI through regulation, it has issued guidance that  addresses how often an AI should be updated. Using HUD\u2019s guidance and  interviews with department officials as criteria, we define an AI as  outdated if it was completed in 2004 or earlier. Specifically, HUD\u2019s 1996  Fair Housing Planning Guide\u2014the main reference document for grantees  in developing AIs\u2014suggests that grantees conduct or update them at least  every 3 to 5 years, in part to be consistent with the consolidated planning  cycle. On February 14, 2000 and again on September 2, 2004, HUD issued  memorandums to all CPD and FHEO officials to remind grantees to update  their AIs annually when necessary, but especially at the beginning of a new  consolidated 5-year planning cycle. In addition, HUD\u2019s 2009 study on  grantees\u2019 AI conformance concluded that the grantees with AIs dating  from the 1990s may place a low priority to them and that such AIs should  be updated.", "The incidence of outdated AIs was generally consistent across the country  and among both large and small grantees. Figure 2 shows the percentage  of grantees with outdated AIs in each of the geographic areas covered by  HUD\u2019s 10 regional offices, which ranged from a low of 14 percent in  Region IV to a high of 45 percent in Region VII. Despite the variation, only  one region had a statistically significant difference between its percentage  of outdated AIs and the percentage at the national level.", "HUD\u2019s 2009 internal study on AI conformance also concluded that many  grantees\u2019 AIs were outdated. Specifically, in examining the timeliness of  45 AIs in its sample, HUD found that about 18 percent (8) were produced  before 2000 and had not yet been updated. While the HUD study provides  some insights into the AIs, its findings cannot be generalized to the entire  population because of limitations in its sampling methodology.", "Because many grantees\u2019 AIs are outdated, they may not provide a reliable  basis for identifying and mitigating impediments to fair housing. For  example, HUD\u2019s 1996 fair housing guidance suggests that grantees use  demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau when preparing their AIs  and to update these planning documents as new census data becomes  available. Updated census data could indicate demographic trends within  a jurisdiction that might be useful in preparing an AI, such as whether  particular areas of a jurisdiction are becoming progressively more or less  segregated over time and the potential reasons thereof. Moreover,  according to one FHEO field office official, grantees should update their  AIs every 5 years per the guidance, because the impediments to fair  housing in a particular community evolve and change, and new issues can  occur on a continuing basis. Another FHEO field office official said that an  AI dated from the 1990s would not be considered current under any  circumstances. The official said that grantees should update their AIs  periodically to adjust to the development of potential impediments to fair  housing choice within their communities. For example, the official noted  that, subprime mortgage lending grew substantially during the 2000s, and  subprime mortgage lenders potentially disproportionately targeted  minority borrowers, which resulted in many foreclosures among such  groups.  Without taking steps to update their AIs, whether grantees that  receive federal funds through the CDBG, HOME, and other grant programs  are sufficiently focused on overcoming current impediments to fair  housing that may exist within their communities is unclear."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "We Did Not Receive AIs from 25 Grantees and the Brevity and Lack of Content of Others Raised Questions about Whether They Were AIs", "paragraphs": ["We did not receive AIs from 25 grantees, despite intensive follow up  efforts that included multiple e-mails and phone calls to appropriate  officials. Representatives from some of these grantees offered several  reasons for not providing the requested AIs. For example, representatives  from two grantees said that they could not find their AIs, and a  representative from another said an AI had not been prepared. Further,  representatives from 8 grantees stated that they had already sent us their  AIs, although we have no record of receiving them. We cannot definitively  determine that all these grantees are out of compliance with statutes and  HUD regulations requiring grantees to maintain AIs. However, the failure  of these grantees to provide AIs, together with the results of HUD\u2019s 2009  study that also found that some grantees did not provide AIs as requested,  raises questions about whether some jurisdictions may be receiving  federal funds without preparing the documents required to demonstrate  that they have taken steps to affirmatively further fair housing.", "Our analysis of the 441 AIs we received from grantees also indicates that  the documents ranged in length from several hundred pages with  supporting graphs and other materials to a few pages of content. For  example, one grantee\u2019s AI contained 64 tables illustrating a wide variety of  information, ranging from a breakdown of the grantee\u2019s population by  race, ethnicity, and poverty status to the rates at which low-income  applicants in the grantee were denied conventional loans. While AIs may  consist of many pages, length does not necessarily indicate the quality of  these documents. For example, some lengthy AIs we reviewed had reports  attached, including their CAPERS, that grantees were required to submit  to HUD separately.

To gain insights into current AIs, we  reviewed a subset of 60 of the 281 such documents that we received for a  variety of reasons, including to determine their authorship. HUD\u2019s 1996  guidance suggests that AIs may be authored by grantees, fair housing or  industry groups, universities or colleges, or any combination thereof. Our  analysis indicates that grantees, through their community development  and planning offices, for example, had prepared about half of the 60  current AIs we reviewed (table 2). In 9 of the 60 cases we reviewed, the  grantee had contracted with a fair housing organization; in 9 of the 60  cases with a private consulting firm; and in 4 cases with a university or  college.

One AI we reviewed, which was prepared on  behalf of several grantees by a regional planning unit within a local  university, identified some of their established or planned land use policies  as potential impediments to fair housing. For example, the AI found that  some of the grantees had minimum lot-size requirements for building  single-family residences that could limit housing affordability. The AI  noted that a 1-acre minimum lot size, for example, would create land costs  that would make owning or renting homes on such lots unaffordable to  low-income families. Further, the AI noted that some of the grantees were  considering requiring that all new homes be constructed of brick, a  requirement that could substantially increase construction costs compared  with siding and make the homes unaffordable to low-income families. To  address these potential impediments, the AI recommended that the  grantees (1) ensure that a sufficient portion of their communities were  zoned for multifamily construction and that lot sizes for single-family  housing were small enough to keep single-family housing affordable and  (2) consider the potential impact on housing affordability, including on  minority families, before adopting building codes that require all-brick  construction.", "Neighborhood revitalization, municipal and other services, employment- housing transportation linkage. One AI prepared by a private nonprofit  fair housing organization on behalf of several grantees noted that the  area\u2019s transportation system was inadequate to service the needs of all  residents. The AI concluded that residents who wanted or needed to use  public transportation were obliged to limit their residences to the  jurisdictions in which their jobs were located even if they wanted to live  elsewhere. To address this impediment, the AI recommended that the  grantees support a regional transportation system that not only provided  services to low- and moderate-income households throughout the area but  also met the needs of employers in geographic areas that were not  currently served.", "Lending policies and practices. An AI for a large county comprising  several grantees included a review of data required under the Home  Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). The analysis found that mortgage  lenders in the jurisdiction denied the applications of upper-income black  applicants at a rate that was three times higher than the rate for equally  situated white applicants. Further, the AI found that the loan denial rate  for Hispanic mortgage applicants was twice as high as that of equally  situated white applicants. The AI recommended that the grantees contract  with a consultant to prepare and conduct training for mortgage lenders to  encourage their voluntary compliance with fair housing laws. Finally, the  AI recommended that the grantees continue to monitor HMDA data to  determine if the educational programs had a positive effect on loan denial  rates for minorities.", "Fair housing informational programs. An AI for a county concluded that,  because the grantee received few complaints from residents about fair  housing, there might be a lack of public knowledge about fair housing  rights and responsibilities. The AI suggested that because residents might  not be aware of such issues, landlords and others involved in the real  estate business could feel that they had more leeway in dealing with  potential home buyers and renters. As a result, the AI recommended that  the grantee should promote fair housing education through public  workshops, presentations at schools and libraries, public service  announcements in English and Spanish, and the distribution of fair  housing literature at all county facilities and events."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Time Frames for Implementing Recommendations and the Signatures of Top Elected Officials Raises Questions about the Usefulness of Many Current AIs as Planning Documents", "paragraphs": ["While current AIs may identify a variety of potential impediments to fair  housing and strategies to overcome them, questions exist about the status  of many such AIs as local planning documents. As part of our review, we  found that the 60 current AIs generally included five of the seven key  elements in the suggested format for AIs contained in HUD\u2019s 1996 fair  housing guidance (table 4). Specifically, four of these elements were  present in over 55 of the 60 grantees\u2019 AIs: jurisdictional background data,  evaluation of fair housing legal status, identifications of impediments to  fair housing choice, and conclusions and recommendations. The  introduction and executive summary were present in 52 of the grantees\u2019  AIs. However, we found that only 12 of the AIs included time frames for  implementing recommendations for overcoming impediments and that  only 8 AIs included the signatures of top elected officials.", "The lack of time frames for implementing proposed actions among a  substantial majority\u201448 of the subset of 60 current AIs we reviewed\u2014is  potentially significant. HUD\u2019s guidance on including estimated time frames  for implementing recommendations is generally consistent with our view  that time frames are an important component of effective strategic and  other planning process. Recognizing the importance of specific time  frames, officials from one HUD field office we contacted routinely  provided technical advisory notices to aid grantees that were preparing or  updating their AIs. These notices recommend, among other things, that  grantees include benchmarks and timetables for implementing actions in  their AIs. In the absence of established time frames in AIs, determining  whether grantees are achieving progress in implementing  recommendations to overcome identified impediments is difficult.", "Further, our finding that 52 of the 60 current AIs did not include the  signatures of top elected officials raises questions as to whether the  officials endorse the analyses and support suggested actions in the AIs and  are accountable for implementing them. These questions may be  particularly significant with respect to the 25 AIs identified in table 2 that  were prepared by an external party under contract, such as a fair housing  group or consultant, rather than by the grantee through one of its  agencies. Our review indicates that none of these 25 AIs had been signed  by the grantees\u2019 top elected officials. While HUD field office officials we  contacted said the lack of these signatures did not necessarily mean that  the grantees did not plan to implement the actions described in the  documents, other HUD officials disagreed. For example, officials from two  field offices said that the lack of such signatures suggested that the  grantees may not endorse the analysis and recommendations in the AIs.  Officials from one of these field offices said that, in the absence of the  signature of a top elected official, an AI had little value as a planning  document. We note that HUD requires authorizing grantee officials to sign  documents that, among other things, certify that their ConPlans identify  community development and housing needs, contain specific short- and  long-term objectives to address such needs, and certify that the grantee is  following its department-approved plan. This is not an uncommon  accountability model for compliance-based regulatory structures.  Without the signatures of top elected officials, it is not clear that grantees  have established plans to identify and address impediments to fair housing  within their jurisdictions.", "We identified an example of an AI that lacked time frames for addressing  impediments and had not been signed by a top elected official and that did  not appear to be functioning as an effective planning document. This AI,  which was prepared under contract by a fair housing group, had 15  specific recommendations, including conducting fair lending \u201ctesting\u201d and  establishing an effective code enforcement program. We contacted the  CDBG representative for this grantee, who said that he believed that the AI  contained just two recommendations. The official also stated that, due to  other priorities, the grantee had not yet had time to implement either of  these two recommendations and did not have immediate plans to do so.", "HUD\u2019s 2009 study also raises questions about the usefulness of many AIs  as planning documents to identify and address potential impediments to  fair housing. As discussed previously, this study concluded that many of  the AIs in its sample dated from the 1990s, which HUD said indicated that  these grantees place a low priority on the documents. According to the  HUD study, moreover, many of the AIs reviewed did not conform to the  department\u2019s guidance and appeared to have been prepared in a cursory  fashion. In sum, our findings that many AIs are outdated, may not be  prepared as required, or lack time frames and signatures, together with the  findings of HUD\u2019s study, raise significant questions as to whether the AI is  effectively serving as a tool to help ensure that all grantees are committed  to identifying and overcoming potential impediments to fair housing  choice as required by statutes governing the CDBG and HOME programs  and HUD regulations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HUD\u2019s Limited Regulatory Requirements and Oversight and Enforcement Approaches May Help Explain Why Many AIs Are Outdated or Contain Other Weaknesses", "paragraphs": ["HUD\u2019s AI requirements and oversight and enforcement approaches have  significant limitations that likely contribute to our findings that many such  documents are outdated or contain other weaknesses. In particular, HUD\u2019s  regulations have not established standards for updating AIs or the format  that they must follow, and grantees are not required to submit their AIs to  the department for review. According to HUD\u2019s 2009 internal report on AI  compliance, and CPD and FHEO officials, the limited regulatory  requirements pertaining to AIs and limited resources and competing  priorities adversely affect the department\u2019s capacity to help ensure the  effectiveness of AIs as fair housing planning documents. Moreover, our  work involving 10 HUD field offices identified specific instances that  illustrate the limitations in the department\u2019s AI oversight and enforcement  approaches and the need for corrective actions. For example, we found  that HUD officials rarely request grantees\u2019 AIs during on-site monitoring  reviews or receive complaints from the public about such documents,  which means that the department often has minimal information about the  status of grantees\u2019 AIs in terms of their timeliness and content. Conversely,  while we identified instances where certain field offices took proactive  steps to help ensure the integrity of the AI process, such as one office\u2019s  efforts to better ensure that grantees update their AIs periodically, these  initiatives were not common.

The following efforts describe how HUD  generally carries out these responsibilities:    Reviews of grantee reports and plans that, among other things, are to  address AFFH compliance. HUD CPD and FHEO officials are to regularly  review documents that grantees annually submit on their overall plans and  performance in complying with CDBG and other grant program  requirements. For example, at the end of the fiscal year, grantees are  required to submit their CAPER to HUD, which discusses their progress in  meeting their objectives for the use of CDBG and other grant funds. As  part of the CAPER, HUD requires grantees to include a description of  actions taken to AFFH.

HUD headquarters  establishes annual criteria for assessing risk each year and the percentage  of on-site monitoring reviews to be conducted. The criteria can include the  amount of the CDBG or HOME grant, the amount of time that has passed  since the last on-site review, and employee turnover in grantee offices  responsible for implementation of CDBG and other grant programs. CPD  officials generally were directed to visit at least 10 to 15 percent of the  grantees under their jurisdiction annually.

To better ensure that grantees  conform with HUD guidance, the report suggested requiring grantees to  submit their AIs for review and approval. The report noted that, because  grantees are not currently required to submit AIs to HUD, a possible first  step could simply be to implement a submission requirement. However,  the report also noted that HUD would have to dedicate sufficient  resources to conduct reviews of AIs and develop appropriate criteria for  assessing them.

However, HUD officials said the department has not yet  acted to implement the recommendations in the study.", "While HUD has not yet acted on the recommendations in the 2009 internal  study, senior headquarters officials cited limited regulatory requirements  as adversely affecting oversight efforts. In the absence of specific  regulatory requirements, CPD officials said it is difficult for field offices to  ensure that grantees update their AIs within specified time frames or  conform to a specific format in preparing the documents, including the  signatures of top elected officials. In contrast, the CPD staff noted that  there are specific regulatory requirements pertaining to grantees  ConPlans, Annual Action Plans, and CAPERs, including when these  documents must be prepared and what must be included, which facilitates  their oversight efforts. Additionally, CPD and FHEO officials in HUD\u2019s  headquarters cited limited resources and competing regulatory priorities  as limiting oversight of grantees\u2019 AIs and AFFH compliance generally and  potentially posing challenges to any new regulatory initiatives. CPD  officials said that obtaining and reviewing grantees\u2019 AIs is a low priority  for field office staff due to competing demands and limited resources, and  additional resources and technical expertise would be required for staff to  review and approve AIs as suggested in the department\u2019s internal study.", "CPD and FHEO officials from the 10 HUD field offices we contacted also  commented about limited AFFH regulatory requirements and oversight  approaches. For example, officials from 7 of the 10 field offices told us  that because grantees are not required to submit their AIs, verifying  whether grantees had AIs or had updated them was difficult. Some field  office staff officials also said that, because grantees are not required to  submit their AIs, their capacity to assess grantees\u2019 overall compliance with  AFFH requirements is limited. For example, without requiring grantees to  submit their AIs, the officials said that they could not verify whether the  potential impediments to fair housing choice that may be cited in other  documents, such as the grantees\u2019 5-year ConPlan and CAPERs, were the  same impediments listed in their AIs. One field office officials suggested  that HUD require grantees to submit their AIs as part of their 5-year  consolidated plans to enable them to verify that the two documents were  consistent. Officials from several field offices also recommended that HUD  revise its regulations to require that AIs meet certain standards for  timeliness and completeness, which they said would enhance their  abilities to oversee and enforce the program.", "Further, CPD and FHEO field office officials agreed with HUD  headquarters officials that declining resources and competing priorities  had limited their ability to assess grantees\u2019 AIs or AFFH compliance  generally. Representatives from all of the 10 HUD offices we contacted  said that their staff levels had decreased recently while their workload had  increased, especially with the implementation of the American Recovery  and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). For example, FHEO and  CPD officials in several field offices told us that they were losing staff due  to retirements and promotions. One FHEO Field Office Director said that  it had one official currently available to monitor 54 entitlement grantees\u2019  compliance with all relevant statutes and regulations, including those  pertaining to AFFH, within the office\u2019s jurisdiction. Additionally, CPD and  FHEO officials in one office commented that, at one time they had enough  staff to regularly send both a CPD and FHEO representative on on-site  monitoring reviews, but with staff reductions over the years, they are no  longer able to continue this practice. Field office officials also stated that  work priorities were often shifting, making it difficult for them to  consistently focus on one aspect of CDBG and other grant program  compliance.", "We identified the following specific examples that illustrate how HUD\u2019s  limited oversight and enforcement program on a nationwide basis may  have contributed to many AIs being outdated or not otherwise in full  conformance with department guidance, and further support the need for  corrective actions to address these limitations:    Our review of CAPERs for a group of grantees with outdated AIs raises  questions about the value of such reports as a means of assessing AFFH  compliance. As discussed previously, HUD\u2019s annual reviews of CAPERs  and other required grantee reports are a key means by which department  officials assess AFFH compliance in the absence of a requirement that  grantees routinely submit their AIs for review. We selected a  nongeneralizable sample of 30 grantees with outdated AIs from the 441  grantees that sent us AIs. We requested that HUD provide the most  recently available CAPER report for each of these 30 grantees to help us  determine what information these reports contain about the grantees\u2019 AIs,  and the department provided 27 CAPERs. In 17 of the 27 cases, the  grantees mentioned that they had an AI but did not specify the AI\u2019s date. In  such cases, HUD field offices that rely on CAPER reviews to help assess  AFFH compliance may not be aware AIs are outdated unless they  specifically follow up with the grantee to find out the date of its AI. In 10  cases, the grantees\u2019 CAPERs disclosed the date of their AI which, in some  cases, was from the 1990s. The extent to which HUD officials identify such  disclosures in CAPERs or follow up on them was not clear.", "Field offices\u2019 CPD on-site monitoring programs and complaint review  processes provide a limited basis for assessing grantees\u2019 AIs and taking  follow up actions as may be required. We obtained data from 7 of the 10  field offices we contacted regarding the number of CPD on-site grantee  reviews they conducted in 2009 and the number of times they obtained or  reviewed AIs during such monitoring. As table 5 indicates, CPD field office  officials reported collecting or reviewing AIs in 17 of the 88 reviews.  Moreover, officials from these 7 field offices said they rarely if ever receive  public complaints about a grantee\u2019s AI. Given the absence of public  complaints, which could be due to the fact that there may be a general  public unawareness that grantees are required to prepare AIs, the  complaint process does not appear to provide a systematic basis for HUD  to identify potential limitations in grantees\u2019 AIs and follow up with them as  necessary.", "Our visits to field offices located in the two HUD regions with the  highest incidence of outdated AIs illustrate some of the inherent  limitations in the department\u2019s oversight and enforcement processes.  According to an FHEO official in one of these offices, historically, it has  generally been unaware of the current state of a grantee\u2019s AIs, because the  grantees did not routinely submit them. In 2010, this official said the field  office requested that all of the grantees under its jurisdiction submit their  AIs, so that the office could gain a better perspective on the timeliness of  the AIs. In one case, the official said that the office learned that a grantee  that had been certifying its AFFH compliance for several years did not  have an AI. At the other field office, we identified instances where it  accepted AFFH certifications under questionable circumstances. For  example, in one case, representatives from a grantee told us that they  could not find its AI. When we asked field office officials about this  circumstance, they said that the grantee had provided a two-page  summary of an AI that it completed in 1996. Field office officials said that  they viewed the summary as sufficient evidence that the grantee had  completed an AI. Moreover, in distributing CDBG and other grant funds  each year, this field office sends routine communications which, among  other things, remind grantees to update their AIs periodically. While this is  a potentially positive step, the field office does not appear to take any  additional steps to ensure that AIs are not outdated. For example, we  identified at least one grantee subject to the field office\u2019s jurisdiction that  has received such communications for four consecutive years, but its AI  was prepared in the 1990s.", "While our analysis generally verified that there are limitations in HUD\u2019s  overall AI oversight and enforcement approaches that require corrective  action, we identified practices in certain field offices that appear designed  to better ensure that AIs are effective planning documents and that  grantees fulfill overall AFFH requirements. As discussed previously, in  2010, one HUD field office we contacted independently requested that all  grantees within its jurisdiction provide their AIs for review, which allowed  FHEO officials to determine that many such AIs were outdated, and one  grantee did not have an AI. In another example, officials from one field  office said that they maintain ongoing communications with grantees to,  among other things, determine the date they completed their AIs. In cases  where an AI is determined to be outdated, officials told us that they work  closely with the grantee through technical assistance to bring the AI up to  date. We corroborated the field office\u2019s assertion by reviewing the AIs we  received from grantees under its jurisdiction and found that all of the  grantees had sent us updated AIs. Another field office has established  procedures to use special assurance agreements, which were discussed  previously, to help ensure that grantees revise AIs that may have identified  deficiencies. However, these initiatives by individual field offices appear to  be isolated examples within HUD\u2019s general approach to AI and AFFH  oversight, which provides limited assurances that AIs serve as effective  planning tools to identify and address impediments to fair housing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Has Taken Steps to Begin to Address Regulatory, Oversight, and Resource Limitations, but These Efforts Are Ongoing", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing the limitations in AI and AFFH requirements and its oversight  processes, in 2009, HUD initiated a process to review and revise its  existing regulations.

In  January 2010, HUD\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal  Opportunity testified that the department was working on a proposed  regulation to enhance AFFH compliance. According to a senior HUD  attorney, revising the AFFH regulation is a priority for HUD, and the  proposed rule may cover a variety of topics, including enhancements to  the guidance provided to grantees on preparing AIs and improvements in  the department\u2019s oversight and enforcement approaches. However, until  the rule is proposed, it is not clear what topics it will address. The HUD  attorney also said that the department\u2019s tentative time frame for publishing  a proposed rule to revise AFFH requirements is in December of 2010.

In this document, the  Secretary described a strategy for addressing HUD\u2019s need to identify  qualified individuals for its talent pipeline over the next three fiscal years.  The Secretary stated that this strategy would incorporate the utilization of  various federal programs that are designed to recruit and retain students  to positions in the federal government, such as the Presidential  Management Fellows Program, the Student Career Experience Program;  and the Student Temporary Employment Program. During our review, a  CPD official said that the office recently announced a buyout for certain  officials and that CPD was \u201cmoving more aggressively to recruit and hire  approximately 50 new employees in the next 3 months with the skills to  provide grant oversight, assess grantee and community needs,\u201d among  other activities.", "While the effects of these plans and initiatives remain to be seen, we note  that some of the proposals to enhance HUD\u2019s AI and AFFH oversight and  enforcement approaches would not necessarily involve a significant  commitment of additional staff resources. In particular, requiring grantees  to submit their AIs for review, without necessarily approving them, would  allow CPD and FHEO officials to perform a variety of basic tasks to better  ensure their quality. These tasks could include verifying whether AIs (1)  have been prepared as required, (2) updated in accordance with HUD  guidance, (3) include all elements suggested in the 1996 fair housing  guidance, and (4) are consistent with AFFH discussions in other key  documents, particularly CAPERs. If HUD officials identified any areas of  concern with grantees\u2019 AIs through such analysis, they could follow up as  necessary, through technical assistance, enforcement actions, or other  activities as may be necessary, to better ensure that AI serve as effective  tools to identify and overcome impediments to fair housing.

Given that many AIs are outdated, they do  not likely serve as effective planning documents to identify and address  current potential impediments to fair housing choice. Moreover, some  grantees may not prepare AIs, and others sent us cursory documentation  as their AIs which, on the basis of their content, do not appear to be AIs.  While we estimate that 64 percent of grantees have prepared current AIs,  the usefulness of many such AIs as planning documents is uncertain. Our  review of a subset of 60 current AIs indicates that, while many of them  identify potential impediments to fair housing choice and contain  recommendations to overcome them, the vast majority also lack time  frames for implementing identified recommendations or the signatures of  top elected officials, both of which are necessary to establish clear  accountability to carrying out the AFFH intent. Without time frames,  judging a grantees\u2019 progress in overcoming identified impediments is  difficult and, without the signatures of top elected officials, determining  whether responsible officials endorse the recommendations in the AIs and  are accountable for ensuring their implementation is unclear. Absent any  changes in the AI process, they will likely continue to add limited value  going forward in terms of eliminating potential impediments to fair  housing that may exist across the country.", "HUD\u2019s limited approach to establishing AI regulatory requirements, and its  limited oversight and enforcement approaches, may help explain the  various weaknesses in the documents that we have identified.

Specifically, grantees are not required through  regulation to update their AIs periodically, include certain information,  follow a specific format in preparing AIs, or submit them to HUD for  review. These limitations are not new or unknown to HUD officials, yet  little progress has been made to address them. While HUD officials said  that the department is working on a regulation to enhance grantees\u2019  compliance with AFFH requirements since 2009, what the regulation will  ultimately entail, or when it will be completed is unclear.

However, depending on how  any changes are structured, resources could be better leveraged to provide  more coverage for overseeing grantees. For example, while HUD officials  expressed concerns about the resources and technical expertise necessary  to approve AIs, a grantee submission requirement itself could have several  significant benefits without necessarily involving a significant commitment  of staff resources. Specifically, a submission requirement could allow HUD  staff to verify basic items, such as whether grantees have prepared AIs as  required, and whether such AIs have been updated and conform to an  established format, and are consistent with other critical reports, such as  CAPERs. Moreover, a submission requirement would provide enhanced  incentives for grantees to better ensure that their AIs serve as effective  planning tools to identify potential impediments to fair housing and to  overcome them.

For example,  HUD may take steps to reward grantees for participating in regional  efforts to promote integration or decreasing the concentration of poverty.", "Increasing the level of AFFH review and technical assistance. According  to HUD, since the beginning of fiscal year 2010, FHEO regional and field  offices have increased the level review of grantee\u2019s AIs within their  jurisdictions. The letter also stated that some offices have requested  grantees to submit their AIs whereas other offices are doing so on a risk  basis. Moreover, HUD stated that, since January 2010, it has increased its  training of grantees regarding their AFFH compliance requirement. This  training covers the AI and the importance of its completion, what  information should be included in the AI including race and ethnicity data,  who should complete the AI, the consequences of not completing the AI,  and how to report fair housing activities.", "Improving HUD\u2019s capacity for monitoring and enforcing AFFH  compliance. HUD stated that it is exploring ways to find greater  efficiencies and reduce staff time spent on routine administrative matters  and to dedicate more time to AFFH oversight. This is to include additional  training for HUD on AFFH oversight. Specifically, HUD said it is designing  training at its National Fair Housing Academy on reviewing submissions to  better ensure consistent and valid review criteria. HUD said it is also  developing uniform standards for its staff of review of grantees\u2019 Annual  Action Plans and Consolidated Plans for compliance with AFFH  certifications.", "While we commend HUD for recognizing the need to take steps to improve  its oversight of AFFH compliance, many of the key challenges we found in  our report do not appear to be addressed by its current plans. Specifically,  we note that HUD did not address the status of its planned AFFH  rulemaking efforts, including standards for grantees to follow in updating  their AIs and the format that they should follow in preparing the  documents, such as including the time frames for implementing  recommendations and the signature of responsible officials. Further, HUD  did not discuss any plans to require, at a minimum, that grantees submit  their AIs to the department on a routine basis to help ensure grantees  compliance with requirements and guidance pertaining to these  documents. In the absence of such regulatory requirements, the usefulness  of requiring AIs as a tool to affirmatively further fair housing is diminished.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

To ensure  a high response rate, we e-mailed follow-up requests to nonrespondents  approximately 2 and 4 weeks after the initial e-mail. As a result of this  follow-up, we learned that 7 grantees in our initial sample were out of the  scope of our study and subsequently excluded them, thereby reducing our  sample to 466 grantees. We then conducted intensive follow up with the  remaining nonrespondents, making repeated attempts to acquire the  requested AIs through multiple phone calls and e-mails conducted by  contractors hired specifically for this phase of the document request  effort. Despite repeated attempts to follow up with nonrespondents, 25  grantees did not submit an AI (see table 6 for rationales provided by  officials from these 25 grantees).", "Upon conclusion of the document request effort, we received AIs from 441  grantees for a response rate of 95 percent.

We used the standard errors of the estimates to  calculate whether any differences between the grantees by region and  grant size were statistically significant at the 95 percent confidence level.", "To evaluate the timeliness of AIs, we relied on HUD criteria, including the  1996, 2000, and 2004 guidance that recommended that they be updated  every 3 to 5 years, and annually as necessary, and the findings of a 2009  internal HUD study on AI compliance, which concluded that AIs  completed in the 1990s are outdated. Specifically, using a data collection  instrument (DCI), we systematically noted the publication dates of all 441  AIs and also noted if no date was mentioned in the AI.
