In recent years GAO has identified shortcomings in DOD's strategic planning and was asked to determine (1) whether DOD has implemented our prior recommendation to develop and implement a depot maintenance strategic plan, (2) the extent to which the services have developed and implemented comprehensive strategic workforce plans, and (3) what challenges adversely affect DOD's workforce planning."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD has not implemented our October 2001 recommendation to develop and implement a DOD depot strategic plan that would delineate workloads to be accomplished in each of the services' depots. The DOD depot system has been a key part of the department's plan to support military systems in the past, but the increased use of the private sector to perform this work has decreased the role of these activities. While title 10 of the U.S. code requires DOD to retain core capability and also requires that at least 50 percent of depot maintenance funds be spent for public-sector performance, questions remain about the future role of DOD depots. Absent a DOD depot strategic plan, the services have in varying degrees, laid out a framework for strategic depot planning, but this planning is not comprehensive. Questions also remain about the future of arsenals and ammunition plants. GAO reviewed workforce planning efforts for 22 maintenance depots, 3 arsenals, and 2 ammunition plants, which employed about 72,000 civilian workers in fiscal year 2002. The services have not developed and implemented strategic workforce plans to position the civilian workforce in DOD industrial activities to meet future requirements. While workforce planning is done for each of the industrial activities, generally it is short-term rather than strategic. Further, workforce planning is lacking in other areas that the Office of Personnel Management guidance and high-performing organizations identify as key to successful workforce planning. Service workforce planning efforts (1) usually do not assess the competencies; (2) do not develop comprehensive retention plans; and (3) sometimes do not develop performance measures and evaluate workforce plans. Several challenges adversely affect DOD's workforce planning for the viability of its civilian depot workforce. First, given the aging depot workforce and the retirement eligibility of over 40 percent of the workforce over the next 5 to 7 years, the services may have difficulty maintaining the depots' viability. Second, the services are having difficulty implementing multiskilling--an industry and government best practice for improving the flexibility and productivity of the workforce--even though this technique could help depot planners do more with fewer employees. Finally, increased training funding and innovation in the training program will be essential for revitalizing the aging depot workforce."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The manufacture and support of military weapons involves a vast array  of industrial capability some of which is in the private sector and some  of which is in the public sector. The part in the public sector centers  around 27 key Department of Defense (DOD) industrial facilities, including  22 maintenance depots, 3 arsenals, and 2 government-owned and-operated  ammunition manufacturing plants. The civilian workforce in these  activities was reduced by about 56 percent between 1987 and 2002\u2014from  about 163,000 to about 72,000 employees. The workforce reduction  occurred as a result of downsizing initiatives, the increased use of the  private sector for logistics support activities, and other factors. Because  seniority was a major factor in determining which workers would be  retained and little new hiring has occurred in most of these activities, the  result of downsizing is that more than 7,000 civilian employees, or about  12 percent of the remaining workforce, are currently eligible to retire and  about 43 percent will be eligible to retire by 2009. This has created a  human capital management challenge for DOD. In addition, DOD\u2019s  challenge is exacerbated by the war on terrorism and other critical  military operations while it also is undertaking significant transformation  initiatives and addressing initiatives to further streamline its operations,  including responding to further downsizing mandates.", "In recent years, we have emphasized the importance of strategic  planning in DOD for establishing and achieving key mission objectives.  We have also identified specific deficiencies in DOD\u2019s planning for depot  maintenance operations. For example, in October 2001, we reported that  DOD had no overall plan that tied investments in depot maintenance  facilities and equipment with future workloads and, in turn, with human  capital needs. At that time we recommended that DOD, among other  actions, develop a strategic\u2014or long-term\u2014plan for depot maintenance  that addressed human capital needs and the specific actions necessary to  meet them.", "This report looks specifically at the strategic workforce planning for the  27 previously mentioned DOD industrial facilities.

This appendix also describes the type of work  performed at the activities and the number of DOD civilians employed in  each. The activities generally require extensive shop facilities and  specialized equipment and employ a range of personnel from highly  skilled technicians and engineers to laborers. Figure 2 shows a collection  of maintenance or manufacturing activities performed in some of the  27 industrial activities. In fiscal year 2002, these activities employed about  72,000 civilian employees\u2014about 10 percent of DOD\u2019s civilian workforce.  About 1,200 military personnel are also employed in these activities, with  over half the military assigned to the Pearl Harbor Shipyard and  Intermediate Maintenance Activity, which in 1998 consolidated its depot  and intermediate maintenance work into one activity, bringing together  the largely military workforce employed in the intermediate activity with  the largely civilian population employed in the shipyard. In the other DOD  industrial activities, military personnel are largely in managerial or  supervisory positions. Of the approximately 72,000 civilian employees, the  Army employs about 14,200; the Navy, about 35,500; the Marine Corps,  about 1,300; and the Air Force, about 21,100. Various factors (such as the  downsizing of the U.S. military force structure; increased use of the private  sector for performing support activities; and changes in repair processes,  increasing equipment\u2019s time in the field) have resulted in significant  reductions in the number of personnel working in these facilities. For  example, the number of personnel assigned to DOD maintenance depots  was reduced by about 60 percent between 1987 and 2001\u2014from about  156,000 to about 64,500 workers, while the total amount of maintenance  work was cut in half during that period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993", "paragraphs": ["Improved strategic planning has been a key goal of the federal government  in recent years, with the Government Performance and Results Act of  1993 providing guidance on strategic planning for government activities.

Absent a comprehensive DOD plan, the services have in  varying degrees initiated a strategic depot planning effort.

In the past, the department requested repeal of  legislative provisions that influenced the continued use of DOD facilities  and personnel performing depot maintenance activities and recently again  considered proposing the repeal in order to gain flexibility for its business  decisions. However, the identification and acquisition of future core  capabilities are key to strategic depot planning.", "Section 2464 of title 10 requires the Secretary of Defense to identify and  maintain a core logistics capability. Under that provision, the core logistics  capability is to be owned and operated by the government to ensure the  existence of a ready and controlled source of technical competence and  resources so that the military can effectively and timely respond to  mobilization, national defense emergencies, and contingencies. The core  capabilities are to include those necessary to maintain and repair the  weapon systems and military equipment that the Secretary, in consultation  with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, identifies as necessary to  meet the nation\u2019s military needs. Furthermore, the Secretary is to identify  the workloads required to maintain those core capabilities and to require  their performance in government facilities. Finally, the Secretary is to  assign these facilities sufficient workloads to ensure peacetime cost  efficiency, technical competencies, surge capacity, and reconstitution  capabilities to support military strategic and contingency plans.  Nonetheless, the concept of core capabilities is not precise and has been  controversial. We have previously reported that the department\u2019s  implementation of the core statute is not comprehensive and that the  policy and implementing procedures and practices provide little assurance  that core maintenance capabilities are being developed as needed to  support future national defense emergencies and contingencies. In  response to our report, DOD has revised its core policy to improve the  department\u2019s guidance to the military services regarding how core  capability requirements should be developed. Although this guidance has  been issued, questions remain about the guidance and the services are not  accomplishing key analyses to identify essential core capabilities.", "In addition, 10 U.S.C. 2466 specifies that no more than 50 percent of the  funds made available for depot maintenance may be spent for private  sector performance, unless the requirement is waived for a particular  fiscal year. This sets aside 50 percent of the funding for public-sector  performance of these workloads. In recent years, our mandated reviews  of the allocation of depot maintenance work between the public and  private sector with regard to the 50 percent funding rule have found  that increasing amounts of the service\u2019s depot work was going to the  private sector. For example, during fiscal 2001 and 2002, the Air Force  exceeded the 50 percent limit and waived the requirement; we could not  determine with precision whether the Army was in compliance with the  50 percent provision.", "Because DOD implemented an acquisition policy that called on the private  sector for life-cycle logistics support of its weapons systems, during the  1990s most new weapon system programs called for using private-sector  maintenance providers, with depot repair of few new programs going to  military depots. With some increased visibility and awareness of the 50-50  and core provisions, DOD has recognized the need to revitalize the depots.  DOD guidance supports the use of public-private partnerships. In some of  these partnerships, private-sector logistics providers subcontract with  military depots for some depot maintenance work. We recently reported  that public-private partnerships comprise only about 2 percent of DOD\u2019s  depot maintenance work, and while the department plans to significantly  increase the use of such partnerships, there are some challenges that  must be overcome if the department\u2019s planned expansion of partnerships  is to be realized. It is uncertain the extent to which public-private depot  maintenance partnerships will result in contractor personnel replacing  DOD civilian personnel in depots. However, because the 50-50 guidance  provides that the funds for some depot partnerships are not counted when  applying the 50 percent limitation, partnership work could be a vehicle for  transferring significant amounts of maintenance to the private sector  without exceeding the 50 percent limitation.", "DOD recently considered proposing changes to title 10 depot  maintenance provisions. A legislative proposal that was associated  with the department\u2019s transformation agenda suggested repealing six  sections that impose limitations on the management of depot-level  maintenance and repair by requiring certain amounts of work to be  performed in public depots. According to the proposed repeal, these  limitations reduce the flexibility necessary for the department to make  proper and efficient business decisions in determining the source for  depot-level maintenance and repair.

The  implications for the future are uncertain. In short, as we have reported,  the future capability for performing work in the military depot  maintenance facilities is questionable because no overall plan exists that  ties investments in depot maintenance facilities and plant equipment with  future workloads and, in turn, with human capital needs. Furthermore,  no other department plan provides required direction to shape the future  of these facilities and their workforce. Without strategic planning that  identifies which capabilities these activities will need to provide in the  future, there is no assurance they will be able to support future readiness  requirements as they have in the past. For example, DOD\u2019s latest logistics  strategic plan, which was developed in August 1999, neither mentioned  maintenance nor the large infrastructure and cadre of personnel required  to operate and support the DOD maintenance depots. This occurred even  though maintenance is an important logistics activity that is essential for  keeping complex weapon systems ready to perform even though about  half the department\u2019s depot maintenance work is currently performed in  military depots.", "Under the Government Performance and Results Act, federal agencies  are required to develop strategic plans that include mission statements,  strategic goals and objectives, and describe how the agencies intend to  achieve their goals and objectives through their activities, human capital,  information, and other resources. Depot officials said it is difficult to  develop a depot strategic plan with so many uncertainties about how the  military depots will be used in the future. This is particularly true in  light of the support initiatives implemented in recent years to contract  out to the private sector most logistics support activities, including depot  maintenance, for new and upgraded systems and also in light of the base  realignment and closure process that is planned for 2005. These initiatives  indicate that the role of military depots could be further reduced in the  future. But how much it will be reduced is not clear.

We reported in November of 1998, however, that  the Army did not have a sound basis for identifying the number of  positions to be eliminated from its depots. This was particularly the  case in determining the number of direct labor personnel needed to  support depot workload requirements. To address this problem, the  Army implemented the Army Workload and Performance System to  correlate workload and funding requirements with the depot workforce.  Nonetheless, this system does not provide the visibility of new systems,  modernization programs, and upgrades that will have depot work that  could be assigned to the depots.", "Depot planners said they have little assurance that new systems will be  brought in, as the older systems they currently work on are phased out  of the inventory. Recently, ownership of Army depots has shifted to  subordinate commands of the Army Materiel Command that are  responsible for the sustainment of Army systems. It was hoped that this  change would increase the commands\u2019 use of the depots and better  integrate depot work into the overall command mission performance,  but it is too soon to know if this will be successful. The subordinate  commands such as the Tank-automotive and Armaments Command  and Aviation and Missile Command, which are responsible for making  decisions about how support work will be allocated between the public  and private sectors, were also responsible for decisions that moved  responsibility for much of the work that used to be performed by the  depots to the private sector.

However, it is unclear whether the extent that the vision  these activities have for themselves is the same as the one that Army  headquarters and the parent commands have for these organizations.  Neither the Army nor most of the parent commands have officially  published strategic plans that identify the vision and objectives for these  activities. Most arsenals\u2019 workload and corresponding workforce have  been declining for years. The arsenals generally project workload and  corresponding workforce requirements primarily by consulting customers  and prospective customers regarding their future workload for the  arsenals. Arsenal officials said that this methodology provides a  reasonable workload projection for only 2 years. Further, some of the  work that is done in the arsenals is not the type of manufacturing work the  arsenals used to perform. For example, instead of manufacturing large  artillery systems, more than 40 percent of workload performed in the  Rock Island arsenal is manufacturing and assembling tool kits\u2014ranging  from carrying-case sized sets to fully equipped maintenance shelters.

Based on the results of the 2002 business case analysis,  which showed that the multiskill concept would increase readiness by  providing a more flexible and well-trained workforce, in September 2002  the naval aviation community again sought approval for the proposed  demonstration project, including increased compensation.", "Navy headquarters has not yet approved the request, but aviation  depot officials are going forward with the project using an alternative  compensation approach. They have established a compensation award  at each site, not to exceed a $2,500 annual award. Five different skill  combinations have been proposed for the Cherry Point Depot and two for  the Jacksonville depot. One combination has begun at the North Island  depot. According to naval aviation officials, workers are reluctant to  participate because while in training they would not have the opportunity  for overtime pay. Officials believe that getting an additional grade would  be sufficient to increase the willingness of depot workers to participate\u2014a  goal that is likely critical to getting the program to sufficient numbers to  make it cost-effective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Air Force Multiskilling Program Is Older but Declining", "paragraphs": ["Although the Air Force\u2019s current depot maintenance improvement effort  calls for determining cost effective ways to implement multiskilling,  officials are generally supportive of it as a workload tool; however, the  Air Force\u2019s multiskilling program is declining in size. In 1993, the Air Force  Materiel Command prototyped a multiskilling concept using aircraft  mechanics at the Oklahoma City depot. The program involved training  and certifying mechanics in multiple skills (aircraft, sheet metal, and  electrical) that were capable of performing a series of tasks involving  general airframe, structural, and electrical maintenance. By 1997, the  program had over 100 participants. However, since then, depot officials  told us the program has lost its popularity and currently consists of only  49 participants. Officials said that due to production requirements, many  of the skilled workers participating in the original project are now working  in their primary skill and new hires show little interest because there are  no financial incentives.", "At the Warner Robins depot, officials designated a specific occupation job  series, 8801, as multiskilling to provide workers with greater job flexibility  and a better career path. As of September 2001, 148 workers were  functioning in this job series. Multiskilled workers primarily performed  tasks in two occupations, such as aircraft mechanic and electrical  mechanic or aircraft mechanic and sheet metal mechanic. According to  depot officials, they used this occupational job series as a hiring tool to  attract younger, multiskilled workers at the entry level. However, workers  did not receive any additional salary.", "As a part of its depot maintenance improvement efforts, the Air Force has  refocused on multiskilling. Officials conducted a business case analysis to  determine the feasibility of various opportunities for using multiskilling at  the depots. After several months of data gathering and analysis, officials  said they were not able to provide a strong business case for developing a  standardized approach or expanding the use of multiskilling at the depots.  We found that, except in very limited cases, the depots are not doing true  multiskilling today. Rather, the depots are doing something similar called  multicrafting that does not involve the combination of two or more skills  at the journeyman skill level. Despite the results of the business case  analysis, officials from Headquarters, Air Force Materiel Command, and  the depots were generally supportive of multiskilling as a tool to deal with  fluctuating homogenous workloads and to facilitate movement of  employees as workload demands fluctuate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multiskilling Is Cited as Improving Flexibility and Cost-Effectiveness of Depot and Other Workforces", "paragraphs": ["Service, depot, and other organization officials cite the multiskilling  concept as a way to provide a more flexible, productive workforce that  can react more quickly to fluctuating workloads, a key issue in trying to  improve the cost-effectiveness of maintenance operations as well as meet  readiness needs.", "According to officials of the Naval Air Systems Command, the extensive  business case analysis they conducted indicated that multiskilling will  provide a trained workforce, more flexible for increased readiness, and  more capable of being able to be reassigned on demand to better support  fluctuating workloads. The officials also indicated that a multiskilling  program could also better support readiness by serving as an incentive to  skilled, near-retirement workers to stay and provide on-the-job training for  younger workers. In addition, depot officials reported, on the basis of the  economic analysis that savings would be achieved even though workers  would receive increased compensation.", "Various organizations such as the Tennessee Valley Authority are  exempt from OPM\u2019s job grading standards and are allowed to establish  a classification system that is more flexible and better fits their  environment. Among the flexibilities the Tennessee Valley Authority  has implemented is a multiskilled work force that receives additional  compensation for additional skills and work. The Tennessee Valley  Authority\u2019s program will involve about 1,400 current employees as well  as new hires. According to Authority officials, multiskilling is improving  the flexibility and efficiency of the workforce. As North America\u2019s  largest public power company, the Tennessee Valley Authority developed  its union agreements on multiskilling in fiscal year 2000 and fully  implemented its pilot program by the end of fiscal year 2001, with the  program expected to be fully implemented by 2005. The plan is to review  all preventive maintenance activities and reassign them to utilize multiskill  employees. Authority officials said that the multiskilling training program  is resulting in a more efficient way to accomplish their work and to obtain  and maintain a versatile group of employees. They reported that increases  in productivity and efficiency were expected to reduce restaffing after  attrition by about 15 percent.", "Private sector industrial activities have also implemented multiskilling.  According to Naval Air Systems Command and Air Force officials, they  did benchmarking in the private sector before they began trying to put  together their own multiskilling programs. Navy depot officials also noted  that they see increased usage of this concept when they do private sector  wage grade comparability studies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Need for Increased Funding and Innovation Driven by Increased Training Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Based on the potential retirement of about 31,000 depot workers out of the  approximately 72,000 workers in the workforce eligible to retire by 2009,  training requirements will increase significantly for new hires, and  innovation will be required to develop more cost-effective training  alternatives. For over 10 years, most depots had training costs much  smaller than would normally be required for industrial activities since  depot downsizing resulted in hiring few new employees. However,  because the Air Force currently has a significant deficit in funding training  for new hires and refresher training, depot officials raised concerns over  their ability to fund future training requirements needed for workforce  revitalization. Furthermore, as the depots face the challenge of developing  and implementing plans to address skill imbalances occurring due to  attrition and retirement over the next 5 to 7 years, the need for increased  funding will likely drive the need to find new funding sources and to  develop innovative training programs that cost less.", "The Air Force is already challenged by unfunded training costs. Air Force  workers who had received little training for years were required to take  \u201cback-to-basics training.\u201d This came about after accidents occurred at two  depots and additional training requirements evolved from the personnel  changes resulting from closing two Air Force depots and transferring  their work to other locations. However, although training requirements  increased, training budgets have not kept pace. For example, when Air  Force Materiel Command depot managers requested $10 million in 2001 to  train first-line supervisors, the Command did not approve any of that  funding. And when managers requested $11.5 million for budget years 2002  to 2007 to provide added training for new workers, the Command only  funded a portion of that request. Lacking sufficient training dollars to fund  their requirements, Air Force depot managers have been seeking ways to  partner with state government programs. Partnering with the states to  develop training programs and curriculum for co-op students at high  schools, vocational technical colleges, and universities was a cost-effective  strategy that enabled depots to hire certified and credentialed workers to  replace retirees. For example, the Warner Robins and Oklahoma City  depots are working primarily with the states of Georgia and Oklahoma to  establish training programs with local community colleges and high  schools so that new hires will be trained and certified as Federal Aviation  Association Aircraft and Power Plant license holders. Each of the Air  Force depots is developing courses to groom the next generation of  leaders and managers. But according to depot planners, much more needs  to be done and where the funding is to come from is unclear. This is  particularly true as the Air Force plans for the potential retirement of 43 to  52 percent of its depot workforce over the next 5 to 7 years.", "The other service depots are also experiencing challenges in funding  training as they begin to hire new employees after years of downsizing.  About half of the depots provide new industrial workers with training  through apprentice programs. The Air Force and one Marine Corps  center are using cooperative education programs, because they believe  apprenticeship programs, which take 3 to 4 years to qualify workers for  becoming journeymen-level workers, are too expensive. The Army  Materiel Command estimated that $7.9 million was needed to sustain  79 apprentices already in the program and to add 50 additional apprentices  for fiscal year 2002, or about $55,000 for each apprentice. However, the  Command did not receive this level of funding, which caused the  Command to transfer the costs to the depots as a cost of their operations.  Army Materiel Command reported that it has requested additional funding  for the apprentice program to support an average of 184 apprentices each  year for the 7-year period, fiscal years 2003 through 2009. Army depot  officials said that the program was too small in number to significantly  impact future worker needs. In addition, without the Army directly  funding the program costs; customers pay for depot services will increase,  which could lead to a loss of customer support. Two of the five Army  maintenance depots decided that no additional apprentices will be  accepted into the apprenticeship program unless the program can be  directly funded.", "In confronting the human capital challenge of revitalizing the depot  workforce, the services have the opportunity to develop innovative  training programs that cost less and to identify new funding sources for  training. According to Navy and Air Force officials, centralized training  programs and centralized funding could be considered cost-effective  ways to support depot revitalization. Officials also noted that centralized  training programs would help ensure consistency in the quality of training  provided to depot workers. Also, centralized funding would be another  source of funding and would provide centralized oversight and  accountability over how the funds are disbursed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Continued shortfalls in DOD\u2019s strategic planning process, including the  lack of a DOD depot strategic plan and a strategic plan for arsenals and  ammunition facilities have created questions regarding the future of the  72,000 civilians in the depot maintenance, arsenal, and ammunition  manufacturing plant workforce and their ability to support future military  operations. Without a strategic perspective that complements the  department\u2019s overall mission and objectives, the services do not have  the long-term visibility they need to ensure the continued performance  of these important support missions. When this is coupled with DOD\u2019s  adoption of increased contracting of work to the private sector, the future  role of these industrial facilities and their workforce is clearly in doubt.  The situation is compounded by questions regarding DOD\u2019s  implementation of the core maintenance statute, which is an essential  feature in defining the depot workforce of the future. While in some  cases the services have made a start at defining future objectives for the  industrial facilities that are centered around the development of  public-private partnerships, it is unclear how these partnerships should  be folded into future industrial facilities planning. Further, without a  departmental approach that has been approved by the Congress,  future depot planning will continue to be fragmented, inconclusive, and  inefficient. Since we have previously recommended that DOD develop a  depot strategic plan, we are not repeating that recommendation in this  report. However, we continue to believe a depot strategic plan is needed  and we will continue to follow DOD\u2019s progress toward implementing one.", "The absence of strategic guidance regarding the future of the DOD  industrial facilities has generally prevented the development of  comprehensive strategic workforce plans that are required for effectively  managing DOD\u2019s 72,000 civilian industrial facilities workers to meet the  challenges of the future. For example, without having long-term strategies  for acquiring, developing, and retaining their workforce that are clearly  linked to achieving programmatic goals, the services continued to  downsize these activities without a vision for what capabilities would be  required in the future. The result of downsizing is that the remaining depot  maintenance workforce averages 47 years of age and has skill imbalances.  With workload in some activities continuing to decline and with  uncertainties about new work for the future, officials in depots, arsenals,  and ammunition plants are uncertain whether they should plan to replace  retiring workers and about what skills will be needed in the future.  Furthermore, the industrial planners, in their short-term planning,  have followed some but not all of the steps identified by OPM and high  performing organizations, with the naval shipyard community and  Air Force more comprehensive in their workforce planning approaches.  However, the planners, have not, in general, identified competencies,  developed comprehensive retention plans, or evaluated the performance  of workforce planning efforts and taken corrective actions\uf8e7all best  practices that could help depots more effectively meet current and  future challenges.", "A number of challenges confront DOD\u2019s workforce planning for the  revitalization of this industrial workforce, about 12 percent of which are  eligible to retire in fiscal year 2002 and about 43 percent of which will be  eligible to retire by 2009. First, workforce planning efforts, which are  generally focused on the short-term, do not address the potential loss of  a third to over 40 percent of the depot workforce over a short period of  time, a challenge that could threaten the depots\u2019 viability. Only the Air  Force has taken action to ensure the continued viability of its depots in  2007 and beyond. Secondly, the current occupational series may not be  the best to most efficiently perform required maintenance operations.  Multiskilling, which has been successfully implemented in the private  sector and in some government activities, has flexibilities unavailable to  most government activities. However, depot activities trying to implement  the flexibilities have been confronted by rules that do not allow providing  an additional grade for performing work in additional skill areas. While  the naval aviation community is trying an approach that would use a  bonus rather than additional pay, naval aviation officials believe the  additional flexibilities are still needed. We also believe that if it proves to  be cost-effective, the full option of providing an additional grade would  help ensure the greatest potential for success. Finally, with the large  number of workers eligible to retire by 2009, training requirements and  funding for training will increase significantly for new hires. Further, the  need for increased funding for training will likely drive the need to find  new funding sources and to develop cost-effective training programs. A  centralized DOD depot training program could be a very practicable way  to introduce more innovative and cost-effective approaches to producing  and funding the required training to support depot revitalization, if the  department intends to continue using the depots as an important part of its  industrial base."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the management and direction of DOD\u2019s strategic planning for  maintenance depots, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct  the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Materiel  Readiness to    complete the revisions to DOD\u2019s core policy and develop a schedule  for the services to complete the computation of core requirements;  require the service secretaries and the Commandant of the Marine Corps  to develop revised core capabilities to provide a baseline for defining  workloads that should be performed in government facilities by  government personnel; and  require the service secretaries and the Commandant of the Marine Corps  to develop, or complete the development of, and implement strategic plans  that are linked to the services\u2019 mission and objectives and the Office of the  Secretary of Defense\u2019s depot strategic plan when it is developed and that  delineate industrial workloads to be accomplished in each service\u2019s  depots, other service\u2019s depots, by contractors at their own sites and at  government sites and using partnerships and identify the workforce  requirements to support the performance of this work.", "To improve the management and strategic direction of DOD\u2019s strategic  planning for arsenals and ammunition plants, we recommend that the  Secretary of Defense require the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics to develop a strategic plan that  provides guidance and a schedule for identifying long-term capabilities to  be provided by the private sector, those to be provided in government- owned and -operated plants; and those to be provided in government- owned and contractor-operated plants.", "To improve the quality and comprehensiveness of the services\u2019 workforce  planning efforts, we recommend that the Secretaries of the services and  the Commandant of the Marine Corps develop strategic workforce plans  that include improvements in areas identified in this report as being  deficient, such as assessing workforce competencies required for the  current and future workforce; implementing action plans that include  comprehensive retention plans; and establishing performance metrics to  use in evaluating workforce planning efforts and a mechanism for  performing assessments of prior workforce planning efforts.

Because the Congress has not  yet acted on the department\u2019s transformation proposal, we believe that it  is premature to assume that Congress will approve this new personnel  system.
