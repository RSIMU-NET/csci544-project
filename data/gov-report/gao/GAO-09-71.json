From 2000 to 2006, opium poppy cultivation and heroin production declined about 50 percent, while coca cultivation and cocaine production levels increased by about 15 and 4 percent, respectively. These increases, in part, can be explained by measures taken by coca farmers to counter U.S. and Colombian eradication efforts. Colombia has improved its security climate through systematic military and police engagements with illegal armed groups and by degrading these groups' finances. U.S. Embassy Bogot? officials cautioned that these security gains will not be irreversible until illegal armed groups can no longer threaten the stability of the government of Colombia, but become a law enforcement problem requiring only police attention. Since fiscal year 2000, State and Defense provided nearly $4.9 billion to the Colombian military and National Police. Notably, over 130 U.S.-funded helicopters have provided the air mobility needed to rapidly move Colombian counternarcotics and counterinsurgency forces. U.S. advisors, training, equipment, and intelligence assistance have also helped professionalize Colombia's military and police forces, which have recorded a number of achievements including the aerial and manual eradication of hundreds of thousands of hectares of coca, the seizure of tons of cocaine, and the capture or killing of a number of illegal armed group leaders and thousands of combatants. However, these efforts face several challenges, including countermeasures taken by coca farmers to combat U.S. and Colombian eradication efforts. Since fiscal year 2000, State, Justice, and USAID have provided nearly $1.3 billion for a wide range of social, economic, and justice sector programs. These programs have had a range of accomplishments, including aiding internally displaced persons and reforming Colombia's justice sector. But some efforts have been slow in achieving their objectives while others are difficult to assess. For example, the largest share of U.S. non-military assistance has gone towards alternative development, which has provided hundreds of thousands of Colombians legal economic alternatives to the illicit drug trade. But, alternative development is not provided in most areas where coca is cultivated and USAID does not assess how such programs relate to its strategic goals of reducing the production of illicit drugs or achieving sustainable results. In response to congressional direction in 2005 and budget cuts in fiscal year 2008, State and the other U.S. departments and agencies have accelerated their nationalization efforts, with State focusing on Colombian military and National Police aviation programs. One aviation program has been nationalized and two are in transition, with the largest--the Army Aviation Brigade--slated for turnover by 2012. Two National Police aviation programs have no turnover dates established. State, Defense, Justice, and USAID each have their own approaches to nationalization, with different timelines and objectives that have not been coordinated to promote potential efficiencies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States has been providing assistance to Colombia since the  early 1970s to help the Colombian military, the National Police and other  law enforcement agencies, and civilian agencies in their efforts to reduce  illicit drug production and trafficking activities. Despite this assistance, in  the late 1990s, Colombia was the world\u2019s leading producer of cocaine and  had become a major source of heroin used in the United States. In October  1999, the Colombian government announced a 6-year strategy, known as  Plan Colombia, to (1) reduce the cultivation, processing, and distribution  of illicit narcotics in Colombia by 50 percent over a 6-year period, and (2)  improve the security climate in Colombia by reclaiming control of areas  held by a number of illegal armed groups, which in the last decade had  financed their activities largely through drug trade profits.", "Plan Colombia\u2019s counternarcotics strategy centered on illicit crop  eradication and interdiction activities and alternative development  projects designed to offer farmers an alternative to growing coca and  opium poppy. Plan Colombia sought to reclaim control of territory  dominated by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (known by its  Spanish acronym, FARC) and other illegal armed groups through a variety  of means, including the growth and professionalism of the Colombian  military and National Police, systematic military engagement with  insurgent groups, and an expanded police presence throughout the  country. Plan Colombia also included a number of social, economic, and  judicial reform programs designed to broadly support its drug reduction  and security objectives. In January 2007, the Colombians issued a 6-year  (2007-2013) follow-on strategy, referred to as the Plan Colombia  Consolidation Phase (PCCP), which includes many of the same strategies  and programs initiated under Plan Colombia.", "Since fiscal year 2000, the United States has provided more than $6 billion  in military and nonmilitary assistance to Colombia.

In response, State  issued a report to Congress in March 2006 that noted the need for  continued and sustained support for military and nonmilitary assistance  programs in Colombia for the short- and mid-term, followed by reductions  as nationalization efforts take hold. State updated this strategy in two  reports to Congress dated April 2007 and April 2008. The April 2007  report included a proposed funding plan illustrating the administration\u2019s  intent to provide an additional $4 billion in assistance under PCCP. The  plan called for a gradual reduction in assistance to the Colombian military  and National Police, an initial increase in funding for nonmilitary  assistance programs, followed by relatively constant funding levels for  nonmilitary assistance through fiscal year 2013. According to State, in  fiscal year 2008, Congress accelerated these plans by reducing  appropriations for Colombian military and police programs (in particular,  aviation programs) by nearly $170 million, while increasing appropriations  for nonmilitary programs (in particular, alternative development projects)  by over $85 million with the expectation that this funding shift will lead to  major reductions in coca growth.", "At your request, we examined U.S. assistance efforts since fiscal year 2000  when funding for Plan Colombia was first approved.

These groups were assuming increasing control of the coca  and opium poppy growing areas of the country through wide scale  violence and human rights abuses, which affected to varying degrees each  of Colombia\u2019s 32 departments (see fig. 1). Colombia suffered a severe  economic downturn in the late 1990s as its armed forces and police were  unable to respond to the growing strength of these illegal armed groups,  and levels of murder, kidnapping, extortion, economic sabotage, and illicit  drug trafficking spiraled upward. According to State, in the 7 years prior  to Plan Colombia, coca cultivation had increased by over 300 percent and  opium poppy cultivation had increased by 75 percent.", "Despite U.S. and Colombian efforts to counter the drug-trafficking  activities of these illegal armed groups, State reports that Colombia  remains the source for about 90 percent of the cocaine entering the United  States, and the primary source of heroin east of the Mississippi River.

Currently, USAID has almost no alternative development projects in  eastern Colombia, where the majority of coca is grown. (See fig. 14.) While  the majority of the Colombian population lives within the USAID  economic corridors, the lack of programs in eastern Colombia nonetheless  poses a challenge for linking alternative development to reducing the  production of illicit drugs. The USAID Mission Director told us that the  mission intends to expand the geographic scope of alternative  development programs as the government of Colombia gains control over  conflictive areas. However, the lack of transportation infrastructure in  most coca growing areas limits the chances of program success and future  expansion. USAID and other U.S. Embassy Bogot\u00e1 officials emphasized  that alternative development programs have benefited from security gains  made possible through the Colombian military\u2019s enhanced air mobility, but  large areas of Colombia are still not secure.", "According to USAID officials, another challenge is the government of  Colombia\u2019s \u201cZero Illicit\u201d policy, which prohibits alternative development  assistance projects in communities where any illicit crops are being  cultivated.

However, USAID officials expressed  concern that the policy limits their ability to operate in areas where coca is  grown. The policy also complicates USAID\u2019s current strategy of working in  conflictive areas like Meta, where coca is cultivated in high  concentrations. One nongovernmental organization official told us the  policy is a major problem because if one farmer grows coca in a  community otherwise fully engaged in and committed to growing licit  crops, then all aid is supposed to be suspended to that community.  However, USAID officials told us programs have only been suspended a  few times due to this requirement.", "USAID collects data on 15 indicators that measure progress on alternative  development; however, none of these indicators measures progress  toward USAID\u2019s goal of reducing illicit narcotics production through the  creation of sustainable economic projects.
