GAO found in January 2013 ( GAO-13-95 ) that VA faced challenges verifying firms on a timely and consistent basis, communicating with veterans, enhancing information technology systems, and developing and implementing long-term strategic plans. GAO assessed (1) VA's progress in establishing a timely and consistent verification program and improving communication with veterans, and (2) the steps VA has taken to identify and address program challenges and longer-term goals. GAO reviewed VA's verification procedures and strategic plan, reviewed a generalizable random sample of 96 verification applications, and interviewed VA officials and representatives from two veterans' organizations selected from prior work and four verification assistance counselors selected to obtain geographic representation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since GAO's 2013 report, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) took significant steps to improve how it verifies and communicates with veteran-owned small businesses, consistent with several of GAO's previous recommendations. VA reported that due to process improvements, it reduced average application processing times by more than 50 percent\u2014from 85 days in 2012 to 41 in 2015. VA reported that it generally met its regulatory goals for application processing, and GAO's review of randomly selected application files generally corroborated this statement. VA refined the program's quality controls and implemented an internal audit process. Veterans' organizations and verification counselors with whom GAO spoke noted improvements in VA's communications and interactions with veterans, although three of the four verification counselors with whom GAO spoke suggested the program's website could be clearer and all four said the agency's letters to veterans could be clearer. In response, VA officials said they have been redesigning the website to make documents easier to locate. Officials also said the regulatory language in the letters was necessary and they encourage veterans to obtain free assistance with their applications from VA-certified counselors.", "VA has been undertaking multiple efforts to address continuing verification program challenges (such as an outdated case-management system) and long-term goals (making processes more veteran-friendly). However, the agency has not had a comprehensive operational plan for managing these efforts to completion. GAO previously recommended that VA's Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), which oversees the verification program, establish a strategic plan for the program and integrate efforts to replace an outdated case-management system with agency strategic planning. VA developed a strategic plan for 2014\u20132018 that included longer-term goals for the program, such as making the verification process more veteran-friendly. In August 2015, VA began piloting a restructured process that allows veterans to communicate directly with the individual processing their application. VA plans to fully transition to the new process by September 2016. VA recently hired a new director for the program, which has had four directors since 2011, including two acting directors in 2015. VA also has continued its efforts to replace the outdated case-management system for the program, but has faced delays due to contractor performance and funding issues. As a result, VA officials do not anticipate the replacement system will be in place until early 2017. While VA has developed a high-level operating plan for OSDBU, the plan does not integrate schedules or specify actions and milestone dates for achieving the multiple changes under way or discuss how to integrate the efforts. VA officials told GAO they were working on developing a detailed operating plan but were waiting to evaluate preliminary results of the verification pilot. GAO's work on organizational transformations states that organizations should set implementation goals and develop timelines to show progress. A detailed plan to guide multiple ongoing efforts is critical given repeated delays in VA's efforts to acquire a new case-management system and the lack of continuity in the program's leadership. Once such an operating plan is developed, it also will be important to update it on a timely basis. Otherwise, VA would continue to be at risk for delays in implementing its initiatives and achieving its long-term goals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA: (1) complete its fiscal year 2016 operating plan and include an integrated schedule addressing key actions for the verification program and milestone dates for achieving them, and (2) establish a process to review and update the operating plan to address changing conditions.

The act requires VA to give priority to SDVOSBs and VOSBs when  awarding contracts and provides for limited competition contract awards  to achieve contracting goals that VA must establish. Additionally, VA  must verify the ownership, control, and status of firms seeking such  preferences and maintain a database of verified SDVOSBs and VOSBs.  The program has grown from 2,900 verified firms in 2010 to more than  7,400 verified firms in 2015.", "Since VA launched its verification program in 2008, we and VA\u2019s Office of  Inspector General (OIG) have reported on weaknesses, such as limited  progress in defining an organizational structure to manage the program,  establishing and monitoring verification operations, and instituting  effective controls to prevent and detect fraud by ineligible firms. At the  same time, some veteran small business owners and their advocates  have complained of a slow and burdensome verification process and  questioned VA\u2019s rationale for some application denials. We made several  recommendations to VA aimed at developing and implementing a plan to  help ensure a more thorough and effective verification program (in 2010)  and refining and implementing a strategic plan that combined outcome- oriented, longer-term goals with performance measures (in 2013). In  September 2014, VA announced a major organizational transformation to  respond to criticism that the agency was not succeeding in providing high- quality service to veterans. To improve service and rebuild confidence in  VA, the agency launched the MyVA initiative to provide a unified veteran  experience across the organization.", "You asked that we update our January 2013 report on VA\u2019s verification  program.

We  collected information on processing time, review completeness, and  documentation of key decisions and rationales. We analyzed the results  to make generalizable estimates about applications submitted from June  through September 2014 and to determine if VA consistently followed its  policies and procedures for processing applications. We assessed the  reliability of the data by interviewing VA officials, reviewing  documentation, and checking for illogical values or obvious errors and  found the data sufficiently reliable for estimating population values. We  reviewed administrative program data obtained from VA on application  processing times for fiscal years 2012 through 2015 and compared those  numbers to our findings from the case file review. We also reviewed  administrative data from VA on the number and type of site visits  conducted in fiscal years 2014 and 2015. We assessed the reliability of  CVE\u2019s administrative data by interviewing VA officials and reviewing  documentation and found the data to be sufficiently reliable for describing  reported processing statistics. We also reviewed a program quality  manual and internal audit reports from December 2014 to March 2015.  We reviewed more than 100 allegations of noncompliance with program  regulations sent to VA between June 2014 and May 2015 by a veteran- owned small business advocate. We selected 10 for a more in-depth  review and reviewed VA\u2019s files on verified businesses associated with the  allegations to identify the steps VA took to investigate the allegations.

OSDBU\u2019s Center for Verification and  Evaluation (CVE) maintains the mandated database of verified SDVOSBs  and VOSBs and is responsible for verification operations, such as  application processing. CVE is led by a director and deputy director, and  staff are organized into seven teams that either assist with a verification  phase or supporting function. A federal employee leads each team and  CVE contracts with several SDVOSBs to provide contractors that conduct  verifications and supporting activities. As of January 2016, CVE had 16  federal employees and 156 contract staff (employed by five different  SDVOSB contractors) verifying applications or filling supporting roles.  CVE and its information technology are funded by VA\u2019s Supply Fund, a  fund that recovers its operating expenses through fees and markups on  different products or services. CVE\u2019s final obligations for fiscal year  2014 were $17.9 million and its approved budget for fiscal year 2015 was  $16.1 million, representing a decrease of about 10 percent ($1.8 million).", "VA developed eligibility requirements and a process to verify the  ownership and control of firms seeking contracting preferences as  SDVOSBs and VOSBs and to confirm the status of any owner who  indicates a service-connected disability. To be eligible for verification  under VA\u2019s rules  the small business concern (hereafter, firm) must be unconditionally  owned and controlled by one or more eligible parties (veterans,  service-disabled veterans, or surviving spouses); the owners of the firm must have good character (any small business  owner or concern that has been debarred or suspended is  ineligible);  the applicant cannot knowingly make false statements in the  application process;  the firm and its eligible owners must not have significant financial  obligations owed to the federal government; and  the firm must not have been found ineligible due to a Small Business  Administration protest decision.", "VA\u2019s verification process consists of reviewing and analyzing a  standardized set of documents submitted with each verification  application. VA\u2019s current verification process has four phases\u2014initiation,  examination, evaluation, and determination (see fig. 1). Denied applicant  firms can request a reconsideration of the denial decision, but if the denial  is upheld, must wait 6 months before submitting another application.", "VA maintains a database on its Vendor Information Pages (VIP) website  of verified SDVOSBs and VOSBs. Once VA verifies a firm, the firm  name appears with a verified logo in VIP. Verification is valid for 2 years,  with the option of renewing for 2 additional years. To apply for renewal,  verified firms must submit an application before expiration of their  verification, answer questions about any key changes to their business  structure, submit supporting business documents such as updated tax  returns and any amended operating documents, and receive a full  evaluation by CVE. Firms that receive a renewal have to undergo a full  verification (reverification) after the 2-year renewal period expires (that is,  firms must go through the full process every 4 years).", "In 2014, VA launched the MyVA Reorganization Plan in an effort to  improve the efficiency and effectiveness of VA\u2019s services to veterans.

MyVA extends to all aspects of the agency\u2019s  operations, including the verification program. In response to this  organizational change, OSDBU is required to align its own strategy with  MyVA and take steps to make its operations more customer service- oriented and veteran-centric.

VA officials attributed the decreased processing time to a number  of process improvements, such as moving from paper to electronic  applications, developing detailed written work instructions for staff and  contractors conducting verification activities, and enhancing resources  available to applicants to make them more aware of program  requirements. Officials told us that they have been generally meeting their  regulatory processing goal of 60 days (from receipt of a complete  application) and had 5 applications (out of 3,129) in fiscal year 2014 and  11 applications (out of 4,651) in fiscal year 2015 that did not meet this  goal.", "Our review of randomly selected application files corroborated that CVE  generally met its processing goals, but the verification process can take  longer from a veteran\u2019s perspective. In calculating processing times, CVE  excluded any time spent waiting for additional information it asked firms to  supply, so the number of days it took an applicant to become verified  typically was longer than CVE reported. To illustrate how long the process  could take from the veteran\u2019s perspective, we used the results of our case  file review to estimate the average number of days it took veterans to  receive an initial determination\u2014including any time a firm took to prepare  and submit additional requested documentation (time that VA excluded  from its estimated processing times). Based on our analysis, it took  firms that applied for verification from June through September 2014 an  average of 68 days to receive an initial determination on verification  eligibility.", "Additionally, firms can submit and withdraw their application multiple  times if they need to correct issues or wish to apply at a later date, an  option that can lengthen the verification process for some firms. Each  time a firm resubmits an application, CVE resets the processing clock.  Based on our case file review, we estimated that for 15 percent of  applications submitted from June 2014 through September 2014, it took  more than 4 months from the initial application date for firms to receive a  determination from CVE. In 5 of the 96 applications we reviewed, the  verification process took more than 6 months to complete. For 2 of the 5  applications, the process took 1 year or more to complete. In each of the  5 cases, the firm had submitted and withdrawn an application at least one  time before submitting an application that received a final determination.  VA officials said that weeks or months could pass between a firm\u2019s  withdrawal of its application and resubmission of a new application.  Additionally, VA officials said that allowing applicants to withdraw and  resubmit multiple applications was advantageous to the veteran (without  the option, more veterans would receive denials and have to wait 6  months before submitting another application)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Improved Quality Controls, and Implemented New Procedures to Document and Investigate Allegations of Noncompliance", "paragraphs": ["CVE has continued to refine its quality management system since our  May 2010 and January 2013 reports, including developing  comprehensive work instructions, conducting site visits, and revising  policies for investigating allegations of noncompliance.

For example, at that time, VA  was introducing significant changes to its procedures and operations, and  we determined that our original focus on evaluating VA\u2019s compliance with  policies and procedures would be of limited value.", "Since our 2013 report CVE has put into place detailed written work  instructions\u2014which are used by CVE staff and contractors conducting  verification activities\u2014for each part of the verification process, and a  quality manual that documents the requirements of its quality  management system. According to CVE officials, the work instructions  are updated on a regular basis. CVE officials said the agency received  certification in 2015 that its revised quality management system was  compliant with the International Organization for Standardization  9001:2008 quality management standards. CVE also has implemented  an internal audit process and a continuous improvement process. As of  September 2015, CVE had taken action on and closed 332 of 350 (95  percent) internal audit recommendations made since February 2013.", "Based on our case file review, we estimate that VA followed its policies  and procedures for verifying SDVOSBs and VOSBs in 100 percent of  applications that were approved or denied from June through September  2014. This included checking the veteran and disability status of the  applicant, conducting research on the firm from publicly available  information, and reviewing business documents to determine compliance  with eligibility requirements (such as direct majority ownership by the  veteran and experience of the veteran manager).", "In our May 2010 report, we found that VA had a large backlog of firms  awaiting site visits, including some high-risk firms. As a result, we  recommended that VA develop and implement a plan to, among other  things, conduct timely site visits to high-risk firms. VA reported in  October 2013 that it had conducted more than 1,000 site visits in fiscal  year 2013 and there was no longer a backlog of firms awaiting site visits,  which was consistent with our recommendation. In fiscal years 2014  and 2015, CVE conducted 1,750 site visits to gather additional  information about firms during its application review, or check the  accuracy of verification teams\u2019 decisions and help ensure that verified  firms continue to comply with program regulations. Specifically, CVE  conducted 1,144 site visits in fiscal year 2014 and 606 site visits in fiscal  year 2015 on verified firms and firms applying for verification. Of the fiscal  year 2015 site visits, CVE used risk-based determinations to select the  vast majority of firms for visits (93.7 percent or 568 firms). The remainder  were randomly selected or chosen because they were in the application  process. CVE officials said that firms identified through risk-based  selection were chosen based on their risk to VA (for instance, if the firm  had a VA contract). Officials reported low error and noncompliance  rates as identified through site visits, described specifically below.", "CVE officials said the site visits identified two instances in fiscal year  2015 and nine instances in fiscal year 2014 in which CVE evaluators  mistakenly verified a firm (a less than 1 percent error rate).", "CVE issued 25 cancellations to firms found out of compliance with  program regulations (a 4 percent noncompliance rate) in fiscal year  2015 and 57 cancellations in fiscal year 2014 (a 5 percent  noncompliance rate), an outcome that can result from changing  characteristics of the firm after verification.", "These statistics, particularly the identification of a small number of  instances in which CVE evaluators mistakenly verified a firm in the past 2  fiscal years, are consistent with the findings from our case file review that  VA has been following its policies and procedures for verifying firms.", "CVE officials said they have been working with VA\u2019s Office of Enterprise  Risk Management to determine how many site visits should be conducted  annually and how firms should be selected. VA spent about $3 million in  fiscal year 2014 to conduct 1,144 site visits (about 16 percent of all  verified firms). Officials stated that because of the cost of conducting the  site visits (about $2,600 per visit)\u2014and the low rate of noncompliance  identified by site visit examiners (about 4.7 percent in fiscal year 2014)\u2014 the agency has been looking to reduce the number of site visits while  maintaining the effectiveness of the site visit program. CVE also randomly  selected a sample of 104 of 2,312 firms that received VA contracts from  March 2014 through April 2015 for site visits, in order to obtain a  statistical estimate of the noncompliance rate for the program. CVE  officials said they have compiled data from visits performed in fiscal years  2014 through 2016, which they will use to identify risk factors that could  affect compliance (such as a firm\u2019s business type, industry type, and size  of VA contract). VA officials said they plan to use these data to monitor  emerging risk factors and adjust their selection of firms to receive site  visits accordingly.", "CVE also monitors program compliance through investigations of  suspicious firms identified through tips from external sources. CVE  officials told us they received about 400 tips in 2014 about noncompliance  with program regulations. CVE is responsible for investigating  noncompliance with program requirements, and the VA OIG is  responsible for investigating fraud. Officials said that they investigate  credible allegations they receive by conducting public research to  substantiate or disprove the tip, reviewing eligibility requirements related  to the tip, and making a recommendation for corrective action, if  necessary. We reviewed case files associated with 10 firms for which  CVE received such allegations (between June 2014 and May 2015).  These allegations were made by a veteran-owned small business  advocate. We found that CVE investigated 6 of the 10 allegations. For the  4 cases that it did not review, CVE officials said the allegations were not  specific enough to conduct an investigation. Additionally, officials said the  allegations were not sent to the e-mail address that VA had established  for this purpose, and thus, may not have been routed to the correct  individuals within VA charged with investigating allegations. According  to a policy memorandum issued in October 2015, CVE previously only  accepted referrals on its non-compliance referral form. However, the  policy memorandum changed CVE\u2019s policy regarding reviews of non- compliance referrals, and CVE began reviewing and responding to all  allegations of noncompliance, whether received on the referral form or  not. Additionally, CVE will notify the sender if the agency has enough  information to investigate the allegation and request additional  information, if necessary.", "Based on our review of the files for these 10 allegations, we found that  CVE had not always documented that a noncompliance allegation had  been received or that it was conducting a review of the firm\u2019s eligibility  based on the allegation. CVE officials said they adopted a policy in July  2015 to upload all findings from investigations that result from  noncompliance allegations to the case-management system so that CVE  staff and contractors working on a firm\u2019s verification have access to that  information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Has Taken Steps to Improve Communication with Veterans, Although Some External Groups Suggested Improvements", "paragraphs": ["VA has taken steps to improve communication with veterans since our  January 2013 report, in which we discussed concerns of some veterans\u2019  organizations about the verification program. VA implemented additional  procedures to improve communication with verified firms about their  verification status. Specifically, according to agency officials, VA sends  e-mail reminders 120, 90, and 30 days before the expiration of a firm\u2019s  verification status; contacts verified firms by telephone 90 days before  expiration of verification status; and notifies firms in writing 30 days before  cancelling a firm\u2019s verification. Additionally, VA communicates with  applicants at several points in the verification process, such as to indicate  that an application is complete, additional documents are needed, and a  determination has been made. VA also e-mails applicants about issues  that would result in a denial to offer them the ability to make changes to  the application or to withdraw it prior to receiving the denial. Our case file  review found VA generally followed its procedures to send reminder  notices to applicants who needed to submit additional documentation,  and to send notices that an application was complete.", "In our January 2013 report, we noted that VA had recognized that some  applicants needed additional support and launched a Verification  Counseling program in June 2012 to assist firms interested in becoming  verified. Since that time, VA has continued to work with PTACs across the  United States to provide verification assistance to veterans free of  charge. VA officials said they have trained more than 300 procurement  experts on the verification process so they can assist veterans applying  for verification. In addition, we determined that VA provides other  resources such as fact sheets, verification assistance briefs, and standard  operating procedures for the verification program on its website. VA also  provides a tool on its website that allows firms to obtain a list of  documents required for an application depending on the type of company  they own (such as a limited liability corporation or sole proprietorship).  Moreover, CVE officials said that they have increased interaction with  veterans seeking verification through web-based activities and outreach  at conferences and other events. For instance, since our 2013 report,  CVE began conducting monthly pre-application, reverification, and town  hall webinars to provide information and assistance to verified firms and  others interested in the verification process. VA officials also told us that  they attend veteran small business conferences and other meetings in  which they can conduct outreach for the verification program.", "CVE has taken steps to collect veteran feedback about the program. The  agency held two focus groups in July 2015 and began surveying firms in  August 2015. Several veterans who participated in the focus groups  commented on the lack of clarity of VA\u2019s communications. For example,  one veteran said that there was a lack of clarity about the documents that  should be submitted with an application. Two veterans noted issues with  the timing and redundancy of document requests during the application  process. And two veterans said there was lack of clarity around certain  program rules. Although survey results cannot be generalized to all  veterans going through the verification process, the contractor  administering the surveys reported in September 2015 that feedback from  firms that had been through the verification process appeared positive,  particularly with respect to improvements in the verification process.  CVE officials stated they hope the surveys will allow them to more  systematically collect feedback from veterans on different aspects of the  program, including the pre-application experience, the verification process  from submission to determination, and site visit examinations.", "All the counselors and representatives of veterans\u2019 service organizations  with whom we spoke noted that VA has improved its verification process,  but most had suggestions for continued improvement. One PTAC  representative noted that VA could better leverage organizations such as  PTACs, veteran small business outreach centers, and state-level  Departments of Veterans Affairs to disseminate information. Another  PTAC representative noted that PTACs and other veterans\u2019 groups could  host events for CVE to interact with veterans to increase awareness of  the verification program and the services PTACs provide. Additionally,  this PTAC representative said CVE could do a better job referring  veterans to PTACs that could assist them with the verification process.  He added that having PTACs assist veterans before they started the  application process would reduce applicant error and frustration and  processing times. VA officials stated that they make PTAC referrals  through the help desk and monthly preverification webinars and  participate in outreach events when possible. Officials also noted that  travel dollars to attend and conduct outreach at external events are  limited and they try to use the monthly webinars to interact with and  inform veterans.", "In addition, VA has taken steps to address external stakeholders\u2019  concerns about the information available on VA\u2019s website and clarity of  communications to applicants. Three of the four counselors noted that  resources on VA\u2019s website for the verification program can be difficult to  locate. Representatives from one of two service organizations said VA  does not provide adequate documentation of program standards for  applicants. Officials said that they have been working with OSDBU to  redesign the website to make documents, such as verification assistance  briefs and the tool to identify required documents, easier to locate.  Additionally, the counselors we interviewed noted that VA\u2019s  communications to applicants were at times unclear. VA\u2019s procedures  require that determination letters to applicants include specific reasons for  denial or potential denial. All four of the counselors we interviewed also  stated that VA\u2019s determination letters to applicants could be clearer and  that they include regulatory compliance language that could be difficult for  some applicants to understand.", "We used an automated readability test on five determination letters from  our case file review (written from August through December 2014).  According to the test, the reading level required to understand the letters  ranged from a college sophomore to a college senior level, so readability  might present a challenge for some applicants. VA officials maintained  that the inclusion of regulatory language in the determination letters was  necessary, but acknowledged the language could present readability  challenges. Moreover, the officials noted that they encourage veterans to  obtain free assistance with their applications from VA certified verification  counselors. We also observed several instances in our review in which a  letter initially stated that documents were due on one date, and then later  stated the applicant should disregard the initial statement and that  documents were due on a different, earlier date. VA officials said this was  due to a glitch in the system that generated the letters and a software  update issued in May 2015 resolved the issue. Officials also said  document requests are now generated using a new template, instead of  the older template that previously caused issues.

According to OSDBU officials, the new process is expected to provide  cost savings to the agency by reducing the amount of time spent  reviewing applications and addressing veterans\u2019 questions. For  example, VA officials told us that under the current four-phase process,  eligibility issues are not identified and communicated to the veteran until  the later stages of the process, which could be 35\u201340 days after  application submission. Under the new process, veterans would be  interviewed shortly after submitting their application, which would allow  VA to identify issues up front and avoid multiple reviews of applications  for firms not meeting program requirements. CVE officials also stated that  changes to the process are intended to help improve communication with  applicants. For example, under the current process, applicants may  correspond with several different customer service representatives, each  of whom would have to read through case notes before addressing the  veteran\u2019s question. Under the new process, a case manager, who serves  as the point of contact for the veteran and coordinates staff evaluating the  application, would be familiar with the application status and any issues  that arose throughout the process. Additionally, by interviewing the  applicant at the beginning of the application process, CVE may be able to  reduce some of the problems caused by applicants not understanding the  written communications sent by CVE. Key differences between the pilot  and current processes as described by CVE officials are shown in table 1.  CVE officials stated that as of November 2015, 369 applications had been  reviewed using the new process and that CVE had processed about 15  percent to 20 percent of applications under the new process. CVE  officials said they plan to process about half of all applications using the  new process by April 2016.", "CVE officials stated that they plan to fully transition to a new process by  September 2016. The new process will be based on the approach used  during the pilot with some adjustments, as determined by CVE\u2019s  evaluation of the pilot procedures. The officials stated that they developed  a number of metrics to inform adjustments to the pilot, which include  length of application processing times, number of approvals, denials, and  withdrawals, and number of applications processed by case-management  teams each month. Additionally, to help evaluate the verification  procedures used during the pilot, CVE officials stated that VA held one  focus group in October 2015 and since September 2015 has been  surveying firms that participated in the new process to obtain feedback.  CVE has made adjustments to the process in response to metrics and  feedback. For example, CVE decided to have case analysts process the  majority of applications, which allowed assessors more time to process  complex applications and provide guidance to the case analysts and  other assessors, when needed. CVE\u2019s Acting Director and Deputy  Director were responsible for evaluating data obtained from these metrics  according to CVE officials. In addition, CVE officials stated that  information obtained from the metrics was intended to provide them with  a better sense of how many teams will be needed to conduct verification  and what types of skills verification staff and contractors needed for the  work. CVE officials stated that VA has used current staffing resources for  the pilot and transitioned more staff from the current verification process  to the pilot, as the pilot expanded. Officials said that VA has developed a  range of preliminary cost estimates based on different staffing levels used  during the pilot. The agency plans to develop a cost estimate for average  and total processing costs after they have transitioned staff to the new  process. As of March 2016, CVE officials stated they completed their  evaluation of the pilot and have selected a process they determined was  cost effective and efficient and did not compromise quality."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reverification Policy", "paragraphs": ["VA also recently revised its reverification process to improve efficiency  and customer service.

VA  obtained input and recommendations from veteran stakeholder groups to  inform the new regulations.", "According to officials, the proposed revisions are intended to simplify the  criteria used to determine veteran ownership and control, and account for  common business practices that might otherwise lead to a denial decision  under the current regulation. For example, in addressing the challenges  associated with one current regulatory provision, CVE officials said that  the proposed rule simplifies the ownership criteria by modifying the term  \u201cunconditional\u201d to allow businesses to include rights of first refusal and  \u201ctag-along\u201d rights in their operating documents and still participate in the  program. Similarly, officials said that VA plans to allow minority owners  to vote on extraordinary business decisions such as closing or selling the  business. Officials stated that the revisions to the regulation were not  expected to provide cost and resource efficiencies, or affect the new  verification process being developed through the pilot.", "Comments on the proposed rule were due January 5, 2016, and officials  expect to finalize the proposed rule in mid-2016. Officials said they  received about 100 comments and that they still were evaluating and  categorizing the comments as of January 21, 2016.

Furthermore, one of two leadership positions directly  below the Executive Director had been vacant since October 2008, and  the other positions had been filled by an Acting Director. In 2010, we  recommended that VA develop and implement a plan that ensures a  more thorough and effective verification program and addresses actions  and milestone dates for filling vacant positions within OSDBU, including  the leadership positions. By July 2011, VA had filled the vacant  leadership positions but has since experienced turnover in the leadership  positions for the verification program. Specifically, CVE has had four  different directors since 2011, including two acting directors in 2015. In  addition, the position of Deputy Director was vacant from March 2014 to  September 2015. VA posted a job announcement for the CVE director  position in October 2015 that closed in November 2015.

VA  hired a permanent director in February 2016.", "In addition to taking steps to acquire permanent leadership for the  program, VA has made changes to CVE\u2019s organizational structure to align  staffing resources with agency needs and reflect the new pilot verification  process. CVE officials said that under the new organizational structure, a  federal employee heads each of three teams\u2014critical path, risk and  compliance, and verification support\u2014and oversees the contractors who  conduct the majority of the work for the program. The critical path team is  responsible for verifying applications. All federal staff responsible for  overseeing the verification process and the contractors reviewing  applications have been moved to this team, according to CVE officials.  The risk and compliance team oversees CVE\u2019s site visit program,  investigates allegations of noncompliance, and makes referrals to VA\u2019s  Debarment and Suspension Committee and OIG. The verification support  team staffs the help desk and provides support processing  communications to applicants. CVE officials also said that the quality  assurance team has been moved from within CVE to the larger OSDBU  organization and will continue to support CVE internal audits as well as  provide support to OSDBU. OSDBU officials indicated that VA made this  change to share more responsibilities between CVE and OSDBU and  reduce program operating costs.", "According to CVE officials, VA has developed position descriptions for the  pilot verification process and used data from the pilot to determine optimal  staffing levels needed to process applications under the new procedures.  As discussed earlier, CVE relies heavily on contractor support to conduct  its verification activities and currently has 16 federal employees and 156  contractors working on the verification program. CVE officials stated that  VA plans to continue using contractor staff to conduct verification  activities because the use of such staff gives VA the flexibility to adjust  staffing levels as needed to respond to changes in the number of  verification applications received. According to VA officials, and generally  consistent with findings from our case file review, federal employees  make the final determination for verification decisions. Officials said that  based on information obtained through the pilot, VA has determined that it  needs a total of 10 federal reviewers on the critical path team; however, it  still was determining its needs for contractor staff as of November 2015.

For example, the operational  plan states that VA needs to have in place an information technology  system that allows both case-management and client-relationship  management. However, it does not describe the specific actions that VA  must take to acquire such a system or how system development will be  integrated with other ongoing efforts, such as adoption of a new  verification process. Instead, the operating plan states that a main  element to achieving the goal is to develop a case-management system.  In another example, the operating plan states that VA must have a  verification process that provides a positive veteran experience and that a  main element to achieving that goal is to transition to the new process.  But the plan does not explain the specific actions necessary to fully  transition to the new process or the timetable for the transition. In  addition, VA does not have a process in place to update the verification  program operating plan on a timely basis to ensure that it reflects current  initiatives, conditions, and long-term goals.

We selected a stratified  probability sample of all verification applications (initial and renewal  applications) submitted to VA between June and September 2014. We  chose this time period so we could obtain a sample of applications for  which CVE had completed its application review and so that the  applications in our sample would have been processed under a recent  and similar set of verification procedures. The applications were stratified  by two groups of decision outcomes: (1) withdrawals and (2) approvals  and denials. The sample was designed to make generalizeable estimates  for approvals and denials only, with the sample of withdrawals providing  nongeneralizeable examples. We used simple random sampling methods  to select 96 of the 1,306 applications submitted to VA during this time  frame that resulted in an approval or denial. We developed and pre-tested  an instrument to collect data from the case files on application processing  time frames, completeness of VA\u2019s review, and documentation of key  decisions and rationales. We assessed the reliability of these data by  interviewing VA officials knowledgeable about the data, reviewing  documentation related to the data systems, and checking the data for  illogical values or obvious errors and found them to be sufficiently reliable  for estimating population values. The sample allowed us to estimate the  proportion of cases for which VA consistently followed its policies and  procedures and met regulatory time frames for reviewing applications for  the verification program for applications submitted from June through  September 2014. Because we used simple random sampling methods to  select approvals and denials, our estimated proportions did not require  weighting. We used hypergeometric methods to estimate 95 percent  confidence intervals, which account for the small size of the sample and  population, estimated proportions near 0 or 100, and a nonignorable  sampling fraction.", "We reviewed administrative program data obtained from VA on  application processing times for fiscal years 2012 through 2015 and  compared those numbers to our findings from the case file review.
