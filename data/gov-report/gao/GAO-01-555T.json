To provide a focal point, the President appointed a National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection and Counterterrorism at the National Security Council. This position, however, has significant duties indirectly related to terrorism, including infrastructure protection and continuity of government operations. Notwithstanding the creation of this National Coordinator, it was the Attorney General who led interagency efforts to develop a national strategy.", "H.R. 525 would set up a single, high-level focal point in the President\u2019s Council on Domestic Terrorism Preparedness. In addition, H.R. 525 would require that the new council\u2019s executive chairman\u2014who would represent the President as chairman\u2014be appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate.

Based upon our recommendation, the executive branch has made progress in implementing our recommendations that threat and risk assessments be done to improve federal efforts to combat terrorism. However, we remain concerned that such assessments are not being coordinated across the federal government.", "H.R. 525 would require a threat, risk, and capability assessment that examines critical infrastructure vulnerabilities, evaluates federal and applicable state laws used to combat terrorist attacks, and evaluates available technology and practices for protecting critical infrastructure against terrorist attacks.

The Attorney General\u2019s Five-Year Plan represents a substantial interagency effort to develop a federal strategy, but it lacks desired outcomes. The Department of Justice believes that their current plan has measurable outcomes about specific agency actions. However, in our view, the plan needs to go beyond this to define an end state. As we have previously testified, the national strategy should incorporate the chief tenets of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (P.L. 130-62). The Results Act holds federal agencies accountable for achieving program results and requires federal agencies to clarify their missions, set program goals, and measure performance toward achieving these goals.", "H.R. 525 would require the new council to publish a domestic terrorism preparedness plan with objectives and priorities, an implementation plan, a description of roles of federal, state and local activities, and a defined end state with measurable standards for preparedness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Council Would Analyze and Review Budgets", "paragraphs": ["In our December 1997 report, we reported that there was no mechanism to centrally manage funding requirements and to ensure an efficient, focused governmentwide approach to combat terrorism.

These reports represent a significant step toward improved management by providing strategic oversight of the magnitude and direction of spending for these programs. Yet we have not seen evidence that these reports have established priorities or identified duplication of effort as the Congress intended.", "H.R. 525 would require the new council to develop and make budget recommendations for federal agencies and the Office of Management and Budget.

In addition, the annual updates to the Attorney General\u2019s Five-Year Plan track individual agencies\u2019 accomplishments.

Congress has been concerned with the management of these programs and, in addition to H.R. 525, two other bills have been introduced to change the overall leadership and management of programs to combat terrorism. On March 21, 2001, Representative Thornberry introduced H.R. 1158, the National Homeland Security Act, which advocates the creation of a cabinet-level head within the proposed National Homeland Security Agency to lead homeland security activities. On March 29, 2001 Representative Skelton introduced H.R. 1292, the Homeland Security Strategy Act of 2001, which calls for the development of a homeland security strategy developed by a single official designated by the President.", "In addition, several other proposals from congressional committee reports and various commission reports advocate changes in the structure and management of federal efforts to combat terrorism. These include Senate Report 106-404 to Accompany H.R. 4690 on the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriation Bill 2001, submitted by Senator Gregg on September 8, 2000; the report by the Gilmore Panel (the Advisory Panel to Assess Domestic Response Capabilities for Terrorism Involving Weapons of Mass Destruction, chaired by Governor James S. Gilmore III) dated December 15, 2000; the report of the Hart-Rudman Commission (the U.S. Commission on National Security/21st Century, chaired by Senators Gary Hart and Warren B.

H.R. 525 focuses on federal programs to prepare state and local governments for dealing with domestic terrorist attacks. Other bills and proposals include the larger issue of homeland security that includes threats other than terrorism, such as military attacks.", "H.R. 525 would attempt to resolve cross-agency leadership problems by creating a single focal point within the Executive Office of the President. The other related bills and proposals would also create a single focal point for programs to combat terrorism, and some would have the focal point perform many of the same functions. For example, some of the proposals would have the focal point lead efforts to develop a national strategy. The proposals (with one exception) would have the focal point appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate. However, the various bills and proposals differ in where they would locate the focal point for overall leadership and management. The two proposed locations for the focal point are in the Executive Office of the President (like H.R. 525) or in a Lead Executive Agency.", "Table 1 shows various proposals regarding the focal point for overall leadership, the scope of its activities, and it\u2019s location.", "Location of focal point Executive Office of the President Lead Executive Agency (National Homeland Security Agency)", "Lead Executive Agency (Department of Justice)", "Lead Executive Agency (National Homeland Security Agency)", "Homeland security (including domestic terrorism, maritime and border security, disaster relief and critical infrastructure activities) Homeland security (including antiterrorism and protection of territory and critical infrastructures from unconventional and conventional threats by military or other means) Domestic terrorism preparedness (crisis and consequence management) Domestic and international terrorism (crisis and consequence management) Homeland security (including domestic terrorism, maritime and border security, disaster relief, and critical infrastructure activities) Homeland Defense (including domestic terrorism and critical infrastructure protection)", "Based upon our analysis of legislative proposals, various commission reports, and our ongoing discussions with agency officials, each of the two locations for the focal point\u2014the Executive Office of the President or a Lead Executive Agency\u2014has its potential advantages and disadvantages. An important advantage of placing the position with the Executive Office of the President is that the focal point would be positioned to rise above the particular interests of any one federal agency. Another advantage is that the focal point would be located close to the President to resolve cross agency disagreements. A disadvantage of such a focal point would be the potential to interfere with operations conducted by the respective executive agencies. Another potential disadvantage is that the focal point might hinder direct communications between the President and the cabinet officers in charge of the respective executive agencies.", "Alternately, a focal point with a Lead Executive Agency could have the advantage of providing a clear and streamlined chain of command within an agency in matters of policy and operations. Under this arrangement, we believe that the Lead Executive Agency would have to be one with a dominant role in both policy and operations related to combating terrorism. Specific proposals have suggested that this agency could be either the Department of Justice (per Senate Report 106-404) or an enhanced Federal Emergency Management Agency (per H.R. 1158 and its proposed National Homeland Security Agency). Another potential advantage is that the cabinet officer of the Lead Executive Agency might have better access to the President than a mid-level focal point with the Executive Office of the President. A disadvantage of the Lead Executive Agency approach is that the focal point\u2014which would report to the cabinet head of the Lead Executive Agency\u2014would lack autonomy. Further, a Lead Executive Agency would have other major missions and duties that might distract the focal point from combating terrorism. Also, other agencies may view the focal point\u2019s decisions and actions as parochial rather than in the collective best interest."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Passage of H.R. 525 May Warrant Changes in Existing Organizations", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 525 would provide the new President\u2019s Council on Domestic Terrorism Preparedness with a variety of duties. In conducting these duties, the new council would, to the extent practicable, rely on existing documents, interagency bodies, and existing governmental entities. Nevertheless, the passage of H.R. 525 would warrant a review of several existing organizations to compare their duties with the new council\u2019s responsibilities. In some cases, those existing organizations may no longer be required or would have to conduct their activities under the supervision of the new council. For example, the National Domestic Preparedness Office was created to be a focal point for state and local governments and has a state and local advisory group. The new council has similar duties that may eliminate the need for the National Domestic Preparedness Office. As another example, we believe the overall coordinating role of the new council may require adjustments to the coordinating roles played by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of State and Local Domestic Preparedness Support, and the National Security Council\u2019s Weapons of Mass Destruction Preparedness Group in the policy coordinating committee on Counterterrorism and National Preparedness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["In our ongoing work, we have found that there is no consensus\u2014either in Congress, the Executive Branch, the various commissions, or the organizations representing first responders\u2014as to whether the focal point should be in the Executive Office of the President or a Lead Executive Agency.
