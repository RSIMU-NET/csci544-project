Under current rules, banks must hold capital equal to at least 8 percent of risk-weighted assets. Since the early 1990s, U.S. federal banking regulators have used a risk-weighting system under which banks multiply asset amounts by factors, known as risk weights, to calculate risk-weighted assets. Different types of assets have different risk weights that attempt to capture the assets' relative risk. The Basel III-based final rule adopted in 2013 by the U.S. federal banking regulators incorporates higher risk weights for certain mortgage-related assets while leaving others unchanged from prior capital regimes (Basel I and Basel II). Most banks use the standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets, but large internationally active banks use an advanced approach that relies on formulas established by the regulators and inputs from their internal systems.", "Under the standardized approach, the risk weights for single-family residential mortgages are largely unchanged by the final rule. Similarly, the risk weights under this approach for residential mortgage-backed securities (MBS) guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac have not changed since Basel I.", "Under the advanced approach, large internationally active banks use a formula defined in regulation to determine the capital requirements for residential mortgage exposures, which include whole loans as well as MBS guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. This formula has not changed since it went into effect in 2008 under the Basel II-based rule.", "For both approaches, the ways for determining risk weights for securitization exposures and mortgage servicing assets have changed under the final rule, which may increase these risk weights. As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the final rule eliminates the use of credit ratings for determining risk weights for securitization exposures, instead relying on regulator-established formulas. Also, the final rule reduces the cap on mortgage servicing assets that can be included in capital calculations and will raise the risk weight from 100 percent to 250 percent.", "The Basel III-based final rule largely left in place the historically lower risk weights of MBS guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac vis-\u00e0-vis other mortgage-related assets, which can influence the demand for these securities relative to whole loans and privately issued MBS. However, the full impact of changes in risk weights for holdings of mortgage-related assets remains uncertain because insufficient time has passed since these changes took effect, and for some assets the changes have not yet been fully phased in. GAO's recent work suggested that many lenders generally appeared to be participating in residential mortgage lending much as they had before capital requirements changed. Also, data on mortgage debt outstanding and on banks' holdings of different assets indicate that trends in holdings of mortgage debt and mortgage-related assets that predate the changes in risk weights have continued. But increased risk weights for some mortgage-related assets may lead to changes in banks' decisions about securitizing and servicing mortgages."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["During the 2007\u20132009 financial crisis, many banking organizations lacked  capital of sufficient quality and quantity to absorb substantial losses,  specifically on mortgages and mortgage-related assets, revealing these  assets to be riskier than previously thought.

Among other things,  capital acts as a financial cushion to absorb unexpected losses, promotes  public confidence in the solvency of the institution and the stability of the  banking sector, and provides protection to depositors and deposit  insurance funds. Because of capital\u2019s role in absorbing losses, promoting  confidence, and protecting depositors, federal banking regulations require  banking organizations to maintain adequate capital, and regulators set  minimum capital levels to help ensure that institutions do so, including a  target total minimum risk-based capital ratio\u2014that is, the ratio of capital to  risk-weighted assets. Federal law authorizes banking regulators to take a  variety of actions to ensure capital adequacy, including informal and  formal enforcement actions. Federal banking regulators generally expect  institutions to hold capital at levels higher than regulatory minimums.", "Capital rules in the United States generally follow a framework of  measures adopted by the Basel Committee. U.S. federal banking  regulators have adopted various risk-based capital regimes over the past  decades. Under these frameworks, assets and off-balance-sheet  exposures are assigned to one of several broad risk categories according  to the obligor (for example, the person or legal entity contractually  obligated on an exposure), or if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of  the collateral. Banking organizations multiply the aggregate dollar  amount or exposure amount in each risk category by the risk weight  associated with that category. The resulting risk-weighted amounts from  each of the risk categories are added together, and generally this sum is  the banking organization\u2019s total risk-weighted assets, which comprises  the denominator of the risk-based capital ratio. For example, a $1,000 on- balance-sheet asset at a 20 percent risk weight would equal $200 in risk- weighted assets. An additional $1,000 on-balance-sheet asset at a 50  percent risk weight would equal $500 in risk-weighted assets, for a total of  $700 in risk-weighted assets (compared to the $2,000 in total assets).  The risk weights enable one to calculate the amount of capital a banking  organization would need to hold for a given asset\u2014its \u201ccapital charge\u201d\u2014in  order to meet the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements. To meet  an 8 percent minimum total capital ratio requirement, the organization  with the $700 in risk-weighted assets in the previous example would need  to hold $56 in capital ($700\u00d70.08). The minimum total capital charge for  the $1,000 on-balance-sheet asset that was risk-weighted at 20 percent  would be $16 ($1,000\u00d70.2\u00d70.08), while the minimum capital charge for  the $1,000 on-balance-sheet asset that was risk-weighted at 50 percent  would be $40 ($1,000\u00d70.5\u00d70.08).", "Risk weights for mortgages and other mortgage-related assets have been  included in a number of these regulatory capital frameworks over the  years, including the following:", "The Basel Capital Accord (Basel I), which was adopted in 1988 and  implemented in the United States in the early 1990s, established a  system of generally applicable risk weights for specific assets  (including mortgage-related assets) to calculate total risk-weighted  assets and defined a minimum total risk-based capital ratio (the ratio  of regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets) of 8 percent with limited  exceptions. Under this system, all assets of a certain category\u2014for  example, commercial loans\u2014were assigned a flat risk weight without  regard for differences in credit quality among the assets in that  category (simple risk-bucket approach).

Banks that are not subject to  this other rule may choose to use either method but must use the same  method across all exposures.", "The simplified supervisory formula approach takes into account the  weighted average capital charge for the underlying exposures,  delinquency level of the underlying collateral, and the relative size and  seniority of the security in the securitization structure (see app. II for the  details of the formula). The current balances of all the underlying  exposures in the securitization structure are used to calculate the  attachment and detachment points for each level, or tranche, of the  structure. Losses are first borne by the lowest tranches. Once a tranche  experiences a total loss, the next tranche immediately senior to it begins  to bear any additional losses.", "The following hypothetical securitization structure illustrates the simplified  supervisory formula approach for a securitization backed by a pool of  residential mortgages that would be risk-weighted at 50 percent. For such  a securitization, the typical capital charge of the underlying mortgage pool  is 4 percent (50 percent risk weight multiplied by 8 percent minimum risk- based capital ratio). Assuming that 5 percent of the mortgages in the pool  are delinquent and have a risk weight of 100 percent (for an 8 percent  capital charge), the weighted average capital charge of the mortgage pool  would be 4.2 percent. The risk weights for each of the tranches can be  calculated using the formula outlined in the final rule and described in  appendix II. The risk-weight results for a pool that does not involve  resecuritizations are shown in table 2. If 10 percent of the underlying  mortgage pool is delinquent, the weighted average capital charge would  be 4.4 percent, and the tranche risk weights for the lower (more risky)  tranches would increase, reflecting the increased likelihood of losses on  these tranches. In both scenarios, the most senior tranches would have  risk weights of 20 percent.", "Risk weights for other securitization exposures, such as real estate  mortgage investment conduits, can also be calculated using the simplified  supervisory formula approach. Similarly, the credit risk transfer  transactions the enterprises have engaged in with various investors would  be treated as securitization exposures for banks that hold these notes. In  most cases, these notes would have risk weights at or near 1,250 percent  due to the holders of the notes being in or near the first-loss position.", "Previously, under the Basel I-based rules that most banks were subject to  through 2014, some private-label securitization exposures were assigned  general risk weights while others were given risk weights based on credit  ratings. For example, privately issued MBS backed by mortgages that  would qualify for the 50 percent risk weight would receive a 50 percent  risk weight, subject to certain conditions. Mortgage securitization  exposures\u2014including direct credit substitutes, recourse, and residual  interests\u2014that were externally rated were assigned risk weights between  20 percent (for long-term credit ratings of AAA or AA) and 200 percent  (for BB ratings, which indicate higher risk).", "The gross-up approach in the Basel III-based rule is the same as an  approach that was available under the previous rules.

For mortgages not guaranteed by the federal  government (as in the previous example), the underlying exposures  can have risk weights of either 50 percent or 100 percent. The  weighted-average risk weight would be 75 percent if half of the total  amount of underlying mortgages had a risk weight of 50 percent and  the remaining underlying exposures had a risk weight of 100 percent.", "For the previous example, assume the weighted-average risk weight of  the underlying exposures is 50 percent (that is, all the mortgages meet all  of the requirements discussed previously, such as not 90 days past due  and not restructured or modified).

The total  amount of mortgage servicing assets held by banks peaked in 2009  and generally has been decreasing in subsequent years, according to  data compiled by SNL Financial. In 2016 reports on mortgage  servicing and nonbank servicers, we found that the share of U.S.  residential mortgages serviced by nonbank servicers increased from  approximately 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2012 to approximately  24.2 percent in the second quarter of 2015, while the share serviced  by the largest nationwide, regional, and other banks decreased from  about 75.4 percent to about 58.6 percent over the same period.", "Banking organizations may face recourse obligations (for example, to  repurchase mortgages they have sold to others) when loans default  within a certain period after the sale. Banks reported a decreasing  amount of residential mortgages serviced for others with recourse,  according to data compiled by SNL Financial, but this trend predates  the Basel III-based final rule.", "Under current credit risk retention rules, banks must retain an interest  equal to at least 5 percent of the credit risk for mortgage-backed  securities they sponsor unless the security qualifies for an applicable  exemption, including being exclusively backed by mortgages that  meet the definition of a \u201cqualified mortgage.\u201d These residual  interests are included in risk-weighted assets and may carry higher  risk weights under the Basel III-based rules than under the previous  rules, depending on how they are structured. Residual interests that  are structured as a vertical slice of the securitization structure  (meaning the sponsor retains a 5 percent interest in each tranche)  would have a lower risk weight than residual interests that are  structured as a horizontal slice of the securitization (meaning the  sponsor retains the most junior 5 percent interest in the securitization  structure). Few transactions involving the securitization of mortgages  that do not meet the qualified mortgage definition have been  completed since the rule went into effect. Instead, banks may be  electing to hold these mortgages in their portfolios or to originate  loans that meet the qualified mortgage definition, including those that  can be sold to the enterprises. The increase in banks\u2019 holdings of  securities backed by the enterprises could be evidence of this latter  scenario, as banks often deliver loans to the enterprises in exchange  for enterprise MBS. Holdings of enterprise MBS would have lower risk  weights than holding whole loans in portfolio (whether or not they  meet the qualified mortgage definition).", "Finally, the Basel III-based final rule largely left unchanged the historically  lower risk weights of MBS guaranteed by the enterprises vis-\u00e0-vis other  mortgage-related assets, which can influence the demand for these  securities relative to whole loans and privately issued MBS. While  holdings of MBS guaranteed by Ginnie Mae retain a 0 percent risk weight  and holdings of MBS guaranteed by the enterprises retain a 20 percent  risk weight under the standardized approach (and their treatment under  the advanced approach has not changed), holdings of privately issued  MBS may face higher risk weights than under the prior rules. For privately  issued MBS that have an external credit rating, the minimum weight  increased from 7 percent to 20 percent for banks subject to the advanced  approach, and the junior tranches of these MBS are likely subject to  higher risk weights in part because credit ratings can no longer be used to  calculate risk weights. According to data compiled by SNL Financial,  banks\u2019 holdings of MBS guaranteed by Ginnie Mae and the enterprises  have been increasing while their holdings of other residential MBS have  been decreasing, but these trends predate the changes to risk weights for  privately issued MBS."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We sought and received technical comments on a draft of this report from  the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  and incorporated their comments and feedback into the final report.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees and other interested parties.
