Initiated in 2001, Navy Cash is a joint Department of the Navy (DON) and Department of the Treasury Financial Management Service (FMS) program to create a cashless environment on ships using smart card technology, and is estimated to cost about $320 million to fully deploy. As requested, GAO analyzed whether DON is effectively implementing IT management controls on the program, including architectural alignment, economic justification, requirements development and management, risk management, security management, and system quality measurement against relevant guidance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Key IT management controls have not been effectively implemented on Navy Cash, to the point that further investment in this program, as it is currently defined, has not been shown to be a prudent and judicious use of scarce modernization resources. In particular, Navy Cash has not been (1) assessed and defined in a way to ensure that it is not duplicative of programs in the Air Force and the Army that use smart card technology for electronic retail transactions and (2) economically justified on the basis of reliable analyses of estimated costs and expected benefits over the program's life. As a result, DON cannot demonstrate that the investment alternative that it is pursuing is the most cost-effective solution to satisfying its mission needs. Moreover, other management controls, which are intended to maximize the chances of delivering defined and justified system capabilities and benefits on time and within budget, have not been effectively implemented. System requirements have not been effectively managed. For example, neither policies nor plans that define how system requirements are to be managed, nor an approved baseline set of requirements that are justified and needed to cost-effectively meet mission needs, exist. Instead, requirements are addressed reactively through requests for changes to the system based primarily on the availability of funding. Program risks have not been effectively managed. In particular, plans, processes, and procedures that provide for identifying, mitigating, and disclosing risks have not been defined, nor have risk-related roles and responsibilities for key stakeholders. System security has not been effectively managed, thus putting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of deployed and operating shipboard devices, applications, and data at increased risk of being compromised. For example, the mitigation of system vulnerabilities by applying software patches has not been effectively implemented. Key aspects of system quality are not being effectively measured. For example, data for determining trends in unresolved system change requests, which is an indicator of system stability, as well as user feedback on system satisfaction, are not being collected and used. Program oversight and management officials acknowledged these weaknesses and cited turnover of staff in key positions and their primary focus on deploying Navy Cash as reasons for the state of some of these IT management controls. Collectively, this means that, after investing about 6 years and $132 million on Navy Cash and planning to invest an additional $60 million to further develop the program, the department has yet to demonstrate through verifiable analysis and evidence that the program, as currently defined, is justified. Moreover, even if further investment was to be demonstrated, the manner in which the delivery of program capabilities is being managed is not adequate. As a result, the program is at risk of delivering a system solution that falls short of cost, schedule, and performance expectations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For decades, the Department of Defense (DOD) has been challenged in  For decades, the Department of Defense (DOD) has been challenged in  modernizing its business systems.

In addition, the estimates should be updated regularly  to reflect material changes in the program, and steps should be taken to  minimize mathematical mistakes and their significance. The estimates  should also be grounded in a historical record of cost estimating and  actual experiences on comparable programs.", "Credible: The cost estimates should discuss any limitations in the analysis  performed that are due to uncertainty or biases surrounding data or  assumptions. Further, the estimates\u2019 derivation should provide for varying  any major assumptions and recalculating outcomes based on sensitivity  analyses, and the estimates\u2019 associated risks and inherent uncertainty  should be disclosed.

Moreover, it does not include FMS\u2019s portion of the  program\u2019s cost, which is estimated to be about $100 million over a 14-year  period. In addition, the cost estimate does not clearly describe how the  various cost sub-elements are aggregated to produce the amounts  associated with the two documented cost categories, system installation  costs, and operations and maintenance costs. Therefore, it is not clear that  all pertinent costs are included and no costs are double counted.

However, the calculations used to derive the cost estimate, including  descriptions of the methodologies used and traceability back to source  data (e.g., vendor quotes, salary data), are not documented.

A sensitivity analysis  reveals how the cost estimate is affected by a change in a single  assumption or cost driver, such as the ship installation schedule, while  holding all other parameters constant. A Monte Carlo simulation assesses  the aggregate variability of the cost estimate to determine a confidence  range around the estimate. Without such analyses of uncertainty, the  program office cannot have confidence that the program can be completed  within the cost estimate.", "Program officials acknowledged the limitations in the estimate, and  attributed them to turnover of staff and their current focus on deploying  the system.

Moreover, at least three alternatives to the status  quo were not assessed on the basis of net present value, using the proper  discount rate to account for inflation. Instead, the analysis only  qualitatively evaluated Navy Cash against its predecessor systems. For  example, the analysis included evaluation of the capabilities and  limitations of the predecessor systems, but did not include evaluating the  relative cost and benefits of any alternatives to Navy Cash.", "In addition, the program\u2019s benefit projections erroneously counted about  $40 million in cost transfers as cost savings, thus overstating projected  benefits (i.e., projected benefits should only be $93 million). Transfers  represent shifts of control over the spending of resources from one group  to another and thus do not result in an economic gain. According to OMB  guidance, transfers do not produce economic gains because the benefits to  those government entities that receive such a transfer are the same as the  costs borne by those government entities that provide the transfer.  Moreover, no uncertainty analysis was performed on the benefit estimates.

It also stated  that it would improve quality-of-life for sailors and marines. While DON  has measured the reduction in the cash onboard some ships where Navy  Cash is operating, this reduction represents a transfer and is not an actual  benefit. Moreover, the extent to which the system is achieving expected  man-hour savings, which would constitute a true benefit, has not been  measured.

Without system requirements, the ability  of the program office to understand the impact of any system change  requests (i.e., cost, schedule, and performance) and thus make informed  decisions about such changes, is limited. For example, although the  program office identified a high-level requirement for the system to share  information with the Retail Operations Management system used in ships\u2019  store operations, the associated system-level requirements were not  defined. As a result, the deployed version of the system was not designed  and developed to provide this interface. The requirement for this interface  was later realized after a number of system and operational problems  surfaced. Addressing these problems through a series of changes required  additional time and funding. Program officials acknowledged that more  effective requirements development and management practices could have  avoided these problems. As another example, a system requirement for  automatically deploying software patches to operational systems was not  defined.

In lieu of a policy or plans, the program office has established an ad hoc  change control process, whereby change proposals are approved or  disapproved by a joint DON and FMS change control board based on a  change management policy that was drafted in 2003. However, this policy  was never finalized or approved and does not define roles and  responsibilities or how requirements will be managed. Further, the board  has not been chartered.

We do not agree. Our review extended to six key  acquisition control areas, all of which are reflected in DOD\u2019s own  acquisition policies as well as other federal guidance. Effective  implementation of these controls can minimize program risks and better  ensure that system investments are defined in a way to optimally support  mission operations and performance, as well as deliver promised system  capabilities and benefits on time and within budget.

We do not find this comment relevant to our  recommendation because our point is not that one of the other DOD  programs should be altered and used in place of Navy Cash. Rather, our  point is that these smart card programs need to be looked at collectively to  decide whether it is in the department\u2019s best interest to continue investing  in separate smart card programs or to invest in a single department-wide  solution. This point is consistent with FMS\u2019s stated goal of having a single  smart card for DOD.", "Third, FMS stated that it disagreed with our finding that the Navy Cash  benefits projection erroneously counted $40 million as cost savings rather  than cost transfers, adding that this value represents not merely a transfer  between agencies but actual savings to the United States.

To address the objective, we focused on the following  management areas (1) architectural alignment; (2) economic justification;  (3) requirements development and management; (4) risk management; (5)  security management; and (6) system quality measurement. In doing so,  we analyzed a range of program documentation, such as the acquisition  strategy, business case, economic analysis, agreements between the  partnering organizations, and interviewed cognizant officials, such as the  Milestone Decision Authority, program manager, and Financial  Management Service (FMS) and financial agent officials responsible for  Navy Cash.", "To address architectural alignment, we reviewed the program\u2019s business  enterprise architecture (BEA) compliance assessments and system  architecture products as well as versions 4.0, 4.1, and 5.0 of the BEA and  compared them to the BEA compliance requirements described in the  Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2005 and DOD\u2019s BEA compliance guidance and evaluated the extent to  which the compliance assessments addressed all relevant BEA products.  We also reviewed DOD guidance for program architecture development,  such as DOD\u2019s Business Transformation Guidance, and compared Navy  Cash\u2019s program architecture development activities to this guidance. In  addition, we interviewed Navy Cash and FMS officials, as well as Navy  Cash\u2019s Milestone Decision Authority, and requested related documentation  on the potential duplication between Navy Cash and other DOD programs  that involve the use of smart card functionality, such as the Air Force\u2019s and  Army\u2019s Eagle Cash and EZpay programs.", "To address the program\u2019s economic justification, we reviewed the latest  economic analysis to determine the basis for the cost and benefit  estimates. This included evaluating the analysis against Office of  Management and Budget guidance and GAO\u2019s Cost Assessment Guide. In  addition, we interviewed cognizant program officials, including the Navy  Cash program manager and FMS, regarding their respective roles,  responsibilities, and actual efforts in developing and/or reviewing the  economic analysis and the extent to which measures and metrics showed  that projected benefits in the economic analysis were actually being  realized. We also interviewed cognizant officials such as the Milestone  Decision Authority about the purpose and use of the program\u2019s economic  analysis for managing the investment in the Navy Cash program.", "To address requirements development and management, we reviewed  relevant program documentation, such as the concept of operations  document, and interviewed relevant program officials and evaluated this  information against relevant best practices. We also reviewed interface  requirements documents, minutes of program management meetings, and  traceability of security requirements. In addition, we interviewed program  officials involved in the requirements management process to discuss the  change control process they use and their roles and responsibilities for  managing requirements.", "To address risk management, we reviewed relevant risk management  documentation, such as program management review meeting minutes  and compared the program office\u2019s activities with DOD\u2019s risk management  guidance and related best practices. We analyzed the effectiveness of the  program\u2019s management reviews in terms of managing risks. In doing so,  we interviewed cognizant program officials responsible, such as the  program manager, Milestone Decision Authority, and FMS officials to  discuss their roles and responsibilities and obtain clarification on the  program\u2019s approach to managing risks associated with acquiring and  implementing Navy Cash.", "To address security management, we reviewed relevant security  documentation, such as DOD and National Institute of Standards and  Technology information security guidance, and the Navy Cash afloat and  ashore system security authorization agreements. In addition, we observed  the system in operation aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt and  discussed security issues with ship personnel, program office, FMS, and  financial agent officials. We also reviewed USS Harry S. Truman  contingency plan test results. Additionally, we reviewed a database used  to maintain the inventory of Navy Cash hardware and software assets as a  part of our analysis on the Navy Cash vulnerability management program.  Furthermore, we interviewed cognizant DON, FMS, and financial agent  officials to discuss their roles and responsibilities and obtain clarification  on the program\u2019s approach to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of Navy Cash systems and information.", "To address system quality measurement, we reviewed program  documentation, such as change request logs, and a plan of action and  milestones for change requests. We also compared the program\u2019s data  collection and analysis practices relative to these areas to program  guidance and best practices. We reviewed the plans for and results of  surveys that were performed on user and shipboard merchant satisfaction  with Navy Cash, and we interviewed program management and technical  officials.", "We conducted our work at DOD offices and program office and ship  facilities in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, Norfolk, Virginia, and  Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, between June 2007 and September 2008, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objective. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of the Treasury, Financial Management Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact persons named above, key contributors to this  report were Neelaxi Lakhmani (Assistant Director), Jenniffer Wilson  (Assistant Director), Ed Glagola (Assistant Director), Monica Anatalio,  Carolyn Boyce, Harold Brumm, West Coile, Neil Doherty, Cheryl  Dottermusch, Joshua Hammerstein, Mustafa Hassan, Michael Holland,  James Houtz, Ethan Iczkovitz, Rebecca LaPaze, Anh Le, Josh Leiling, Mary  Marshall, Karen Richey, Melissa Schermerhorn, Karl Seifert, Jonathan  Ticehurst, and Adam Vodraska."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
