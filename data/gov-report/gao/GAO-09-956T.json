Since the program's inception, GAO has conducted numerous reviews of the SBIR program. This statement summarizes GAO's past findings on the SBIR program's (1) successes and challenges, (2) data collection issues that affect program monitoring and evaluation, and (3) how agencies make eligibility determinations for the program. GAO is not making any new recommendations in this statement."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Between July 1985 and June 1999, GAO found that the SBIR program was achieving its goals to enhance the role of small businesses in federal R&D, stimulate commercialization of research results, and support the participation of small businesses owned by women and/or disadvantaged persons. More specifically, GAO found that throughout the life of the program, awards have been based on technical merit and are generally of good quality. In addition, the SBIR program successfully attracts many qualified companies, has had a high level of competition, consistently has had a high number of first-time participants, and attracts hundreds of new companies annually. Further, SBIR has helped serve agencies' missions and R&D needs; although GAO found that agencies differ in the emphasis they place on funding research to support their mission versus more generalized research. During these reviews GAO also identified areas of weakness and made recommendations that could strengthen the program further. Many of these recommendations have been either fully or partially addressed by the Congress in various reauthorizations of the program or by the agencies themselves. For example, in 2005, GAO found that the issue of how to assess the performance of the SBIR program remains somewhat unresolved after almost two decades, and identified data and information gaps that make assessment of the SBIR program a challenge. Many of the solutions to improve the SBIR program could be addressed, in part, by collecting better data and establishing a government-use database, so that SBA and participating agencies can share information and enhance their efforts to monitor and evaluate the program. However, in 2006, GAO reported that SBA was 5 years behind schedule in complying with a congressional mandate to develop a government-use database that could facilitate agencies' monitoring and evaluation efforts. Moreover, the information that SBA was collecting for the database was incomplete and inconsistent, thereby limiting its usefulness. In 2006, SBA told GAO that it expected to have the government-use database operational early in fiscal year 2007. However, the database did not become operational until October 2008 and currently contains 2 years of new data, according to an SBA official. The database also does not permit information to be entered in an inconsistent format. In 2006, GAO also found that SBA, NIH, and DOD focus on a few select criteria to determine the eligibility of applicants for SBIR awards. GAO reported that both NIH and DOD largely relied on applicants to self-certify that they met all of the SBIR eligibility criteria as part of their SBIR applications, although both made additional efforts to ensure the accuracy of the information when they observed discrepancies in the applications. When the agencies were unable to verify the eligibility of an applicant, they referred the application to SBA for an eligibility determination. GAO found that when SBA finds an applicant to be ineligible for the SBIR program, it places this information on its Web site but does not consistently identify that the ineligibility determination was made for the SBIR program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here today to testify on our past work on the Small  Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. As you know, to be  competitive in the global economy, the United States relies heavily on  innovation through research and development (R&D). Recognizing the  potential of small businesses to be a source of significant innovation, the  Congress passed the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982.  The act established the SBIR program to stimulate technological  innovation, use small businesses to meet federal R&D needs, foster and  encourage participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in  technological innovation, and increase private sector commercialization of  innovations derived from federal R&D. The act provided for a three- phased program: phase I to determine the feasibility and scientific and  technical merit of a proposed research idea; phase II to further develop the  idea; and phase III to commercialize the resulting product or process with  no further SBIR funding.", "Federal agencies that have budgets of $100 million for research conducted  by others, called extramural research, are required to use 2.5 percent of  these budgets to establish and operate an SBIR program. Currently, 11  federal agencies participate in the SBIR program. Each agency manages its  own program, including targeting research areas, reviewing proposed  projects, and making research awards through grants, contracts, or  cooperative agreements. The Small Business Administration (SBA) plays a  central administrative role by, for example, issuing policy directives to the  participating federal agencies, collecting data from participating agencies  on awards and recipients, and reporting program results annually to the  Congress. In 2005 awards from three agencies\u2014the Department of  Defense (DOD), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and National  Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA)\u2014accounted for the majority of  SBIR funds. From its inception in fiscal year 1983 through fiscal year 2004,  federal agencies had awarded over $17 billion for more than 82,000  projects.", "Since it was established in 1982, the SBIR program has been reauthorized  and modified by the Congress at various times. For example, the Small  Business Research and Development Enhancement Act of 1992 directed  SBA and participating agencies to, among other things, emphasize the goal  of increasing commercialization of research results and to improve the  government\u2019s dissemination of program-related data. As a result, agencies  were required to include commercialization potential as a criterion for  selecting award recipients. During this same period, SBA began to develop  a publicly available database, known as Tech-Net, that contained  information on all awards made through the SBIR program. The Tech-Net  database is intended to be, among other things, an electronic gateway of  technology information and resources for researchers, scientists, and  government officials about federally funded, leading edge technology  research. The Small Business Innovation Research Program  Reauthorization Act of 2000 formalized this database by requiring SBA to  develop, maintain, and make available to the public a searchable, up-to- date, electronic database that contained SBIR award information. The  2000 reauthorization act also required SBA to develop and maintain  another restricted government database that would contain additional  information on commercialization not contained in the public Tech-Net  database, thereby allowing better evaluations of the SBIR program on an  ongoing basis. This database was to be established by mid-2001 and made  available only to government agencies and certain other authorized users.  SBA has established, through a policy directive, a series of data elements  for all the agencies to submit for its public Tech-Net database. The SBIR  program is currently being considered by the Congress for reauthorization,  and both the House and Senate have recently passed bills to reauthorize  the program.", "In this context, you asked us to summarize the successes and challenges  that our past work has identified about the SBIR program, summarize the  concerns we have previously identified on SBA\u2019s efforts to establish an  interagency database that includes information on SBIR applicants and  awards, and describe the process that agencies use to determine the  eligibility of SBIR applicants for the program. This statement is based  largely on our prior reviews of the SBIR program and contacts with SBA  officials. Our work on the prior reviews was conducted in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  we obtained for those reviews provided a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Successes and Challenges of the SBIR Program", "paragraphs": ["Our reviews of the SBIR program between 1985 and 1999 found numerous  examples of program successes such as the following:    Funding high-quality research. Throughout the life of the program,  awards have been based on technical merit and are generally of good  quality.", "Encouraging widespread competition. The SBIR program successfully  attracts many qualified companies, has had a high level of competition,  consistently has had a high number of first-time participants, and attracts  hundreds of new companies annually.", "Providing effective outreach. SBIR agencies consistently reach out to  foster participation by women-owned or socially and economically  disadvantaged small businesses by participating in regional small business  conferences and workshops targeting these types of small businesses.", "Increasing successful commercialization. At various points in the life of  the program we have reported that SBIR has succeeded in increasing  private sector commercialization of innovations.", "Helping to serve mission needs. SBIR has helped serve agencies\u2019 missions  and R&D needs, although we found that agencies differ in the emphasis  they place on funding research to support their mission versus more  generalized research.", "Our reviews of the SBIR program during that time have also identified a  number of areas of weakness that, over time, have been either fully or  partially addressed by the Congress in reauthorizing the program or by the  agencies themselves. For example,    Duplicate funding. In 1995, we identified duplicate funding for similar, or  even identical, research projects by more than one agency. A few  companies received funding for the same proposals two, three, and even  five times before agencies became aware of the duplication. Contributing  factors included the fraudulent evasion of disclosure by companies  applying for awards, the lack of a consistent definition for key terms such  as \u201csimilar research,\u201d and the lack of interagency sharing of data on  awards. To address these concerns, we recommended that SBA take three  actions: (1) determine if the certification form needed to be improved and  make any necessary revisions, (2) develop definitions and guidelines for  what constitutes \u201cduplicative\u201d research, and (3) provide interagency  access to current information regarding SBIR awards In response to our  recommendations, SBA strengthened the language agencies use in their  application packages to clearly warn applicants about the illegality of  entering into multiple agreements for essentially the same effort. In  addition, SBA planned to develop Internet capabilities to provide SBIR  data access for all of the agencies.", "Inconsistent interpretations of extramural research budgets. In 1998, we  found that while agency officials adhered to SBIR\u2019s program and statutory  funding requirements, they used differing interpretations of how to  calculate their \u201cextramural research budgets.\u201d As a result, some agencies  were inappropriately including or excluding some types of expenses. We  recommended that SBA provide additional guidance on how participating  agencies were to calculate their extramural research budgets. The  Congress addressed this program weakness in 2000, when it required that  the agencies report annually to SBA on the methods used to calculate their  extramural research budgets.", "Geographical concentration of awards. In 1999, in response to  congressional concerns about the geographical concentration of SBIR  awards, we reported that companies in a small number of states,  especially California and Massachusetts, had submitted the most  proposals and won the majority of awards. The distribution of awards  generally followed the pattern of distribution of non-SBIR expenditures for  R&D, venture capital investments, and academic research funds. We  reported that some agencies had undertaken efforts to broaden the  geographic distribution of awards. In the 2000 reauthorization of the  program, the Congress directed the SBA Administrator to establish the  Federal and State Technology (FAST) Partnership Program to help  strengthen the technological competitiveness of small businesses,  especially in those states that receive fewer SBIR grants. The FAST  Program was not reauthorized when it expired in 2005. In 2006 when we  looked at the geographical concentration of awards made by DOD and  NIH, we found that while a firm in every state received at least one SBIR  award from both agencies, SBIR awards continued to be concentrated in a  handful of states and about one third of awards had been made to firms in  California and Massachusetts.", "Clarification on commercialization and other SBIR goals. Finally, in  2000, the Congress directed the SBA Administrator to require companies  applying for a phase II award to include a commercialization plan with  their SBIR proposals. This addressed our continuing concern that  clarification was needed on the relative emphasis that agencies should  give to a company\u2019s commercialization record and SBIR\u2019s other goals  when evaluating proposals. In addition, in 2001, SBA initiated efforts to  develop standard criteria for measuring commercial and other outcomes  of the SBIR program and incorporate these criteria into its Tech-Net  database. In fiscal year 2002, SBA further enhanced the reporting system  to include commercialization results that would help establish an initial  baseline rate of commercialization. In addition, small business firms  participating in the SBIR program are required to provide information  annually on sales and investments associated with their SBIR projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBIR Tech-Net Database Limitations", "paragraphs": ["Many of the solutions cited above to improve and strengthen the SBIR  program relied to some extent on the collection of data or the  establishment of a government-use database, so that SBA and participating  agencies could share information and enhance their efforts to monitor and  evaluate the program. However, in 2006, we reported that SBA was 5  years behind schedule in complying with the congressional mandate to  develop a government database that could facilitate agencies\u2019 monitoring  and evaluation of the program. We also reported that the information SBA  was collecting for the database was incomplete and inconsistent, thereby  limiting its usefulness for program evaluations. Specifically, we identified  the following concerns with SBA\u2019s data-gathering efforts:    SBA had not met its obligation to implement a restricted government-use  database that would allow SBIR program evaluation as directed by the  2000 SBIR reauthorization act. As outlined in the legislation, SBA, in  consultation with federal agencies participating in the SBIR program, was  to develop a secure database by June 2001 and maintain it for program  evaluation purposes by the federal government and certain other entities.  SBA planned to meet this requirement by expanding the existing Tech-Net  database to include a restricted government-use section that would be  accessible only to government agencies and other authorized users. In  constructing the government-use section of the database, SBA planned to  supplement data already gathered for the public-use section of the Tech- Net database with information from SBIR recipients and from  participating agencies on commercialization outcomes for phase II SBIR  awards. However, according to SBA officials, the agency was unable to  meet the statutory requirement, primarily because of increased security  and other information technology project requirements, agency  management changes, and budgetary constraints. When we reported on  this lack of compliance with the database mandate, SBA told us that it  anticipated having the government-use section of the Tech-Net database  operational early in fiscal year 2007. However, according to an SBA  official, the database became operational in October 2008, and agencies  have begun to provide data on their SBIR programs using the Internet.", "While federal agencies participating in the SBIR program submitted a wide  range of descriptive award information to SBA annually, these agencies  did not consistently provide all of the required data elements. As outlined  in SBA\u2019s policy directive, each year, SBIR participating agencies are  required to collect and maintain information from recipients and provide it  to SBA so that it can be included in the Tech-Net database. Specifically,  the policy directive established over 40 data elements for participating  agencies to report for each SBIR award they make; a number of these  elements are required. These data include award-specific information,  such as the date and amount of the award, an abstract of the project  funded by the award, and a unique tracking number for each award.  Participating agencies are also required to provide data about the award  recipient, such as gender and socio-economic status, and information  about the type of firms that received the awards, such as the number of  employees and geographic location. Much of the data participating  agencies collected are provided by the SBIR applicants when they apply  for an award. Agencies provide additional information, such as the  grant/contract number and the dollar amount of the award, after the award  is made. For the most part, all of the agencies we reviewed in 2006  provided the majority of the data elements outlined in the policy directive.  However, some of the agencies were not providing the full range of  required data elements. As a result, SBA did not have complete  information on the characteristics of all SBIR awards made by the  agencies. SBA officials told us that agencies did not routinely provide all of  the data elements outlined in the policy directive because either they did  not capture the information in their agency databases or they were not  requesting the information from the SBIR applicants. Officials at the  participating agencies cited additional reasons for the incomplete data  they provided to SBA. For example, some officials noted that SBA\u2019s Tech- Net annual reporting requirements often change and others said that if the  company or contact information changes and the SBIR recipient fails to  provide updated information to the agency, the agency cannot provide this  information to SBA.", "Participating agencies were providing some data that are inconsistent with  SBA\u2019s formatting guidance, and while some of these inconsistencies were  corrected by SBA\u2019s quality assurance processes, others were not. In 2006,  we determined that almost a quarter of the data provided by five of the  eight agencies we reviewed was incorrectly formatted for one or more  fields in the Tech-Net database. As a result, we concluded that these  inconsistent or inaccurate data elements compromised the value of the  database for program evaluation purposes. SBA\u2019s quality assurance efforts  focus on obtaining complete and accurate data for those fields essential to  tracking specific awards, such as the tracking number and award amount,  rather than on those fields that contain demographic information about  the award recipient. We found that SBA electronically checked the data  submitted by the participating agencies to locate and reformat  inconsistencies, but it did not take steps to ensure that all agency-provided  data were accurate and complete. We also determined that inconsistencies  or inaccuracies could arise in certain data fields because SBA interpreted  the absence of certain data elements as a negative entry without  confirming the accuracy of such an interpretation with the agency. As we  reported in 2006, such inaccuracies and inconsistencies were a concern  because information in the Tech-Net database would be used to populate  the government-use section of the database that SBA was developing (as  discussed above) to support SBIR program evaluations. However, at the  time of our review, SBA had no plans to correct any of the errors or  inconsistencies in the database that related to the historical data already  collected. As a result, we concluded that the errors in the existing  database would migrate to the government-use section of the database and  would compromise the usefulness of the government-use database for  program evaluation and monitoring purposes.", "To address the concerns that we identified with regard to the quality of the  data that SBA was collecting for the Tech-Net database, we recommended  in our 2006 report that SBA work with the participating agencies to  strengthen the completeness, accuracy, and consistency of its data  collection efforts. According to an SBA official, the database is currently  operational and agencies have entered data for fiscal years 2007 and 2008  over the Internet. Moreover, according to this official, the system is set up  in such a way that it does not accept incorrectly formatted data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Focus on Select Awardee Eligibility Criteria", "paragraphs": ["In 2006, we also found that SBA and some participating agencies focused  on a few select criteria for determining applicants\u2019 eligibility for SBIR  awards. Specifically, we reviewed DOD\u2019s, NIH\u2019s, and SBA\u2019s processes to  determine eligibility of applicants for the SBIR program and found that  they focused largely on three SBIR criteria in their eligibility reviews\u2014 ownership, size in terms of the number of employees, and for-profit status  of SBIR applicants. Although agency officials also told us that they  consider information on the full range of criteria, such as whether the  principal investigator is employed primarily by the applying firm, and the  extent to which work on the project will be performed by others.", "Moreover, we found that both NIH and DOD largely relied on applicants to  self-certify that they met all of the SBIR eligibility criteria as part of their  SBIR applications. For example, at NIH, applicants certified that they met  the eligibility criteria by completing a verification statement when NIH  notified them that their application had been selected for funding but  before NIH made the award. The verification statement directs applicants  to respond to a series of questions relating to for-profit status, ownership,  number of employees, where the work would be performed, and the  primary employment of the principal investigator, among others. Similarly,  DOD\u2019s cover sheet for each SBIR application directs applicants to certify  that they met the program\u2019s eligibility criteria. NIH and DOD would not  fund applications if the questions on their agency\u2019s verification statement  or cover sheet were not answered. Both NIH and DOD also warned  applicants of the civil and criminal penalties for making false, fictitious, or  fraudulent statements. In some cases the agencies made additional efforts  to ensure the accuracy of the information applicants provided when they  observed certain discrepancies in the applications.", "In 2006, we reported that when officials at the agencies had unresolved  concerns about the accuracy of an applicant\u2019s eligibility information, they  referred the matter to SBA to make an eligibility determination. We found  that when SBA received a letter from the agency detailing its concerns,  SBA officials contacted the applicants and asked them to re-certify their  eligibility status and might request additional documentation on the  criteria of concern. Upon making a determination of eligibility, SBA then  notified the official at the inquiring agency, and the applicant, of its  decision.", "Although, SBA made the information about firms it found ineligible  publicly available on its Web site so that all participating agencies and the  public could access the information, we found that it did not consistently  include information on the Web site identifying whether or not the  determination was for the SBIR program. An SBA official told us the  agency planned to include such information on its Web site more  systematically before the end of fiscal year 2006. Once the agencies  received information about applicants\u2019 eligibility they also had different  approaches for retaining and sharing this information. For example, while  both NIH and DOD noted the determination of ineligibility in the  applicant\u2019s file, NIH also centrally tracked ineligible firms and made this  information available to all of its institutes and centers that make SBIR  awards. In contrast, DOD did not have a centralized process to share the  information across its awarding components, although DOD officials told  us it was common practice for awarding components to share such  information electronically.", "In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, while the SBIR program is generally  recognized as a successful program that has encouraged innovation and  helped federal agencies achieve their R&D goals, it has continued to suffer  from some long-standing evaluation and monitoring issues that are made  more difficult because of a lack of accurate, reliable, and comprehensive  information on SBIR applicants and awards. The Congress recognized the  need for a comprehensive database in 2000 when it mandated that SBA  develop a government-use database. Although SBA did not meet its  statutorily mandated deadline of June 2001, the database has been  operational since October 2008, and contains limited new information but  may also contain inaccurate historical data.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
