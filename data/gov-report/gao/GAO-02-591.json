As a result, FAA will likely need to hire thousands of air traffic controllers in the next decade to met increasing traffic demands and to address the anticipated attrition of experienced controllers, predominately because of retirement. FAA has yet to developed a comprehensive human capital workforce strategy to address its impending controller needs. Rather, FAA's strategy for replacing controllers is generally to hire new controllers only when current, experienced controllers leave. This does not take into account the potential increases in future hiring and the time necessary to train replacements. In addition, there is uncertainty about the ability of FAA's new aptitude test to identify the best controller candidates. Further, FAA has not addressed the resources that may be needed at its training academy.

Controllers help ensure that aircraft  maintain a safe distance between one another and that each aircraft is on  proper course to its destination.", "Specific controller responsibilities for managing air traffic vary according  to the type of air traffic control facility. For instance, controllers who work  at airport control towers are responsible for ensuring the safe separation of  aircraft on the ground and in flight in the vicinity of airports, generally  within a 5-mile radius. These controllers manage the flow of aircraft during  take-off and landing and coordinate the transfer of aircraft with adjacent  control facilities as aircraft enter or leave an airport\u2019s airspace. Controllers  working at terminal radar approach control (TRACON) facilities use radar  screens to track planes and manage the arrival and departure of aircraft  within a 5- to 50\u2013nautical mile radius of airports. At these TRACON  facilities, a key function of an approach controller is to line up and  sequence airplanes as they descend into an airport\u2019s 5-mile radius.  Controllers working at air route traffic control centers (commonly called  en route centers) manage aircraft beyond a 50\u2013nautical mile radius. These  controllers assign aircraft to specific routes and altitudes while they fly  along federal airways. These controllers also coordinate the transfer of aircraft control with adjacent en route or terminal facilities. The typical en  route center is responsible for more than 100,000 square miles of airspace,  which generally extends over several states.", "Figure 1 shows how controllers working at the different air traffic control  facilities track aircraft during ground movements, take-off, in-flight, and  landing operations. Currently, FAA operates 339 air traffic control facilities,  consisting of 24 en route centers and 315 terminal facilities.", "In total, about 20,000 employees categorized as air traffic controllers  directly control and manage the air traffic system, comprising several  positions with differing responsibilities.

This total includes  positions that actively control, or supervise the control of, traffic (air traffic  control specialists, traffic management coordinators, and operational  supervisors); and \u201coff-line\u201d positions that do not control traffic (former air  traffic control specialists in management, training, or staff positions)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staffing Levels Negotiated between FAA and Controllers\u2019 Union", "paragraphs": ["As the table above indicates, the majority of air traffic controllers are  classified as specialists. These controllers are represented by the National  Air Traffic Controllers Association, which negotiated staffing levels with  FAA in 1998. Under the terms of the agreement, nationwide staffing (in full- time equivalents) for these specialists was set at 15,000 for fiscal years 1999  through 2001. The agreement also called for 2 percent staff increases for  fiscal years 2002 and 2003, arriving at a controller specialist staffing level of  15,606 by the end of fiscal year 2003. FAA has requested funding to meet the  staffing levels called for in the agreement. Under the 1998 agreement, FAA  headquarters officials and NATCA national representatives negotiate  allocation of staffing levels for the air traffic control specialists among  FAA\u2019s nine regions. Figure 2 below shows the location of each FAA region  and the number of controller specialists allocated to each region for fiscal  year 2001.", "Once the regions receive their staff allocations, FAA regional managers and  NATCA regional representatives negotiate staff allocations among the  various field facilities in each region.

Pursuant to this  authority, FAA requires that a potential controller candidate be hired before  reaching his or her 31st birthday. This provision was established in  recognition of the fact that younger trainees are more successful in  completing the controller training programs, and that younger individuals  may be better able to deal with the stress of controlling air traffic. One  exception to this rule is the Employment of Retired Military Air Traffic  Controllers Program, commonly known as the Phoenix Controller-20  program, under which FAA commits to hiring retired military controllers  who are past the age of 30. This exception allows military controllers to  stay with the military longer before moving to FAA to continue their  controller activities.", "Controller retirement is also affected by special requirements. Controllers  working at FAA\u2019s air traffic control facilities and staff offices are eligible to  retire under two sets of retirement provisions: the general retirement  requirements for federal employees and special requirements for  controllers. Depending on when a controller was hired, he or she is covered  by either the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employee  Retirement System. As federal employees, controllers under these systems  can retire if they meet certain age and years-of-service requirements. For  example, under general CSRS, a controller who is 55 years old can retire  after 30 years of federal service, or at 60 years old with 20 years of service,  or at 62 with 5 years of service.", "Under the special controller retirement requirements, a controller may  retire earlier than under the general CSRS and FERS requirements if he or  she has enough service time as an active controller specialist, traffic  management coordinator, or immediate supervisor. Time in these  \u201ccovered\u201d positions is generally known as \u201cgood time\u201d because it counts  toward the special retirement requirements. Controllers can retire at age 50  if they have spent at least 20 years in a covered position, or at any age if  they have at least 25 years in a covered position. Under these provisions,  controllers covered by CSRS are guaranteed a retirement annuity amounting to the greater of two figures: either 50 percent of their high  average 3-year salary or the basic federal retirement annuity. Controllers  covered by FERS receive an annuity amounting to 1.7 percent of their high  average 3-year salary for the first 20 years of service plus 1 percent of their  high average 3-year salary for each additional year of service.", "Table 2 summarizes the CSRS, FERS, and special retirement provisions.", "In addition to these basic retirement eligibility requirements, air traffic  controllers covered by CSRS are also subject, pursuant to Public Law 92- 297, to a rule requiring mandatory separation at age 56. Controllers covered by FERS are subject to a similar rule, pursuant to Public Law 99- 335.

Referred to as off-the-street hires,  these candidates must pass an OPM exam to qualify for employment with  FAA and must pass a 15-week initial training program at FAA\u2019s Academy in  Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, before being assigned to a facility. There have  been no OPM job announcements for entry-level air traffic control  specialist positions since 1992, because FAA has chosen to rely on other  sources for new candidates. FAA estimates that approximately 150 people  who responded to the last announcement and passed the OPM exam are  still eligible for employment as controllers.", "The second group includes graduates of FAA-accredited collegiate  programs who receive initial air traffic control training prior to being hired  by FAA. This type of training introduces students to the terminology,  airspace configurations, and technical skills necessary to manage air traffic  and operate equipment. Students can receive general air traffic control  training at one of 13 schools under FAA\u2019s collegiate training initiative  program, or specialized en route training at the Minneapolis Community  and Technical College, formerly known as the Mid-American Aviation  Resource Consortium school (see app. II for more detailed information on  the schools). Collegiate training initiative schools offer either two- or four- year aviation related degrees. Unlike these schools, the Minneapolis  Community and Technical College program is not part of a broader  academic program, and the federal government subsidizes the cost of  training its students. Collegiate training initiative graduates must pass an  initial 12-week controller training program at the FAA academy to begin  work at their assigned facility, while Minneapolis Community and  Technical College graduates can immediately begin working at their  assigned facilities. During fiscal years 1997 through 2001, FAA has hired 465  from the collegiate training programs and 291 from the Minneapolis  Community and Technical College.", "The third group of candidates consists of controllers with previous air  traffic control experience, including both former Department of Defense  (DOD) controllers and controllers fired in the 1981 strike. DOD employs  both active-duty military controllers and civilian controllers. In general,  military controllers can leave DOD for FAA at the end of their enlistments,  as long as they do so before turning 31 years of age. To help DOD  minimize military controller losses, FAA and DOD designed a program in  1999 called the Phoenix Controller-20 program to give controllers an  incentive to stay in the military past age 30. Under this program, military  controllers can join FAA after they retire from military service. FAA may  also hire controllers who previously held air traffic controller positions  with the agency; most of them are among those fired in the 1981 controller  strike. President Reagan banned the federal government from hiring any of  these controllers, but President Bill Clinton lifted this ban in 1993, at which  time FAA issued a job announcement for fired controllers interested in  returning to work. Candidates in this group are not required to attend initial  controller training at the academy but may be required to take refresher  training there. During fiscal years 1997 through 2001, FAA hired 793 former  DOD controllers and rehired 562 controllers who had been fired in 1981.", "Once assigned to an air traffic control facility, candidates are classified as  \u201cdevelopmental controllers\u201d until they complete all requirements to be  certified for all of the air traffic control positions within a defined area of a  given facility.

To the extent that FAA replaces supervisors who leave,  increases in supervisory retirements could further reduce the number of  experienced controller specialists available to control traffic and increase  controller specialist hiring needs in order to replace the controllers moving  to supervisory positions. The overall impact of supervisor attrition is  unclear at this time. Until recently, FAA was in the process of reducing the  controller-to-supervisor ratio from 7-to-1 to 10-to-1, through attrition, as  agreed to in the 1998 NATCA collective bargaining agreement. This strategy  would help mitigate the flow of NATCA bargaining unit controllers into the  supervisory ranks.

This condition is  widespread across the various air traffic control facilities at the FAA, and  the potential for massive turnover exists even at FAA\u2019s most complex and  busiest facilities. To effectively deal with expected attrition, government  agencies must identify human capital needs, assess how current staff and  expected future staff will meet those needs, and create strategies to  address any shortfalls or imbalances. As we have reported, a high- performing organization typically addresses its current and future  workforce needs by estimating the following: the number of employees it  will need; the knowledge, skills, and abilities those employees will have in  order for the organization to accomplish its goals; and the areas where  employees should be deployed across the organization. We have  developed a model that identifies strategic workforce planning as a critical  success factor in effectively managing a human capital program, because  such planning can help agencies ensure that they have adequate staff to  accomplish their missions.", "Although FAA will be faced with unprecedented numbers of retirements of  its air traffic controllers, it has not yet developed a comprehensive  workforce plan to address this issue and therefore risks having a shortage  of qualified controllers. Good workforce planning includes developing  strategies for integrating hiring, recruiting, training, and other human  capital activities in a manner that meets the agency\u2019s long-term objectives.  FAA generally hires new controllers only when current, experienced  controllers leave, and it does not adequately take into account the time  necessary to fully train these replacements. Furthermore, although FAA  intends to increasingly hire individuals with no prior controller experience,  its new aptitude test for potential candidates may not be as effective in  screening them as initially planned. In addition, FAA has not provided its  training academy with the resources necessary to handle the expected  large increase in controller candidates. Finally, exemptions to the  mandatory age 56-separation provision raise equity and safety issues. FAA  therefore might face a shortage of experienced controllers, leading to an  increase in overtime logged by its remaining controllers. Increased flight  delays might also result from this situation, as fewer controllers might not  be able to safely guide the same number of flights that would be possible  with a fully staffed controller workforce."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FAA\u2019s Hiring Process Does Not Adequately Ensure that Qualified Controllers Will Be Available When Necessary", "paragraphs": ["A key component of workforce planning is ensuring that appropriately  skilled employees are available when and where they are needed to meet  an agency\u2019s mission. This means, in part, that an agency continually needs  trained employees becoming available to fill newly opened positions. FAA\u2019s  current hiring process does not adequately ensure that qualified  replacements are available to expeditiously assume the responsibilities of  those who retire. The main objective of FAA\u2019s branch manager for resource  management is to ensure that controller-staffing levels meet the levels  called for in FAA\u2019s contract with the controller\u2019s union (NATCA). To do this,  he estimates how many controller specialists will leave during the year and  allocates this number among regions as a target-hiring figure. On at least a  quarterly basis, he informs the officials in the regions how many controller  candidates they are allowed to hire for that period. If attrition is lower than  expected during that period, he may tell them to delay hiring until a later  quarter. For example, in fiscal year 2001, the plan called for hiring 425  controller candidates but, because of lower-than-expected attrition levels,  FAA hired only 358 new controllers. According to this official, FAA does  not have budgetary resources to maintain and develop an employee  pipeline to ensure that fully certified replacements are available, so it has  no plans to change these hiring practices.", "FAA\u2019s approach of hiring new employees only when current employees  leave does not adequately account for the time needed to train controllers  to fully perform their functions, or for the increased retirements that are  projected in the short and long terms. The amount of time it takes new  controllers to gain certification depends on the facilities at which they will  work, but it generally takes from 2 to 4 years and can take up to 5 years at  some of the busiest and most complex facilities.", "The branch manager\u2019s May 2001 hiring plan identifies a \u201chiring lead time  adjustment\u201d starting in fiscal year 2004 that provides for additional hiring in  recognition of the time necessary to train employees. The numbers  included, however, do not appear adequate to account for the large  potential increases in controller attrition. For example, in fiscal year 2004,  the adjustment is for hiring 70 extra candidates, which would respond to a  potential attrition of about 700 to 1,100 controllers in 2006, when these new  hires might be ready for certification at some facilities. In addition, the  branch manager told us that budget constraints play a key role in  determining the timing of hiring new candidates. For example, he said that  budget requests are tied to the NATCA contract amounts and that FAA had  no plans to request the additional funding necessary to go above those  levels. FAA officials also stressed that staffing management is now a  partnership between FAA and NATCA, and that this also creates  constraints on FAA\u2019s ability to hire and place new controllers at specific  facilities.", "FAA regional officials, who are responsible for ensuring that FAA\u2019s air  traffic facilities are adequately staffed, are particularly concerned about  FAA\u2019s replacement-hiring policy. Eight of nine regional officials with whom  we spoke stated that they would like for FAA to allow them to hire new  controller staff above their authorized levels so that experienced, fully  qualified controllers will be ready when current controllers retire. The  officials were particularly concerned that significant increases in  retirement rates among veteran controllers would leave the facilities short  of qualified controllers while new trainees are hired and trained. Several  regions stated that they had made formal and informal requests to FAA  headquarters to obtain additional controllers who could be hired and  trained in advance of future retirements. In May 2001, for example, officials  from FAA\u2019s Southwest Region formally requested 48 additional staff  members to mitigate the impact of future retirements. The region asked for  new hires at one of its en route centers to \u201censure that quality customer  service is maintained, budgetary concerns are addressed, and controller  attrition is dealt with.\u201d In April 2002, FAA headquarters informed the region  that their request was denied because of operational constraints imposed  by the 1998 agreement with the controllers\u2019 union and because of the  current fiscal year\u2019s budgetary constraints. Furthermore, numerous FAA  regional officials told us that they were frustrated by their agency\u2019s  insistence on staffing as close to the numbers called for in the NATCA  contract as possible.", "A lack of experienced controllers could have many adverse consequences,  according to several FAA regional officials. Several regional officials stated  that if a facility becomes seriously short of experienced controllers, the  remaining controllers might have to slow down the flow of air traffic  through their airspace. If the situation became dire, FAA could require  airlines to reduce their schedules, but this would be an unlikely, worst-case  scenario, according to some FAA regional officials. Also, because there  would be fewer experienced controllers available to work, some FAA  facility officials stated that those controllers could see increased  workloads and additional, potentially mandatory, overtime. Some facility  managers told us that they expected this increased burden to result in  additional work-related stress for the remaining controllers, which would  increase sick leave usage. It could also cause experienced controllers to  retire sooner than they otherwise might.

As  discussed in chapter 1, FAA historically has hired its new controllers from a  variety of sources, including graduates of institutions in FAA\u2019s collegiate  training initiative program, the Minneapolis Community and Technical  College, candidates already on a list maintained by OPM, controllers  formerly employed by FAA who were fired by President Reagan in 1981,  and former DOD controllers. Table 5 shows the sources and number of new  controllers that FAA hired between fiscal years 1997 and 2001.", "DOD officials were concerned that increasing retirements of FAA\u2019s  controllers over the next 5 years will cause greater operational problems,  and possibly affect defense readiness, if potentially thousands of DOD  controllers were to fill openings at FAA. DOD has lost many controllers to  FAA\u2014about 35 percent of FAA\u2019s hires in the past 5 years. FAA\u2019s regional  officials told us that they like to hire former military controllers because of  their experience, maturity, and work ethic. DOD officials with whom we  spoke explained that these losses had resulted in cutbacks for fighter  training missions by at least one of the armed services and in the  implementation of significant retention bonuses to military controllers.    Although DOD employs both civilian and uniformed military controllers,  there remains a pay disparity between DOD and FAA. These officials  believe that the higher pay offered by FAA explains why DOD military and  civilian controllers apply for FAA controller jobs. For example, in fiscal  year 2001, the maximum base salary levels for DOD controllers were  $48,730 for a DOD military controller and $74,553 for a DOD civilian  controller, while FAA controllers could earn up to $128,386. DOD officials  stated that both agencies (FAA and DOD) must meet their recruiting and  retention goals to support national security and defense requirements. To  that end, DOD officials said that the focus needs to be on the requirement  for air traffic controllers as a whole and not on two competing systems.", "Along these lines, FAA headquarters officials said that because FAA hopes  to achieve a more diverse workforce, it expects to concentrate increasingly  on hiring off-the-street candidates. The success of the off-the-street hiring  depends in large part on identifying potential candidates who have an  appropriate aptitude for controllers\u2019 work. Traditionally, FAA used the  academy\u2019s initial entry-training program to screen out candidates who  could not become successful controllers. According to FAA officials, as  many as 50 percent of off-the-street applicants have dropped out before  finishing the required training program. These officials estimated that  about $10 million per year was spent on training candidates who later failed  the program. FAA therefore developed a new screening exam, known as  AT-SAT, to better ensure that the new hires have the skills and abilities to  succeed on the job. FAA plans to require that candidates without prior  experience pass the 8-hour AT-SAT exam before they begin training at its  academy. According to academy officials, the academy is planning to rely  on AT-SAT as a way to screen out candidates unlikely to pass the academy\u2019s  training, and it has therefore revised its training program to emphasize  teaching skill-sets rather than serving as a screening program.", "Uncertainty exists regarding the exam\u2019s ability to screen out unsuccessful  candidates and help ensure that new candidates have the aptitude to  become successful controllers. For example, FAA has recently changed the  exam to allow more candidates to pass, which creates some uncertainty  about its ability to identify successful candidates. During initial validation  of AT-SAT, FAA found that the test should predict, with a high level of  validity, that those who passed it would become successful controllers.  However, FAA found that only about 28 percent of non-FAA test subjects  and about 62 percent of active controllers could pass the test. In addition,  they found that passing rates for some applicant groups, including  particularly African-Americans and females, might be significantly lower  than the overall passing rates. Therefore, FAA concluded that the passing  score on the test was set higher than the typical controller\u2019s job  expectations. As a result, the developers of the exam changed the weight  given to different portions of the exam and adjusted the passing score to tie  the test more accurately to the actual job performance of controllers.  According to FAA, this will result in more applicants passing the exam (68  percent are now expected to pass).", "FAA plans to begin using the test in June 2002. Although FAA has not  revalidated the effectiveness of the revised exam, FAA officials stated that  they have long planned to perform an operational evaluation of the exam to  assess how well the exam works in practice, and that they are currently  considering two options for performing this evaluation. First, FAA could  correlate candidates\u2019 scores on the exam with how well they perform on a  computer simulation of actual air traffic. In order to implement this option,  FAA would have to develop a new computer-based performance measure  for the terminal environment. Officials indicated that this would cost  several hundred thousand dollars. The second option would be to validate  the exam against initial training at the academy, field training, and job  performance. This would require FAA to develop criteria for measuring  success in each of these three areas. In any case, to evaluate the exam, the  officials need to decide on an option, develop a detailed implementation  plan, and identify funding for this purpose. Officials could not provide an  estimate as to when they will decide on a specific option.

Most controller candidates undergo both 15 weeks of classroom  exercises at FAA\u2019s academy in Oklahoma City and on-the-job training at the  facility where employees are assigned. As of March 2002, the academy was  staffed with 91 FAA employees and 60 contractors. This number of  employees and contractors has been used to train, on average, about 200  new hires for each of the past 5 years. The academy\u2019s training plan  anticipates that between 547 and 980 controller candidates might need  training each year through fiscal year 2005. To meet the projected levels,  these officials believe they will need up to 50 additional staff to provide  training.", "The training academy may have difficulty recruiting current controllers to  conduct portions of their training program. Academy officials told us that  their recent attempts to persuade experienced controllers to volunteer to  train new recruits have not been very successful. Academy officials  explained that the 1998 pay raise, which in some cases increased salaries  for controllers by more than 30 percent but applied only to periods when  the controllers were actually guiding air traffic, has affected the  controllers\u2019 willingness to participate. Whereas a controller was once paid  the same amount for providing training as for controlling traffic, under the  new system a controller would lose pay by becoming a trainer at the  academy. Academy officials said they recently put an announcement out  asking for volunteers to conduct training and received 31 applications.  They noted that before the pay raise they were receiving hundreds of  applications for these positions, which provided them a greater  opportunity to select from a broader pool.", "Equipment deficiencies also hamper the academy. For example, the  academy is training en-route controllers on equipment that is not used at  actual en-route centers, so controllers must retrain on different equipment  once they reach their facilities. To efficiently train en-route and terminal  controllers, academy officials told us that they need a specialized en-route  simulator lab known as a Display System Replacement lab, which costs  between $7 million to $45 million, depending on the sophistication of the  model purchased. Academy officials have been trying to obtain this  equipment for several years, and the academy has recently made another  proposal regarding this equipment. FAA headquarters is expected to decide  whether to purchase this lab in the near future. In addition, the academy  uses tower simulators to give trainees experience with controlling traffic in  a computer-simulated environment. However, academy officials said their  current simulators are often broken, outdated, and lacking in the necessary  capacity to train large numbers of new hires. The cost of the new  equipment is estimated at $2 million. If FAA does not make these  investments, academy officials said, controller candidates will need more  training time when they reach their facilities.", "New controllers might also have difficulty obtaining on-the-job training,  FAA regional officials stated. New controllers are to receive their facility  training from fully certified controllers already working in that facility.  Under FAA\u2019s current hiring system and estimated attrition rates, however,  there will be fewer experienced controllers to provide training and more  new hires in need of training. More time will thus likely be needed to train  new controllers. This situation could be particularly acute at FAA\u2019s en-route  centers and busy terminal facilities, because it takes longer to train  replacement controllers at these facilities.

As described in  chapter 1, legislation passed in 1972 stipulates that air traffic controllers  must separate at age 56. Some controllers are exempt from the retirement  rule, however, and continue to work beyond age 56. This practice raises  two concerns: (1) whether the skills and abilities of the older controllers  have diminished, thus potentially compromising safety; and (2) whether the  exemptions result in unequal treatment for some controllers.", "In 1972, Congress directed that \u201can air traffic controller shall be separated  from the service on the last day of the month in which he becomes 56 years  of age.\u201d The House Report associated with this law justifies the provision  by stating that \u201cair traffic control is a young man\u2019s business\u2026and that  because of the natural forces of aging, magnified by the stresses of control  functions, the productive and proficient life of the controller is  substantially less than that which prevails in most other occupations.\u201d In  addition, the report states, \u201cthe controllers themselves are convinced that  the demands of their job are so great that only young, healthy adults can  consistently do a safe, competent job of controlling the steadily growing  volume of air traffic.\u201d The House Report further states that \u201cas the  controller approaches age 50 his mental faculties of alertness, rapid  decision making, and instantaneous reaction\u2026begin a definite decline.\u201d In  addition, the associated Senate Report states, \u201clike skilled athletes, most  controllers lose proficiency to some degree after age 40, and in the interest  of the public\u2019s safety, should not be retained as controllers in busy facilities  beyond the time they can perform satisfactorily.\u201d", "The law\u2019s provision requires mandatory separation at age 56 for controllers  who separate and control air traffic; provide preflight, in-flight, or airport  advisory service to aircraft operators; or serve as the immediate  supervisors of any employee who performs these duties. These positions  include controller specialists and their first-line supervisors as well as  traffic management coordinators and their first-line supervisors.", "Some controllers who separate and control traffic are exempted from this  provision, however, including controllers appointed by the Department of  Transportation (DOT) before May 16, 1972, and controllers appointed by  DOD before September 12, 1980. In addition, those controllers covered by  the FERS retirement system can continue working past age 56 until they  have reached 20 years of service in a covered position (so called good time  under the special air traffic controller retirement provisions). Similarly, on  November 12, 2001, the president signed a law allowing controllers covered  by the CSRS retirement system to work in covered positions past age 56  until they first become eligible for retirement annuities under any retirement scenario. Our analyses of FAA\u2019s employee database shows that  approximately 700 of those controllers currently engaged in separation and  control of traffic are exempt from the requirement and have already turned  age 56, and another 1,200 will reach 56 by December 31, 2006, if they do not  leave FAA before then. According to FAA, 287 controllers were appointed  by DOT before May 16, 1972, and are exempt from the requirement. Most of  the remaining exempted controllers were either appointed by DOD before  September 12, 1980, or are covered by FERS provisions.", "FAA also has the statutory authority to waive the age provision on a case- by-case basis.

Further, since 1995, it has been FAA\u2019s policy not to grant any age  waivers. This official also stated that most controllers are aware of the  difficulty in obtaining an age waiver and do not even apply for one\u2014only  seven controllers have applied for a waiver since 1995. Despite this view,  many controllers said they would like the opportunity to work past the age  of 56. Our survey indicates that many controllers would continue to work if  they were permitted to do so; approximately 31 percent of respondents  cited the opportunity to work past age 56 as a factor that could lead them  to delay their retirement plans. In addition, regional FAA officials said they  would like to have the flexibility to retain some of these experienced  controllers.", "As mentioned above, safety concerns formed the basis of the age-56  separation provision. Only limited actions have been taken, however, to  assess whether those controllers who are exempted from the provision  have adequately retained the skills and abilities necessary to perform their  duties. FAA requires all controllers to pass annual physical examinations  that test sight, hearing, and overall health conditions. No additional tests\u2014 such as for mental acuity or changes in reaction time\u2014are given to  controllers who surpass age 56.", "The equity issues associated with the exemptions to the age-56 separation  rule could become more prominent in the future if FAA continues to rehire  controllers fired during the 1981 strike. In 1993 President Clinton, through  presidential directive, lifted the ban on hiring former striking employees. In  the past 5 years, FAA has rehired about 850 controllers who were fired in  1981. The average age of the 733 still working as of June 30, 2001, was 54,  and about 35 percent were aged 56 or older. The oldest was 69 as of June  30, 2001. In addition, FAA officials said that most of the rehires are exempt  from the mandatory separation provisions because they were originally  hired before May 16, 1972.

To the extent that controllers leave at a  slower pace than estimated, FAA will have a larger window of opportunity  to replenish its workforce. Ultimately, FAA\u2019s ability to successfully plan for  and manage this situation will dictate its overall impact on the nation\u2019s air  traffic control system and the safety and efficiency of air travel in the  United States.", "The employees whom FAA will need to replace possess unique skills and  are critical to the safety and efficiency of the nation\u2019s air transportation  system.

An effective human capital process anticipates expected attrition  and includes the development of a comprehensive workforce plan that (1)  establishes an effective approach for hiring individuals with the requisite  skills and abilities in time to accomplish agency missions, (2) provides new  employees with the best training opportunities possible to maximize their  potential, and (3) uses opportunities to retain qualified staff.", "FAA\u2019s approach to workforce planning does not adequately address these  strategies, raising the risk that the safety and efficiency of the nation\u2019s air  transportation system will be adversely affected. In addition, if FAA does  not take steps to develop and implement a more comprehensive workforce  strategy, increased traffic delays and overtime costs could result. FAA\u2019s  practice of hiring replacements for controllers only after a position is  vacated leaves the agency vulnerable to skills imbalances, with  inexperienced and uncertified controllers replacing seasoned veterans.  This situation may be exacerbated at individual air traffic control facilities  because the age and experience of controllers varies across the system,  which could cause some locations to experience additional staffing  challenges. Also of concern are the effects of the recent scoring changes  that were made to the test used to screen potential candidates. Until the  screening test results are examined, the ability of the exam to identify  candidates who will make successful controllers will not be known.  Further, the quality of the training that controllers receive could be  compromised because FAA has not addressed the human resources and  equipment needs of its training academy, despite the growing projected  student population.

FAA officials agreed that the potential for sizable future  attrition, in the range of 600\u2013800 controllers per year, is likely over the next  decade. The officials said, however, that although they have plans that  extend to 2010, the uncertainty surrounding the future, along with labor  contracts and budget constraints, limit their specific workforce planning  for air traffic controllers to fiscal years 2002 through 2004. With general  agreement between FAA and GAO that attrition will grow substantially  over the next decade, we believe that the workforce challenges FAA faces  extend well beyond fiscal year 2004. As such, we believe that sound  workforce planning demands that FAA develop a strategic vision that  includes a workable, long-term plan to meet staffing needs.", "Regarding our concern about FAA\u2019s preparedness for the future, the FAA  officials remarked that FAA\u2019s ability to meet its past goals is an indication of  its ability to meet future needs, and that there is nothing to indicate that its  successful performance will not continue in the future. We recognize that  FAA has been able to meet its recent staffing goals. However, the recent  workforce climate for FAA could be significantly different from that which  it will face over the next decade.

In particular, the report points out the  potential skills gap that FAA could face in the future because its current  hiring process does not ensure that fully qualified controllers are available  to replace experienced controllers when they leave.", "The officials also commented that FAA has long planned for an operational  evaluation of the new screening exam, and that research associated with  this evaluation has been underway for some time. The officials indicated  that they are considering two options for evaluating the effectiveness of the  exam.   The officials commented, however, that limited work has been done  on the evaluation process since 1998, and that they must determine which  option to pursue, develop a detailed implementation plan, and identify  funding for the evaluation. The officials further noted that continued  funding for the ongoing research could not be assured. In response to this  comment, we revised the text of the report to recognize FAA\u2019s efforts and  plans regarding evaluation of the new screening exam. As such, we are  encouraged that FAA plans to conduct an operational evaluation of the  exam, once it has been implemented. However, we remain concerned that  FAA has not decided how it will conduct the evaluation or how it will fund  it and has already highlighted potential funding issues that could serve as a  constraint to performing the planned evaluation. Further, we believe that  an evaluation of the revised exam is an integral part of a comprehensive  workforce plan and have modified the recommendation to emphasize this  belief.", "Finally, the FAA officials provided technical comments that we  incorporated, as appropriate. For example, we added information in this  chapter to highlight the constraints that FAA\u2019s labor contract and budget  impose on the timing of hiring controllers."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
