To assist USO, Congress, beginning in fiscal year 2000, provided a total of $23.8 million in grants to be awarded through DOD as seed money for an endowment fund. The availability of these funds to USO, along with DOD's ongoing support funded in its regular annual appropriations, represents a substantial financial commitment. GAO determined (1) the source and amount of DOD's support to USO in fiscal years 2000-2002 and (2) the sufficiency of internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that federal funds are used in an appropriate manner. GAO focused its audit on USO World Headquarters' activities and audited a limited selection of USO transactions for the 3 fiscal years."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal years 2000 through 2002, DOD provided USO with substantial appropriated and nonappropriated support, but the total amount cannot be determined because of limitations in DOD's and USO's record-keeping systems. GAO identified at least $34.7 million in appropriated funds that DOD provided to support USO during fiscal years 2000 through 2002. Of this amount, $20.8 million was in congressionally appropriated grants to help USO establish the Spirit of Hope Endowment Fund to ensure the continuation of USO's programs and services. Another $12.1 million was for reimbursements to USO, and at least $1.8 million was paid directly by DOD for tour-related expenses such as commercial airfares, visas, and passports. DOD also provided other appropriated support, such as lodging and transportation. However, GAO could not determine the total monetary value of DOD's support from appropriated funds because neither DOD nor USO has record-keeping systems that aggregate the needed information. DOD also provides USO with nonappropriated support, largely in the form of in-kind goods (e.g., food), services (e.g., Internet access), and infrastructure support (e.g., performance facilities), to help sustain USO's overseas tours, but the same limitations precluded GAO from determining the total monetary value. DOD and USO did not have sufficient financial and management controls to reasonably ensure that all appropriated funds were used appropriately. DOD properly awarded grant funds to USO, and USO properly administered these funds. However, USO did not require its independent auditor to fully test internal controls over grants or funds reimbursed to USO by DOD, as required by its agreements with DOD. In terms of reimbursements to USO and direct payments by DOD, DOD lacked clearly written supplemental guidance regarding allowable expenses, management oversight in reviewing USO's invoices, and procedures for capturing reimbursable expenses. In some cases, these weaknesses resulted in inappropriate expenditures of funds. Based on limited testing, GAO found problems with payments totaling about $433,000, including about $86,000 in improper expenditures, $3,000 in questionable expenditures, and $344,000 for unsupported expenditures. Had USO's independent auditor tested internal controls, the problems GAO identified might have surfaced. As a result of GAO's audit, DOD stated it has initiated several actions to improve financial and management controls and to recover funds from USO. As of September 2003, DOD had recovered about $19,000 from USO in improper payments for overseas tour expenses."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For more than 60 years, the United Services Organizations (USO), a  not-for-profit, nongovernmental but congressionally chartered  organization, has offered support and entertainment to the men and  women of America\u2019s armed forces and their families.

For example,  AFEO explained that meal expenses for celebrities receiving honorarium  are not reimbursable because the honorarium is intended to help defray  the cost of meals and other essentials, and the invitational travel orders we  reviewed specifically stated that meal expenses were not authorized.  Expenses for alcoholic beverages are never allowable in conjunction with  government travel.

In calendar year 2002,  AFEO paid USO twice for administrative expenses associated with  overseas tours. We identified improper payments totaling about $9,000. A  USO contract employee, responsible for preparing the expense reports for  overseas tours, included invoices for these services in several of the tour  files we audited. According to the contract employee, USO officials  directed that the invoices be submitted to AFEO for payment. The Air  Force contracting officials responsible for managing the contract stated  that in accordance with the terms of the contract between AFEO and USO,  USO is paid a monthly administrative fee that covers numerous  administrative tasks, including preparing the expense reports for USO  tours. Contracting officials stated that the monthly administrative fee  included the cost for all accounting services, including those performed by  the contractor. Neither AFEO nor USO could provide an estimate of how  long the double billings occurred. However, one USO official believed that  the contract employee started to submit the invoices with the inception of  the contract in 1999 and ended with the termination of the contractor\u2019s  services in May 2003. Based on our review of documentation provided by  USO for calendar years 2001 and 2002, the amount billed could have  totaled $78,000.

If first-class  travel is requested, USO is supposed to pay for the cost of the upgrade  from business-class to first-class. However, contrary to the stated policy  and statements made by AFEO officials, this was not always the case. In  each case, we found AFEO purchased and paid for either the unauthorized  first-class or business-class ticket.

USO  officials stated they would have reimbursed AFEO for the cost of the  upgrade from business-class to first-class if AFEO had notified them or if  they were provided documentation of the first-class charges. AFEO  officials acknowledged that closer scrutiny of the documentation received  from USO should have identified those instances in which first-class and  business-class airline tickets were improperly paid by AFEO. Additionally,  AFEO noted that the monthly reconciliation of the centrally billed account  statement to the individual airline ticket transactions should have  identified the discrepancies we found. Our review of the monthly  reconciliations showed that first-class travel was clearly identified, but  AFEO failed to seek reimbursement from USO.

Our audit of the documentation indicated that this  practice was inconsistently applied. In one instance, we found that AFEO  disallowed a thank you dinner for one tour, but it paid for several meals  that were classified as thank you dinners for another tour. Additionally,  the documentation was not always adequate to identify whether these  expenses were for meals for celebrities or for other individuals on the  tour. For example, we found that tour managers and a USO tour  producer\u2019s meals were reimbursed over a number of days.

In  some cases, individuals who were part of a celebrity\u2019s entourage were  classified as celebrities and received honoraria while others were not.  AFEO agreed that it was not always possible to identify which names  listed on invitational travel orders received honoraria. In one instance,  honoraria and production support costs were charged for 13 individuals,  but the supporting documentation indicated that only 12 individuals  participated in the tour. An AFEO official stated that the individual\u2019s  itinerary must have changed and acknowledged that this should have been  documented in the file.

USO\u2019s overseas entertainment tours have provided quality  entertainment to the troops, and DOD\u2019s financial and in-kind support has  been key to the Armed Forces Professional Entertainment Program\u2019s  continued success. When a nongovernmental organization, such as USO,  receives federal funds to assist a government organization, such as DOD,  that organization is accountable for the proper use of the funds. A key  factor in helping achieve that accountability is to implement appropriate  internal controls. However, our audit found that DOD\u2019s program lacks  effective financial and management controls to provide reasonable  assurance that federal funds are used consistent with the terms specified  in grant and contract agreements. Neither AFEO nor USO can determine  the total amount of financial or in-kind support DOD provides to sustain  USO\u2019s overseas tours. Furthermore, without adequate supplemental  guidance to identify allowable costs for overseas tours and effective  management oversight, AFEO does not have reasonable assurance that it  is paying for only allowable costs and that appropriated funds are being  spent in accordance with federal laws and regulations. Moreover, USO\u2019s  failure to fully comply with audit requirements in grant and contract  agreements reduces DOD\u2019s assurance that USO has adequate internal  controls over federal program funds, leaving the program vulnerable to  fraud, waste, and abuse. Had USO\u2019s independent auditor fully tested  internal controls, the problems we identified might have surfaced. AFEO  officials stated they have taken action to improve management oversight  during the review of invoice packages and to develop written policies and  procedures consistent with DOD and federal travel regulations.
