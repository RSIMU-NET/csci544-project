It significantly increased resources in South Asia and the Near East and launched new initiatives targeting broader, younger audiences--particularly in predominantly Muslim countries. Also since September 11, the BBG has initiated several new programs focused on attracting larger audiences in priority markets, including Radio Sawa and Arabic language television in the Middle East, the Afghanistan Radio Network, and Radio Farda in Iran. State and BBG have increased their efforts to support the war on terrorism. However, State does not have a strategy that integrates all of its diverse public diplomacy activities and directs them toward common objectives. In addition, we found that while the BBG did have a strategic plan, the plan lacked a long-term strategic goal or related program objective to gauge the Board's success in increasing audience size, the key focus of its plan. Furthermore, there is no interagency strategy to guide State's, BBG's, and all federal agencies' communication efforts and thus ensure consistent messages to overseas audiences. In addition to strategy deficiencies, we found that State and the BBG were not systematically and comprehensively measuring progress toward the goals of reaching broader audiences and increasing publics' understanding about the United States. In addition to weaknesses in planning and performance measurement, State and BBG face several internal challenges in carrying out their programs. Challenges at State include insufficient public diplomacy resources and a lack of officers with foreign language proficiency. The BBG also faces a number of media market, organizational, and resource challenges that may hamper its efforts to generate large audiences in priority markets."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss issues surrounding U.S. public  diplomacy, particularly in the Middle East.

As part of our work, we surveyed  top officials of public affairs sections at U.S. embassies worldwide on such  issues as guidance from various State Department offices; sufficiency of  budgetary, staff, and other resources; and ability to adequately measure  performance. We met with cognizant State officials, individual members  of the BBG, and senior members of each broadcast entity to discuss  management issues. We also met with academics specializing in public  diplomacy and international affairs issues, and private sector officials from  U.S. public relations and opinion research firms with international  operations.

Public diplomacy is carried out through a  wide range of programs that employ person-to-person contacts; print,  broadcast, and electronic media; and other means. Traditionally, U.S.  public diplomacy focused on foreign elites\u2014current and future overseas  opinion leaders, agenda-setters, and decision makers. However, the  dramatic growth in global mass communications and other trends have  forced a rethinking of this approach, and State has begun to consider  techniques for communicating with broader foreign audiences. The BBG,  as the overseer of U.S. international broadcasting efforts, supports U.S.  public diplomacy\u2019s key objectives by broadcasting fair and accurate  information about the United States, while maintaining its journalistic  independence as a news organization. The BBG manages and oversees the  Voice of America (VOA), WorldNet Television, Radio/TV Marti, Radio Free  Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Sawa, Radio Farda, the Afghanistan Radio  Network, and Radio Free Asia. Radio Sawa and Radio Farda (Iran) provide  regional and local news to countries in the Middle East.", "Together, State and the BBG spend in excess of $1 billion on public  diplomacy programs each year. State\u2019s public diplomacy budget totaled an  estimated $628 million in fiscal year 2004. About 51 percent, or $320  million, is slated for the Fulbright and other educational and cultural  exchange programs. The remainder covers mostly salaries and expenses  incurred by State and embassy officers engaged in information  dissemination, media relations, cultural affairs, speaker programs,  publications, and other activities. BBG\u2019s budget for fiscal year 2004 is $546  million. This includes more than $42 million for radio and television  broadcasting to the Middle East. Since initiating the language service  review process in 1999, the Board has reduced the scope of operations of  more than 25 language services and reallocated about $19.7 million in  funds, with the majority redirected toward Central Asia and the Middle  East, including $8 million for Radio Farda service to Iran.

Public  diplomacy funding increased in South Asia from $24 million to $39 million  and in the Near East from $39 million to $62 million, or by 63 and 58  percent, respectively, from fiscal year 2001 through 2003.

In 2003, State has continued to emphasize  exchanges with Muslim countries through its Partnership for Learning  Program\u2014designed to target young and diverse audiences through  academic and professional exchanges such as the Fulbright, International  Visitor, and Citizen Exchange programs. According to State, under this  program, 170 high school students from predominantly Islamic countries  have already arrived and are living with American families and studying at  local high schools. State has also carried out increased exchanges through  its Middle East Partnership Initiative, which includes computer and  English language training for women newly employed by the Afghan  government and a program to assist women from Arab countries and  elsewhere in observing and discussing the U.S. electoral process. In  addition, State is expanding its American Corners program, which uses  space in public libraries and other public buildings abroad to provide  information about the United States.

In  fiscal year 2005, State plans to open 10 in Afghanistan and 15 in Iraq.", "State\u2019s Office of International Information Programs has also developed  new initiatives to support the war on terrorism, including a print and  electronic pamphlet titled The Network of Terrorism, distributed in 36  languages via hard copy, the Web, and media throughout the world, which  documented the direct link between the September 11 perpetrators and al  Qaeda; and a publication titled Iraq: From Fear to Freedom to inform  foreign audiences of the administration\u2019s policies toward Iraq."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New BBG Initiatives Target Large Audiences in Priority Markets", "paragraphs": ["Several of the BBG\u2019s new initiatives focus on reaching large audiences in  priority markets and supporting the war on terrorism. The first of these  programs, Radio Sawa in the Middle East, was launched in March 2002  using modern, market-tested broadcasting techniques and practices, such  as the extensive use of music formats. Radio Sawa replaced the poorly  performing VOA Arabic service, which had listening rates at around 2  percent of the population. According to BBG survey research, Radio Sawa  is reaching 51 percent of its target audience and is ranked highest for news  and news trustworthiness in Amman, Jordan. Despite such results, it  remains unclear how many people Radio Sawa is actually reaching  throughout the entire Middle East because audience research has been  performed only in select markets. Further, the State Inspector General and  the Advisory Group on Public Diplomacy for the Arab and Muslim World  have raised questions about whether Radio Sawa has focused more on  audience size and composition than on potential impact on attitudes in the  region. The BBG has also launched the Afghanistan Radio Network and a  language service to Iran called Radio Farda.

State officials told us that such a strategy is  particularly important because State\u2019s public diplomacy operation is  fragmented among the various organizational entities within the agency.  Public affairs officers who responded to our survey indicated that the lack  of a strategy has hindered their ability to effectively execute public  diplomacy efforts overseas. More than 66 percent of public affairs officers  in one region reported that the quality of strategic guidance from the  Office of the Undersecretary in the last year and a half (October 2001  through March 2003) was generally insufficient or very insufficient. More  than 40 percent in another region reported the same. We encountered  similar complaints during our overseas fieldwork. For example, in  Morocco, the former public affairs officer stated that so little information  had been provided from Washington on State\u2019s post-September 11 public  diplomacy strategy that he had to rely on newspaper articles and  guesswork to formulate his in-country public diplomacy plans.", "In contrast to State\u2019s lack of strategy, BBG has introduced a market-based  approach to international broadcasting that aims to generate large  listening audiences in priority markets that the Board believes it must  reach to effectively meet its mission. Early implementation of this strategy  has focused on markets relevant to the war on terrorism, in particular the  Middle East. The Board\u2019s vision is to create a flexible, multimedia,  research-driven U.S. international broadcasting system that addresses the  many challenges we noted in our report, including that the Board is faces a  diverse organizational structure consisting of several broadcast entities  with differing missions, broadcast approaches, and constituencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interagency Public Diplomacy Strategy Has Not Been Established", "paragraphs": ["Mr. Chairman, we believe it is especially important to emphasize as of  February 4, 2004, no interagency public diplomacy strategy has been  implemented that lays out the messages and means for governmentwide  communication efforts to overseas audiences. The absence of an  interagency strategy complicates the task of conveying consistent  messages and thus achieving mutually reinforcing benefits. State officials  told us that, without such a strategy, the risk of making communication  mistakes that are damaging to U.S. public diplomacy efforts is high. They  also said that the lack of a strategy diminishes the efficiency and  effectiveness of governmentwide public diplomacy efforts.", "Our overseas fieldwork in Egypt and Morocco underlined the importance  of interagency coordination. Embassy officers there told us that only a  very small percentage of the population was aware of the magnitude of  U.S. assistance being provided to their countries.

Immediately after September 11, the White House, State  Department, Department of Defense, and other agencies coordinated  various public diplomacy efforts on a day-to-day basis, and the White  House established a number of interim coordination mechanisms. One  such mechanism was the joint operation of the Coalition Information  Centers in Washington, London, and Islamabad, set up during the early  stages of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan in 2001. The centers were  designed to provide a rapid response capability for correcting inaccurate  news stories, proactively dealing with news items likely to generate  negative responses overseas, and optimizing reporting of news favorable  to U.S. efforts.", "In January 2003, the President established a more permanent coordination  mechanism, the White House Office of Global Communications, which is  intended to coordinate strategic communications from the U.S.  government to overseas audiences.

Its overseas performance  measurement efforts focus on anecdotal evidence and program outputs,  rather than gauging progress toward changing foreign publics\u2019  understanding and attitudes about the United States. Some posts judge the  effectiveness of their public diplomacy efforts by simply counting the  number of public diplomacy activities that occur in their host country\u2014for  example, the number of speeches given by the ambassador or the number  of news articles placed in the host-country media.

About 79 percent of the  respondents to our survey reported that staffing at their missions was  insufficient to conduct systematic program evaluations and many officers  also reported that staffing at posts was insufficient to carry out the long- range monitoring required to adequately measure program effectiveness.  Even if sufficient staffing were available, State would still have difficulty  conducting long-range tracking of exchange participants because it lacks a  database with comprehensive information on its various exchange  program alumni. State had planned to begin building a new worldwide  alumni database with comprehensive data linking all of its various  exchange programs.
