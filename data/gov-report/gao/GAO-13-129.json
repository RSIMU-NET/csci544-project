These two offices manage numerous construction and cleanup projects that each cost less than $750 million and are called nonmajor projects. DOE requires its program offices to establish performance targets for the expected scope, cost, and completion date of each project before starting construction or cleanup. GAO has encouraged federal agencies to use strategic workforce planning to help them meet present and future mission requirements. Two key elements of workforce planning are to identify mission-critical occupations and skills and any current and future shortfalls in these areas. GAO was asked to examine the (1) extent to which EM and NNSA nonmajor projects have met their scope, cost, and completion date targets, (2) factors affecting EM's and NNSA's management of nonmajor projects, and (3) extent to which EM's workforce plans identify mission-critical occupations and skills and any current and future shortfalls in these areas. GAO reviewed DOE documents and project data, examined EM workforce plans, toured selected DOE facilities, and interviewed DOE officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Of the 71 nonmajor projects that the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Environmental Management (EM) and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) completed or had under way from fiscal years 2008 to 2012, 21 met or are expected to meet their performance targets for scope, cost, and completion date. These projects included a $22 million EM project to expand an existing waste disposal facility at the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee and a $199 million NNSA project to equip a radiological laboratory and office building at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Another 23 projects did not meet or were not expected to meet one or more of their three performance targets for scope, cost, and completion date. Among these, 13 projects met or are expected to meet two targets, including a $548 million NNSA project to shut down a nuclear reactor in Russia for nonproliferation purposes; 8 projects met or are expected to meet one target; 1 project did not meet any of its targets; and 1 project was cancelled. Of the remaining 27 projects, many had insufficiently documented performance targets for scope, cost, or completion date, which prevented GAO from determining whether they met their performance targets. EM and NNSA often did not follow DOE requirements for documenting these performance targets, making it more difficult for GAO and DOE to independently assess project performance.", "Several factors affected EM's and NNSA's management of their nonmajor projects that were completed or ongoing from fiscal years 2008 to 2012. These factors included the suitability of a project's acquisition strategy, contractor performance, and adherence to project management requirements. For example, EM officials managing an ongoing project to remediate soil and water at the Idaho National Laboratory used an acquisition strategy that tied incentives for the contractor to different performance milestones across the multiple subprojects within the contract, which will help the project meet its performance goals, according to EM officials. In contrast, NNSA encountered problems meeting its performance goals for a project to build an office building and radiological laboratory at the Los Alamos National Laboratory partly due to its acquisition strategy. According to NNSA project officials at the Los Alamos site office, the project team should have hired one contractor to design the project and solicited bids from other contractors to build the project rather than using the same contractor for both activities. The former strategy might have resulted in a more mature project design and more time to evaluate various contractors' qualifications to construct the project, according to the NNSA project officials.", "EM's workforce plans do not consistently identify mission-critical occupations and skills and current and future shortfalls in these areas for its federal workforce. In addition, many EM workforce plans indicate that EM may soon face shortfalls in a number of important areas, including project and contract management. EM officials said that they recognize these issues and have taken a number of steps to address them, including conducting a skills assessment to identify key occupational series to target for succession planning. However, the inconsistent terms used to describe mission-critical occupations and skills in EM's workforce plans make it difficult for GAO and DOE to understand EM's most critical needs regarding its workforce. GAO recommends that EM and NNSA clearly define, document, and track the scope, cost, and completion date targets for each of their nonmajor projects and that EM clearly identify critical occupations and skills in its workforce plans. EM and NNSA agreed with GAO's recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that EM and NNSA clearly define, document, and track the scope, cost, and completion date targets for each of their nonmajor projects and that EM clearly identify critical occupations and skills in its workforce plans.

As of February 2011, DOE\u2019s two largest program  offices\u2014the Office of Environmental Management (EM) and the National  Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)\u2014remained on our list of areas at  high risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement for contracting and  project management. Our recent reviews of these offices focused on  major system acquisitions (or major projects), which include construction  and environmental cleanup projects that each cost $750 million or more.", "However, these two offices also manage numerous projects that are  smaller, less expensive, and less technically complex, called nonmajor  projects, that each cost less than $750 million.", "EM and NNSA must manage their projects, including nonmajor projects,  in accordance with DOE\u2019s order on project management, Order 413.3.  The order defines DOE\u2019s project management principles and process,  which consist of a series of management reviews and approvals, called  \u201ccritical decisions,\u201d that are required to move a project forward from  project planning and design to implementation. One important step in this  process is the establishment and approval of a project\u2019s performance  baseline, which represents DOE\u2019s commitment to complete a project with  a specific scope of work at a certain cost and by a specific date. The  performance baseline consists of three interrelated targets\u2014scope, cost,  and completion date. A project\u2019s scope defines its technical goals and  includes targets for specific technical requirements that the project is to  deliver at completion. For example, for a construction project, the scope  defines in general terms what facilities and equipment will be purchased  or upgraded, as well as the project\u2019s minimum capability to perform the  desired function at completion. DOE program offices are to establish and  approve a project\u2019s performance baseline before work can start.", "In our 2011 high-risk update, we noted that one of the top 10 issues  facing DOE is having sufficient people and other resources to resolve its  contract and project management problems. Specifically, we reported that, according to the department\u2019s analysis, DOE lacks an adequate  number of federal contracting and project management personnel with  the appropriate skills (such as cost estimating, risk management, and  technical expertise) to plan, direct, and oversee the completion of a  project. To help ensure that federal agencies have the personnel with the  appropriate skills they need now and in the future, we and other  organizations have encouraged federal agencies to use strategic  workforce planning. In particular, in its Human Capital Assessment and  Accountability Framework, the Office of Personnel Management  specified, among its key elements of workforce planning, the need to  develop workforce plans that identify (1) \u201cmission-critical\u201d occupations  and skills that are essential to achieving an agency\u2019s strategic goals and  (2) current and future potential shortfalls in these areas. In April 2012, we  reported on issues related to NNSA\u2019s workforce planning efforts.  Specifically, we reported that NNSA and its site contractors face  shortages in qualified critically skilled candidates and an aging workforce.  NNSA and its site contractors told us that they are engaged in workforce  planning to avoid potential critical skill gaps, but NNSA did not expect to  complete NNSA-wide workforce plans until 2013.", "In this context, you asked us to look at DOE\u2019s management of nonmajor  projects. Our report objectives were to examine the (1) extent to which  EM and NNSA nonmajor projects that were completed or ongoing for  fiscal years 2008 to 2012 met their scope, cost, and completion date  targets; (2) factors affecting EM\u2019s and NNSA\u2019s management of nonmajor  projects during this period; and (3) extent to which EM\u2019s workforce plans  identify mission-critical occupations and skills, as well as any current and  future shortfalls in these areas.", "To determine the extent to which EM and NNSA nonmajor projects met  their scope, cost, and completion date targets, we reviewed project  performance information for 30 EM and 41 NNSA nonmajor projects that  were either completed or ongoing from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year  2011 and for which EM and NNSA had established performance targets.  We also collected performance information for ongoing projects for fiscal  year 2012. The total estimated cost of these 71 projects is approximately  $10.1 billion. We excluded (1) EM projects funded by the American  Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 because of a separate review  looking at these projects, (2) information technology projects, and (3)  operational activities. We relied on DOE Order 413.3 for requirements on  how scope, cost, and completion date targets are to be specified in a  project\u2019s performance baseline. In assessing whether projects had  achieved their scope, cost, and completion date targets, we followed  Office of Management and Budget guidance and DOE performance  metrics. Taken together, these sources state that a project achieves a  satisfactory performance if it completes its scope target at less than 10  percent above its cost target and at less than 10 percent past its  completion date target. To evaluate factors affecting EM\u2019s and NNSA\u2019s  management of nonmajor projects, we conducted structured interviews  with EM and NNSA project officials for a subset of the 71 projects: a  nonprobability sample of 10 EM projects and 10 NNSA projects that  included completed and ongoing projects, with a wide range of project  costs. While we cannot generalize from these interviews to all EM and  NNSA projects, we chose these projects to provide examples of factors  that affected EM\u2019s and NNSA\u2019s management of these projects. The  interviews focused on aspects of project management, such as the  preparation of project designs, risk assessments, and cost and schedule  baselines, as well as adherence to DOE project management  requirements. As part of these interviews, we conducted tours of two  DOE facilities near Oak Ridge, Tennessee. To evaluate the extent to  which EM\u2019s workforce plans identify mission-critical occupations and skills  and any current and future shortfalls in these areas, we examined EM\u2019s  strategic workforce plans for its headquarters and site office staff, DOE\u2019s  corrective action plan for contract and project management, and the  Office of Personnel Management\u2019s Human Capital Assessment and  Accountability Framework. We also interviewed DOE and EM officials  with knowledge of EM\u2019s practices in workforce planning, including officials  in EM\u2019s Office of Acquisition and Project Management and its Office of  Human Capital and Corporate Services (Office of Human Capital).

First, EM and NNSA did  not consistently follow DOE requirements for documenting scope targets  and tracking these targets using DOE\u2019s performance database. Second,  EM did not always establish credible completion date targets or conduct  required independent reviews when it restructured its PBSs in 2010.", "Establishing a clearly defined target for scope is critical for an agency to  accurately track and assess a project\u2019s overall performance. In particular,  a project\u2019s scope of work directly affects estimates of the project\u2019s cost  and completion date. If the scope target is too broad or vaguely stated, it  can be difficult to track whether or to what extent certain aspects of  project scope were reduced or eliminated between CD-2 (when the  baseline was established) and CD-4 (when the project was completed),  potentially affecting cost and completion date targets. Accordingly, since  2003, DOE Order 413.3 has required that information on scope targets be  documented in a project execution plan as part of CD-2. The current  order also requires a project\u2019s acquisition executive to sign a  memorandum approving CD-2 that contains this information. In addition,  the order requires that information on scope targets, as well as other  critical performance information, be entered into DOE\u2019s centralized  database on project performance\u2014the Project Assessment and  Reporting System (PARS).OAPM, is used to track and report on project performance.", "This database, which is administered by  However, EM and NNSA did not always follow the order\u2019s requirement on  documenting scope targets, and we encountered the following problems  when we attempted to identify scope targets for EM and NNSA projects:", "Key project documents associated with CD-2 and identified in Order  413.3\u2014project execution plans and CD-2 approval memorandums\u2014 often did not contain information on scope targets. Instead, we had to  obtain and review a variety of other project documents to try and  locate this information. For example, we obtained information on  scope targets for several EM and NNSA projects from briefing slides  (i.e., a PowerPoint presentation) prepared for a DOE advisory board  involved in reviewing and approving projects. We also used  independent project review reports, documents describing the  functional and operational requirements of the projects, and contractor  documents that provided detailed descriptions of a project\u2019s scope of  work, among other documents. (See app. I for more details on our  scope and methodology.)", "The additional project documents that EM and NNSA provided to  verify scope targets were often dated several months (or more) before  or after the approval of CD-2. Because these documents were often  not contemporaneous with the date when CD-2 was approved, we  had difficulty determining whether any scope targets had changed  during the interval. For example, we obtained information on scope  targets for two EM projects from a project execution plan that was  signed and dated almost 9 months after the CD-2 approval  memorandum had been signed. (If documents were not dated within  1 year of CD-2 approval, we did not consider them sufficient and  reliable for purposes of determining scope targets.)", "EM and NNSA often did not clearly or uniformly identify scope targets  in their documents, instead providing this information in a variety of  ways. For example, a NNSA project provided this information in  briefing slides for a project advisory board under the headings  \u201cprogrammatic requirements summary\u201d and \u201cphysical design  summary.\u201d In cases where we were unable to clearly identify scope  targets, we relied on EM and NNSA officials to identify the information  that they considered to represent scope targets.", "OAPM has encountered similar problems in trying to identify scope  targets for projects at CD-2 and track how well completed projects had  met these targets at CD-4. Specifically, OAPM officials told us that DOE  program offices may have documented a project\u2019s scope targets in a  variety of project documents, such as a project execution plan or an  acquisition strategy plan, rather than in an approval memorandum at CD- 2. As a result, OAPM officials said they occasionally must reconstruct a  project\u2019s scope targets from other contemporaneous planning documents  near the time of the CD-2 approval. In a few instances, they said that no  audit trail exists to compare scope targets established at CD-2 with the  scope targets cited in a project\u2019s CD-4 approval memorandum. In  addition, an OAPM official told us that OAPM has not completed the  process of locating and entering these data into PARS and continues to  work with EM and NNSA to reconstruct project scope targets near the  time of CD-2 approval.", "We found two problems with the performance baselines of many projects  that EM restructured from its portfolio of PBS activities in 2009 and 2010.  First, several projects did not have a credible completion date target. For  example, EM\u2019s April 2010 memorandum approving CD-2 for the Zone 1  Remedial Actions project, located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, gave a  target completion date of fiscal year 2017, which meant that the target  completion date was at the end of the fiscal year (September 30, 2017),  according to EM officials. However, EM approved the formal completion  of this project, via a CD-4 approval memorandum, on September 30,  2011\u20146 years ahead of the completion date target identified in the CD-2  approval memorandum. In explaining this difference, EM officials stated  that they had linked the target completion date for this project to the end  of the existing PBS near-term baseline, which had been established  before the restructuring process. According to EM officials, EM used this  method because it already had a contract in place to conduct work  activities associated with the PBS near-term baseline. Since the end of  the PBS near-term baseline was to coincide with the end of the contract  period, EM officials said that they did not think it would be appropriate to  change the target completion dates. In addition, EM officials told us that  they were more focused on finishing the scope of work for a given project  within a specific dollar amount, and that it was not worth the additional  expenditure of time and dollars to modify contracts to change the  completion date. EM used this same methodology in establishing target  completion dates for several other projects we examined.", "When we found that EM\u2019s practice of establishing target completion dates  did not provide a meaningful benchmark for assessing project  performance, we had to locate additional documentation to establish a  more credible completion date target. For example, for the Zone 1  Remedial Actions project, we reviewed additional documentation and  decided that a more credible completion date target was December 15,  2011. As a result, for this and other projects, the completion date targets  we used to evaluate the performance of some projects are different than  the ones that DOE uses in its PARS database.", "Second, EM often established a new performance baseline and approved  CD-2 for a project without having the baseline reviewed by an  independent team of experts, as DOE Order 413.3 requires. Among other  things, the review team is responsible for examining a project\u2019s cost and  completion date targets to ensure that they are credible and valid.  However, EM did not conduct such reviews when it restructured some of  the projects we examined. Instead, according to EM officials, EM relied  on independent reviews conducted in the 2007 to 2008 time frame as part  of the CD-2 approval process for PBS activities. In addition, EM officials  said that it was not worth the additional expenditure of time and dollars to  conduct new independent reviews for these projects.", "If EM had conducted new reviews as part of its restructuring process, it is  possible that these reviews would have uncovered problems with some of  the performance targets that EM had to correct later. Specifically, we  identified two projects\u2014the decontamination and decommissioning of the  Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah, Kentucky, and the Main  Plant Process Building in West Valley, New York\u2014for which EM had to  significantly increase the cost targets it had approved 10 and 5 months  earlier, respectively. In both cases, these cost increases were due to  errors that EM project officials made in calculating total project cost. For  example, for the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant project, the project  team did not incorporate additional project costs, including funds for  contingencies and the contractor\u2019s fee, into the project\u2019s cost estimate.  This omission resulted in underestimating the project\u2019s cost target by  about $8 million, or about 21 percent. In both cases, these errors  increased the projects\u2019 cost targets and caused EM to miss the original  cost targets, according to our assessment of performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Documentation or Changing Performance Baselines Complicates Evaluation of 27 Projects\u2019 Performance", "paragraphs": ["We were unable to determine the extent to which 27 of the 71 nonmajor  projects that EM and NNSA completed or had under way from fiscal year  2008 through fiscal year 2012 had met their scope, cost, and completion  date targets for four reasons.

Because EM had essentially completed all physical work before  fiscal year 2008 on the 6 projects we identified, EM never established  a performance baseline for these projects, according to EM officials.  However, we included these projects in our review because EM did  not formally approve the completion of these projects (via a CD-4  approval memorandum) until the 2010 to 2011 time frame, which  meant that these projects would have been ongoing until that time.  The combined cost of these 6 projects is approximately $1.5 billion.  (See app. II for more details.)", "NNSA.

In addition, for the Nuclear  Materials Safeguards and Security Upgrades, Phase II project at the Los  Alamos National Laboratory, NNSA and contractor officials have  determined that the project\u2019s remaining construction costs will exceed the  existing funds for the project and have halted work on the project.

We consider a project\u2019s scope target to have been modified  if, among other things, EM or NNSA increased the scope of the project  after approving it at CD-2 or reduced the scope for programmatic reasons  and provided a sound justification for this reduction. In contrast, if EM or  NNSA reduced project scope solely to meet a project\u2019s cost target, we did  not consider the scope target to have been modified; rather, we  considered the scope target not to have been met.

For example, an NNSA project to build a highway  at the Nevada National Security Site had an original scope target of 19.2  miles of highway and a cost target of about $14 million, but the project  team completed an additional 12 miles of highway at an incremental cost  of about $4 million, ahead of the original completion date target. However,  because the scope target changed, the total cost of the project also  changed, which made it unfair to judge the project\u2019s performance against  its original cost target.", "Table 3 provides an example of a NNSA project for which we consider the  scope target to have been modified.", "We have previously reported on problems with the way DOE documents  and tracks the scope of its projects, and DOE has taken actions to  address this issue. In a 2008 report on DOE\u2019s Office of Science, we noted  concerns within DOE that projects sometimes had overly broad definitions  of scope, making it difficult to determine the effects of a change in project   To address this issue, we recommended that DOE consider  scope.whether it could strengthen its project management guidance to help  ensure that each project\u2019s scope is clearly and sufficiently defined. DOE  generally agreed with our recommendation and revised Order 413.3 in  November 2010 to establish clearer requirements for identifying and  documenting project scope at CDs 2 and 4. Specifically, the revised order  requires a project\u2019s acquisition executive to clearly identify the scope  target in the documentation approving CD-2. In the documentation  approving CD-4, when a project is declared complete, this official must  clearly identify the scope accomplished and compare this scope with the  target established at CD-2.", "To determine whether NNSA and EM had improved their documentation  of scope targets since DOE revised Order 413.3, we identified two  nonmajor projects for which NNSA and EM established performance  targets in 2011. These projects are NNSA\u2019s Sanitary Effluent Reclamation  Facility Expansion project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and  EM\u2019s Purification Area Vault project at the Savannah River Site. In  reviewing project documentation, we found that both NNSA and EM had  provided information on targets for scope, cost, and completion date in  their memorandums approving CD-2. In particular, NNSA\u2019s approval  memorandum identified the following scope targets: (1) expand the  existing Sanitary Effluent Reclamation Facility capacity to treat 300  gallons per minute of product water in an 18-hour day; (2) provide a  400,000-gallon product water storage tank, which provides a consistent  supply of water to the cooling towers in the event the facility is off-line for  maintenance; and (3) provide additional evaporation capacity. These  scope targets provide a quantitative measure of how the project is to  perform at completion, as required by DOE\u2019s order.", "However, we found problems with the way EM documented the scope  target for its Purification Area Vault project. EM\u2019s approval memorandum  provided a high-level description of the project\u2019s scope, stating that the  project will modify an existing portion of the K-Area Complex at the  Savannah River Site in South Carolina to accommodate a vault;  implement passive and active fire protection features as identified in the  project fire hazards analysis; and install a new heating, ventilation, and air  conditioning system. However, the scope target cited in the approval  memorandum did not provide sufficient detail for measuring scope  performance at project completion and, therefore, it may be difficult for an  independent reviewer to accurately assess project performance.  Specifically, we found the following:", "The first part of the scope target\u2014construct a secure storage location  for holding at least 500 containers\u2014provides a quantitative measure  of how the project is to perform at completion, as required by DOE\u2019s  order. The second part of the scope target\u2014attain CD-4 approval for  storage of containers\u2014does not provide a quantitative measure and  instead reflects a stage in DOE\u2019s critical decision framework.  Therefore, only one part of the scope target can be used to  independently measure project performance regarding scope.", "The scope target only captures some of the elements of scope  contained in the high-level scope description. As a result, the effect of  any changes to these other elements of scope on project performance  is unclear. For example, if EM decided not to fully implement the fire  protection features identified in its hazards analysis, it is not clear  whether EM or an independent reviewer would consider the project to  have met its scope target.", "Only the scope target\u2014as opposed to the other elements of scope in  the high-level scope description\u2014is currently being tracked in DOE\u2019s  centralized database for project performance.

According to DOE guidance, an acquisition  strategy is the high-level business management approach chosen to  achieve project objectives within specified resource constraints. The  acquisition strategy is the framework for planning, organizing, staffing,  controlling, and leading a project. As part of this framework, agency  officials have to choose the most appropriate contract alternative for a  given project. Alternatives can include the use of multiple contractors to  perform different tasks or the use of a prime contractor (such as the M&O  contractor at a DOE site), who would be responsible for awarding  subcontracts for different tasks. In addition, agency officials should  identify the use of special procedures, such as the use of a \u201cdesign-build\u201d  contract, whereby a single contract is awarded for both design work and  construction, or the use of a \u201cdesign-bid-build\u201d contract, whereby separate  contracts are awarded for the design and construction.", "Some EM and NNSA officials told us that the acquisition strategy was an  important factor in the successful management of their projects. For  example, EM retained a prime contractor to manage the Soil and Water  Remediation\u20132012 project at the Idaho National Laboratory using a  contract containing incentives based on cost and schedule performance.  According to project officials, the fee structure under this acquisition  strategy is relatively simple and gives the project team flexibility to tie  incentives to different performance milestones across the multiple  subprojects within the contract. These officials said that this contract  structure has been a very effective tool in achieving performance goals.  EM expects this project to meet its cost target of $743 million and its  completion date target of September 2012, and officials said that they  expect the contractor to receive its incentive fee, as called for in the  contract.", "Other EM and NNSA officials cited the existence of an inadequate  acquisition strategy as having a negative effect on the performance of  their projects. For example, according to NNSA project officials at the Los  Alamos site office, the M&O contractor at the Los Alamos National  Laboratory decided to construct the Radiological Laboratory/Utility/Office  Building project using a design-build acquisition strategy with a single  prime subcontractor responsible for both design and construction. This  approach was chosen based on the M&O contractor\u2019s experience with  constructing office buildings. However, the project also involved the  construction of a radiological laboratory, which entailed the use of  rigorous documentation standards to show that the project can meet  nuclear quality assurance standards, among other things. Officials of the  NNSA site office said that one of their key lessons learned would be to  use a design-bid-build acquisition strategy if they had to manage a similar  project in the future. The use of a design-bid-build contract would have  offered several advantages over a design-build contract, according to  these officials. First, it would have allowed NNSA staff more time to  develop more robust project specifications and a more mature project  design before having contractors bid on the construction of that design.  Second, NNSA staff might have had more time to evaluate bids from  contractors to see if they had the skills to construct the project. Third, with  a more mature design, NNSA might have been able to reduce the number  of federal staff and the time spent overseeing the project. This project  was completed in June 2010, a few months after its completion date  target. Its cost target was $164 million; however, the final cost of this  project has not been determined because of ongoing litigation. According  to the officials of the site office, NNSA withheld the M&O contractor\u2019s  performance incentive fee as a result of less than desirable contractor  and subcontractor management during the design and construction of the  facility.", "DOE has previously identified ineffective acquisition strategies as being  among its top 10 management challenges.

Among other things, officials cited concerns with finding qualified  contractors that understood DOE\u2019s nuclear safety requirements and  maintained adequate internal control processes. Examples are as follows:", "Nuclear Facility Decontamination & Decommissioning \u2013 High Flux  Beam Reactor Project, Brookhaven National Laboratory, New York:  This project was completed in December 2010, more than a year  ahead of its completion date target, and at a cost of $16 million, which  was 31 percent higher than its cost target of $12 million. EM officials  stated that the major factor increasing costs was that the contractor  did not properly prepare for and pass internal safety reviews, which  were necessary to demonstrate the contractor\u2019s readiness to begin  removal and disposal of key reactor components. Because the  contractor required more time than originally planned to prepare for  and pass internal safety reviews, work on the project was delayed,  and the total project cost increased. Officials did not explain why the  project was completed well ahead of its completion date target despite  the delays encountered. Officials stated that one of the most important  lessons learned was to better ensure earlier in the process that the  contractor had a rigorous process in place (e.g., procedures and  training) to demonstrate that their personnel were ready to perform  the decontamination and decommissioning work. Because EM\u2019s  cleanup work at Brookhaven National Laboratory is performed under  the Laboratory Management and Operations Contract under the  purview of DOE\u2019s Office of Science, EM officials said that they have  provided information to the Office of Science to be included in the  contractor\u2019s overall performance evaluation.", "Process Research Unit Project, Niskayuna, New York: EM  established a cost target of $79 million for this ongoing project. In  September 2010, a contamination incident occurred while the  contractor was performing open air demolition of a building at the site.  According to DOE\u2019s incident report, the contamination incident had  two root causes: (1) the contractor failed to fully understand,  characterize, and control the radiological hazard; and (2) the  contractor failed to implement a work control process that ensured  facility conditions supported proceeding with the work. As a result of  this incident, as well as weather-related issues, the project has  exceeded its cost target, and the project\u2019s final cost and completion  date depend on the outcome of negotiations between DOE and the  contractor, according to project officials.", "Nuclear Materials Safeguards and Security Upgrades Project, Phase  II, Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico: This ongoing project  is expected to meet its cost target of $245 million but not its  completion date target of January 2013. NNSA used a design-bid- build acquisition strategy for this project, with one contractor  responsible for designing the project, and another contractor  responsible for construction activities. According to project officials,  during the construction phase, the building contractor had to stop  work when it discovered errors with the design of the project.  Specifically, officials told us the designs contained an erroneous  elevation drawing that did not adequately account for the presence of  a canyon and a pipeline containing radioactive liquid waste on the  north side of the project site. In addition, other construction  subcontractors, whose work was to be performed in sequence, had to  wait to begin their work. As a result of these problems, the design  contractor spent considerable time redesigning the project, according  to project officials, and NNSA has had to award additional funding and  schedule time to the construction contractors to compensate for the  inadequate design. All told, officials told us the additional costs  resulting from redesign and the delay of construction ranged from $15  million to $20 million. In addition, NNSA and contractor officials  recently determined that the project\u2019s remaining construction costs will  exceed the existing funds for the project and have halted work.

In a few cases, EM and NNSA increased  the scope of work associated with a project after establishing  performance targets at CD-2; in these cases, we noted that these projects  had been modified and did not calculate whether they had met or  exceeded their original cost and schedule targets.", "In addition, we considered  To evaluate factors affecting EM\u2019s and NNSA\u2019s management of nonmajor  projects, we selected a nongeneralizable sample of 20 out of the 71  projects\u2014including 10 EM projects and 10 NNSA projects\u2014for more  detailed review. The names of these 20 projects are provided in apps II  and III. Results from nonprobability samples, including our sample of 20  projects, cannot be used to make inferences about EM\u2019s and NNSA\u2019s  overall project performance or generalized to projects we did not include  in our sample. We were interested in gathering information on the  selected projects to identify material factors that may not exist across all  projects but could help us understand EM\u2019s and NNSA\u2019s organization  strengths and potential challenges. We selected these 20 projects to  ensure that our sample included completed and ongoing projects, with a  wide range of project costs. Together, the 20 projects represented about  $4.1 billion, or approximately 41 percent, of the total value of the 71  projects.", "For these 20 projects, we developed a structured interview template to  identify the key factors that affected the management of these projects.  We used three primary sources in developing this structured interview  template\u2014GAO\u2019s cost guide, DOE\u2019s Order 413.3, and DOE\u2019s guidance  document on conducting project reviews. The structured interview  template focused on certain aspects of project management, such as the  preparation of project designs, risk estimates, and cost and schedule  targets, as well as the adherence to DOE project management  requirements. We pretested the structured interview template during a  site visit to the Y-12 National Security Complex and the Oak Ridge  Reservation near Oak Ridge, Tennessee. At each site, we selected six  projects and interviewed relevant EM and NNSA federal project directors  and other knowledgeable staff using the structured interview template.  Based on our pretesting, we revised the structured interview template and  conducted 20 interviews with the relevant EM and NNSA federal project  directors and other knowledgeable staff to gather their perspectives on  their projects\u2019 performance and reasons for it.", "To evaluate the extent to which EM\u2019s workforce plans identify mission- critical occupations and skills and any current and future shortfalls in  these areas, we examined EM\u2019s strategic workforce plans for its  headquarters and site office staff, DOE\u2019s corrective action plan for  contract and project management, and the Office of Personnel  Management\u2019s Human Capital Assessment and Accountability  Framework. Specifically, we obtained the eight EM workforce plans,  prepared by EM headquarters, the Consolidated Business Center, the  Richland Operations Office and Office of River Protection (which manage  operations at the EM site in Hanford, Washington), the  Portsmouth/Paducah Site Office, the Savannah River Operations Office,  the Idaho Operations Office, the Carlsbad Field Office, and the Oak Ridge  Office. We reviewed these plans in their entirety, and also searched for  relevant terms, to determine the extent to which the plans identified  mission-critical occupations and skills and any current and future  shortfalls in these areas. In addition to our document review, we  interviewed DOE and EM officials with knowledge of EM\u2019s practices in  workforce planning, including officials in EM\u2019s Office of Acquisition and  Project Management and Office of Human Capital and Corporate  Services. We conducted these interviews to determine how EM develops  its workforce plans and to obtain EM officials\u2019 points of view regarding the  state of the EM workforce.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2011 to December 2012  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
