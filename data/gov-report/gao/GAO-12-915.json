Prior to the 2010 Decennial Census, the Census Bureau experienced significant challenges in managing its information systems leading to cost overruns and performance shortfalls which increased the cost of the 2010 census by almost $3 billion. Given the bureau\u0092s extensive use of IT in collecting, analyzing, and distributing information, GAO was asked to determine to what extent the bureau has developed (1) effective policies, procedures, and processes for managing IT investments and system development; and (2) effective practices for acquiring and maintaining IT human capital skills. To address these objectives, GAO identified leading practices in these areas, reviewed bureau policies and procedures to determine whether they followed these practices, and interviewed bureau officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Census Bureau (Census Bureau) has drafted a new investment management plan, system development methodology, and requirements development and management processes to improve its ability to manage information technology (IT) investments and system development, but additional work is needed to ensure these processes are effective and successfully implemented across the bureau. GAO and others have identified the importance of implementing critical processes within an agency to allow it to select, control, and evaluate its IT investments and effectively manage system development. The bureau has developed a new draft investment management plan which contains policies and guidance for managing IT projects; however, the plan does not explain when investments with cost or schedule variances should be escalated to higher-level boards for review, or when managers should provide updated investment information to a planned bureau-wide tracking tool. The bureau has also developed a new system development methodology guide, but the guide has critical gaps. For example, although there are five development process models allowed, including the traditional sequential approach and newer more iterative approaches, the guide does not explain how to adapt processes and related work products for newer iterative approaches. Furthermore, while the bureau has developed new draft requirements development and management processes for system development within individual bureau directorates, it has not established a consistent process bureau-wide as GAO recommended in 2005. Lack of a consistent bureau-wide process contributed to significant cost and performance issues in the 2010 Decennial Census. Although the bureau plans to begin operational development for the 2020 Decennial Census in fiscal year 2015, it has not finalized plans for implementing its new investment management and system development processes across the bureau. Until the bureau takes additional action to finalize and implement consistent, bureau-wide processes, it faces the risk that IT governance issues that adversely affected the 2010 Decennial Census will also impact the 2020 Decennial Census.", "The bureau has begun to take steps to improve its IT workforce planning; however, many key practices consistent with principles for effective workforce planning remain to be put in place. In particular, there is no bureau-wide coordination of these workforce planning efforts. Each directorate is responsible for its own IT workforce planning and the bureau has not established any efforts to coordinate activities among directorates. While the bureau identified mission critical IT occupations and began an assessment of select mission critical competencies in June 2011, it does not plan to perform a bureau-wide IT competency assessment until the fall of 2012. Until bureau-wide IT workforce planning processes are established and the bureau develops specific plans to conduct an IT skills inventory and gap analysis, the bureau faces the risk that the appropriate IT workforce will not be in place to effectively develop and manage multimillion dollar investments in information systems and technology that will be needed for the 2020 Decennial Census."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen and improve the Census Bureau\u0092s management of IT, GAO recommends that the Acting Secretary of Commerce take eight actions, including improvements to guidance for its planned IT investment process, a consistent requirements development and management process, an implementation plan and time frames for its investment management process and system development methodology, and coordination of IT workforce planning efforts.

For nearly 100 years,  census data were tabulated by clerks who made tally marks or added  columns of figures with a pen or a pencil. As the nation grew and there  were more people, items, and characteristics to count, speedier tabulation  methods had to be invented or the results of one census would not be  processed before it was time for the next one. In 1880, the bureau used a  \u201ctabulating machine\u201d\u2014a wooden box in which a roll of paper was  threaded past an opening where a clerk marked the tallies in various  columns and then added up the marks when the roll was full\u2014that made  tabulating at least twice as fast as the previous manual process.", "By 1950, mechanical tabulating improved; its speed had increased to  2,000 items per minute. In 1951, the first large-scale electronic computer,  UNIVAC I, was designed and built specifically for the Census Bureau.  This machine was able to tabulate 4,000 items per minute. From 1970 on,  the bureau took advantage of new high-speed composers that converted  the data on computer tape directly to words and numbers on off-set  negative film used in publishing. Beginning in the mid-1980s, some  statistics were made available on diskettes for use in microcomputers and  users began to obtain statistics online. In the later 1980s, the bureau  began testing CD-ROM (compact disk/read-only memory) laser disks as a  medium for releasing data.", "The 2000 Census demonstrated probably the biggest leap forward in the  use of technology for collecting and disseminating data. According to the  bureau, its previous response scanning system (which dated to the  1950s) was replaced with optical character recognition technology,  allowing the bureau to design a respondent-friendly (instead of machine- friendly) questionnaire in which write-in responses could also be captured  electronically. In addition, the bureau\u2019s previous online data system from  the 1990s evolved into online data available through the Census Bureau\u2019s  website. Further technological advances were made in the 2010 census  through the use of handheld computers for certain parts of Census  operations and integration of Global Positioning System information into  Census Bureau maps. Although specific technical decisions for the 2020  Census remain to be made, both ongoing Census operations and the  next decennial census will be highly reliant on the effective use of  information technology.", "The 2010 Decennial Census cost $13 billion and was the costliest U.S.  census in history. One reason for the high cost was the increased use of  paper-based processing over what was originally intended due to  performance issues with key IT systems, which increased the cost of the  census by up to $3 billion. The total cost of the census was 56 percent  more than the $8.1 billion 2000 Decennial Census (in constant 2010  dollars).

Using this  model, each spiral, or incremental cycle, typically starts by  determining the development objectives and scope for the increment.

Accordingly, we made  recommendations to the Census Bureau to develop procedures to ensure  consistent investment management and decision-making practices and to  institutionalize a process improvement initiative, such as the CMMI  framework, to strengthen bureau-wide system development and  management processes. We noted that unless these recommendations  were implemented, the bureau would face increased risk that cost  overruns, schedule slippages, and performance shortfalls would occur  and it would not be able to effectively manage its multimillion dollar  investments in IT.", "As development of the IT systems progressed, these problems were  realized.

We also testified on significant risks facing the 2010 census.  In particular, we testified in March 2008 that the Field Data Collection  Automation program was experiencing significant problems, including  schedule delays and cost increases from changes in requirements, which  required additional work and staffing. In April 2008, the Census Bureau  dropped the use of handheld devices developed as part of this program  for nonresponse follow-up and reverted to a paper-based operation,  requiring the development of a Paper-Based Operations Control System  to manage the operation.

Specifically, since other life-cycle models do not follow the waterfall model  in terms of phases, types of activities, and work products for each phase,  the methodology should explain how it can be adapted to alternate  software development models, including identifying mandatory work  products for other non-waterfall development models and phases.

In 2005 we  found that individual project teams within the bureau had not consistently  implemented key practices for requirements management and we  recommended that a consistent approach be established bureau-wide.  These weaknesses in the bureau\u2019s processes for requirements  management were not sufficiently addressed and we reported in 2007,  2008, and 2009 that these issues contributed to increases in life-cycle  cost estimates and cost overruns of hundreds of millions of dollars for key  investments necessary for the 2010 Decennial Census. Furthermore,  the bureau had developed a handheld device for the 2010 census that did  not operate as intended because of the lack of a robust requirements  process.
