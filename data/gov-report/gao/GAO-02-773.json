The insurance program is  supported by the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (Fund). To help place  the Fund on a financially sound basis, the Congress enacted legislation in  November 1990 that required the Secretary of HUD to, among other things,  take steps to ensure that the Fund achieve and maintain an economic value  of at least 2 percent of the Fund\u2019s insurance-in-force.  In February 2001 we  reported that a 2 percent capital ratio appeared sufficient to withstand  moderately severe economic downturns that could lead to worse-than- expected loan performance.  However, we cautioned against concluding  that the Fund could withstand the specified economic scenarios regardless  of the future activities of FHA or the market. Specifically, we noted that our  estimates and those of others are valid only under a certain set of  conditions, including that recently insured FHA loans respond to economic  conditions similarly to the response of those insured in the more distant  past. At the end of fiscal year 2001, loans originated in the most recent 4  fiscal years accounted for about 70 percent of FHA\u2019s portfolio.", "Concerned about reported increases in FHA\u2019s default and foreclosure rates,  you asked that we assess the performance of loans made in recent years  and the implications for the Fund of any worsening loan performance. To  address your concerns, we (1) describe how the early performance of FHA  loans originated in recent years differs from the performance of loans  originated earlier; (2) describe changes in FHA\u2019s program or the  conventional mortgage market that could explain recent loan performance;  and (3) assess whether the overall riskiness of FHA\u2019s portfolio is greater  than we previously estimated and assess the impact that any increased  riskiness might have on the ability of the Fund to withstand worse-than- expected loan performance.", "To meet these objectives, we used data provided by FHA to compare  foreclosure rates for FHA-insured loans over time by the type of loan, the  location of the property, and the amount of the loan as a percentage of the  property\u2019s value (loan-to-value ratio). We reviewed FHA guidance, trade  literature, and publicly available information to identify changes in the FHA  and conventional mortgage market that could explain any differences in  loan performance for recently originated loans. Finally, using the model  that we developed for our prior report and basing it on the experience of  FHA loans insured from fiscal years 1975 through 1995, we also compared  the estimated and actual foreclosure rates through 2001 of loans insured  from fiscal years 1996 through 2001. Appendix I provides a more detailed  description of our scope and methodology. Appendix II provides a  technical description of the model we used to assess estimated and actual  loan performance.", "We conducted our work from July 2001 through June 2002, in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["FHA was established in 1934 under the National Housing Act (P.L. 73-479)  to broaden homeownership, shore up and protect lending institutions, and  stimulate employment in the building industry. FHA insures private lenders  against losses on mortgages that finance purchases of properties with one  to four housing units. Many FHA-insured loans are made to low-income,  minority, and first-time homebuyers.", "Generally, lenders require borrowers to purchase mortgage insurance when  the value of the mortgage is large relative to the price of the house. FHA  provides most of its single-family insurance through a program supported  by the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund. The economic value of the Fund,  which consists of the sum of existing capital resources plus the net present  value of future cash flows, depends on the relative size of cash outflows  and inflows over time. Cash flows out of the Fund from payments  associated with claims on foreclosed properties, refunds of up-front  premiums on mortgages that are prepaid, and administrative expenses for  management of the program. To cover these outflows, FHA deposits cash  inflows\u2014up-front and annual insurance premiums from participating  homebuyers and the net proceeds from the sale of foreclosed properties\u2014 into the Fund. If the Fund were to be exhausted, the U.S. Treasury would  have to cover lenders\u2019 claims and administrative costs directly. The Fund  remained relatively healthy from its inception until the 1980s, when losses  were substantial, primarily because of high foreclosure rates in regions  experiencing economic stress, particularly the oil-producing states in the  West South Central section of the United States. These losses prompted  the reforms that were first enacted in November 1990 as part of the  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-508). The reforms,  designed to place the Fund on an actuarially sound basis, required the  Secretary of HUD to, among other things, take steps to ensure that the  Fund attained a capital ratio of 2 percent of the insurance-in-force by  November 2000 and to maintain or exceed that ratio at all times thereafter.  As a result of the 1990 housing reforms, the Fund must meet not only the  minimum capital ratio requirement but also operational goals before the  Secretary of HUD can take certain actions that might reduce the value of  the Fund. These operational goals include meeting the mortgage credit  needs of certain homebuyers while maintaining an adequate capital ratio,  minimizing risk, and avoiding adverse selection. However, the legislation  does not define what constitutes adequate capital or specify the economic  conditions that the Fund should withstand.", "The 1990 reforms also required that an independent contractor conduct an  annual actuarial review of the Fund. These reviews have shown that during  the 1990s the estimated value of the Fund grew substantially. At the end of  fiscal year 1995, the Fund attained an estimated economic value that  slightly exceeded the amount required for a 2 percent capital ratio. Since  that time, the estimated economic value of the Fund continued to grow and  always exceeded the amount required for a 2 percent capital ratio. In the  most recent actuarial review, Deloitte & Touche estimated the Fund\u2019s  economic value at about $18.5 billion at the end of fiscal year 2001. This  represents about 3.75 percent of the Fund\u2019s insurance-in-force.", "In February 2001 we reported that the Fund had an economic value of $15.8  billion at the end of fiscal year 1999. This estimate implied a capital ratio of  3.20 percent of the unamortized insurance-in-force. The relatively large  economic value and high capital ratio reported for the Fund reflected the  strong economic conditions that prevailed during most of the 1990s, the  good economic performance that was expected for the future, and the  increased insurance premiums put in place in 1990.", "In our February 2001 report we also reported that, given the economic  value of the Fund and the state of the economy at the end of fiscal year  1999, a 2 percent capital ratio appeared sufficient to withstand moderately  severe economic scenarios that could lead to worse-than-expected loan  performance. These scenarios were based upon recent regional  experiences and the national recession that occurred in 1981 and 1982.  Specifically, we found that such conditions would not cause the economic  value of the Fund at the end of fiscal year 1999 to decline by more than 2  percent of the Fund\u2019s insurance-in-force. Although a 2 percent capital ratio  also appeared sufficient to allow the Fund to withstand some more severe  scenarios, we found that three of the most severe scenarios we tested  would cause the economic value of the Fund to decline by more than 2  percent of the Fund\u2019s insurance-in-force.  These results suggest that the  existing capital ratio was more than sufficient to protect the Fund from  many worse-than-expected loan performance scenarios. However, we  cautioned that factors not fully captured in our economic models could  affect the Fund\u2019s ability to withstand worse-than-expected experiences  over time. These factors include recent changes in FHA\u2019s insurance  program and the conventional mortgage market that could affect the  likelihood of poor loan performance and the ability of the Fund to  withstand that performance.", "In deciding whether to approve a loan, lenders rely upon underwriting  standards set by FHA or the private sector. FHA\u2019s underwriting guidelines  require lenders to establish that prospective borrowers have the ability and  willingness to repay a mortgage. In order to establish a borrower\u2019s  willingness and ability to pay, these guidelines require lenders to evaluate  four major elements: qualifying ratios and compensating factors; stability  and adequacy of income; credit history; and funds to close.", "In recent years, private mortgage insurers and conventional lenders have  begun to offer alternatives to borrowers who want to make small or no  down payments. Private lenders have also begun to use automated  underwriting as a means to better target low-risk borrowers for  conventional mortgages. Automated underwriting relies on the statistical  analysis of hundreds of thousands of mortgage loans that have been  originated over the past decade to determine the key attributes of the  borrower\u2019s credit history, the property characteristics, and the terms of the  mortgage note that affect loan performance. The results of this analysis are  arrayed numerically in what is known as a \u201cmortgage score.\u201d A mortgage  score is used as an indicator of the foreclosure or loss risk to the lender."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Early Performance of FHA Loans Originated during the Late 1990s Has Declined Slightly", "paragraphs": ["During their early years, FHA loans insured from fiscal year 1995 through  fiscal year 1998 have shown somewhat higher cumulative foreclosure rates  than FHA loans insured from fiscal year 1990 through fiscal year 1994, but  these rates are well below comparable rates for FHA loans insured in the  1980s. To better understand how foreclosure rates might vary, we  compared the rates for different types of loans\u2014fixed-rate and adjustable  rate mortgages (ARMs)\u2014locations of properties, and loan-to-value (LTV)  ratios. For loans made in recent years, FHA has been experiencing  particularly high foreclosure rates for ARMs and mortgages on properties  located in California. One measure of the initial risk of a loan, its LTV, can  partly explain the difference over time in foreclosure rates.

California,  which accounted for 15 percent of the dollar value of all single-family loans  that FHA insured during the 1990s, had an average foreclosure rate of  6.41 percent for both fixed rate and ARMs. In comparison, the 4-year  cumulative foreclosure rate for FHA loans insured during the 1990s outside  of California averaged 1.97 percent. According to FHA, the poor  performance of FHA loans originated in California was attributable to poor  economic conditions that existed during the early- to mid-1990s, coupled  with the practice of combining FHA\u2019s interest-rate buy-down program with  an ARM to qualify borrowers in California\u2019s high-priced housing market.", "The five states with the greatest dollar value of long-term fixed-rate  mortgages insured by FHA during the 1990s were California, Texas, Florida,  New York, and Illinois.

In fact, for ARMs that FHA insured in California in  fiscal years 1995 and 1996, the 4-year cumulative foreclosure rate was  about 10 percent, more than twice as high as the rate for any of the other  three states with the highest dollar volume of loans or for the remaining 46  states and the District of Columbia combined."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Difference in LTV Ratios Can Explain Part but Not All of the Difference in Foreclosure Rates", "paragraphs": ["Although differences in the share of FHA-insured loans with high LTVs  (above 95 percent) may be a factor accounting for part of the difference in  cumulative foreclosure rates between more recent loans and loans insured  earlier in the 1990s, the same pattern exists even when differences in LTV  are taken into account.

Thus, differences in LTV alone cannot account for the  observed differences in foreclosure rates.", "Finally, we also considered whether the differences in foreclosures rates  could be explained by differences in prepayment rates. Higher prepayment  rates might be associated with lower foreclosure rates: if a higher  percentage of loans in a book of business are prepaid, then only a smaller  share of the original book of business might be subject to foreclosure.  However, we found that during the 1990s, prepayment rates showed the  same pattern across the years as foreclosure rates and, if anything, were  generally higher when foreclosure rates were higher, suggesting that less  frequent prepayment was not a factor explaining higher foreclosure rates in  the late 1990s."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Program- and Market- Related Changes that Could Explain Higher Foreclosure Rates", "paragraphs": ["Although economic factors such as house-price-appreciation rates are key  determinants of mortgage foreclosure, a number of program- and market- related changes occurring since 1995 could also affect the performance of  recently insured FHA loans. Specifically, in 1995 FHA made a number of  changes in its single-family insurance program that allow borrowers who  otherwise might not have qualified for home loans to obtain FHA-insured  loans. These changes also allow qualified borrowers to increase the  amount of loan for which they can qualify. According to HUD, these  underwriting changes were designed to expand homeownership  opportunities by eliminating unnecessary barriers to potential homebuyers.  The proportion of FHA purchase-mortgages made to first-time homebuyers  increased from 65 percent in 1994 to 78 percent at the end of March 2002  and the proportion of FHA purchase-mortgages made to minority  homebuyers increased from 25 percent to 42 percent. At the same time,  there has been increased competition from private mortgage insurers  offering mortgages with low down payments to borrowers identified as  relatively low risk. The combination of changes in FHA\u2019s program and the  increased competition in the marketplace may partly explain the higher  foreclosure rates of FHA loans originated since fiscal year 1995. FHA has  since made changes that may reduce the likelihood of mortgage default,  including requiring that, when qualifying an FHA borrower for an ARM, the  lender use the ARM\u2019s second year mortgage rate rather than the first-year  rate. In addition, FHA has implemented a new loss-mitigation program.  Because certain data that FHA collects on individual loans have not been  collected for a sufficient number of years or in sufficient detail, we were  unable to estimate the effect of changes in FHA\u2019s program and competition  from conventional lenders on FHA loan performance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Changes in FHA\u2019s Underwriting Guidelines Could Have Resulted in Higher Foreclosure Rates", "paragraphs": ["FHA issued revised underwriting guidelines in fiscal year 1995 that,  according to HUD, represented significant underwriting changes that  would enhance the homebuying opportunities for a substantial number of  American families.

However, the changes may also have increased the  likelihood of foreclosure. The loans approved with more liberal  underwriting standards might, over time, perform worse relative to existing  economic conditions than those approved with the previous standards. The  revised standards decreased what is included as borrowers\u2019 debts and  expanded the definition of what can be included as borrowers\u2019 effective  income when lenders calculate qualifying ratios.

For  example, childcare expenses were considered a recurring monthly debt in  the debt-to-income ratio prior to 1995, but FHA no longer requires that  these expenses be considered when calculating the debt-to-income ratio.", "Another change affecting the debt-to-income ratio is that only debts  extending 10 months or more are now included in the ratio; previously,  FHA required all debts extending 6 months or more to be included. As a  result of this change, borrowers can have short-term debts that might affect  their ability to meet their mortgage payments, but these debts would not be  included in the debt-to-income ratio.

Certain types of income that were  previously considered too unstable to be counted toward effective income  are now acceptable in qualifying a borrower. For example, FHA previously  required income to be expected to continue for 5 years in order for it to be  considered as effective income. Now income expected to continue for 3  years can be used in qualifying a borrower. Similarly, FHA now counts  income from overtime and bonuses toward effective income, as long as this  income is expected to continue.

These types of benefits are not  included as effective income, but FHA believes that receiving food stamps  or other public benefits positively affects the borrower\u2019s ability to pay the  mortgage. Lenders may also consider as a compensating factor a  borrower\u2019s demonstrated history of being able to pay housing expenses  equal to or greater than the proposed housing expense. In FHA\u2019s revised  handbook, the section on compensating factors now states, \u201cIf the  borrower over the past 12 to 24 months has met his or her housing  obligation as well as other debts, there should be little reason to doubt the  borrower\u2019s ability to continue to do so despite having ratios in excess of  those prescribed.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHA Has Changed How It Evaluates Borrowers\u2019 Past Credit History", "paragraphs": ["In addition to changes affecting borrowers\u2019 qualifying ratios, the 1995  underwriting changes affected how FHA lenders are supposed to evaluate  credit history to determine a borrower\u2019s willingness and ability to handle a  mortgage. As with qualifying ratios and compensating factors, FHA relies  on the lender\u2019s judgment and interpretation to determine prospective  borrowers\u2019 creditworthiness. The 1995 underwriting changes affected FHA  guidelines regarding unpaid federal liens as well as credit and credit  reports.   Specifically, before 1995, borrowers were ineligible for an FHA- insured mortgage if they were delinquent on any federal debt or had any  federal liens, including taxes, placed on their property. Following the 1995  changes, borrowers may qualify for a loan even if federal tax liens remain  unpaid. FHA guidelines stipulate that a borrower may be eligible as long as  the lien holder subordinates the tax lien to the FHA-insured mortgage. If  the borrower is in a payment plan to repay liens, lenders may also approve  the mortgage if the borrower meets the qualifying ratios calculated with  these payments. Finally, FHA expanded the options available to lenders to  evaluate a borrower\u2019s credit history. The previous guidance on developing  credit histories mentions only rent and utilities as nontraditional sources of  credit history. Lenders can now elect to use a nontraditional mortgage  credit report developed by a credit reporting agency if no other credit  history exists. Lenders may also develop a credit history by considering a  borrower\u2019s payment history for rental housing and utilities, insurance,  childcare, school tuition, payments on credit accounts with local stores, or  uninsured medical bills.

In recent years, FHA\u2019s  competitors in the mortgage insurance market\u2014private mortgage insurers  and conventional mortgage lenders\u2014have increasingly offered products  that compete with FHA\u2019s for those homebuyers who are borrowing more  than 95 percent of the value of their home. In addition, automated  underwriting systems and credit-scoring analytic software such as those  introduced by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and  the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) in 1996 are  believed to be able to more effectively distinguish low-risk loans for  expedited processing. The improvement of conventional lenders\u2019 ability to  identify low-risk borrowers might increase the risk profile of FHA\u2019s  portfolio as lower-risk borrowers choose conventional financing with  private mortgage insurance, which is often less expensive. In addition, by  lowering the required down payment, conventional mortgage lenders and  private mortgage insurers may have attracted some borrowers who might  otherwise have insured their mortgages with FHA. If, by selectively offering  these low down payment loans to better risk borrowers, conventional  mortgage lenders and private mortgage insurers were able to attract FHA\u2019s  lower-risk borrowers, recent FHA loans with down payments of less than 5  percent may be more risky on average than they have been historically.  FHA is taking some action to more effectively compete with the  conventional market. For example, FHA is attempting to implement an  automated underwriting system that could enhance the ability of lenders  underwriting FHA-insured mortgages to distinguish better credit risks from  poorer ones.

FHA also stipulated that lenders should  consider a borrower\u2019s ability to absorb increased payments after buy down  periods. FHA also emphasized that lenders should rarely exceed FHA\u2019s  qualifying ratio guidelines in the case of ARMs. In 1998, seeing that  borrowers were still experiencing trouble handling increased payments  after the buy down period, FHA required borrowers to be qualified at the  anticipated second-year interest rate, or the interest rate they would  experience after the buy down expired, and it prohibited any form of  temporary interest-rate buy down on ARMs. These changes will likely  reduce the riskiness of ARMs in future books of business.", "FHA has also required stricter documentation from lenders on the use of  compensating factors and gift letters in mortgage approvals.

As a result, FHA  strengthened its policy and required lenders to judge the liquidity of a  borrower\u2019s assets when considering a borrower\u2019s cash reserves.

In addition, these data could be used  in a more comprehensive analysis of the relationship among FHA  foreclosures and FHA program design, the housing market, and economic  conditions.

Although more  years of loan performance are necessary to make a definitive judgment,  factors not accounted for in the models that we used for that report appear  to be affecting the performance of loans insured after 1995 and causing the  overall riskiness of FHA\u2019s portfolio to be greater than we previously  estimated. In that report we based our estimate of the economic value of  the Fund (as of the end of fiscal year 1999), in part, on econometric models  that we developed and used to forecast future foreclosures and  prepayments for FHA-insured loans based on the historical experience of  loans dating back to 1975. However, a large share of the loans in FHA\u2019s  portfolio at that time were originated in fiscal years 1998 and 1999, and  therefore there was little direct evidence of how those loans would  perform. As a result, at the time that we released that estimate we  cautioned that recent changes in FHA\u2019s insurance program and the  conventional mortgage market, such as those discussed in the previous  section, could be causing recent loans to perform differently, even under  the same economic conditions, from earlier loans.", "To estimate the potential impact of these changes, we first used our  previous model to develop estimates of the relationship between, on the  one hand, the probability of foreclosure and prepayment and, on the other  hand, key explanatory factors such as borrower equity and unemployment  for loans insured between fiscal years 1975 and 1995. On the basis of  these estimates and of the actual values beyond 1995 for key economic  variables, such as interest and unemployment rates and the rate of house  price appreciation, we forecasted the performance (both foreclosures and  prepayments) of loans that FHA insured from fiscal year 1996 through  fiscal year 2001. We then compared those forecasts with the actual  experience of those loans. (See app. II for a full discussion of our  methodology.) As is shown in figure 11, for each year\u2019s book of business,  we found that cumulative foreclosure rates through the end of fiscal year  2001 exceeded our forecasted levels. For example, for the book of  business with the longest experience, loans insured in 1996, we forecasted  that the cumulative foreclosure rate through the end of fiscal year 2001  would be 3.44 percent, but the actual foreclosure rate was 5.81 percent.  These results suggest that some factors other than those accounted for in  the model may be causing loans insured after 1995 to perform worse  thanwould be expected based on the historical experience of older loans.", "The fact that cumulative foreclosures for recent FHA-insured loans have  been greater than what would be anticipated from a model based on the  performance of loans insured from fiscal year 1975 through fiscal year 1995  suggests that the caution we expressed in our 2001 report about the effect  of recent changes in FHA\u2019s insurance program and the conventional  mortgage market on the ability of the Fund to withstand future economic  downturns is still warranted. In particular, the performance of loans  insured in fiscal years 1998 and 1999, which represented about one-third of  FHA\u2019s loan portfolio at the end of 1999, could be worse than what we  previously forecasted. In turn, lower performance by these loans could  affect the economic value of the Fund and its ability to withstand future  economic downturns.", "To assess the extent of this effect, we would need to know the extent to  which the performance of loans insured in fiscal years 1998 and 1999 has  been and will be worse than what we forecasted in developing our previous  estimate of the economic value of the Fund. Because loans insured in fiscal  years 1998 and 1999 have not completely passed through the peak years for  foreclosures, these loans\u2019 foreclosures to date provide only a limited  indication of their long-term performance. We do, however, have a better  indication of the long-term performance of loans insured in fiscal years  1996 and 1997 because they are older loans with more years of experience.  The experience of these loans suggests that changes that are not accounted  for in our models are causing these books of business to have higher  foreclosure rates than would be anticipated from a model based on the  performance of earlier loans. If loans insured in fiscal years 1998 and 1999  are affected by changes that are not accounted for in our models in the  same way that loans insured in fiscal years 1996 and 1997 appear to be  affected, then the 1998 and 1999 loans will continue to have higher  cumulative foreclosure rates than we estimated. Higher foreclosure rates,  in turn, imply a lower economic value of the Fund, which is generally  estimated as a baseline value under an expected set of economic  conditions. With a lower baseline economic value of the Fund under  expected economic conditions, the Fund would be less able to withstand  adverse economic conditions.", "To better understand the reasons for the increased risk of recently  originated FHA loans would require additional data on factors that might  explain loan performance\u2014including qualifying ratios and credit scores.  Even if these historical data were available today, it is too soon to estimate  with confidence the impact that recent changes will ultimately have on  recently insured loans because many of these loans have not yet reached  the peak years when foreclosures usually occur. Recently insured loans  represent the majority of FHA\u2019s portfolio. The impact of underwriting  changes and changes in the conventional mortgage market on the riskiness  of the portfolio is not fully understood.

A negative relationship might also exist if a borrower's passing  up one profitable refinancing opportunity reflected a lack of financial  sophistication that, in turn, would be associated with passing up additional  opportunities. However, a borrower who anticipated moving soon might  pass up an apparently profitable refinancing opportunity to avoid the  transaction costs associated with refinancing. In this case, there might be a  positive relationship, with the probability of prepayment being higher if the  borrower fulfilled his or her anticipation and moved, thereby prepaying the  loan.", "Another explanatory variable is the volatility of interest rates, INTVOL,  which is defined as the standard deviation of the monthly average of the  Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation's series of 30-year, fixed-rate  mortgages\u2019 effective interest rates.

CHANGEPOS measures how far the interest rate on the mortgage has  increased since origination, with a minimum of 0, while CHANGENEG  measures how far the rate has decreased, with a maximum of 0.  CAPPEDPOS measures how much further the interest rate on the mortgage  would rise if prevailing interest rates in the market did not change, while  CAPPEDNEG measures how much further the mortgage's rate would fall if  prevailing interest rates did not change. For example, if an ARM was  originated at 7 percent and interest rates increased by 250 basis points 1  year later, CHANGEPOS would equal 100 because FHA's ARMs can  increase by no more than 100 basis points in a year. CAPPEDPOS would  equal 150 basis points, since the mortgage rate would eventually increase  by another 150 basis points if market interest rates did not change, and  CHANGENEG and CAPPEDNEG would equal 0.

However, we did not view this downward bias as a problem because our  purpose was to forecast the dependent variables, not to test hypotheses  concerning the effects of independent variables.", "In general, our results are consistent with the economic reasoning that  underlies our models. Most important, the probability of foreclosure  declines as equity increases, and the probability of prepayment increases  as the current mortgage interest rate falls below the contract mortgage  interest rate.  As shown in tables 4 and 5, both of these effects occur in  each regression model and are very strong.

The overall conditional  prepayment probability for long-term, fixed-rate mortgages is estimated to  be about 5.0 percent. This means that, in any particular year, about 5  percent of the loan dollars outstanding will prepay, on average.  Prepayment probability is quite sensitive to the relationship between the  contract interest rate and the currently available mortgage rate. We  modeled this relationship using RELEQHI and RELEQLO.
