Six FTAs have been approved and are in force, and negotiations for another 4 FTAs have been concluded. The United States has simultaneously pursued comprehensive, high-standard trade agreements on the bilateral and multilateral levels. Trade with countries for which FTAs were pursued under TPA comprises about 16 percent of U.S. trade and foreign direct investment. Twenty-seven percent of U.S. trade is with countries with FTAs in force prior to TPA (e.g., Canada and Mexico); 56 percent is with countries with which the United States does not have FTAs. The largest U.S. trade partners not pursued under TPA are the European Union, Japan, and China; the rest account for relatively small shares of U.S. trade. USTR held 1,605 consultations with congressional committee staff from August 2002 through April 2007, but satisfaction with the consultations was mixed. About two-thirds of these meetings were with the House and Senate trade and agriculture committees. Almost all the congressional staff GAO contacted viewed the consultations as providing good information, but slightly more than half said that they did not provide opportunities for real input or influence. These staff often said that they were not given sufficient time to provide meaningful input. The trade advisory committee chairs GAO contacted said that USTR and managing agencies consulted with their committees fairly regularly, although process issues at times hindered some from functioning effectively. For example, about half said that the 30-day deadline for reporting on the likely impact of FTAs can be difficult to meet, and the ITC had a similar problem. In addition, adherence to statutory representation requirements is not always transparent. Several committees have not been able to meet while their charters were expired, or members had not been reappointed. However, USTR and managing agencies are not required to report to Congress such lapses in a committee's ability to meet."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Pub. L.

In addition, to determine what  FTAs have been pursued under TPA and why, we reviewed USTR  documents and interagency memoranda discussing FTA partner selection  and updated our findings from prior GAO work on FTA partner selection.  To determine the potential economic and commercial significance of these  FTAs, we analyzed official U.S. trade and investment data, as well as  studies and analyses from USTR, Commerce, ITC, and trade experts. To  determine the nature of the congressional consultation process and how  well it has worked in practice, we reviewed consultation provisions from  the Trade Act of 1974 up through the Trade Act of 2002, analyzed USTR\u2019s  congressional consultation logs, and interviewed current and former staff  of USTR and the congressional committees that had participated in these  consultation meetings. In our congressional interviews, we interviewed  House and Senate committees, including majority and minority staffs, of  the trade, agriculture, and other committees of jurisdiction. To determine  the nature of the consultation process for the trade advisory committees  and how well it worked in practice, we reviewed relevant provisions in the  Trade Act of 1974, the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), and  TPA; analyzed meeting records, charter information, and committee  rosters; and interviewed 16 of the relevant 27 trade advisory committee  chairs, judgmentally selected from the policy and technical levels of the  system, as well as select committee members referred to us by the chairs,  and the agency officials responsible for overseeing these committees. We  also updated findings from prior GAO work on the trade advisory  committees.

The bill  granting this \u201cfast track\u201d authority, renamed TPA, passed the House by one  vote amid contentious debate, with a noticeable split along party lines.  Although delegation of the constitutional authority to \u201cregulate commerce  with foreign nations\u201d dates back to 1934 and some form of fast track  authority was granted by Congress to every president since 1974, the  Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 restored this authority  after an 8-year hiatus.", "Congress accompanied this grant with statutorily defined objectives for  the trade negotiations and requirements that the administration consult  with Congress and other stakeholders before, during, and after the  negotiations. If Congress decided that the President hadn\u2019t satisfied his or  her obligations to consult under TPA, the implementing legislation could  be treated like any other bill. Congress has applied TPA procedures to  every implementing bill submitted under the Trade Act, according to  USTR. Additional information about the history of the consultation  requirements can be found in appendix II.", "TPA also requires the administration to consult with private sector  advisory committees. It continues the advisory committee system  established under the Trade Act of 1974, which was intended to ensure  that representatives from private business and other groups with a stake in  trade policy could provide input before, during, and after negotiations. The  system has a three-tier structure of committees to advise the President on  (1) overall trade policy, (2) general policy areas, and (3) technical aspects  of trade agreements. The law requires the President to consult with these  committees on a continuing and timely basis. Each advisory committee  must submit a report to Congress and the President on each trade  agreement negotiated under TPA no later than 30 days after the President  notifies Congress of his or her intent to enter into the agreement.  The  system comprises about 700 advisors across 28 committees broadly  representative of the U.S. economy and various trade policy interests.", "The Trade Act of 1974 also requires USTR to provide an opportunity to  private organizations or groups outside the advisory committee system to  present their views on trade issues. To comply with this requirement,  USTR publishes a Federal Register notice and the Trade Policy Staff  Committee conducts a hearing. The public can comment on any matter  relevant to the proposed agreement in response to the Federal Register  notice, either in writing or at the public hearing. USTR also consults with  groups outside of these mechanisms; sometimes USTR is contacted, and  sometimes USTR seeks out comments.", "We reported on the trade advisory committee system in 2002 and found  that it has made valuable contributions to U.S. trade policy and  agreements. We also found, however, that consultations were not always  timely or useful and that the process needed greater accountability.  Furthermore, we found that committee structure and composition had not  been updated to reflect changes in the U.S. economy and trade policy. In  response to these findings, USTR and the other managing agencies have  taken several actions, including the installation of a secure Web site for  viewing draft agreement text; reconfiguration of the committee system;  introduction of a monthly teleconference of chairs; and introduction of  periodic plenary sessions for the third tier technical committees.", "TPA was actively used by the President. In addition to pursuing numerous  FTAs, a global round of trade liberalization talks at the WTO launched in  November 2001 was subsequently notified under TPA. WTO talks made  some progress, but they were not concluded by the July 1, 2007, deadline  TPA set for an agreement to qualify. The President has called on Congress  to renew TPA, in part to continue pursuit of WTO talks in hopes of  achieving fundamental global agriculture reform and meaningful reduction  in trade barriers to goods and services worldwide. Some in Congress are  supportive, but others are skeptical, making an examination of recent  experience under TPA timely.

Among the foreign policy considerations for selecting FTA  partners are the strengthening of strategic relationships and the promotion  of reform in partner countries.

Particularly following the September 11  terrorist attacks and the onset of the Iraq war, pursuing FTAs with  moderate Muslim countries became a significant policy goal. In May 2003,  the President announced a Middle East Free Trade Initiative, which lays  out a plan of graduated steps for Middle Eastern nations to increase trade  and investment with the United States. Under this initiative, the United  States has entered into FTAs with Morocco and Bahrain and has approved  an FTA with Oman. This is in addition to the FTAs the United States  already had with Israel and Jordan. USTR indicated in its November 2004  letter of intent to enter into an FTA with Oman, for example, that Oman, as  a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, will \u201ccontinue to be an  important strategic colleague on a broad array of foreign and national  security issues.\u201d The United States has sought to strengthen strategic  relationships through FTAs in other regions as well.

For example, as the U.S.- Chile FTA negotiations were drawing to a close, the United States  announced its intent to enter into FTA negotiations with the Central  American countries of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and  Nicaragua under CAFTA and later announced its intent to include the  Dominican Republic in those negotiations. USTR also submitted a letter of  intent to enter into FTA negotiations with the Andean countries of  Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia under the Andean FTA. The  individual letters of intent to enter in FTA negotiations with these ten  countries cited the complementary nature of these negotiations, which  would lend momentum to concluding the Free Trade Area of the Americas  (FTAA). Agency officials explained that when the United States pursues  individual bilateral FTAs, one goal is to enable them to be woven into  regional agreements under the mantle of broader integration. The  individual letters of intent to enter into FTA negotiations with Thailand  and Malaysia also cited the Enterprise for ASEAN Initiative as a factor in  the selection process, building upon the U.S.-Singapore FTA. The  administration envisioned similar regional or subregional trading groups  for the Middle East (the Middle East Free Trade Area) and South Africa  (SACU, Southern African Customs Union). (See fig. 1.)", "For certain developing country FTA partners, one motivation in U.S.  selection was converting one-way U.S. trade preference programs into  two-way reciprocal agreements. Agency officials explained that under  preference programs such as the Generalized System of Preferences and  the Caribbean Basin Initiative, developing countries have preferential  duty-free access to the American market without having to reciprocate; by  entering into FTAs with them, the United States \u201clevels the playing field\u201d  by gaining market access in these countries. Public documents related to  the SACU trade negotiations, for example, noted an opportunity to replace  the African Growth and Opportunity Act trade preference program with  an FTA for several of the partner countries. The Andean FTA was  motivated in part by a desire to replace the Andean Trade Preference  Agreement, while the CAFTA-DR was motivated in part by a desire to  replace a major portion of the Caribbean Basin Initiative. Furthermore,  USTR officials noted that transitioning from unilateral trade preferences to  reciprocal trade agreements would deepen existing regional integration.  USTR identified section 202(b) of the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade  Partnership Act as an example of how this evolution was also a goal that  Congress shared."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Under TPA, the Administration Pursued Strategies of Competitive Liberalization and Comprehensive FTAs", "paragraphs": ["As WTO negotiations have repeatedly stalled in the face of wide  substantive differences, particularly over agriculture, the United States  has sought to continue to be active in pursuing trade agreements at other  levels, even prior to TPA. As part of its mission to play the leading role in  developing and coordinating U.S. trade policy, USTR pursued trade  agreements throughout the 1990s not only at the global level through the  WTO, but also at the bilateral and multilateral levels, such as through the  U.S.-Jordan FTA and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).", "Since TPA passage, USTR officials stressed that they would  simultaneously pursue bilateral, multilateral, and global trade agreements  under a strategy referred to as \u201ccompetitive liberalization,\u201d or more  recently as \u201ccomplementary liberalization.\u201d This competitive liberalization  strategy linked trade policy to foreign policy, security policy, and  commercial policy goals. Although still committed to liberalization on a  global front, working in parallel with the WTO framework offered an  opportunity to keep the concept of achieving liberalization moving  forward despite setbacks at the global level.", "Competitive liberalization had the dual goal of providing momentum for  global trade liberalization and providing an alternative if global trade talks  failed to progress. As former U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick  explained in 2002, \u201cwe will not passively accept a veto over America\u2019s  drive to open markets. We want to encourage reformers who favor free  trade. If others do not want to move forward, the United States will move  ahead with those who do.\u201d Agency officials say that, due to its importance  to the global trading system and the potential of more significant and  broad-based economic gains, the successful completion of global trade  agreements such as the WTO Doha Round is the administration\u2019s ultimate  goal and that FTAs were intended to serve as a stepping stone to that goal  since they can provide a substantial demonstration effect. U.S. Trade  Representative Susan Schwab said in her May 2006 Senate confirmation  hearing that pursuing FTAs helps \u201cto establish the breadth and scope of  potential multilateral agreements in years to come by setting precedents  and by demonstrating the real benefits of free and fair trade.\u201d For example,  according to administration officials, signing NAFTA contributed to  moving the last (Uruguay) round of global trade talks creating the WTO to  conclusion. Additionally, FTAs were seen as a tool to strengthen  relationships with trading partners similarly seeking progress in global  liberalization. In the letter announcing its intent to negotiate an FTA with  Australia, for example, the USTR stated \u201cwe believe that an FTA would  further unite and strengthen the alliance of countries leading the effort  toward global trade liberalization.\u201d The second goal of competitive  liberalization was to provide an alternative venue for pursuing trade  liberalization as WTO talks lagged. However, whereas competitive  liberalization sought to pressure other countries to agree to tariff and  subsidy cuts in the WTO, complementary liberalization sees the  simultaneous pursuit of FTAs and WTO negotiations as a mutually  reinforcing effort. Former U.S. Trade Representative Robert Portman  explained in 2006 that, \u201cwhere we have a free trade agreement, we find we  have\u2026the ability to have a better relationship on the multilateral issues   it\u2019s relatively easy on the global stage\u2026to find some solutions.\u201d", "Closely tied to the strategy of competitive/complementary liberalization is  the strategy of pursuing only highly comprehensive \u201cgold standard\u201d  bilateral and regional FTAs. Such agreements have a number of absolute  requirements, based on the model USTR seeks to use. NAFTA was the  original \u201cmodel,\u201d although requirements have evolved with time and with  different regions. USTR insists, for example, that partners accept the  inclusion of agriculture, as well as a \u201cnegative list\u201d approach to services,  because they believe this will provide greater liberalization and lessen  impediments to securing market access. Agency officials did say there is  some room to change specific language depending on a country\u2019s  individual needs, such as changing what level of market access would be  proposed, and the timetable for phasing down barriers. However, officials  also noted that taking products, sectors, or issues off the table, particularly  ones such as intellectual property rights that are considered to provide a  U.S. competitive advantage, generally precludes or creates an impasse in  negotiations. Other countries that negotiate FTAs frequently exclude  sensitive industries or issues. Some trade experts argued that USTR\u2019s  pursuit of comprehensive agreements limits potential FTA partners since a  number of larger economies are unwilling to enter into such  comprehensive negotiations. Administration officials recognized this and  cited the EU, Switzerland, and Japan as examples of major trading  partners with which an FTA with the United States could have significant  commercial value but where the trading partner appears unwilling to  assume obligations consistent with the objectives set out in TPA. USTR  reports that it paused negotiations pursued under TPA with other large  countries or subregions, such as the FTAA and SACU, in part for similar  reasons. At the same time, some partners were not considered ready for  FTAs because they either were not WTO members or had only recently  acceded.", "Agency officials told us that a number of interrelated factors influenced  their decision to pursue exclusively comprehensive trade agreements:    Legislative requirements\u2013Agency officials told us that TPA legislation  played a large role in the decision to pursue only comprehensive FTAs.  Since, under TPA, each agreement must make progress in meeting the  applicable negotiating objectives prescribed by Congress, USTR only  pursues FTAs in which the negotiating objectives are translated into 16  standard chapter headings, and the provisions require partner countries to  pursue a number of nontariff based reforms. These include transparency  in government procurement, protection from discrimination for investors,  and liberalization of financial and other services. Agency officials told us  that USTR has some discretion in how to pursue these objectives, but  since the objectives are statutorily mandated, their discretion starts at a  fairly high bar.", "Foreign and economic policy goals\u2013The administration has said that  pursuing comprehensive FTAs links trade policy to foreign policy and  security policy goals. According to USTR, comprehensive FTAs include a  number of provisions linking the trade agreement to other goals such as  encouraging reform and openness, strengthening partners\u2019 regulatory  environments, and establishing the framework for promoting democracy.  Furthermore, agency officials and trade experts stressed that if the United  States pursued FTAs with \u201csweetheart exemptions\u201d it would actually be  undermining the international trading system in violation of WTO rules  and regulations. Furthermore, agency officials questioned whether  pursuing noncomprehensive FTAs would lead to noticeable commercial  gains since trade barriers with large trading partners usually only remain  in sensitive industries.", "Private sector input\u2013Since all trade agreements must be approved by  Congress, USTR officials told us they only negotiate agreements that they  think will receive broad domestic support. As private sector  representatives have identified certain \u201cdeal breakers,\u201d which must be  included in order to gain their support, USTR officials always include  these topics in the FTAs they negotiate. These topics include a negative  lists approach to services and inclusion of intellectual property protection  provisions.", "Negotiating strategy\u2013Agency officials and congressional staff involved in  trade issues also told us that since the precedent that the United States  only engages in comprehensive FTAs has been set, they have reinforced  their credibility in insisting on future comprehensive FTAs. Partner  countries also have a better sense of what the United States expects. A  trade expert we spoke with added that due to the asymmetric bargaining  strength of the United States compared with most of its negotiating  partners given the relative sizes of their economies, USTR likely has more  leverage in proposing the baseline agreement for the negotiation. On the  other hand, the United States has had less success in insisting on such requirements with some large prospective partners, such as Brazil,  Switzerland, and Japan.", "Not everyone involved in trade negotiations, however, believes that  exclusively pursuing comprehensive FTAs is in the best interest of the  United States. We heard from both the private sector and former  congressional staff that strict insistence on comprehensive FTAs may  disadvantage the United States compared with other countries that engage  in FTAs more liberally. In addition, they told us that \u201cone size does not fit  all\u201d and developing countries need help to develop before they trade with  the United States. Agency officials told us, however, that due to the factors  listed above, they remain convinced that pursuing comprehensive FTAs is  the best policy for the United States. Furthermore, they pointed out that a  prospective FTA partner\u2019s readiness to undertake obligations which would  meet TPA objectives and U.S. interests is evaluated in the selection choice.  If a country or group of countries is not ready, the United States uses other  mechanisms such as Trade and Investment Framework Agreements as  building blocks, including capacity building."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FTAs Pursued Account for Limited Share of U.S. Trade and Investment but Include Diverse Markets for U.S. Exports", "paragraphs": ["Trade with countries for which FTAs were pursued under TPA accounted  for about 16 percent of U.S. trade in 2006 and about 16 percent of U.S.  foreign direct investment in 2005.

As noted  previously, the United States has sought elimination of substantially all  trade barriers under its FTAs in order to maximize the overall economic  benefits of the agreements. While reduction or elimination of trade  barriers through FTAs has been estimated to create an overall net  economic benefit for the United States and its FTA partners, most  economic studies find the gains for the United States of the FTAs to be  relatively small compared with the overall U.S. economy. Assessments by  ITC of economy-wide and sectoral effects of actual, completed FTAs also  indicate positive but generally small effects on the U.S. economy and trade  overall. (The U.S. FTA with South Korea is predicted to have modest  effects.)  However, with the exception of Singapore, given the FTA  partners\u2019 generally higher trade barriers, U.S. export gains are predicted to  be larger than import increases for each FTA the ITC has assessed. For  South Korea, U.S. exports are predicted to rise by $9.7 to 10.9 billion, while  U.S. imports from South Korea rise by $6.4 to $6.9 billion.", "While FTAs require the United States to lower its trade barriers, several  FTA partners pursued under TPA already had special access to the U.S.  market through U.S. trade preference programs. For example, CAFTA-DR  economies had preferential access to the U.S. market through the  Generalized System of Preferences and the Caribbean Basin Initiative  (including the Caribbean Basin Trade Promotion Act, which provided  additional access). However, FTAs provide superior market access for  several reasons. First, product coverage under FTAs is more complete.  About 91 percent of products in the U.S. tariff schedule (for goods) are  either eligible for preferential access (54 percent) or are already duty-free  for most countries (37 percent). The remaining 9 percent of products are  still dutiable even for countries eligible for preference programs. FTAs  eliminate nearly all U.S. duties on these remaining products. Second, FTAs  are bilateral agreements that provide trade partners with permanent  access to the U.S. market. Preference programs are unilateral programs  that need reauthorization. Lapses in authorization have created  uncertainty in the past for both foreign exporters and investors. Finally,  since preference programs are unilateral, U.S. exporters do not receive  preferential duty-free access to foreign beneficiary markets. FTAs address  this disparity.", "FTAs also help U.S. exports maintain a competitive advantage or  counteract the advantages of third-country competitors that may already  have better access to foreign markets through their own FTAs. In cases in  which competitors do not have an FTA with U.S. FTA partners, U.S.  exports gain an advantage over exports from competitors. The edge varies  by country and product and depends on the restrictiveness of the tariff  and nontariff barriers in our FTA partners\u2019 economies. For example, in  CAFTA-DR countries, the simple average tariff rate across all products  ranged from 5.6 to 8.5 percent in 2006, with tariffs on agricultural products  ranging from 9.7 to 13.1 percent. Non-FTA countries must still pay these  rates on their exports. U.S. \u201cmost favored nation\u201d tariff rates, which apply  to all but two U.S. partners (North Korea and Cuba) that do not otherwise  qualify for special, lower, rates, by comparison, were 3.5 percent overall  and 5.3 percent for agricultural products. In some countries, average most  favored nation tariff rates are even higher on agricultural products relative  to those on nonagricultural products. For example, according to the  WTO, the overall average tariff rate for South Korea on all products was  12.1 percent, but 47.8 percent for agricultural products. Table 8 in  appendix III shows the simple average tariff rates (non-FTA rates) across  U.S. FTA partners to provide an indication of the tariff benefits provided  by FTAs. For countries that have FTAs with trade partners besides the  United States, FTAs help restore the competitiveness of U.S. exports by  providing comparable access. For example, Chile also has FTAs with  Canada, Mexico, and the EU, as well as the United States. If the United  States did not have an FTA with Chile, then U.S. exporters would be at a  disadvantage relative to exporters from Canada, Mexico, and the EU. On  the other hand, since FTA partners are free to enter into additional  agreement with other countries, any advantage gained for U.S. exporters  may be temporary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Majority of Trade Already Covered by FTAs Prior to TPA or Not Pursued under TPA", "paragraphs": ["Non-FTA trade partners accounted for over half (56 percent) of U.S. trade  in 2006.

As discussed  previously, the United States seeks to include agricultural liberalization in  its FTA agreements. This is a sensitive issue with the EU that is also being  dealt with at the WTO and has made prospects for a U.S.-EU FTA less  likely. Since trade barriers on nonagricultural products between the U.S.  and EU are already very low, an FTA that did not include agriculture  would have less impact. Similarly, agriculture issues are sensitive with  Japan and Switzerland. However, the United States did pursue an FTA  with South Korea, which also had sensitive agricultural issues but was  willing to address them within the context of an FTA. Although agriculture  is also a sensitive issue with China, the country also recently acceded to  the WTO (December 2001), is still implementing those commitments, and  has been in transition to a more market-based economy. Similarly, Taiwan  has recently acceded to the WTO.", "After the top few non-FTA trade partners, remaining trade partners each  account for about 1 percent or less of U.S. trade. Since most of the  smaller non-FTA trade partners are WTO members, successful conclusion  of the WTO Doha Round would still provide market liberalization.  However, a Doha agreement would be less likely to completely eliminate  trade barriers; FTAs provide much deeper liberalization for individual  countries by eliminating trade barriers between the United States and its  FTA partners. Nevertheless, various studies conclude that a Doha  agreement, even though unlikely to eliminate all trade barriers, would still  have a much larger impact on global\u2014and overall U.S.\u2014trade than  eliminating all trade barriers with small non-FTA partners.", "Comparing countries pursued under TPA with those not pursued shows  some differences in the U.S. trade and investment relationship between  these two groups.

They also praised USTR\u2019s  willingness to answer questions and follow up on particular issues of  interest. The general view was that USTR was very responsive in  answering questions and providing follow-up information.", "In terms of satisfaction that the consultation meetings provided an  opportunity for input or influence on the trade negotiations, however, the  committee staff we interviewed were fairly evenly divided. Slightly less  than half of the congressional staff we interviewed felt that the  consultation meetings had met their expectations in this respect as well.  They were satisfied that they had been fully briefed, and the USTR  negotiators had listened to their views. They indicated that they knew that  USTR could not always obtain the results their committee or their Member  of Congress wanted, but felt that their views had been taken into  consideration. However, slightly more than half of the congressional  committee staff with whom we spoke felt that they did not have any real  input or influence on the trade negotiations. For these staff, USTR\u2019s  consultation meetings had not met their expectations because they had  not provided an opportunity for a two-way exchange of information that  the staff considered a true consultation. One committee staff person  appeared to reflect the views of these staff in characterizing the  consultations as a good conduit for information flow from USTR, but not  as a good forum for working together and developing policy jointly. Others  characterized the meetings as helping them feel well-briefed, but not  consulted. Among these staff, several said they felt that USTR was  \u201cchecking the box\u201d in their meetings with them.

Overall, on this issue, the degree to which the  committee staff we interviewed felt that they had input or influence on  trade negotiations varied across parties. In particular, Republican staff  (which was in the majority in Congress for nearly all of the TPA period)  generally had more positive views about their input and influence than  Democrats.", "We also found mixed views among the staff we interviewed on whether  the timing of the consultations gave sufficient time for staff to provide  meaningful input. Most, but not all, of the staff of the trade and agriculture  committees said the timeliness of consultations was good. However, staff  from the other committees of jurisdiction often said that the consultations  were not timely and cited this as a reason that they felt briefed rather than  consulted. They said that they generally weren\u2019t briefed and given  information until the last business day before the negotiators were leaving  for the next round. This did not give them enough time to fully consider  the information, consult with their committee or Member to develop a  response, and give feedback that USTR would have time to consider.  These staff felt strongly that one way to achieve more meaningful  congressional input was to allow more time for feedback by having earlier  consultations and by providing them with text or other information in a  more timely manner. In addition, staff of one of the primary committees of  jurisdiction complained of last-minute consultations on some of the more  controversial issues. While they understood that the interagency process  took time and that USTR was moving as quickly as possible, they felt that  if congressional consultation was meant to be meaningful, USTR could  either build in the time needed for congressional consultation or delay  tabling the controversial text at the next negotiating round to allow time  for congressional input.", "Among the committee staff who had expressed satisfaction with the  consultation meetings, several noted that the style of the briefer was  important. In some cases, the briefers tended to keep the briefing short  and let committee staff ask questions. The staff we spoke with said that if  they asked a question, the briefers would answer it fully. But, if staffers  didn\u2019t know what to ask, they were at a disadvantage in obtaining  pertinent information. They said that most staff depended on the briefers  to let them know about issues of concern. This was very important to  them. It was much more helpful when the briefers provided the context  and alerted them to any changes in the text or any areas of concern  developing in the negotiations.", "Several other committee staff, who were dissatisfied with the  consultations, expressed a much more negative view about briefers\u2019  willingness to share information. While they agreed that the information  USTR provided was generally of good quality, they said there were  instances when, in their opinion, USTR deliberately did not offer  information on changes to the negotiated text that would be of concern to  staffers, unless they asked specific questions, which they often did not  know to ask. One committee staff said that this had been the case, for  example, with the U.S.-Korea FTA, in which significant changes had been  made to the investment chapter. Although the committee staff had  received the amended text, USTR did not mention that changes had been  made to a sensitive provision in the Expropriation Annex, which the  committee staff said was extremely controversial\u2014to the point that the  language in the text had been carefully worked out in the 2001-2002 time  period and then never touched again. The staff person said that this text  was considered to be \u201cset in stone,\u201d and any change to it clearly merited  mention by USTR. With the press of business during consideration of the  U.S.-Korea FTA, the committee staff had not realized that it had been  changed, and they didn\u2019t learn about it until they were alerted by the  private sector. The committee staff who were dissatisfied with the  consultations also said that there had been instances when it appeared  USTR had withheld information. For example, several committee staff  mentioned that a controversy related to the Australia FTA  pharmaceuticals benefits scheme resulted from USTR withholding  information. Again, committee staff found out about the controversial  provisions from the private sector when the text was made public. In  another example, some committee staff said that USTR had not adequately  briefed Judiciary Committee staff on the H1-B visas issue with the Chile  and Singapore FTAs. While there was disagreement among the staff who  commented on this as to whether USTR had adequately briefed the staff or  withheld critical information, a lack of clarity in the consultations did  result in the Judiciary Committee being highly upset about this issue. (As a  result of the Judiciary Committee\u2019s views, USTR significantly modified its  objectives regarding immigration. Subsequent agreements have either  included a side letter stating that the agreement has no effect on U.S.  immigration law or policy or, in more recent agreements, this type of  provision has been included in the text of the agreement.) These staff felt  strongly that in order for the consultation process to work, Members of  Congress and committee staff need to know that USTR will always make a  good faith effort to tell them when substantive changes to the model text  have been made in the negotiations.

While Members  supporting free trade had no problem in principle with negotiating FTAs  with smaller countries for foreign policy or other reasons, if Members  were going to be expending significant political capital, they wanted it to  at least be economically and commercially beneficial.

These staff  said that although committee staff on the trade and agricultural  committees are knowledgeable about their fields, trade negotiations are  today too broad and complex for any one staff member to fully understand  all of the implications. One trade staff told us that staff on the other  committees of jurisdiction are at a disadvantage because trade is not their  primary issue, and they don\u2019t have time to follow it. Having access to  expert staff, such as through a congressional trade office, would be very  helpful, according to one committee staff. Another committee staff  opposed what they feared might be creation of an additional bureaucracy  with a new trade office and instead said that GAO could serve this role.", "In principle, the formal private sector trade advisors could help fill this  void. However, committee staff said that they did not have contact with  them during the FTA negotiations. One staff said that they used to be  invited to trade advisory committee meetings, but no longer. Although the  trade advisory committees provide extensive technical information to  Congress in their required reports on each FTA at the end of the process,  committee staff did not have access to their substantial knowledge base  during the negotiations.", "A related issue raised by a few staff on some of the nontrade committees  of jurisdiction was that trade negotiations involve a great deal of  specialized terminology and information. Staff of one committee said that  sometimes they found it difficult to fully understand the briefings because  the negotiators used so much jargon. They said that it would be helpful if  USTR developed a primer describing the typical evolution of the trade  negotiations process and providing a glossary of trade terms.

The Senate  staff said that this was more a matter related to internal congressional  security issues than to USTR. Until this year, the Senate committee staff  that have access to the classified negotiating texts said they received hard  copy information because the Senate was unable to resolve security  concerns to allow electronic access. When USTR sent a hard copy to the  Office of Senate Security, it took the office a day to log it in and notify staff  of its availability. Then staff had to make an appointment to go to a secure  room in the Capitol in order to read these documents. The result was that  they had a significantly smaller window of time to access the documents  than if they had been immediately available electronically. Staffers said  that recently a computer in a Senate office building had been made  available for this purpose. While this was an improvement, they would  prefer to have access in their own offices, or at least their own buildings.  On the House side, committee staff did not have any electronic access to  USTR\u2019s secure Web site, as of the end of August 2007. However, several  committee staff said that access was being planned and would greatly  improve timely staff access to negotiating information.", "USTR officials said that they would welcome expansion of congressional  access to USTR\u2019s secure Web site. They also said that an important related  issue is whether congressional staff working on FTAs under negotiation  had security clearances.

We spoke with 16 chairs  of the relevant 27 trade advisory committees, as well as five additional  committee members. They reported that consultations were generally  extensive in number. The chairs and members, however, had mixed  reactions as to whether the nature of the consultations, quality of  information provided, and feedback received were satisfactory.

The first and  third tier chairs we contacted generally felt that these consultations  provided the committees with important access to the administration and  ongoing negotiations. From fiscal year 2002 through May of fiscal year  2007, USTR met with the 16 ITACs a total of 729 times. From fiscal year  2002 through fiscal year 2006, USTR met with the six ATACs a total of 92  times. Most of these meetings were in person, although conference calls  were sometimes held for fast-moving issues or during the 30-day time  frame for report writing. In addition, USTR established a monthly  conference call for all trade advisory committee chairs, beginning in late  2002.", "The number of consultations with USTR was more limited at the second  tier policy committee level. Although USTR has met fairly regularly with  APAC and TEPAC over the past 5 years, the LAC had no meetings for over  2 years from September 2003 to November 2005. Furthermore, IGPAC did  not have an in-person consultation with USTR from July 2005 to  September 2007. In late 2006, USTR instituted a monthly conference call  for IGPAC, together with state points of contact. Agency officials said  this was done to broaden outreach to the states and increase the frequency  of interaction with USTR without travel costs. The officials added that  they have also convened additional IGPAC conference call meetings, as  needed on particular issues. LAC and TEPAC (as well as ACTPN) have  liaison groups that meet more often. For example, the TEPAC liaison  group tries to meet every 4 to 6 weeks.

For example, one third  tier chair said that his expectations were met since the process works well  to facilitate access between negotiators and private sector representatives,  and the administration seems to take consultations seriously. The second  tier committees in particular, however, stated that their advice and  opinions were not considered. A few of the third tier committees  concurred. Those who said their expectations were not met told us their  committees were not being used properly. According to a few of these  chairs, while the administration has consultation meetings with them, they  are more to \u201ccheck off the box\u201d than to engage in meaningful dialogue.  The chairs feel that the administration tells them what has already been  decided upon instead of soliciting their advice. Furthermore, two ITAC  chairs told us that it is more effective to use venues other than the  advisory committee system to provide meaningful input. For example, one  chair said that a coalition of industry-related companies outside of the  ITAC is the major venue for consultations with the administration for that  industry. The chair told us that the ITAC advisory process tends to be at  the end of negotiations and is not as significant as it should be. At the  same time, the chair felt the ITAC did play a role in the consultation  process. Although it could not consult at the highly technical level that the  coalition could, it was able to consult on the broad direction of U.S. trade  policy for that industry. USTR officials told us that the fact that the advice  of any particular advisory committee may not be reflected in a trade  agreement does not mean that the advice was not carefully considered.  USTR emphasized that it does consider advice from its advisory  committees in formulating U.S. trade policy. At the same time, however,  USTR also acknowledged that for some contentious issues, the advice is  not in line with long-standing U.S. policy or congressional guidance set out  in TPA. In those instances, USTR told us they are very limited in what they  can do in response to advisory committee advice. This appears to be  particularly problematic for second tier policy advisory committees. For  example, the strength and reach of FTA investment provisions and dispute  settlement mechanisms have long been a concern of both IGPAC and  TEPAC. LAC, meanwhile, has criticized the worker rights standards and  dispute settlement mechanisms in FTAs as insufficient.", "Overall, the first tier and most of the third tier committee chairs we  interviewed felt that the information USTR provided was of high quality  and detail, providing a mixture of publicly available information and more  proprietary, confidential information. Most of the second tier policy  committee and a few third tier technical committee chairs in our selection,  however, were not satisfied with the quality of information presented  during consultations and felt that it was no better than information  available to the general public. Of those committees, one chair felt USTR  was constantly holding back information, and the committee learned  something new only every seventh or eighth meeting. Another chair  expressed frustration at trying to get information as negotiations were in  progress, saying that USTR was reluctant to state what the other country  was proposing. Two of the chairs who were dissatisfied went on to say  that although most of the information presented is available publicly,  having access to administration officials was valuable. Several other  committee chairs also emphasized the value they place on having access  to the administration through the advisory committee process.", "Approximately half of the advisory committee chairs with whom we spoke  felt that the administration was responsive to their advice and provided  feedback, whether or not their advice was incorporated into the  agreement. The first tier and over half of the third tier committee chairs  feel there is an adequate opportunity for dialogue and that their interests  are considered. Most of the second tier and a few of the third tier  committee chairs, however, expressed dissatisfaction with the feedback  from USTR. They expressed their perception that USTR is either biased  against their committee or that by being asked to comment on completed  deals, their opinions are not truly valued or taken into consideration. Two  chairs said USTR wants them to \u201crubber-stamp\u201d decisions or to be  \u201ccheerleaders\u201d for the administration. Other chairs said their committees  rarely or never get feedback.", "In general, the advisory committee chairs we spoke with were pleased  with the numerous changes that have been made to the advisory  committee system in response to GAO\u2019s 2002 report. In particular,  members found the secure Web site very useful. A quarter of the chairs  said that having text on the Web site sooner, or when USTR says it will be  posted, would be helpful, but they agreed that the secure Web site was a  valuable tool. Three-quarters of the chairs we interviewed had no  complaints about the reconfiguration of the committee system to more  closely align with the current U.S. economy, although chairs and members  from slightly over a third of the committees we interviewed found  problems with the representation of interests on their individual  committees. Ten of the 16 chairs with whom we spoke did not find the  monthly chairs\u2019 teleconference call useful, primarily because of a lack of  detailed information; those chairs located in Washington, D.C., cited lack  of new information. Furthermore, 8 of the 11 chairs we interviewed whose  committees are invited to the newly instituted periodic plenary meetings  (ATACs and ITACs) did not find them useful. A couple of those chairs did  acknowledge, however, that their out-of-town members might find them  more useful and that they are a good opportunity to hear cabinet-level  speakers to whom they would not routinely have access. Beyond the  plenary meetings, several chairs, particularly among the ITACs, said that  more interaction with other advisory committees would be useful.  Currently, only three ITACs (Customs Matters and Trade Facilitation,  Intellectual Property Rights, and Standards and Technical Trade Barriers)  allow for members from other ITACs to sit in on meetings in a nonvoting  capacity.

Chairs told us the text  was not available to their committees until between 7 and 14 of the 30 days  had passed. Furthermore, although some issues such as rice had been  agreed upon in principle between the United States and South Korea at the  conclusion of the agreement and the advisors had been briefed on the  results, the final text had not yet been written. According to administration  officials, the FTA with South Korea was an exception, since USTR was  rushing to finish negotiations before TPA expired. Committee chairs told  us, however, that meeting the 30-day deadline has been difficult for other  FTAs as well. One of the second tier policy committee chairs, for example,  noted that the committee did not have access to the agricultural sections  of the final text of the Colombia FTA in time to complete the review prior  to issuing a committee report. The committee therefore had to submit a  pro forma letter, noting that they would provide a more detailed  addendum to their report after the full text became available. A third tier  committee chair told us that his committee regularly reserves the right to  amend its report. USTR officials acknowledged that the time frame for  report writing has been problematic for years. Furthermore, they pointed  out that as USTR is actually tasked with sending all of the committee  reports within 30 days to Congress, they need at least a couple of days to  collect reports from the various committees, make copies, and then send  them by courier.", "It is also difficult for the ITC to provide in the specified time frame its  statutorily required report assessing the likely impact of the agreement  on the U.S. economy and specific industry sectors because of delays in  receiving the final agreement text. The President is required to provide the  ITC with the details of the agreement, as it exists at that time, 90 days  before the date on which the President enters into the agreement. The ITC  has a total of 180 days from that date to hold any hearings, do its analysis,  and submit its report. TPA also requires the President to update ITC on the  details of the agreement during this period. According to ITC officials, the  deadline is often difficult to make due to last minute changes and late  delivery of the final text. These officials told us that ITC sometimes does  not get the full text of the agreement and all of the annexes until they are  already more than halfway through the 180-day period. The ITC officials  agreed with advisory committee chairs who suggested that a longer report  writing window would be useful.

Congress requires, through the Trade Act of 1974, that the  President seek information and advice from representative elements of the  private sector and the nonfederal government sector through trade  advisory committees that include representatives of certain interests. For  example, the first tier ACTPN is to include representatives of nonfederal  governments, labor, agriculture, small business, environmental and  conservation organizations, and consumer interests, among others. The  third tier committees are to be representative, insofar as is practicable, of  all industry, labor, agricultural, or service interests in the sector or  functional areas concerned. After we reported in 2002 that the committee  system\u2019s structure needed to be revisited, USTR and managing agencies  worked with Congress in reconfiguring some of the committees. For  example, the LAC membership now includes primarily union presidents to  ensure that the administration receives advice from the highest levels.  Furthermore, the 21 industry functional and sector committees were  realigned and streamlined into 16 industry committees to more accurately  reflect the current U.S. economy and trade policy needs. USTR and the  other managing agencies, however, still have had difficulty incorporating  nonbusiness stakeholders into the committees. For example, USTR said it  has had difficulties finding labor representatives willing to serve on  ACTPN, the overall policy first tier committee that is required to be  broadly representative of key sectors and groups affected by trade. Just  under half of the committee members with whom we spoke expressed  frustration with the current composition of their committees. Members  who were dissatisfied with representation told us either that they felt that  certain relevant viewpoints were not adequately represented or that the  composition favored representation of one industry or group at the  expense of another. Furthermore, some members are the sole  representative of a nonbusiness interest on their committee. The  nonbusiness members we spoke with told us that although their interest is  now represented, they still feel isolated within their own committee. The  result is the perception that their minority perspective is not influential.", "Available public information makes it difficult to determine what  perspective or interest a committee member represents. For example,  USTR officials pointed to the charters of the committees for which USTR  is the principal administrator for guidelines as to which representatives  they select. The charter for TEPAC, however, simply says that members  shall be from environmental interest groups, industry, agriculture,  services, nonfederal governments, and consumer interests, and that they  shall be broadly representative of key sectors and groups with an interest  in trade and environmental policy issues. The Department of Labor\u2019s  charter for LAC only says members will be selected from the U.S. labor  community. In addition to charters, the Departments of Agriculture and  Commerce also put out Federal Register notices soliciting new members.  These notices stipulate that members must have expertise and knowledge  of trade issues relevant to the committees and that geographic,  demographic, and sector balance will be sought. Neither the charters nor  the Federal Register notices, however, explain how the agencies actually  determined which representatives they placed on committees, although  these are the documents agencies continually referred us to for this  information. Without reporting such an explanation, it is not transparent  how agencies followed their own guidelines for member selection or met  statutory representation requirements.", "It is also not always transparent from the final roster which interest a  particular member represents. The FACA required the President to report  annually on the status of advisory committees, although this requirement  was terminated in 2000. The General Services Administration now  collects this information from the relevant executive branch agencies and  posts it on the FACA database (a publicly available database on  committees operating under FACA). While the Department of Commerce  reports on the specific interest each committee member represents, USTR  and the Departments of Agriculture and Labor do not. Instead, they list the  member\u2019s occupation or affiliation. However, it is not always possible to  deduce from that information a member\u2019s represented interest, as for  example, several committee members are from law firms or large  companies that deal with a variety of issues. Listing the name of the firm  or company alone does not necessarily indicate representation of a  particular interest.

Originally, FACA  called for the termination of advisory committees every 2 years unless  renewed or its duration is otherwise provided for by law. Legislation  passed in 2004 in response to our 2002 report leaves it to the discretion of  the President whether or not to extend the charters of the trade advisory  committees established under the Trade Act of 1974 to 4 years. All of  these committees, with the exception of LAC, now have 4-year charters.  Department of Labor officials told us this is because of miscommunication  surrounding the 2004 legislation. Charters of several committees have  been allowed to lapse recently, however, resulting in committees not being  able to meet for extended periods of time (up to 7 months in the case of  LAC). Furthermore, the process of selecting and appointing committee  members requires a number of time-consuming steps. The Department of  Commerce, for example, starts the process of appointing new members  approximately 9 months prior to the ITACs\u2019 charter expiration dates, to try  and ensure that the work of the ITACs does not stop, and has been  successful in avoiding lapses as a result. However, other agencies do not  always start this process in time for committees to begin meeting once the  charter is renewed. When both processes of rechartering and member  appointment are delayed, it further reduces a committee\u2019s ability to give  timely, official advice before the committee is terminated, and the  rechartering process has to begin again. This is particularly true in the  case of LAC, which still has a 2-year charter.", "These periods of committees not being able to meet have occurred during  important stages of the U.S. trade agenda for both bilateral agreements  and the WTO. Most recently, the charters of APAC and all six of the ATACs  expired on April 29, 2007. The Department of Agriculture began the  process of soliciting new members on March 20. Although the committees  were rechartered in late May, as of late September 2007 they had still been  unable to meet because they had not yet been repopulated. A Department  of Agriculture official told us that this is because key people responsible  for the vetting process in the undersecretary\u2019s office have been unavailable  due to travel schedules. In the interim, however, the United States signed  FTAs with Panama and South Korea on June 28 and June 30, respectively.  Although these committees were able to get their reports on the two FTAs  to USTR just before their charters expired, they have not been able to give  any official advice in the interim period, when agricultural issues\u2014 particularly rice in the FTA with South Korea\u2014were still being negotiated.  In another example, the LAC did not meet from September 2003 until  November 2005. Department of Labor officials indicated this was due in  part to the difficulty in getting members vetted and appointed. During this  more than 2-year period, the United States was not only negotiating in the  Doha Round of the WTO, but was also negotiating FTAs with numerous  countries. The administration, however, is not required to report such  lapses and the reasons behind them.

This report also examines how well the  congressional and private sector consultations worked in practice.  Although these are considered an essential check to ensure substantively  sound and well-supported agreements, our report finds room for  improvement.", "Under this TPA authority, we found USTR has pursued bilateral and  subregional FTAs in order to advance both foreign policy and economic  policy goals and as building blocks to larger regional initiatives and global  trade expansion. While many in Congress and U.S. industry have  supported these FTA negotiations, some have been concerned about the  limited economic and commercial benefits gained. However, the U.S.  standard of only negotiating comprehensive FTAs has had implications for  the universe of suitable trading partners. Certain larger trading partners  like the EU and Japan have been unwilling to open up sensitive sectors  such as agriculture bilaterally. Negotiations with some larger developing  country partners such as Brazil were ultimately abandoned, in part  because they were unwilling to accept the comprehensive template  proposed by the United States on such topics, as well as intellectual  property rights and services. The results in terms of trade coverage  illustrate the limitations of pursuing comprehensive FTAs: those in force  or concluded under TPA accounted for just 8 percent of total U.S. trade.  Yet, after the EU, Japan, and China, the trade partners that remain to be  covered by FTAs each account for relatively small shares of U.S. trade.", "TPA required that the administration consult with Congress as USTR  negotiated trade agreements. We found that USTR provided extensive  consultations on FTAs, numbering well over a thousand, over the past 5  years\u2014a significant expenditure of effort, resources, and time for an office  of about 200 staff. However, while some current and former congressional  committee staff we spoke with were satisfied with the consultations,  others still came away feeling that they had not been truly consulted,  particularly staff outside of the trade committees. Current and former  USTR negotiators we interviewed believed that congressional input was  constantly being factored into their discussions, but said lack of early  focus by Congress on agreement details often complicated USTR\u2019s ability  to incorporate congressional input. Clearly, clarification of expectations  on both sides is essential to any renewal of TPA.", "Certain procedural issues also hampered consultations. For example, most  committee staff, particularly outside the trade and agriculture committees,  often did not feel that they had the time they needed to review the  information USTR shared with them on the status of the negotiations and,  in turn, provide meaningful input. Although USTR reports that it has  already taken the step of providing committee staff that have security  clearances with the negotiating text 5 days in advance, several committee  staff told us they frequently have less time. Staff also need to obtain  security clearances if they want to be able to access the classified  negotiating text; however, some key staff still lack clearances. In addition,  some staff with clearances are only able to access text through a  cumbersome paper process, while others enjoy electronic access through  USTR\u2019s secure Web site. Discussing changes from previously proposed  text also appears essential to ensuring trust and effective communication.  However, both committee staff and former USTR negotiators commented  that process changes alone cannot resolve the issues at the heart of the  consultation controversy. They said that the political will to engage in  meaningful consultations is key and that consultations only work as well  as the political relations and good faith of players.", "Just over half of the private sector advisory committee chairs we spoke  with said they were adequately consulted and told us that having direct  access to administration officials is valuable. Nevertheless, our work  suggests that tight reporting time frames and delays in finalizing text often  compromise committees\u2019 ability to provide an advisory opinion within 30  days as to whether agreements promote U.S. economic interests, achieve  negotiating goals, and provide for equity and reciprocity, as TPA required.  The ITC faces similar challenges in securing text or agreement details that  can impede its ability to prepare required reports within statutory time  frames.

(4) What is the nature of the consultation process for  trade advisory committees and other stakeholders, and how well has it  worked in practice?", "To answer these questions, generally we reviewed documents and  interviewed officials responsible for international trade policy and  negotiations at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR); the  Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, State, and the Treasury;  and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as officials of the U.S.  International Trade Commission (ITC).", "To determine what FTAs have been pursued under TPA and why, we  reviewed USTR documents and interagency memoranda discussing FTA  partner selection and updated our findings from our prior work on FTA  partner selection. We also interviewed relevant executive branch agency  officials, both current and former, in order to gain the perspectives of  those officials involved with the earlier FTAs negotiated under TPA.

U.S. goods trade  statistics are from the Bureau of the Census, and are through 2006. U.S.  services trade and investment statistics are from the Bureau of Economic  Analysis, and are through 2005, which is the most recent year available.  For the purpose of analyzing the overall U.S. trade and investment  relationship with TPA and non-TPA trade partners, we determined that  these data are sufficiently reliable. Where we combined the two data sets  to show the share of total trade (imports plus exports of goods plus  services), the modest changes that occur from year to year would only  have a minimal effect on the shares reported and no effect on the overall  findings. We also grouped detailed U.S. goods trade statistics into two  broad categories: agriculture and manufacturing based on the Harmonized  Tariff Schedule product chapters. Chapters 1 through 24 are agriculture  and the remaining nonagricultural chapters are manufacturing. ITC  maintains the official U.S. tariff schedule. A complete list of the product  chapters of the Harmonized Tariff schedule can be found at  www.usitc.gov. Finally, in order to analyze the growth of U.S. goods trade  flows over time we used Bureau of Labor Statistics import and export  price deflators at the most disaggregated level available to adjust U.S.  trade statistics for inflation from 1992 to 2006. We did not adjust U.S.  services statistics since reliable price deflators are not available for the  time period we examined.", "To determine the nature of the congressional consultation process and  how well it has worked in practice, we reviewed fast track provisions from  the Trade Act of 1974 up through TPA to trace the evolution of the  consultation provisions. We also analyzed USTR\u2019s congressional  consultation logs in order to determine which committees USTR had  provided with consultation meetings, how often, and on which FTAs. We  interviewed USTR officials about how the log was compiled and generally  found them sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. In addition,  we interviewed current and former USTR officials who had been involved  in providing the FTA consultations, as well as current and former staff of  congressional committees that had participated in these consultation  meetings, in order to obtain their descriptions of the consultation process  and their views on what had worked well and what could be improved. In  our congressional interviews, we interviewed both House and Senate  committees, including both majority and minority staffs, of all the trade,  agriculture, and other committees of jurisdiction that had been involved in  these consultations. The committees of jurisdiction comprised the  following:    Senate Finance and House Ways and Means,    Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and House Agriculture,    Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation and House Natural  Resources (fisheries subcommittees),   Senate and House Judiciary (intellectual property rights subcommittees),    Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and House Financial Services,    Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation (telecommunications staff)  and House Energy and Commerce (telecommunications subcommittee),   Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and House Oversight  and Government Reform.", "Of the 28 committee staffs (from 7 Senate committees and 7 House  committees, each with majority and minority staffs) that we contacted,  staff of 18 (64 percent) agreed to be interviewed.

We interviewed staff of all 4 trade  committee staffs, as well as 4 former trade committee staff in order to  assure coverage back to the beginning of TPA in 2002, due to staff  turnover on some committees. We also interviewed former committee  staff of the other committees of jurisdiction when there had been turnover  on the staff and the current staff were not sufficiently familiar with the  process to comment and referred us to the appropriate former staff.", "To determine the nature of the consultation process for the trade advisory  committees and how well it worked in practice, we reviewed relevant  provisions in the Trade Act of 1974, the Federal Advisory Committee Act  (FACA), and TPA governing the establishment and function of the  committees as well as their reporting requirements and time frames. We  obtained and analyzed committee meeting records and charter and roster  information from both designated agency officials and through the FACA  database maintained by the General Services Administration. We  interviewed a nongeneralizable sampling of 27 trade advisory committee  chairs. We interviewed the first tier and all of the relevant second tier  chairs.

Altogether, we interviewed 16 of the 27 chairs and 5 additional members.  The views of the trade advisory committee chairs with whom we spoke are  not necessarily representative of all committee chairs. We also selected  four other stakeholders to interview, based on literature and background  research, recommendations from trade experts, and participation in public  hearings held for each FTA. These stakeholders were trade experts in the  nongovernmental organization and academic communities. In addition, we  interviewed the executive branch agency officials responsible for  overseeing the committees, at USTR and the Departments of Agriculture,  Commerce, and Labor.

In general, consultation requirements have  expanded under each renewal of authority. The Trade Act of 1974 was the  first grant of fast track authority, which later became known as trade  promotion authority. It established the basic consultation framework,  including required notifications, consultations with congressional  committees, the advisory committee system, and the accreditation of 10  Members of Congress to serve as official advisors to the U.S. delegation of  negotiators. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended fast track  authority but made no significant changes. The next renewal came  through the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984. This act added a new  requirement that the President notify Congress of intent to begin trade  negotiations at least 60 days in advance. Either the House Ways and  Means or the Senate Finance committees could deny fast track  consideration by disapproving of the negotiation within 60 days of the  notification. This provision became known as the \u201cgatekeeper\u201d provision.  In at least one instance, Congress reportedly used the provision as a tool  to successfully influence the administration.", "The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 continued the  previous consultation requirements and added that the Congress could  withhold a trade agreement from fast track consideration by passing  resolutions of disapproval if it determined that the President had failed to  adequately consult with Congress. In addition, the 1988 act extended fast  track procedures only for 3 years but allowed an extension of fast track  procedures for an additional 2 years if the President requested the  extension, and Congress did not pass a resolution disapproving of the  extension. The Trade Act of 2002 included all of the consultation  requirements of previous acts with the exception of the gatekeeper  provision. Instead of giving the two main trade committees the power to  essentially veto potential trading partners before negotiations begin, the  2002 act replaced the 60-day notification of intent to begin negotiations  with a 90-day notification. The Trade Act of 2002 also established the  Congressional Oversight Group (COG) as an additional consultation  mechanism."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Detailed Information on U.S. Goods and Services Trade, Investment, and Tariffs of U.S. Trade Partners", "paragraphs": ["This appendix provides detailed information on U.S. goods trade (table 5)  and services trade (table 6) with U.S. trade partners grouped by whether  the United States pursued an FTA with them under TPA, already had an  existing FTA with them, or did not pursue an FTA with them.
