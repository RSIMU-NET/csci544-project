Public Schools (DCPS) to improve education in public schools. Over the years, GAO and others have identified challenges that DCPS and OSSE face in managing federal monies. This report identifies, on the basis of available information, activities for which OSSE and DCPS used federal payments between 2004 and 2009 and describes how OSSE and DCPS monitored grant and contract recipients, respectively. GAO reviewed expenditure data and interviewed and collected documentation from OSSE and DCPS, among others. GAO reviewed all available grants awarded by OSSE in 2008 and 2009 and 14 of the largest contracts awarded by DCPS during that time."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Approximately 77 percent of federal payments for public charter school improvement in D.C. have been awarded for facility costs, including acquiring, renovating, constructing, or leasing facilities. The funding for facilities has mainly been disbursed through direct loans to schools and grants to expand schools in certain neighborhoods as part of a city improvement initiative. OSSE used the remaining funds for initiatives intended to improve the quality of education through efforts such as academic enrichment and supplemental education activities (provided beyond the normal school day), as well as a variety of other charter school expenditures. OSSE officials reported having established some policies and procedures for monitoring its grant recipients, but, with one exception, these were not documented. Furthermore, the procedures as explained to us by OSSE were not consistently followed. OSSE did create a list of information that program staff are to acquire from grantees. However, the grant files we reviewed often lacked evidence that staff collected this information or performed other monitoring activities. Specifically, most of the files did not include all the narrative and financial reports as required by OSSE in many of their grant agreements. Also, few included any record indicating that staff had followed-up to obtain such documents. According to the expenditure data D.C. provided, DCPS has used federal payments for a variety of purposes--ranging from summer school programs to teacher incentive pay--but available information prior to 2009 does not provide enough details for GAO to fully identify specific activities funded with federal payments. In 2009, DCPS used $40 million primarily for teacher incentive pay, salaries for staff such as physical education and art teachers at underserved schools, and supplemental education activities such as summer school. Expenditure data show that between 2004 and 2008, DCPS funded a variety of programs such as supplemental education and professional development; however, DCPS could not locate information that may have been created on specific activities funded with federal payments during this time. For example, about half of these expenditures were for a \"literacy improvement program,\" but DCPS was unable to provide information to describe the program's goals, objectives, activities, or outcomes. DCPS has policies on responsibilities for monitoring contractor performance; however, these policies do not cover how to do the monitoring and they were not consistently followed. According to program office staff, they have some flexibility in how they implement their monitoring responsibilities and have employed a variety of methods to monitor contractor performance. Of the contract files we reviewed, we found that several lacked any evidence of a performance evaluation by a program officer, or any subsequent review. Notes added to several of the files indicated a program officer had left before the end of the contract term; however, we found no indication that these contracts had been reassigned. Furthermore, the contracting office could not locate 3 of the 17 files we requested for our review."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To improve internal controls, GAO recommends that the Mayor direct OSSE and DCPS to establish and implement written policies and procedures for monitoring use of federal payments for school improvement, and DCPS to maintain contract files and other expenditure documentation.

Between  fiscal years 2004 and 2009, Congress appropriated approximately $190  million in federal payments directly to the D.C. public school system to  improve education. In those years, $85 million in federal payments went  to the state education office\u2014currently the Office of the State  Superintendent of Education (OSSE)\u2014to expand quality public charter  schools under its jurisdiction. Another $105 million was provided to D.C.  Public Schools (DCPS) to improve education in the traditional public  schools under its jurisdiction. Congress provides D.C. with direct financial  assistance in the form of \u201cfederal payments\u201d for a number of programs and  initiatives. Federal payments for school improvement are different from  most federal education funds in that they are appropriated directly to  OSSE and DCPS and do not go through the U.S. Department of Education.  While an examination of how these particular federal payments are  managed has not been conducted, over the years GAO and others have  identified deficiencies in both OSSE and DCPS management of federal  monies. OSSE continues to be designated as a \u201chigh-risk\u201d grantee by the  U.S. Department of Education for its poor grant management, and audits  of DCPS continue to identify systemic problems in its internal controls.", "To learn how the state education office and DCPS have used these federal  payments for school improvement, Congress asked GAO to: (1) identify  the activities for which OSSE has spent federal payments since 2004, (2)  determine how OSSE currently monitors grant recipients, (3) identify the  activities for which DCPS has spent federal payments since 2004, and (4)  determine how DCPS currently monitors contract recipients.", "To perform this work, we gathered and analyzed expenditure data,  financial reports, and other documentation provided by DCPS and OSSE  to identify the activities these agencies funded with federal payments  between 2004 and 2009. We analyzed existing information to describe the  activities on which federal payments were used, but did not evaluate the  impact or outcomes of the projects that OSSE and DCPS funded.

We found the data to be sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. We evaluated OSSE and DCPS monitoring of federal payment  recipients according to established federal practices and D.C.\u2019s own  policies. Because OSSE distributed the majority of federal payments  through grants to public charter schools or other entities, we assessed  OSSE\u2019s monitoring through file reviews. Specifically, we examined 30  grant files for recipients of federal payments for 2008 and 2009 as  identified by OSSE. DCPS has distributed the majority of its federal  payment funds through contracts; therefore, we also conducted a review  of DCPS\u2019 contract files. However, because DCPS indicated that it would  have difficulty compiling all contract files for 2008 and 2009, we selected a  nongeneralizable sample of 17 files, of which we reviewed 14 because  DCPS could not locate 3 files. The 17 files were the largest of the contracts  awarded during this time, accounting for more than one-half of the  contracts funded with federal payments for these years. We selected these  two years to understand how DCPS and OSSE currently function with  regard to federal payments given the new administration of DCPS and  OSSE since 2007.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2009 through  November 2010 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

OSSE typically outlines the monitoring activities it will employ in the  request for grant applications and includes specific time frames for these  activities and deliverables in grant agreements. In establishing their  approach, OSSE officials stated that they try to balance OSSE\u2019s monitoring  functions with those of other organizations, such as PCSB, so they do not  overburden schools with reporting requirements. Most often, these  activities include reviewing financial and narrative performance reports  that grantees must submit, reviewing 100 percent of all expenditures prior  to providing money to grantees, conducting site visits, and in some  instances auditing the grantee\u2019s financial statements.

OSSE developed a standardized form that  grantees are to submit with invoices for staff to review prior to  reimbursement. The files we reviewed included evidence that grantees  submitted and staff reviewed the required reimbursement forms and  invoices. According to the Director, the reimbursement process provides  the opportunity for an extra level of monitoring in that OSSE compares  expenditures with the intended purpose of the grant and approves or  denies reimbursement based on this assessment.", "OSSE staff did not consistently document their collection and review of  grantee narrative and financial reports. According to an OSSE official,  these reports are used to help OSSE monitor grantees\u2019 use of funds and  their impact. Less than one-third of the files we reviewed contained all of  the reports that were required during the grant award period, and one- third of the files had no reports (see figure 3).

Further, the files did not  consistently have evidence that staff followed-up to obtain the reports.  When there was evidence of staff follow-up, it was sometimes not until  months after a report was due. For example, two files that had no reports  included notices to grant recipients requesting that they submit final  performance reports since they had been reimbursed for the amount of the  grant award.

Further, one contract file that lacked a  performance evaluation and two files that were submitted late were  awarded contract extensions. According to a contracting official, staff  from his office should take steps to gather this information from program  staff, but we did not find evidence in the files that officials followed up to  obtain these documents, or that many of the files had supervisory review.

The statu language appropriating these funds does not generally direct OSSE and  DCPS on how to use these monies for school improvements. It appears  that OSSE and DCPS have expended federal payments on a range of  activities related to \u201cschool improvement\u201d\u2014from facility renovation to  summer school programs; however, the lack of detailed information on  tory  some of these payments dating back to 2004 precludes a complete  understanding of their use. A lack of information describing how these  funds were used highlights the need for stronger internal controls related  to information management across administrations.", "Moreover, the financial management challenges that others, such as the  U.S. Department of Education and D.C. Inspector General, have previous identified also persist with OSSE\u2019s and DCPS\u2019s monitoring of grants made  with federal payment funds and contracts, respectively. Specifically, the  policies OSSE and DCPS have are not consistently followed and  sometimes fall short of commonly accepted standards. Because OSSE and DCPS distribute a large portion of federal payment for school  improvement funds through grants and contracts, respectively, effective  internal controls over grants and contracts are critical to their missions.  Without proper documentation on the use of funds and the applicati strong monitoring framework, these funds may more easily be misused.  Further, grantees and contractors may not be held accountable for  meeting the agreed upon performance outcomes. In addition, OSSE and  DCPS may risk implementing initiatives that fall short of reaching the potential to improve the District\u2019s schools.

In its  response, DCPS provided information on several procedures it has  recently put in place to implement more effective monitoring. These  include, among other things, instituting and maintaining documentation on monthly performance evaluations and requiring contracting an officers to sign documentation acknowledging their roles and  responsibilities at the beginning of the contract term. DCPS stated that  these steps will mitigate the risk of not retaining an appropriate program  officer for the duration of the contract.

SOAR isolates federal payments from  other revenue streams and provides OSSE, DCPS, and the D.C Office of  the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) with real-time information related to  revenue and expenditures, among other things. SOAR is interfaced with  PASS. We supplemented these data with interviews, spending plans that  identify how the offices allocated federal payments, and other documents  provided by OSSE and DCPS to describe the purpose and more specific  use of funds as well as how they prioritized the use of funds. For example,  we used SOAR and PASS data to understand the amount of funds DCPS  used for a specific contract or program, but used additional information  from DCPS to understand the purpose. For public charter schools, we  supplemented the SOAR data with other information received from OSSE,  including grant descriptions in the request for applications and summary  data on allocations of federal payments.

Public Charter School Board.", "Using SOAR data, we identified fields that provided descriptive  information on the program or general purpose of funds and the  appropriated and expended amount for a given year\u2019s appropriation. These  funds were often used across several fiscal years. For example, we used  these data to identify public charter schools that received grants and the  amount of these grants. We used additional information provided by OSSE  to determine the amount of funding in a given appropriation year that was  used. We were unable to obtain transaction level data for appropriation  year 2004 because, according to an OCFO official, federal payments for  charter schools were managed by the Department of Insurance, Securities,  and Banking.
