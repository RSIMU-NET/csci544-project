The credit subsidy cost is the government\u2019s estimated net cost, in present value terms, of direct or guaranteed loans over the entire period the loans are outstanding. Because the government now has over 6 years of experience with credit reform, you asked us to determine (1) whether agencies completed estimates and reestimates of subsidy costs, (2) whether we could readily discern any trends including improvements in subsidy estimates, and (3) whether we could readily identify the causes for changes in subsidy estimates. You also asked us whether agencies with discretionary credit programs initially underestimated credit subsidy costs in response to the incentive created by the availability of permanent, indefinite budget authority for credit reestimates.", "We reviewed subsidy estimates and supporting documentation prepared for two domestic credit programs at each of the five largest credit agencies\u2014the Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Education, Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Veterans Affairs (VA), and the Small Business Administration (SBA). Each of the agencies confirmed that the reported data were an accurate reflection of the data they had. While we did not independently verify that data, we found, and agency staff later agreed, that there were problems with these data, as discussed later in the report. The causes of changes in subsidy estimates reported in appendix II are those identified by credit agencies\u2019 staff."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["There is a long history of problems with federal credit programs. We reported many of the problems, such as poor recordkeeping and cost data, prior to credit reform. For example, we reported in November 1989 that federal agencies\u2019 long-standing deficiencies in financial management systems and accounting procedures had precluded accurate, comprehensive recording and reporting of the full extent of credit losses.Agencies have had perennial problems tracking loan payments due and loan guarantees made in federal budgets. Also, prior to credit reform, the cash-based budget distorted choices between direct loans and loan guarantees. A direct loan initially looked like a grant since the budget included as a cost the face value of a direct loan, ignoring that at least some part of the loan would be repaid. Conversely, loan guarantees looked free when they were made because the budget ignored the fact that some would result in default costs. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), GAO, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and others reported on the need to change the way credit programs were budgeted.", "In response to these reports and a growing recognition of federal financial management problems, the Congress enacted a series of laws designed to improve financial management and the quality and use of cost data in decision-making. To address the deficiencies in recognizing the cost of credit programs, the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 was enacted as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. Credit reform was intended to ensure that the full cost of credit programs would be reflected in the budget so that the executive branch and the Congress might consider these costs when making budget decisions. Accounting standards for credit programs were developed to be consistent with the intent of this act. To address broader problems in federal financial management, the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 required the development and maintenance of integrated agency accounting and financial management systems, including financial reporting and internal controls, that provide for development and reporting of cost information. The Government Management Reform Act of 1994 expanded the CFO Act to provide for audits of the annual financial statements of the 24 CFO agencies. The largest credit programs are found in these agencies and audits include a review of agencies\u2019 subsidy estimates and actual loan performance data. Accurate cost information also is key to improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of federal programs as envisioned by the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. The Debt Collection Act of 1982 provided for OMB to require agencies to report debt information to OMB and to the Department of the Treasury. Finally, the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 expanded collection tools and authorities available to agencies and called for centralized servicing of some debt. Federal financial management, including credit program management, continues to reap the benefits of these laws.", "While all of these laws sought to improve federal financial management, a major change for budgeting was the Federal Credit Reform Act included in the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1990. This act changed the budgetary treatment of credit programs so that their costs could be compared more appropriately both with each other and with other federal spending. Credit reform requires agencies to estimate the net cost to the government over the full term of the credit of new direct or guaranteed loans to be made in the budget year and to record that cost in the budget on a present-value basis. Unless OMB approves an alternative proposal, agencies are required to reestimate this cost annually as long as any loans in the cohort are outstanding. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 amended the Federal Credit Reform Act to simplify and clarify subsidy estimation requirements. OMB also has simplified guidance for credit subsidy estimation. Appendix I contains a more detailed description of credit reform requirements and recent changes.", "Credit programs may be either discretionary or mandatory as defined in the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990. Appropriations for the subsidy cost of discretionary credit programs are counted under the discretionary spending caps and so must compete with other discretionary programs for the funding available under these limits. Like other mandatory programs, mandatory credit programs receive automatic appropriations for whatever amount of credit is needed to meet the estimated demand for services by beneficiaries.", "All credit programs automatically receive any additional budget authority that may be needed to fund reestimates. For discretionary programs this means there is a difference in the budget treatment of original subsidy cost estimates and of subsidy cost reestimates. The original estimated subsidy cost is counted under the discretionary caps, but any additional appropriation for upward reestimates of subsidy cost is exempt from the caps. This design could result in a tendency to underestimate the initial subsidy costs of a discretionary program. Portraying a loan program as less costly than it really is when competing for funds under the discretionary caps means more or larger loans or loan guarantees could be made with a given appropriation since the program then could rely on automatic funding for subsequent reestimates to cover any shortfalls. This built-in incentive is one reason to monitor subsidy reestimates. Monitoring reestimates is a key control over tendencies to underestimate costs as well as a barometer of the quality of agencies\u2019 estimation processes.", "The development of credit reform requirements reflects in part decisionmakers\u2019 interest in analyzing the causes of changes in subsidy estimates. Understanding which of the components of subsidy expense\u2014interest, net defaults, fees and other collections, and other subsidy costs\u2014are the key drivers of reestimates can both improve the quality of estimates and yield insights into program operations. OMB developed and provided agencies with a computer model to calculate the total estimated subsidy rate and the components of subsidy expense based on agency-developed cash flow information. In the development of accounting standards for credit programs, the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) indicated that these data would be valuable for making credit policy decisions, monitoring portfolio quality, and improving credit performance. Current accounting standards and OMB guidance require agencies to recognize, and disclose in the financial statement footnotes, the four components separately for the fiscal year during which direct or guaranteed loans are disbursed. However, for programs that disburse over more than 1 year, the current disclosure aggregates subsidy component data for the current year with subsidy costs from prior years. In addition, changes in law and program administration often occur. Thus, loans disbursed from programs over multiple years have different program characteristics and the current year\u2019s financial statement disclosures do not represent the program characteristics or expenses of any given year of the program. Because the requirement in its present form does not provide the kind of useful information that was intended, FASAB now is considering revising these standards.", "Agencies now have prepared eight budgets under credit reform requirements and there should be 6 years of actual data available. Because of different program requirements, resource and expertise levels, and levels of commitment and interest, agencies have taken different approaches to making subsidy estimates. Preparing subsidy estimates is complex for a number of reasons, including projecting cash flows many years into the future and assessing the effect of economic changes on a particular program and its borrowers. Further, in some\u2014if not all\u2014agencies, budget office staff must integrate information from staff and systems in both the finance and program offices. While the present value-based budgeting of credit reform is a major step forward, its success depends heavily on the quality of these complex subsidy estimates. The independent review of agency records and data in the annual financial audit is an important step in monitoring the subsidy estimates and improving their reliability.", "When credit reform was enacted, it generally was recognized that agencies did not have the capacity to implement fully the needed changes in their accounting systems in the short run and that the transition to budgeting and accounting on a present-value basis would be difficult. However, policymakers expected that once agencies established a systematic approach to subsidy estimation based on auditable assumptions, present value-based budgeting for credit would provide them with significantly better information than the former cash-based system. Despite the difficulties with implementation, including current data problems, present value-based reporting for credit avoids a number of the problems of cash reporting. Therefore, we believe that making credit reform work is important."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The objectives of our work were to determine (1) whether agencies completed estimates and reestimates of subsidy costs, (2) whether we could readily identify any trends including improvements in subsidy estimates as reported by the agencies, and (3) whether we could readily identify the causes for changes in subsidy estimates. You also asked us whether agencies with discretionary credit programs initially underestimated credit subsidy costs in response to the incentive created by the availability of permanent, indefinite budget authority for credit reestimates. We selected a sample of 10 programs from the five agencies with the largest domestic federal credit programs: the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Housing and Urban Development, and Veterans Affairs, and the Small Business Administration. We generally selected programs that have the most credit outstanding or highest loan levels. Both direct loan and loan guarantee programs are represented. Table 1 in the following discussion of the availability of subsidy estimates and supporting documentation contains a list of the 10 programs we examined.", "We requested that agencies provide budget data and information for the selected programs for fiscal years 1992 through 1998. The data requested included (1) descriptions of the credit program and highlights of program changes over the years, (2) spreadsheets showing estimated or reestimated cash flows of each cohort, (3) input to and output from OMB\u2019s credit subsidy model, and (4) documentation of agency efforts to revise the subsidy estimation process. For each cohort in fiscal years 1992 through 1998, we extracted the subsidy rate estimates used in the President\u2019s budget request, budget execution, and all reestimates. These data are included in appendix III.", "Our work reports the subsidy rate data and documentation as provided by the agencies. We interviewed staff who prepared the subsidy estimates and obtained written confirmation from each agency that the data in the tables in appendix III were accurate and represented all of the data the agency had. However, we found problems with these data. While we did not independently verify the accuracy of these data, we did compare the budget request subsidy rates confirmed by the agencies to the rates reported in the appropriate Budget Appendix and Budget Credit Supplement. We found that agency-confirmed rates differed from the Budget in nine instances although only three differences were greater than half a percentage point. In two of these three instances, the agencies later provided documentation to support the rates in the Budget. In the third instance, we used the rate produced by the OMB subsidy model because the agency\u2019s cash flow spreadsheets best supported it. In addition, we reviewed recent financial statement audit reports for these credit agencies and programs as one gauge of the reliability of these data.", "While we examined data for all 10 programs in the 5 credit agencies, specific examples used in our work discuss only those programs or agencies with comparable data. For example, we had comparable data from only seven programs to use in our analysis of the most recent subsidy estimates for the fiscal year 1992 and fiscal year 1998 cohorts. This is because all of VA\u2019s credit programs (including some not examined in this report) were consolidated into two programs for fiscal year 1998 (a direct loan program and a loan guarantee program) and Education\u2019s direct loan program only began in fiscal year 1994.", "We used the data in appendix III to try to identify trends in subsidy estimates. Appendix II includes graphs of total subsidy rates by cohort for nine programs and graphs profiling the subsidy rates of a given program cohort over time for eight programs. We did not prepare either graph for SBA\u2019s Disaster Loan Program because SBA had not included subsidy reestimates for any cohort in the President\u2019s Budget prior to fiscal year 1999. We also did not profile a cohort of USDA\u2019s Farm Operating Loans because we did not have enough comparable data for our review.", "To further understand the causes for changes in subsidy rates, we then analyzed the four components of subsidy expense (interest, net defaults, fees and other collections, and other subsidy costs) required to be reported by SFFAS No. 2 and calculated by OMB\u2019s subsidy model. We also compared the budget execution estimate to the first reestimate for all credit programs and analyzed whether there was a different pattern in the direction of the reestimates for direct loan programs and loan guarantee programs or for mandatory and discretionary programs.", "Our work was conducted in Washington, D.C., from September 1996 through January 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

While some progress has been made at some agencies, audits of financial statements continue to show that serious problems remain. Effective implementation of credit reform is highly dependent on the availability of accurate data."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Subsidy Rate Estimates and Supporting Documentation Were Not Consistently Available", "paragraphs": ["Agencies did not have for our review all of the estimated subsidy rates and supporting documentation for the seven budgets they prepared under credit reform for fiscal years 1992 through 1998. Also, the availability of subsidy rate estimates and reestimates generally did not improve over time. All nine programs in existence in 1992 when credit reform became effective had for our review budget request and budget execution subsidy estimates for the first 2 years under credit reform\u2014fiscal years 1992 and 1993. The first reestimates of subsidy cost should have been done for the fiscal year 1994 Budget. Of the 10 programs we examined, 8 either failed to do reestimates for certain years or produced them too late to be included in budget formulation or audit cycles. Only five of the nine programs that should have completed reestimates for the fiscal years 1994 and 1995 Budgets had them for our review. Starting with the fiscal year 1997 Budget, OMB Circular A-11 provided that agencies could forgo completing reestimates under certain circumstances. For fiscal years 1997 and 1998, 5 of the 10 programs made timely reestimates. One of the programs, SBA\u2019s Disaster Loans Program, did not have subsidy reestimates in the Budget until the recently released fiscal year 1999 Budget. The programs that did not make reestimates generally reported staff constraints in completing reestimates while preparing their budget request or difficulties obtaining data on which to base reestimates. All reported that they had received waivers from OMB. We received written copies of OMB waivers to USDA and HUD permitting late completion of estimates. While USDA\u2019s waiver was effective for fiscal year 1996 and future budgets, HUD\u2019s waiver was only for fiscal year 1997. HUD staff told us that OMB gave them waivers orally for other years, and OMB did not disagree. SBA also told us that the waivers were approved by OMB orally, and OMB agreed.", "On the other hand, for estimates and reestimates that were made, the availability of documentation has improved somewhat. In fiscal years 1996 through 1998, most programs did have documentation for estimates and reestimates that were made. Recent credit reform guidance explicitly requires agencies to document subsidy estimation. In the early years of credit reform, fiscal years 1992 through 1995, most programs did not have for our review supporting documentation for all completed budget estimates and reestimates. An official at Education characterized early credit program files as \u201cwoefully lacking.\u201d HUD staff said that early credit estimates were prepared by OMB staff and that HUD and OMB do not have supporting documentation.", "Table 1 shows, by program and fiscal year, whether agencies had for our review all subsidy estimates for the budget request and budget execution, made subsidy reestimates, and had supporting documentation for these estimates that we requested for our review. A check indicates that the agency had for our review all estimated rates, rates for reestimates they made, and had all supporting documentation contained in output from the OMB subsidy model and agency cash flow spreadsheets. It says nothing about the quality of the data. We discuss in some detail our concerns about data reliability later in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reliability of Some Subsidy Estimate Data Is Questionable", "paragraphs": ["The reliability of credit data is questionable for a number of reasons including (1) the poor results of financial statement audits, (2) discrepancies we found between subsidy rates reported in the President\u2019s Budget and the data confirmed to us by the agencies, (3) subsidy rate estimates not always supported by documentation, (4) acknowledgements from some staff that component data were questionable, and (5) staff reports of difficulties with systems support. First, financial statement audits raised questions about data reliability.", "Three of the largest credit agencies, HUD, USDA, and Education, received disclaimers or qualified opinions on their fiscal year 1996 financial statement audits, in part, because of problems associated with their credit programs. HUD received a qualified opinion because the Federal Housing Administration\u2019s (FHA) credit-related accounts were not reported on the present value basis required by SFFAS No. 2. Consequently, HUD\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) was unable to audit the credit-related account balances. USDA\u2019s OIG gave a qualified audit opinion on the fiscal year 1996 financial statements of the rural development mission area because it was unable to obtain sufficient support for credit program receivables and estimated losses on loan guarantees and the related credit reform program subsidy and appropriated capital used. USDA\u2019s Farm Service Agency Farm Operating Loans were included as part of the consolidated audit of USDA\u2019s fiscal year 1996 financial statements which received a disclaimer of opinion. The Farm Service Agency does not prepare separate financial statements. Education received a disclaimer of opinion on the department\u2019s fiscal year 1996 financial statements because it was unable to support the reasonableness of the amounts shown for loans receivable and liabilities for loan guarantees. Education\u2019s OIG also was unable to render an audit opinion due to auditor concerns about the quality of the data supporting subsidy estimates of the Federal Family Education Loan Program. This could reflect problems with historical data since agencies with loan guarantee programs rely on lenders or intermediaries for loan performance data. In some cases, the auditors recommended that agencies establish and document a process for the development of subsidy estimates and make reestimation of subsidy costs a priority.", "Although VA and SBA both received unqualified audit opinions on their fiscal year 1996 financial statements, the auditors of these agencies reported internal control weaknesses related to estimating credit subsidies. For example, SBA\u2019s auditors reported that the agency used inconsistent and unreliable data to reestimate the Disaster Loan Program. Because of the questionable data, OMB and SBA had not included any reestimate of this program until the fiscal year 1999 Budget or the fiscal year 1997 financial statements. In addition, VA\u2019s auditors reported that the agency does not efficiently and reliably accumulate the financial information needed to comply with credit reform accounting requirements and that significant credit reform-related adjustments were necessary to the financial statements.", "Second, we found discrepancies between the subsidy rates reported in the President\u2019s Budget and the data provided and confirmed to us by the agencies in about 10 percent of our sample (7 of 68 rates). Some agencies agreed, after we pointed out inconsistencies, that certain data they had provided and certified as accurate in fact were not. Third, agencies also had for our review subsidy rate estimates that were not always supported by the documentation. For example, none of Education\u2019s documentation supported its estimated subsidy rates. Also, agencies, such as HUD, had difficulty identifying the fiscal year of available subsidy rates and documentation and whether the rates were budget execution estimates or reestimates. Fourth, staff from seven of the eight programs whose component data we were able to examine acknowledged that the data were questionable. We found that component data were questionable because they were not consistent with program characteristics. For example, VA\u2019s direct loan program showed the net default component as negative because cash flows from loan sales were included with recoveries from defaulted loans. As a result, recoveries exceeded defaults. To avoid erroneously indicating that higher defaults would reduce the subsidy rate, proceeds from loan sales should have been included with the \u201cother cash flow\u201d component.", "Fifth, and finally, data reliability depends in part on having adequate information systems, and effective top management commitment is vital to ensuring that these are provided. Today, as 4 years ago, staff in most agencies we examined report difficulties with systems support. For example, staff in three of the five agencies we reviewed\u2014HUD, VA, and USDA\u2014reported inadequate actual data on loan performance and computer systems support. These agencies have efforts underway to refine their data and/or improve their estimation processes. Staff at USDA and VA have worked with their offices of the inspector general or OMB to refine their cash flow spreadsheets and reestimate calculations. HUD staff reported efforts underway to develop a new integrated accounting system and a need to re-engineer budget and accounting processes.", "Staff in the other two agencies\u2014Education and SBA\u2014told us that systems support was not an issue and reported that credit reform implementation has become a high-level priority for their agencies. Specifically, SBA administrators had a commitment to meet the requirements of the Federal Credit Reform Act and sought to improve their capacity to make better subsidy cost estimates. Both agencies reported that they had developed new computer systems, significantly refined their historical information stores, and are using contractor support. Although upper-management commitment is necessary, it does not result in instant improvement. Audits continue to report problems at both agencies, both have difficulty obtaining historical information, and SBA and others have identified errors in SBA subsidy estimates.", "OMB and credit agency staff acknowledge that budget and financial systems for credit programs could have problems with conversions to the year 2000. In a February 1998 report on agencies\u2019 progress in addressing Year 2000 conversion, OMB reported that SBA and VA were demonstrating sufficient progress, USDA and HUD were making some progress but OMB still had concerns, and Education was making insufficient progress. In testimony in September 1997, we reported that the Veterans Benefits Administration, where its housing credit programs are located, has developed an agencywide plan and created a program management organization but will need to strengthen management and oversight of Year 2000-related activities to avert serious disruption of its ability to disseminate benefits. Since our testimony, VA has taken action to address some of our concerns."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Subsidy Rates Generally Fluctuated", "paragraphs": ["Over time, some fluctuation in subsidy rates would be expected within a given group of loans or guarantees (a cohort) and among different cohorts of the same program. Reasons include loans or guarantees made at different interest rates than anticipated; programmatic redesign; better information on technical factors such as defaults, prepayments, and fees from more actual experience; or unanticipated changes in the economy including interest rate changes. Agencies have had several years to obtain and refine historical data and estimation methodologies. Over time we would expect to find that, for a given cohort, the annual changes in reestimates due to technical factors would be smaller. We believe that agencies can improve their abilities to forecast such factors as defaults, recoveries, prepayments, and fee revenue through better modeling and more and better historical data. As this improvement occurs, the variability in the subsidy rate from year to year for a given cohort caused by these factors (as opposed to economic factors such as interest) should diminish. Because reliable component data were not available, we could not readily determine whether this had occurred. However, total subsidy estimates within a given cohort often varied widely over time. Moreover, estimates for different cohorts within the same program also differed widely. These sharp variations raise questions about the causes for these changes and the reliability of the underlying data. The success of credit reform budgeting relies on reasonable estimates informed by timely, appropriate actual data.", "We analyzed the data from several perspectives:", "Comparing Estimated Subsidy Rates Over Time For a Given Cohort\u2014In the programs we examined, we found that reestimates often were large and changed direction over time\u2014increasing or decreasing estimated subsidy cost. During the period of time between a given cohort\u2019s budget execution estimate and its most recent reestimate, we found that reestimates generally fluctuated both up and down. A total of 74 percent of the 23 cohorts we analyzed had at least one reestimate increasing the subsidy rate and at least one reestimate that decreased the subsidy rate. For example, estimates and reestimates of the fiscal year 1992 cohort of Education\u2019s FFELP program changed direction each of the 6 years of data, estimated subsidy rates ranged from 26.30 percent to 16.99 percent. This could result from any number of factors, including changes in assumptions about cash flows as agencies gained experience in estimating subsidy rates or developed better actual loan data, and changes in the timing of loan activity or interest rates. Only VA\u2019s Loan Guaranty Direct Loan Financing Account did not have both increases and decreases in its subsidy estimate, as shown in figure II.17. Graphs of selected cohorts are included in appendix II. Viewed another way, we compared two specific subsidy rate estimates\u2014budget execution and the first reestimate\u2014in eight programs for which we had appropriate data (27 cohorts). We found that the first reestimates of the subsidy rates were higher than the budget execution rates for 13 cohorts and were lower for 14 cohorts. We also found that 15 of the 27 cohorts had changes of at least 20 percent\u20147 increases and 8 decreases. One cohort in the SBA 7(a) program increased by 126 percent.", "Comparing Estimated Subsidy Rates for Different Cohorts of a Given Program\u2014We also analyzed the estimated subsidy rates for a given program by comparing the most recent estimates or reestimates for different cohorts. For example, as shown in figure II.16, the subsidy estimates and reestimates of the fiscal years 1992 through 1997 cohorts in VA\u2019s Loan Guaranty Direct Loan Financing Account changed direction in each of the 6 years of data, and estimated subsidy rates ranged from 4.80 percent to 1.18 percent. We found that the fiscal year 1998 President\u2019s Budget showed that six of eight programs had a lower estimated subsidy rate for their new fiscal year 1998 credit than they reestimated for their fiscal year 1992 credit, the oldest cohorts in our study. Only HUD\u2019s Federal Housing Administration\u2019s Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund and VA\u2019s Loan Guaranty Direct Loan Financing Account had estimated subsidy rates for fiscal year 1998 credit that were higher than the reestimates of the fiscal year 1992 cohort. This relatively consistent pattern of lower estimated subsidy rates in fiscal year 1998 may reflect changes in economic conditions such as lower interest rates, data errors, and/or changes by agencies designed to lower the subsidy cost such as increasing fees, reducing the share of the loan receiving the government guarantee, and improving debt collection. To determine the cause of specific subsidy rate differences would require examining the detailed assumptions used to estimate a program\u2019s cash flows over the full term of the credit. Graphs of the most recently estimated subsidy rates for all cohorts in 9 of the 10 programs in our sample are included in appendix II. SBA\u2019s Disaster Loan Program is not included because the agency had not reestimated the program\u2019s subsidy costs at the time of our review.", "Comparison of Estimated Subsidy Rates for Direct Loans to Those for Loan Guarantees\u2014Loan type was not a predictor of whether subsidy rates increased or decreased from the budget execution rate to the first reestimate. For example, of the three direct loan programs and five loan guarantee programs for which we had appropriate data, only one program\u2014VA\u2019s Guaranty and Indemnity Fund guarantee program\u2014did not have at least one cohort with an upward reestimate and at least one cohort with a downward reestimate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Available Data Not Sufficient to Assess Whether Budgetary Treatment Affected Initial Subsidy Estimates", "paragraphs": ["To obtain some insight on the potential effect of credit reform\u2019s automatic appropriation (unconstrained by discretionary spending limits) for reestimates, we compared the budget execution estimate to the first reestimate for mandatory programs and for discretionary programs. As explained previously, initial appropriations for discretionary programs must compete with other programs for the specified amount of funding available under the discretionary spending limits set in law. Mandatory credit programs are automatically funded for whatever amount of credit is needed for a given program design and set of program beneficiaries. Both discretionary and mandatory credit programs automatically receive funding for the cost of reestimates without regard to Budget Enforcement Act limits. Thus, agencies with discretionary credit programs could benefit from initially underestimating subsidy rates. If the pattern in the direction of reestimates for discretionary and mandatory programs were the same, it would be an indication that this provision of law was not affecting original estimates. It may be difficult to determine whether agencies intentionally underestimated subsidy costs in initial estimates given data unreliability and the number of other factors (such as changes in interest rates or other economic conditions) that could affect subsidy estimates and reestimates.", "We do know of one instance in which the issue was raised. SBA, an agency with discretionary credit programs, hired Price Waterhouse to conduct a diagnostic review of SBA\u2019s existing internal controls. This September 1997 study said that \u201cthe credit subsidy process is not viewed as a way of assessing the future risk and costs of the program for management purposes. Rather, the rate calculation is perceived [by SBA] to be a tool for gaming the congressional appropriations process.\u201d In commenting on a draft of this report, SBA officials disagreed with this conclusion. SBA officials stated that the Price Waterhouse report was incorrect and, due to its special nature, it was not corrected. In support of their position, SBA officials cited the quality of their data and staff and SBA\u2019s commitment to have accurate and credible subsidy rates. However, we found, as discussed earlier, an error in SBA\u2019s subsidy estimation methodology and that their component data were not always correct.

We found somewhat similar patterns when we compared discretionary and mandatory programs. We found that the estimated subsidy rates for 8 of the 15 discretionary cohorts increased in the first reestimate following the initial appropriation, while first reestimates for 7 of the 12 mandatory cohorts decreased.", "This result is not conclusive. No real conclusions can be drawn from this observation about whether some discretionary programs may have sought to benefit from initially underestimating subsidy costs. Any firm conclusion about the reasons for reestimates would require better data and more in-depth study. Other factors, such as changes in the economy\u2014including interest rates\u2014or more historical data, may have contributed to these reestimates.

However, these component data were frequently missing or inaccurate, and thus we were unable to use them for identifying causes of changes in estimates.", "SFFAS No. 2 provides general definitions of these components and requires agencies to disclose them in financial statements. The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board commented on the importance of such data stating that \u201cthe cost component information would be valuable for making credit policy decisions, monitoring portfolio quality, and improving credit performance. Information on interest subsidies and fees would help in making decisions on setting interest rates and fee levels. Information on default costs would help in evaluating credit performance.\u201d It also could be useful as a performance measure to comply with the Government Performance and Results Act. With better data, decisionmakers could compare these components across programs and agencies to see the effect of programmatic differences.", "The potential usefulness of the component data was recently demonstrated by our analysis of SBA component data. Although SBA\u2019s subsidy component data were flawed, they still provided a quick indication to GAO that there was an error in the fiscal year 1997 subsidy estimates for the section 7(a) General Business Loan Program.

In describing the OMB credit subsidy model, OMB guidance to agencies says \u201cuse of a common subsidy model ensures comparability and uniformity among all Federal credit program subsidy estimates.\u201d However, VA, USDA, SBA, and HUD did not distribute their cash flows consistently among the components. OMB Circulars A-11 and A-34 did not provide definitions of the subsidy components. The user\u2019s guide for OMB\u2019s subsidy model did not provide sufficiently clear definitions of the components to ensure that the components could be calculated accurately. Agency staff said they did not have a clear understanding of the definitions and thus were unsure about where the OMB model allocated detailed data for each of their program\u2019s cash flows in calculating the subsidy expense components. Agency staff were unclear about what the data produced by the model represented.

Education officials noted that, with the participation and approval of OMB, Education uses the model as an interim step in subsidy estimation, not at the end as do other agencies. Education uses a methodology that makes minor adjustments to subsidy rates produced by the model. As a result, Education staff did not provide component data for its reestimated subsidy rates.", "Clear definitions of each subsidy component and specific OMB instructions and assistance to agencies in using its subsidy model could provide better assurance of accurate and comparable component data.

While agencies are working to improve their subsidy estimation processes, agency staff continue to report that credit reform implementation often is not a priority of top management. This is indicated both by the failure to ask questions about estimates in program and budget reviews and by the reported lack of sufficient computer systems to support the subsidy estimation process. Greater commitment by OMB and the credit agencies is needed to address pervasive problems with the availability and reliability of subsidy estimate data and documentation. Since agencies are most responsive to issues in which there is demonstrated interest, continued oversight would increase the likelihood that credit reform would be implemented as intended. Better and more reliable data are needed to facilitate this oversight.", "The availability of automatic funding for reestimates of subsidy costs creates an incentive for agencies with discretionary programs to initially underestimate subsidy costs.

OMB officials commented that the report\u2019s focus on subsidy estimation is valuable. However, OMB officials stated that our analytical methodology was questionable because the report did not distinguish between the effect of interest rates on initial subsidy rates and the effect of default and other technical factors. Our methodology was designed to isolate the effects of interest rates by using component data and budget execution rates. It is true that interest rates would change each year even if the default and other technical assumptions remain constant. Unfortunately, we could not isolate these effects because agencies frequently did not provide these data or provided inaccurate data. We used budget execution rates as the starting point for our analyses. This reduced the effect of interest rate changes in the months between budget request and budget execution.", "OMB also stated that several of the report\u2019s general conclusions about subsidy estimates were not supported by the evidence. We disagree. First, OMB officials noted that unless an adjustment is made for the effect of different discount rates, it is impossible to draw valid conclusions about the accuracy of subsidy rates by observing that they have fluctuated over time. We did not draw conclusions about the accuracy of subsidy rates. However, we did observe that the rates fluctuated over time and that some fluctuation would be expected. We said in the report that the reliability of credit data is questionable for a number of reasons. Our characterization of the data was based primarily on results of the audits of the fiscal year 1996 financial statements as well as some discrepancies we identified between rates provided to us by agencies and those reported in the President\u2019s Budget. Second, OMB officials said that we could not draw conclusions about a program from the size or direction of subsidy reestimates unless the effect of interest rate reestimates is removed. Our report did not draw conclusions about programs from the size or direction of subsidy reestimates. Third, OMB officials were concerned that our discussion of the timing of reestimates could lead to the incorrect conclusion that the budget formulation process for subsidy rates for new loans is not being informed by the experience on existing loan cohorts. We disagree. Such a conclusion regarding the effect of not performing reestimates is, in fact, correct. Given that we found three of the five agencies received waivers of the reestimate requirement, it would appear that their budget formulation is not being informed by the most recent experience on existing loan cohorts.

Education officials also raised a question about their perception that our report implied that \u201csignificant shifts in subsidy reestimates over time are necessarily a bad thing.\u201d Our report did not imply this. Rather, we said that over time, some fluctuation in subsidy rates would be expected, some estimates varied widely, and these sharp variations raise questions about the causes for these changes and the reliability of the underlying data. Education officials also provided some clarification of their use of the OMB subsidy model. (See appendix VI.)", "HUD officials acknowledged that the agency has experienced some reporting and estimation problems and stated that the agency has made significant progress since the enactment of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. They noted that the draft report documents the difficulty that virtually every agency is experiencing in dealing with credit reform requirements. HUD officials stated that the problem with cost estimates has less to do with the level of effort devoted to data collection and the timeliness of reestimation than it has to do with inherent limitations of the net present value technique in cost estimation. We agree that credit reform has been a challenge to agencies. However, cash basis reporting for credit programs, while easier to accomplish, does not reflect their costs. When sufficient attention is devoted to net present value estimates of costs as required under the Federal Credit Reform Act, these subsidy costs will be a much better basis for budgeting.

Conversely, this treatment understated costs in later years when loan repayments were more likely to be much larger relative to disbursements.

See \u201cAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\u201d section of the report. 2. We did not draw conclusions about the accuracy of subsidy rates from our observation that subsidy rates have fluctuated over time. Our report stated that the reliability of credit data was questionable for a number of reasons. Our characterization of the data was based primarily on results of the audits of the fiscal year 1996 financial statements as well as some discrepancies we identified between rates provided to us by agencies and those reported in the President\u2019s Budget. 3. The report does not propose a causal relationship between reestimates and subsidy rate fluctuations. Further, changes in assumptions cause the subsidy rate for a cohort of loans to fluctuate from year to year, not reestimates. 4. We did not assess whether any assumptions used in subsidy rate estimation were accurate. Further, we did not draw conclusions about a program from the size or direction of subsidy reestimates. We acknowledged that the fluctuations in subsidy rates could be due to credit extended at different interest rates than anticipated or to unanticipated changes in the economy, as well as other factors. We clarified the report language to state that interest rate changes are an example of such unanticipated economic changes. 5. Report text revised to clarify that the patterns are similar. 6. We compared the subsidy rate estimated for budget execution against the first subsidy reestimate for the following reasons. First, we used budget execution (rather than budget request) because it eliminated the effect of interest rate changes in the months between when the budget request rate was formulated and the time the government is obligated or committed for the loans. Second, credit reform guidance requires agencies to have appropriations of budget authority to cover the full estimated net present value cost of outstanding credit. Third, we used the first reestimate because if an agency sought to benefit from initially underestimating subsidy costs and there was oversight by OMB to ensure that agencies have sufficient appropriations of budget authority, the agency would have to obtain budget authority to cover the shortfall as soon as possible\u2014that is, in the first reestimate. 7. Given that three of the five agencies received waivers of the reestimate requirement, it would appear that their budget formulation is not being informed by the most recent experience on existing loan cohorts. The Credit Task Force of the Accounting and Auditing Policy Committee, which includes OMB and GAO representation, proposed that agencies that have OMB approval be allowed to use a combination of actual and projected data as the basis for reestimates. By allowing agencies to begin the reestimation process earlier, this approach should reduce the need for waivers\u2014permitting agencies to use more recent actual data to inform budget formulation and to include them in the President\u2019s Budget and financial statement audits. 8. We agree that this would be useful information. However, we could not obtain sufficient component data from agencies to evaluate whether subsidy estimation has improved over time, as indicated by smaller annual changes in reestimates due to technical factors. Our report does include a section discussing a number of recent efforts to clarify and simplify implementation of the Credit Reform Act. In other ongoing work, we are evaluating data reliability, barriers to credit reform implementation, and agency plans to overcome those barriers. We will also report on notable best practices in credit agencies as appropriate. 9. We do not dispute that OMB staff devote a substantial amount of time to credit issues. However, our conclusion that greater sustained commitment is needed reflects our concerns about the availability and reliability of credit data despite the fact that agencies now have prepared eight budgets since credit reform became effective for fiscal year 1992.
