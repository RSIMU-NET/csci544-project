For example, federally operated facilities are required to conduct criminal-history checks on employees, as are facilities receiving grants from the Department of Health and Human Services' Head Start program. At the state level, laws vary widely. For example, all 50 states require criminal-history checks for owners and employees of licensed child care facilities, but many state laws exempt facilities from licensing if they do not exceed certain thresholds, such as a minimum number of children. Penalties for violating licensing requirements can range from a $5 administrative fine to imprisonment for a term of years. The cases GAO examined show examples of individuals convicted of serious sexual offenses who gained access to child care facilities as maintenance workers, spouses or friends of providers, a cafeteria worker, and a cook. At least seven of these cases involve offenders who previously targeted children, and in three of the cases, the offenders used their access to children at the facilities to offend again. Among the cases, GAO found instances of providers who (1) knowingly hired offenders and (2) did not perform preemployment criminal-history checks. GAO also found examples of facilities operating without licenses, and facilities that employed offenders while receiving federal funds. The following four cases illustrate the nature of the situations GAO identified."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We have previously reported on cases in which children were being  physically abused at youth residential treatment facilities and sexually  abused at public and private schools. However, very little is known about  the extent of sexual abuse among children that are regularly cared for by  an estimated 1.3 million child care providers every week in the United  States as of 2008. The victims of these crimes are typically 12 years old  or younger\u2014and according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s (FBI)  National Incident-Based Reporting System, crimes against children make  up a large majority of sexual assaults handled by law enforcement  agencies. In this context, and as a follow-on to our December 2010 report  on individuals with histories of sexual misconduct in K-12 public and  private schools, we agreed to (1) provide an overview of relevant federal  and state laws related to the employment of sex offenders at child care  facilities and (2) examine cases where individuals who were convicted of  serious sexual offenses were subsequently employed or present at child  care facilities.", "To provide an overview of selected federal and state laws, we searched  statutory codes for prohibitions against sexual offenders working or being  present in child care facilities, requirements for conducting criminal- history checks, and penalties for violating these requirements. At the state  level, we focused solely on statutory provisions because of their greater  degree of permanence. We did not analyze state regulations or policies,  or any laws, regulations, or policies at the local level. Additional  requirements can be added through regulation by states or at the local  level, and these may go beyond what is specified in state statute.", "To identify case-study examples of child care facilities that employed or  provided residence to registered sexual offenders who committed serious  sexual offenses, we performed searches of open-source information and  public records and used database matching techniques described in  greater detail below. Our methodology was not designed to assess the  prevalence of sex offenders working at child care facilities; nor can it  establish the effectiveness of statutes and legislation designed to prevent  such occurrences. First, we compared social security numbers (SSN) that  we obtained from the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) National Sex  Offender Registry (NSOR) to SSNs in employment databases maintained  by 20 states and the District of Columbia for the years 2007 to 2009.  These states and the District of Columbia are not a generalizable sample,  but illustrate geographic diversity. From this comparison, we identified 24  potential cases of registered sex offenders working at child care facilities.  We identified the facilities by searching the data that we compiled through  our comparisons for employers whose business names contained terms  such as \u201cchildren,\u201d \u201cchild care,\u201d and \u201cdaycare.\u201d The cases we identified  focus only on individuals who were convicted of serious sexual offenses  prior to being employed at child care facilities and cannot be generalized  to all child care facilities. It is possible that our search did not capture sex  offenders whose names or social security numbers were inaccurate in  NSOR or employment data or who worked at facilities that were not  readily identifiable as child care providers, or whose employers did not  properly report the sex offender\u2019s employment to the state, nor would it  capture instances where a registered sex offender was merely present at  the child care facility, but was not employed.", "To identify additional potential case-study examples, we searched open- source information for reports of individuals who committed serious  sexual offenses and gained access to child care facilities. We reviewed  open sources published between the years 2000 through 2010. Open- source information refers to publicly available information, and may  include information obtained from sources such as the media and public  data. It is a key component of traditional law-enforcement, intelligence,  and other information-gathering agencies, such as the Central  Intelligence Agency. To determine whether the preliminary listing of cases  resulting from the above data matches and searches of open-source  information was sufficient, we confirmed that both of the following criteria  had been met: (1) the individual was a convicted sex offender before he  gained employment or was present at the child care facility and (2) the  individual was convicted of a serious sexual offense, to include crimes  against children or a violent sexual offense, or both.", "To refine the list from which to select further cases for review, we  attempted to validate the identity of each offender and verify that he was  employed or present at a child care facility at some time during 2000  through 2010. We excluded from consideration cases where we could not  obtain records or immediately confirm the offender\u2019s identity and  employment. Further, we interviewed related parties, law-enforcement  officials, or representatives from state agencies to validate and  investigate the facts in each case. Where applicable and available, we  reviewed police reports, and other court documents.", "Ultimately, through a combination of our data matching, review of open- source information, public records, and interviews, and by focusing on the  offenders who had been convicted of serious sexual offenses in the past,  to include violent sexual offenses and crimes involving children, we  selected 10 cases from eight states and the District of Columbia. Of these  cases, 8 were selected from open-source information while the remaining  2 were selected from our comparison of SSNs in the NSOR with SSNs in  employment databases. The 8 cases selected from open-source  information cover the years 2002 to 2010. These examples are not  representative of the hiring practices of any child care facilities beyond  those highlighted in the report.", "To the extent possible, we conducted searches to determine whether the  sex offenders in our cases had previous criminal histories or were the  subject of previous allegations of abuse. In addition, although the focus of  our investigation was not to determine whether the child care facilities in  our cases received public funds, during our investigation we observed  that some of these child care facilities did in fact receive public funding. In  these cases, we obtained information from relevant federal, state, and city  agencies indicating whether the facility received federal assistance from  the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Head Start  program or its Child Care Development Fund (CCDF) while a sex  offender was employed or a resident in the home of a child care provider.", "Although our 10 case studies highlight issues or processes that may have  contributed to the employment or presence of sex offenders at the child  care facilities that we included in our report, the circumstances of each  case are unique and cannot be generalized to all child care facilities.", "We performed our work from April 2010 to August 2011 in accordance  with standards prescribed by the Council of the Inspectors General on  Integrity and Efficiency."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Parents who need child care services select from different types of child  care providers: in-home care, in which a child is cared for by a provider  such as an au pair or nanny in the child\u2019s home; family child care or group  home care, in which the child is cared for in a private residence other than  the child\u2019s home; and center care, in which a child is cared for by  providers in a nonresidential setting, such as in a church, school, or  business. Additionally, care can be provided by someone related to the  child other than the parents, such as grandparents, aunts, uncles, or  siblings, which is referred to as relative care. See table 1.", "In general, states and localities are responsible for regulating child care  providers and carry out this responsibility by (1) establishing specific  requirements that regulated child care providers must comply with in  order to legally operate; and (2) enforcing these requirements through  activities conducted by state licensing offices. The stringency of the  requirements with which providers must comply and the scope and  intensity of state enforcement activities differ among the provider types  within states as well as among states overall. Many states do not regulate  a significant number of providers. This is because, given the competing  priorities for limited funds as well as other factors, states must make  choices about the extent to which they can conduct enforcement activities  and the types of providers to which these activities will apply. State  policies regarding child care regulation are also influenced by the supply  of child care and its cost to parents. Research has shown that some types  of child care regulation may increase the cost of doing business for  providers, particularly for small providers like family and group homes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overview of Federal and State Laws Related to the Employment of Sex Offenders at Child Care Facilities", "paragraphs": ["Federal laws regulate the employment of sex offenders at federal child  care facilities, and widely divergent laws govern state child care facilities,  especially with regard to licensing requirements and penalties. We did not  analyze state regulations or policies, nor any laws, regulations, or policies  at the local level. In addition, the scope of this review did not include a  review of whether these laws were effectively enforced. For a summary of  laws related to the employment of sex offenders at child care facilities in  all 50 states, see appendix I.", "Federal Laws. The National Child Protection Law of 1993 requires the  Department of Justice to conduct a criminal-history check at the request  of child care facilities or other youth-serving organizations. This check  allows for a fingerprint-based criminal-history search of the FBI\u2019s National  Crime Information Center database. However, federal law does not  require child care facilities to use this service unless the facility is  federally owned or operated (or operated under a federal contract).", "Other laws governing the employment of sex offenders relate to facilities  that receive federal grants. For example, Head Start grantees must either  conduct a state or national criminal record check before hiring any  employee, depending on state law requirements. Grantees are  prohibited from permanently hiring an individual until these checks h ave  been performed, although they may conditionally hire an individual if it isnot feasible to perform a preemployment check. Employees are also  required to sign a declaration to all pending and prior criminal arrests and ith any  charges related to child sexual abuse and their disposition, along w convictions related to other forms of child abuse and neglect and  convictions of violent felonies. Grantees are then required to determine  whether the individual is fit for employment based upon his or her criminal  charge or conviction. In addition to requirements for Head Start grantees,  CCDF requires that states certify to the federal government that they  have requirements in effect to protect the health and safety of children in  child care facilities who are subsidized with these funds. However, the  block grant does not dictate to states the specificity, stringency, or  number of requirements they must have or the manner in which they  should enforce them.", "45 C.F.R. \u00a7 98.41. child care facility. Nine additional states more narrowly impose such a  prohibition on offenders whose victims were minors. Four states also  specifically prohibit sex offenders from residing at a facility that provides  child care services.", "Criminal-History Check Requirements. Although it is not always clear  whether criminal-history checks need to be completed prior to  employment, all 50 states require such checks for owners and employees  of licensed child care facilities. However, the requirements for licensing  vary widely. Only 3 states appear to require criminal-history checks for all  licensed and unlicensed child care facilities, while 11 states require that  all facilities that receive state or federal funds perform these checks. In  addition, 23 states require criminal-history checks for adult residents at  licensed child care or group home facilities. Fourteen states and the  District of Columbia specifically require checks for volunteers at licensed  childcare facilities, and six states specifically require criminal-history  checks for contractors. Finally, several states exempt child care facilities  associated with schools or religious organizations from the licensing or  criminal-history check requirements.", "Method for Conducting Criminal-History Checks. The vast majority of  states require that criminal-history checks for employees and other staff  be fingerprint-based and be conducted in both national and state  databases, but many do not specify that the checks must be completed  prior to an employee\u2019s start date. In four states, statutes require criminal- history checks, but they do not specify the use of either national or state  databases. In addition, five states limit the check to state databases,  while four states require national database checks only if the employee or  applicant has not been a resident of the state for a specified period of  time. Four states require by statute that criminal-history checks be  performed at specified intervals.", "Penalties for violations. All 50 states provide some type of penalty for  violating requirements related to the employment of sex offenders, but  these penalties vary widely. For example, 34 states and the District of  Columbia attach criminal penalties to licensing requirement violations,  failure of an owner or employee to disclose criminal-history information, or  failure to perform criminal-history checks. In 29 states, violation of  licensing requirements and failure to perform criminal-history checks may  result in civil penalties or fines, ranging from $5 per violation to  $10,000 per violation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cases of Child Care Facilities That Employed or Provided Residence to Sex Offenders", "paragraphs": ["We did not assess the prevalence of sex offenders working or residing at  child care facilities; our 10 cases do provide examples of sex offenders  who gained access to such facilities as maintenance workers, spouses or  friends of providers, a cafeteria worker, and a carpenter. Seven of these  cases involve offenders who previously targeted children, and in at least 3  of the cases, the offenders used their access to children at the child care  facility to offend again. As discussed below, we identified instances of  relatives and acquaintances who knowingly hired offenders to work at  child care facilities and facilities that unknowingly hired offenders because  they did not perform preemployment criminal-history checks. Our  investigation also found instances where child care facilities employing  sex offenders operated without licenses or received federal funds.", "Relatives or Acquaintances Knowingly Provided Sex Offenders  Access to Child Care Facilities. In at least 7 of our 10 cases, sex  offenders were hired or allowed to reside at both licensed and unlicensed  facilities by relatives or acquaintances who were aware of the offenders\u2019  previous offenses. As shown in the cases, the regulatory consequences  for allowing a sex offender to have access to a child care facility differ  widely, ranging from, for example, no action being taken to suspension of  a child care license to a misdemeanor charge for providing child care  services in a home where a sex offender resides. Examples from our  case studies include the following:  \uf0b7  Operators of a licensed child care facility in the District of Columbia  hired their son in April 2008 as an after-hours janitor even though he  had been convicted for attempting to sexually abuse a very young girl.  The terms of the offender\u2019s parole and District of Columbia law  prohibited him from being employed at a child care facility. After  interviewing the child care provider, we confirmed that the offender  was working at the facility in November 2010. The offender\u2019s father  told us that employing his son to work at the child care facility was not  a cause for concern, even though he was a convicted sex offender; he  also stated that his son\u2019s employment was approved by his probation  officer and that he only worked after the school was closed. We  referred the case to the Metropolitan Police Department, Sex Offender  Registry Unit, who told us that they could not take action against the  offender because he was no longer under court supervision and the  restrictions of his parole no longer applied. We then referred the  matter to the Office of the State Superintendent of Education, the  office responsible for licensing child care facilities in the District of  Columbia. In March 2011, the office required the owners to certify that  they had terminated their son\u2019s employment and notify him that he  was prohibited from visiting the child care facility, in order to maintain  their license. As of March 21, 2011, the office was still investigating  the matter.  \uf0b7  An Illinois woman allowed her husband to reside at her unlicensed  home-based child care facility even though he had prior convictions  for sexual assault and abuse. In Illinois, sex offenders are not allowed  to be present at any child care facility. Over a 6-year period, the  offender sexually molested one of the children under his wife\u2019s care.  He was sentenced to life in prison and is currently incarcerated.  Prosecutors told us that they could not gather enough evidence to  prosecute the wife.  \uf0b7  A Kentucky owner of a licensed child care facility hired a cafeteria  worker even though she knew that he had been convicted of sexual  abuse in the first degree, because she wanted to help him. Kentucky  prohibits child care facilities from hiring sex offenders for any position  involving direct contact with minors. A series of anonymous tips led to  an investigation of the child care facility, which resulted in a  suspension of her license and an order to cease operations. She  revoked her right to appeal the suspension.  \uf0b7  A woman in North Carolina allowed her husband and his son, both of  whom were convicted for taking indecent liberties with a minor, to  reside in a house where she was providing child care. North Carolina  prohibits sex offenders from being present at child care facilities. In  February 2010, the mother of two of the children who attended the  child care facility reported that one of the children had witnessed the  husband sexually abusing her sibling. The husband was convicted on  felony charges of being an offender in a home where child care is  provided and indecent liberties with a child and sentenced to 19 to 23  months in prison with 5 years probation. The offender\u2019s son was never  charged. Police arrested the offender\u2019s wife for the misdemeanor  offense of offering child care services in a home where a sex offender  resides; her trial was scheduled to begin in September 2011. We  could not obtain information regarding the present operation of the  child care facility.", "Child Care Facilities Not Performing Preemployment Criminal- History Checks. At least two cases show examples in which licensed  child care facilities unknowingly hired employees who were sex offenders  because they did not conduct required criminal-history checks. The  documents we reviewed and the officials we spoke with indicated that the  child care facilities did not perform these checks because of poor  oversight and an unclear understanding of background check  requirements.", "In June 2007, an offender who was convicted for sexually abusing a  minor gained employment as a substitute custodian at three child care  facilities in New York City. The City of New York requires criminal- history checks on employees of licensed child care facilities; and  according to the Director of the child care facility, employees are not  authorized to begin working until after the employer receives the  results of these checks. However, the offender was not scheduled to  have his fingerprints checked for more than 9 months after he began  working. He was subsequently terminated as a result of downsizing.  The organization only learned of the offender\u2019s criminal past through  our investigation. The Director of the facility also told us that it was  likely that the organization failed in its oversight role because he was  hired when the organization was in flux. The child care facility is now  owned and operated by a different organization.  \uf0b7  A South Carolina child care facility hired an offender in September  2009 who was convicted of committing sexual battery. The person  was hired to provide maintenance and repair services at six different  child care facilities. South Carolina requires licensed facilities to  perform fingerprint-based state and national criminal-history checks  on all employees. The owners said they did not perform a criminal- history check on the offender in this case because he was a self- employed contractor and not an employee of the child care facility. In  December 2009, the human resource director at the child care facility  reported the offender\u2019s employment to law enforcement and child  protective services. We could not obtain information regarding the  present operation of the child care facility.", "Some Facilities Operated without Required Licenses. At least 3 of our  10 cases involve child care facilities that allegedly cared for more children  than legally allowed without a license or did not operate as permitted by  the state. States and localities are responsible for regulating child care  providers by establishing specific requirements they must meet and  enforcing those requirements. Many states set thresholds at which  regulation begins according to the number of children served by different  types of providers and exempt from regulation those providers falling  below these thresholds. For example, in a given state, providers caring  for seven or more children in their home might be regulated, while  providers caring for four children in their home might be exempted from  regulation. Licensed providers are generally subject to standard  oversight, which includes background checks, inspections, technical  assistance and training, and the application of sanctions when providers  are found to be out of compliance. Unlicensed providers may be subject  to less intense scrutiny or none at all. However, the requirements for  licensing vary widely. If enforced, penalties for violating licensing  requirements also vary widely, ranging from a $5 administrative fine to  imprisonment for a term of years. Examples from our case studies include  the following:  \uf0b7  A Missouri child care facility providing care for 31 children employed  as a maintenance man a person convicted of attempted child  molestation. He had been working at the facility for approximately 2  years when he was discovered in January 2003. In Missouri,  fingerprint-based national and state criminal-history checks are  required for all employees of licensed child care facilities\u2014those with  5 or more children. However, Missouri exempts from regulation child  care facilities that are affiliated with a school system. The child care  facility received an exemption from state regulation after it claimed to  be a school; however, during the state\u2019s investigation, it found no  evidence to support this claim. The facility was eventually condemned  after state officials and police conducted investigations into allegations  of child abuse and found unsafe conditions. Subsequently, the  offender pled guilty to two misdemeanor counts of child  endangerment. The child care provider pled guilty to 31 counts of  felony child endangerment and received 3 years of probation. The  Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services told us that as of  November 2010 the child care facility was no longer in operation.  \uf0b7  Another Missouri offender convicted for having sexual intercourse with  a minor subsequently resided in the trailer where his girlfriend  provided child care services when he was arrested by police during a  domestic dispute. The offender pled guilty to assaulting his girlfriend,  receiving a 1-year suspended sentence with 2 years of probation. An  August 2004 report by the offender\u2019s probation officer indicated that  he was compliant with sex-offender registration requirements;  however, he continued to reside at the same home with his girlfriend  while he was on probation and she continued to provide child care  services. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services told  us that as of November 2010 the child care facility was no longer in  operation.  \uf0b7  An Arizona offender convicted of indecent exposure to a minor was  operating an unlicensed facility with his wife in October 2005. The  child care facility provided services for more than 15 children,  although Arizona required a license for any facility with 5 or more  children. Police discovered the offender operating the child care  facility after a parent alleged that he abused her child. The offender  fled the state, but was eventually apprehended. He subsequently pled  guilty to sexual exploitation of a minor and dangerous crimes against  children in the first degree and was sentenced to 13 years\u2019  imprisonment. According to the prosecutor, his wife has not been  charged. We could not obtain information regarding the present  operation of the child care facility.", "Several Child Care Providers Received Federal Funds. At least four of  the child care facilities\u2014two licensed and two unlicensed\u2014received  federal funds from HHS\u2019s Head Start program or its Child Care  Development Fund (CCDF). In all four cases, we attempted to determine  the amount of funds received during the time that a sex offender was  employed or resided at the child care facility, although we can not be  certain when offenders began living or working at some facilities because  the operators did not keep comprehensive records. The Head Start  program delivers comprehensive educational, social, health, nutritional,  and psychological services to low-income families and their children who  are below the age of compulsory school attendance. These services  include preschool education, family support, health screenings, and  dental care. The Office of Head Start makes grants directly to  approximately 1,600 local organizations, including community-action  agencies, school systems, tribal governments and associations, and for- profit and nonprofit organizations. Administered by HHS as a block  grant to the states, CCDF subsidizes child care for low-income children  under age 13 whose parents work or attend educational or job-training  programs. In September 2010, we reported that criminals could obtain  CCDF subsidies to provide child care because at least five states did not  conduct criminal-history checks, verify SSNs, or compare provider  information to sex-offender registries. In our current investigation, we  notified the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) at HHS of the  four cases where sex offenders worked or resided at child care facilities  that received federal funds. Details regarding our four cases follow.", "In one case, owners of the licensed Washington, D.C., child care facility  that hired their son, an offender convicted for attempting to sexually  abuse a child, to work as a janitor, received at least $1 million in  assistance from the Head Start program between April 2008 and  December 2010. Head Start requires that grantees conduct a state or  national criminal-history check on prospective employees, depending on  state law. The District of Columbia requires both state and national  checks for all owners, volunteers, and employees of licensed child care  facilities with 6 or more children. ACF has informed us that this facility\u2019s  Head Start contract has been terminated. In the three remaining cases,  two in Missouri and one in New York, child care facilities received funds  from CCDF. In New York, a licensed facility hired a custodian in 2007  who was convicted for sexually abusing a minor and the facility received  nearly $750,000 in financial assistance from CCDF between July 2007  and June 2008. In one Missouri case, a man convicted for attempted child  molestation worked at a child care facility that received nearly $250,000 in  federal assistance from the CCDF between 2001 and 2003. In the other,  an offender convicted for sexually assaulting a minor resided in his  girlfriend\u2019s unlicensed, home-based day care, which received more than  $4,200 in federal assistance from CCDF between 2001 and 2002.  Although Missouri is 1 of 11 states that requires facilities that receive  state or federal funds to perform criminal-history checks, there are no  federal requirements for CCDF grantees to conduct these checks.", "Table 2 provides a summary of the 10 cases we examined.", "Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public  Affairs can be found on the last page of this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix I: Summary of State Laws Related to the Employment of Sex Offenders at Child Care Facilities", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State AL", "paragraphs": ["Convicted sex offenders may not be  employed within 2,000 feet of a child  care facility.", "Fingerprint-based national and state  criminal-history checks are required of  all employment applicants,  employees, and volunteers of  licensed child care facilities (1 or  more children).", "Violation of the licensing requirements,  including failing to report criminal-history  information, is a misdemeanor.", "Convicted sex offenders with child  victims may not operate a licensed  child care facility.", "Fingerprint-based national and state  criminal-history checks are required of  all owners, employees, contractors,  unsupervised volunteers, and other  persons present on the premises of  licensed child care facilities (5 or  more children).", "Intentional or criminally negligent violation  of the licensing requirements related to  health or safety is a misdemeanor.", "Registered sex offenders may not  volunteer or be employed at a licensed  child care center.", "Fingerprint-based national and state  criminal-history checks are required of  all employees and volunteers of  licensed child care facilities (5 or  more children).", "Violation of the licensing requirements is a  misdemeanor and may also result in civil  penalties of up to $100 per violation per  day.", "Registered sex offenders may not  operate or serve as a contractor or  employee of a child care center.", "State fingerprint-based criminal- history checks are required of all  operators, employees, contractors,  and employment applicants of  licensed child care facilities (6 or  more children or one that accepts  state or federal funds).
