From fiscal years 1976 through 2000, this program collected approximately $156.6 billion in child support, with approximately $84.3 billion collected from 1995 through 2000. Despite these results, billions in child support remain uncollected. In fiscal year 2000, the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE), which is located in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), estimated that $84 billion in past-due child support was owed, but never collected, for all previous fiscal years.", "The Social Security Act as amended contains many provisions designed to help child support agencies collect support when noncustodial parents or their income and assets are hard to find, including two which relate to driver\u2019s licenses.

State CSE programs rely on SSNs to locate the addresses, income, and assets of noncustodial parents. Motor vehicle agencies (MVA) can be a valuable source of SSNs that CSE programs have difficulty obtaining elsewhere. The act also requires that states have laws requiring procedures to suspend, withhold, or restrict the driver\u2019s licenses of noncustodial parents who are delinquent in their child  support payments.", "In light of both the desire to have an effective child support enforcement  system and the desire to protect personal privacy, you requested that we  (1) determine the extent to which states collect SSNs from all applicants  for driver\u2019s licenses and what OCSE has done to promote compliance in  states not doing so, (2) identify privacy concerns associated with MVA  efforts to collect and safeguard SSNs that are used for child support  enforcement purposes, and (3) determine the extent to which state CSE  programs use driver\u2019s license suspension to collect past-due child support  and whether this tool has resulted in collections.", "To accomplish these objectives, we mailed a survey to 54 MVAs\u2014one in  each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 3 U.S. territories\u2014 and  received 53 back. The intent of the survey was to obtain information about  (1) the extent to which MVAs collect SSNs from licensed drivers and (2)  their policies and procedures regarding the collection and safeguarding of  SSNs. We also telephoned the CSE programs in the 50 states, the District  of Columbia, and the 3 U.S. territories to obtain information on how they  use MVA-collected SSNs, the extent to which privacy concerns about  MVA-collected SSNs exist in their jurisdictions, and their use of driver\u2019s  license suspension. We visited MVAs, CSE programs, Offices of Attorney  General, and legislators in 5 states (California, Georgia, Michigan, North  Carolina, and Texas) to obtain more in-depth information on the same  topics that we addressed in the MVA survey and CSE program telephone  calls. We analyzed data on driver\u2019s license suspensions during calendar  year 2000 from CSE programs in 4 other states (Colorado, Maryland,  Pennsylvania, and Washington) to determine the extent to which this  action resulted in child support payments. Finally, we interviewed officials  from OCSE and privacy experts about these two federal requirements. We  performed our work from November 2000 through December 2001 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. See  appendix I for additional information on our scope and methodology and  appendix II for a copy of our survey and responses."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The child support enforcement (CSE) program is a joint federal and state  partnership mandated in 1975 under Title IV-D of the Social Security Actthrough which noncustodial parents are located, paternity is established,  and child support orders are issued and enforced. State CSE programs are  responsible for carrying out these basic activities. These activities may  take place through judicial action or an expedited administrative process,  depending on the state where the action takes place. In a judicial process,  the courts have the authority to make certain decisions and take certain  actions, and proceedings take place in a legal setting, typically involving  district, state, or county attorneys, judges, and other parties. By contrast,  in an expedited administrative process, the state CSE program has the  authority to administer certain aspects of state child support law or  regulation without court approval being required for legally binding  actions.", "Although the states administer the child support enforcement program, the  federal government plays a major role. This includes funding most of the  program and requiring states to develop certain policies and procedures to  help locate noncustodial parents and enforce child support orders. The  Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE), in conjunction with regional  HHS offices, is responsible for overseeing and monitoring state CSE  programs\u2019 compliance with federal requirements.", "The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act  (PRWORA) of 1996 amended portions of the Social Security Act, including  some provisions that pertained to child support enforcement. One such  provision mandates that states enact laws requiring state agencies to  collect SSNs for child support enforcement purposes. Under PRWORA,  SSNs are to be recorded when individuals apply for certain licenses such  as commercial driver\u2019s licenses, occupational and professional licenses,  and marriage licenses. This provision also mandates placing SSNs in  records related to divorce decrees, death certificates, child support orders,  and paternity establishments. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 expanded  this requirement to include the collection of SSNs from applicants for all  driver\u2019s licenses\u2014commercial and noncommercial\u2014and also made it  effective for applicants of recreational licenses. Additionally, the Balanced  Budget Act initially made the effective date of this provision retroactive to  October 1996, as if it had been included in PRWORA. In 1998, however, the  effective date of this provision was extended to October 1, 2000. This  provision only required that SSNs be collected, not that they be displayed  on driver\u2019s licenses. A second provision of PRWORA requires that states  enact laws requiring procedures to suspend licenses of noncustodial  parents who owe past-due child support. Licenses subject to suspension  include commercial and noncommercial driver\u2019s licenses, and  occupational and professional licenses. Additionally, as part of their CSE  plans, states are required to provide OCSE with information on how they  will implement the procedures prescribed in their laws.", "CSE programs use SSNs to help locate noncustodial parents and enforce  support orders. SSNs are important in these endeavors because, by virtue  of being unique numbers, they help ensure that the correct person has  been identified as the noncustodial parent. This accurate identification is  essential in situations in which databases contain several individuals with  the same or similar names and birthdates. When SSN data are not  available, child support officials said that it is more likely that the wrong  person will be identified as the noncustodial parent. Efforts to confirm  identity by other means can be labor-intensive and time-consuming.", "When SSNs are available, child support programs use them as one  component in their efforts to identify the whereabouts, income and assets  of noncustodial parents by matching them against those in state and  federal databases. For example, child support programs use these matches  to obtain address information to locate noncustodial parents, to obtain  employment information to enforce support orders, and to identify the  driver\u2019s licenses of noncustodial parents who are candidates for license  suspension. Although CSE programs obtain SSNs from a variety of  sources, including MVAs, CSE programs themselves are not generally a  source of SSNs for other agencies. Generally, CSE programs may disclose  SSNs only to other CSE programs or social service agencies.", "While MVAs\u2019 use of SSNs varies, some MVAs accept a valid Social Security  card as one form of identification to issue a driver\u2019s license. MVAs also use  SSNs to control fraudulent driver\u2019s license applications, for internal  administrative purposes, or to track fines or fees. For these reasons 35 of  the MVAs collected SSNs from all drivers before being required to do so by  the federal government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most MVAs Are Collecting SSNs from Driver\u2019s License Applicants but OCSE Actions to Track and Promote Compliance Have Been Limited", "paragraphs": ["Most MVAs (47 out of 53) collect SSNs from all applicants for driver\u2019s  licenses, but OCSE has taken limited or no steps to promote such  collection in states not currently doing so.

Of the 6  states that are not collecting SSNs from all applicants for driver\u2019s licenses,  the legislatures in 5 (Georgia, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, and Oregon)  have not introduced laws requiring collection of SSNs in this manner, and,  although the remaining state (Michigan) has passed such a law, the MVA  has not implemented it. OCSE did not take any action against 1 state  (Michigan) because of a lawsuit, did not take formal action against 2 states  (Georgia, and Minnesota), and did not know that 3 states were not  collecting SSNs from all applicants for driver\u2019s licenses."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most MVAs Collect SSNs from All Driver\u2019s License Applicants", "paragraphs": ["Table 1 shows that almost two-thirds of the MVAs were collecting SSNs  from all driver\u2019s license applicants before the date of the legislation  requiring this practice, August 5, 1997.

Of  the 6 states not collecting SSNs from all driver\u2019s license applicants at the  time of our review, 2 performed such collections during the 1980s or  1990s.", "MVA-collected SSNs are used in at least one of two ways by CSE programs  in all but 2 of the 47 states that adhere to this federal requirement. The  first way that CSE programs use MVA-collected SSNs, along with SSNs  from other sources, is to help initially establish or verify the SSNs of  noncustodial parents. CSE programs consult a variety of sources  simultaneously when doing this, often through electronic networks that  link state agencies, including MVAs, or federal agencies. The second way  that MVA-collected SSNs are used in most states is to identify the driver\u2019s  licenses of noncustodial parents who are candidates for suspension. This  is normally done through computer matches, where the SSN from the CSE  program, the SSN from the MVA, and several other pieces of information  must match prior to suspending the driver\u2019s license of a particular  noncustodial parent.", "CSE officials from 44 of the 47 states that are collecting SSNs found them  useful, while 3 did not find them useful. The officials who found them  useful said that the SSN is one of many sources that their programs  consult and some of these officials elaborated on factors that make MVA- collected SSNs useful. Several explained that MVA-collected SSNs were  helpful because this source included SSNs on almost everyone in the CSE  system. This is presumably because MVAs have access to a wide range of  people\u2014everyone who wants a driver\u2019s license. Others added that MVAs  were particularly helpful for obtaining the SSNs of noncustodial parents  who were self-employed, unemployed, or working for cash because the  SSNs of these individuals tend not to be found in other more commonly  used SSN sources, such as state and federal agencies that maintain  employment or tax records. Finally, others explained that MVAs were  particularly important for identifying the driver\u2019s licenses of noncustodial  parents who were candidates for license suspension.", "CSE officials in the 3 states that did not find SSNs useful, as well as in  other states, cited various drawbacks to MVA-collected SSNs. First, in  states where MVAs only recently began collecting SSNs, they often do not  have SSNs from enough individuals for them to be of much use to the CSE  program. Second, MVA SSNs can be unreliable because most MVAs do not  have procedures in place for verifying that drivers are providing their  correct SSN. Only 14 of the 49 MVA survey respondents who answered this  question reported that they verify the SSNs that they collect with the  agency that issues SSNs, the Social Security Administration.

Officials from the MVAs and CSE programs in these five states indicated  that this noncompliance occurred, at least in part, because their programs  either did not bring the need for such laws to their legislatures\u2019 attention  or did not sufficiently highlight the need. For example, a CSE official in  Oregon told us that the state legislature was required to pass various laws  to comply with the Social Security Act\u2019s requirements and the need to pass  a law requiring collection of SSNs on driver\u2019s license applications was  simply overlooked until sometime in 2000 or 2001. CSE officials in  Maryland and Kansas told us that they mistakenly thought that the MVAs  in their states were collecting SSNs from all driver\u2019s license applicants and  thus never proposed that their legislatures pass such legislation.", "CSE and MVA officials from these five states stated that their legislatures  would most likely debate the privacy implications of this requirement  should legislation be proposed. However, privacy was not characterized as  the overriding reason for not trying to get such legislation passed. Other  reasons included the concern that proposing SSN legislation might detract  from pursuing other child support priorities, a belief that the MVA already  had the authority to collect SSNs in this manner, and concerns about the  cost of implementing this requirement.", "Michigan differs from the other five states that were not collecting SSNs in  that its legislature passed a law in 1998 requiring its MVA to collect SSNs  from all driver\u2019s license applicants. However, the secretary of state, who  oversees the state\u2019s MVA, did not want to implement this law for some of  the same reasons cited in other states\u2014cost and privacy. Michigan\u2019s  attorney general filed suit against the federal government in early 2001  challenging the constitutionality of the act\u2019s requirement.

This is largely because OCSE officials did not know about the  noncompliance in four states and did not take formal actions against the  other two states.", "State plans describe the nature and scope of a state\u2019s CSE program. Child  support staff located in the regional offices of OCSE\u2019s parent agency, HHS,  review and approve these plans, and approval is a condition for federal  funding of state CSE programs. As part of the state plan approval process,  OCSE and regional offices track whether states have passed federally  mandated laws.

HHS regional office staffs are responsible for  reviewing these updates to ensure that they comply with all federal  requirements. One tool that regional staff use for reviews is the legislative  analysis checklist, a list of federally mandated laws that states are required  to follow.", "OCSE learned from us about the noncompliance in three (Kansas,  Maryland, and Oregon) of the six states at the end of November 2001,well  after the implementation deadline. This was more than 4 years after the  SSN collection requirement was made part of the Act (August 5, 1997) and  nearly 14 months after the deadline for implementation (October 1, 2000).  With regard to two other states, OCSE became aware that one (Georgia)  was not in compliance sometime prior to September 2000 and the other  (Minnesota), in December of 2000.  For the remaining state (Michigan)  we were unable to determine when OCSE learned that it was  noncompliant.", "Because regional staff were unaware of state noncompliance at the time  that they were reviewing state plans, they erroneously approved four of  the six state plans. One HHS regional staff member mistakenly believed  that MVAs\u2019 collecting SSNs from some, but not all, driver\u2019s license  applicants was in accordance with the act. Thus, this staff member,  although responsible for monitoring this state, did not know that the state  was not in compliance with this requirement until we raised this issue in  July 2001. Regional staff responsible for three other states were unaware  that the states were not collecting SSNs from all licensed drivers. Regional  staff for these four states may not have been closely reviewing the SSN  requirement because the Act established many new requirements and  OCSE senior officials indicated that the requirement for MVAs to collect  SSNs was not their highest priority.", "Once OCSE officials and regional staff learn about noncompliant states,  they are responsible for taking action to try to bring the states into  compliance. They can take informal action\u2014discussing the situation with  state CSE program officials and other relevant parties\u2014or, in the case of  OCSE, formal action. OCSE officials take two types of formal actions. The  first is to disapprove a state plan, which will result in a state losing all  federal funds for its CSE program until it brings the program into  compliance with federal requirements. The second is to conduct targeted  audits focused on specific areas of noncompliance, which could result in a  state being subjected to graduated monetary penalties based on how long  it takes for the state to address the problem.", "As of December 2001, OCSE officials had not taken formal action against  the two states that they knew were not complying with the federal  requirement that states pass and implement laws requiring collection of  SSNs. Regional staff took informal actions, including sending a letter in  April 2001 to a CSE program in one state indicating that it may receive a  Notice of Intent to Disapprove State Plan in the future if it does not  comply with the SSN requirement. When asked why formal action has not  yet been initiated in these two states, officials responded that OCSE\u2019s  strategy is to first try to bring about compliance through informal  discussions. One senior official also informed us in December 2001 that  OCSE has asked HHS regional staff to determine the extent to which the  states that they are responsible for overseeing are complying with the  MVA requirement as well as the requirement that other licensing agencies  collect SSNs from licensees. Once such determinations are complete,  OCSE in conjunction with HHS will decide what formal actions, if any, to  take against noncomplying states.

Although many of these individuals did express  concern about the increased dissemination of SSNs throughout society,  most did not extend this concern to MVA-collected SSNs. This low level of  concern may reflect the facts that CSE programs are widely viewed as  having a legitimate need for SSNs and that federal and state laws greatly  limit the extent to which MVAs can provide SSNs to others.

Additionally, privacy experts we contacted tended not to  identify this requirement as an issue of concern.", "Many of these same individuals, however, expressed general privacy  concerns related to the increased dissemination of SSNs throughout  society because such dissemination increases opportunities for their  unauthorized use and disclosure. These concerns focused on the  dissemination of SSNs in the private sector and the belief that SSNs are  too easily accessible. For example, concerns were expressed about the use  of SSNs in commercial transactions, as a student identification number, or  as a library card number. Concerns were also expressed about how easily  SSNs can be obtained from the Internet or through companies that collect  and sell personal information.", "The low level of concern about MVAs collecting SSNs for child support  enforcement on the part of those we spoke with may be because SSNs are  being collected in support of a federal program and federal law restricts  how MVAs can use and share them. For example, officials of the Texas  and Georgia attorney general\u2019s offices and MVA officials in Texas and  North Carolina pointed to government\u2019s purpose in collecting SSNs to  facilitate the payment of child support as a reason why they are not  concerned about privacy. Children\u2019s advocacy groups echoed this belief,  and noted that SSNs are particularly important for facilitating the  collection of payments when noncustodial parents or their income and  assets are not in the same state as the child.", "Furthermore, federal law greatly restricts the extent to which MVAs can  provide SSNs to other entities.  Federal law protects individual privacy by  affirming the principle that the individual has a right to control personal  information released about oneself to others, by giving consent to such  disclosures. The Driver\u2019s Privacy Protection Act of 1994 (DPPA)explicitly defines SSNs as \u201chighly restricted personal information,\u201d a  category of information that may not be disclosed without \u201cexpress  consent\u201d of the individuals affected by the requests, except for certain  \u201cpermissible uses.\u201d According to MVA officials, the DPPA\u2019s consent  provision has led MVAs to discontinue the bulk disclosure and sale of  personal information, including SSNs, to private-sector entities.  Additionally, entities authorized to receive data under the DPPA must also  comply with the law\u2019s provisions\u2014that is, generally, they may not  redisclose SSNs without the driver\u2019s consent.", "Moreover, MVAs are free to adopt policies that are more restrictive than  those in the DPPA. For example, the Texas MVA only shares SSNs with  two other entities, both of which are government agencies, and places  redisclosure restrictions on these agencies. Additionally, according to  responses to our survey, when asked to identify entities that receive SSN  data from their agencies, MVA officials in 30 states identified only other  government agencies as receiving such data. States can also enact laws or  require written agreements to further restrict the extent to which entities  that receive SSNs from MVAs can disclose those SSNs to other entities.  Based on survey responses, 33 MVAs operate under such laws, written  agreements, or both.", "State officials in the six states not collecting SSNs from all driver\u2019s license  applicants expressed the most concern about the SSN requirement.  Although privacy was not the only nor the overriding reason these  individuals cited for not complying with this requirement, it was one  factor. These individuals mentioned that privacy concerns have been  expressed within their own agencies, by members of the public in their  states, or in their state legislatures. Such concerns were linked to the  belief that government use of SSNs can intrude on privacy, for example, by  exposing people to the risk of identity theft or by allowing government  agencies access to personal information that some people would rather  not provide to them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Weaknesses in Safeguarding SSNs May Exist at Some MVAs", "paragraphs": ["Privacy can be compromised if there are computer security weaknesses  because they raise the possibility that SSNs and other data stored in MVA  computers could be improperly accessed and misused.

While most MVA officials believe that their agencies are adequately  protecting the SSNs that they collect, our survey, which asked about  several of the components included in the federal guidelines, points to  potential weaknesses in the computer security programs at these agencies.", "The federal government has established guidelines identifying practices  essential to effective computer security. These guidelines have  emphasized the need to continually assess and mitigate risk.  The Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) and the National Institute of Standards  and Technology (NIST) have issued standards for federal agency computer  security.  Further, in 1999, we issued the Federal Information System  Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM), a comprehensive guide to conducting  computer security audits that is consistent with the OMB and NIST  standards.  In 2000, the Congress passed Government Information Security  Reform (GISRA) provisions that codified existing federal computer  security guidance. GISRA provisions include requirements for risk  assessment, agencywide security plans, independent audits, and  appropriate control techniques. This last category includes techniques  such as monitoring external access and appropriate policies for the  selection and use of passwords.", "GISRA requires federal agencies to adopt computer security programs, but  it does not require that state agencies do so. Furthermore, although  computer security standards have been established for state child support  agency systems, there are no nationwide standards or guidelines for MVA  computer security programs and computer security was not addressed in  the federal laws related to SSNs at the MVAs. MVAs as a group have not  developed computer security standards. Moreover, officials from the  American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) told us  that the association did not have a program to promote computer security  standards or best practices among MVAs. AAMVA officials said, however,  that AAMVA would be willing to do so if the Congress decides that such  standards are needed. Furthermore, although the Social Security Act  requires MVAs to collect SSNs for child support enforcement purposes  and restricts their use to those purposes, the law did not address computer  security at MVAs. Similarly, while the DPPA addressed the disclosure of  SSNs by MVAs, it did not address computer security practices that MVAs  should adopt to safeguard SSNs on their systems.", "Nearly all MVA officials we spoke with believed that the SSNs stored on  their agencies\u2019 computers are safe from unauthorized access. Our survey  asked MVA officials how easy or difficult it would be for MVA employees  or outside individuals to improperly access SSNs in their agencies\u2019  computer systems. Of the 48 MVA officials responding, only 4 said that  such access would be easy for MVA employees and none said such access  would be easy for individuals not employed by MVAs. We obtained more  detailed information on the security programs during site visits at five  MVAs. Officials at these sites described the computer policies and  procedures that they believe make unauthorized access of MVA-collected  SSNs difficult. These included firewalls to detect and prevent individuals  not employed by MVAs from accessing MVA computer systems. We did not  perform any audit tests to verify MVA responses.", "When asked about their computer security programs, MVA officials in 40  states said at least one of five components of computer security in our  survey was missing in their programs. This number included the 4 officials  who said that unauthorized access was easy at their agencies and most of  those who said that it was difficult. These elements are important for  protecting all personal information on driver\u2019s license applicants that  MVAs collect, not just SSNs.  Other types of personal information include  names, addresses, and telephone numbers.", "In MVA programs, at least one of the following elements was missing:  risk assessments to identify and explore how to mitigate potential  vulnerabilities; agencywide security plans to describe an agency\u2019s overall security audits to evaluate an agency\u2019s security program; access monitoring of an agency\u2019s computer system; and appropriate password selection and use.", "GISRA specifically established a requirement for risk assessments and  agencywide security plans, among others.  Periodic risk assessments  provide the foundation for other aspects of computer security  management. These risk assessments not only help an agency identify  risks and determine which controls will most effectively mitigate them,  but they also increase awareness and support for adopted policies and  controls. Such policies and controls should be described in agencywide  security plans. These written plans are important, according to  government and private security experts, to clearly and comprehensively  describe all of the security policies and procedures that an agency must  follow. These plans also serve as the primary mechanism by which  management communicates such requirements to an agency.", "It is important to have both risk assessments and agencywide security  plans because each of these components influences the other. That is,  security plans should include policies and procedures about when and  how to conduct risk assessments and conducting risk assessments can  lead to revising security plans. Table 2 shows, however, that fewer than  half of the MVA officials responding to our survey reported that their  agencies conduct risk assessments or have agencywide security plans.  Moreover, seven officials reported that their agencies did not conduct risk  assessments nor have agencywide security plans.", "GISRA and FISCAM call for computer security audits, which are also  important to an agency\u2019s computer security program. Such audits can help  agencies obtain objective assessments of their computer security risks and  provide information for agencies to use in developing their risk  assessments and agencywide security plans. According to our survey,  officials at 21 MVAs reported that they have not obtained any independent  audits, reviews, or studies. Moreover, of the seven MVAs that lack both  risk assessments and security plans, six have never obtained independent  audits.", "GISRA and the FISCAM also include two components of computer  security that are part of a broader category, known as control techniques  or access controls. These two components are monitoring who is  accessing computerized data and adherence to appropriate policies for  password selection and use. These are important because they can provide  reasonable assurance that computerized data are protected against  unauthorized disclosure. Monitoring consists of procedures to detect  unusual access activity, such as access by an unauthorized individual or  repeated failed attempts to log into a computer system. Passwords are  reportedly used by almost all MVAs to distinguish users from one another.

Driver\u2019s license suspension is the end result of a process that starts  with the identification of potential noncustodial parents who are  candidates for suspension because they are delinquent in their child  support payments. After initial identification, a warning letter is usually  issued notifying the noncustodial parent who is delinquent in paying child  support that his or her driver\u2019s license may be suspended within a  specified number of days unless the noncustodial parent pays the  delinquent amount, establishes a payment plan, or requests a hearing to  appeal the suspension. If noncustodial parents do not respond within this  time period, they become candidates for driver\u2019s license suspension.", "One key difference in driver\u2019s license suspension among states is the level  of delinquency that qualifies a noncustodial parent for suspension. Such  delinquency criteria is based on the amount of past-due support owed, the  length of time in which a payment has not been made, or a combination of  the two. Among the states with a delinquency criteria of past-due support  owed the amount ranges from $500 to $5,000 or the amount of support that  would accumulate in 1 to 12 months. The criteria also may specify a length  of time in which a payment has not been made, and it ranges from 1 to 6  consecutive months.", "A second key difference in driver\u2019s license suspension among states is the  agency that has authority to initiate and carry out this process. In 13  states, suspending a driver\u2019s license because of nonpayment of child  support is a judicial process in which courts can order a license  suspension after holding a hearing. In 31 states, it is an administrative  process in which the CSE program can suspend the license, usually after  the program has given the noncustodial parent an opportunity to contest  the suspension.

The  remaining officials in these 35 states characterized their programs\u2019 use of  driver\u2019s license suspension as routine or frequent or, as in the case of one  state, provided us with data on use of license suspension indicating that it  is used in many cases.", "CSE officials we spoke with in 16 states told us that their programs were  not using driver\u2019s license suspension to its full extent. These officials said  that, although their states use driver\u2019s license suspension, it is not used in  all cases that meet their states\u2019 delinquency criteria primarily due to  factors related to the discretionary nature of judges\u2019 authority and to  cumbersome administrative processes. Almost all of these officials  indicated that the child support programs in their states could benefit from  increased use of this tool and characterized driver\u2019s license suspension as  an effective tool for obtaining payments from noncustodial parents who  are delinquent in paying child support.", "In 11 of the 16 states in which CSE officials reported that driver\u2019s license  suspension is not used fully, licenses are suspended through a judicial  process and, according to CSE officials, many judges are reluctant to order  it. The CSE officials from judicial states who believed that some judges  were not fully using driver\u2019s license suspension characterized such judges  as being reluctant about suspension in general, as opposed to deciding  that it was inappropriate on a case-by-case basis. The main reason CSE  officials cited for judges\u2019 reluctance to use driver\u2019s license suspension was  concern that suspending driver\u2019s licenses would deny noncustodial  parents transportation to and from work, making it more difficult for the  parents to generate earnings and pay child support.", "Driver\u2019s license suspension is an administrative process in 5 of the 16  states, and CSE officials in these 5 states said that they would like their  programs to use it more often for the collection of child support payments.  These officials said that their programs were not fully using license  suspension primarily because the process for suspending licenses was  cumbersome. For example, as officials from 2 states reported, the  monitoring of noncustodial parents\u2019 responses to the initial warning letter  can be time-consuming and can make CSE staff reluctant to initiate the  license suspension process. Even when a noncustodial parent responds to  the warning letter by making payments, CSE staff must monitor the  payments for years after sending the letter because the driver\u2019s license can  be suspended at any time that the parent stops making payments. In  addition, officials in other states reported that difficulties working with  MVAs made the license suspension process cumbersome and limited its  use. In 1 state, for example, officials said that the MVA\u2019s computer system  matches delinquent parents with their driver\u2019s license primarily by first  and last name, and the system cannot identify the correct driver\u2019s license  to suspend if the delinquent parent has a common name. Consequently,  the CSE program may not be able to suspend the driver\u2019s licenses of those  noncustodial parents with common names.", "In the remaining 3 states it was not possible to gauge CSE program use of  driver\u2019s license suspension at the time of our review. One state has  recently relaxed its delinquency criteria, and the CSE official in that state  believes the program will use driver\u2019s license suspension more extensively  as a result.

We obtained data on  driver\u2019s license suspension in calendar year 2000 in four states\u2014Colorado,  Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Washington. We found that in nearly one out  of every three cases, parents who were subjected to this action made at  least one child support payment after being notified that their licenses  could be, or were being, suspended for nonpayment of child support.  In  calendar year 2000, 104,608 noncustodial parents in the four states we  examined had their driver\u2019s licenses threatened or suspended and the total  amount of child support collected from these parents was $48 million.", "In three of these states, the CSE programs were able to break their  suspension data into two groups: cases in which noncustodial parents  were warned of a possible suspension and cases in which the noncustodial  parents\u2019 licenses were actually suspended. Table 4 shows that in 80  percent of the cases, the states threatened suspension but did not actually  suspend the license. Moreover, in 28 percent of the cases, noncustodial  parents who were threatened with suspension made at least one payment,  resulting in $35 million in support payments. In addition, in 25 percent of  the cases, noncustodial parents whose licenses were suspended made at  least one payment, resulting in payments totaling $6 million.", "Although no one tool is always effective in collecting payments in all  cases, CSE officials in 51 states believe, and our data analysis shows, that  suspension does result in some noncustodial parents paying the support  they owe. Specifically, many CSE officials characterized driver\u2019s license  suspension as effective for reaching one or both of the following types of  noncustodial parents: (1) those who have a source of income from which  CSE programs cannot directly collect payments and (2) those who need  their license for work or transportation. Examples of noncustodial parents  in the first category are those who are self-employed, informally employed,  or are paid in cash. In these situations, CSE programs cannot withhold  wages directly through the noncustodial parent\u2019s employer either because  the parent does not have an employer or the CSE program is not able to  identify the employer. Examples of noncustodial parents in the second  category are those in jobs requiring a driver\u2019s license and those residing in  areas in which automobiles are the primary means of transportation.", "CSE officials also described circumstances in which driver\u2019s license  suspension was not effective in motivating noncustodial parents to pay the  support they owe. The most common circumstance cited by officials for  suspension not being effective was that some noncustodial parents may  not be concerned about losing their driver\u2019s licenses. Such parents may,  for example, already be driving with expired licenses, or their licenses may  have been suspended for reasons unrelated to child support enforcement.  In addition, several officials noted that some noncustodial parents do not  pay the child support they owe regardless of the enforcement action used  against them. For example, some CSE officials reported that their  programs have tried using every tool available against certain noncustodial  parents, and none of these efforts have resulted in child support payments.  Furthermore, CSE officials stated that some noncustodial parents do not  have the money to make their support payments so that any action taken,  including driver\u2019s license suspension, would be ineffective."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While most MVAs collect SSNs from all drivers and most CSE programs  use them, CSE programs in states where MVAs are not collecting SSNs as  required by federal law are not receiving the benefit of SSNs from this  source.
