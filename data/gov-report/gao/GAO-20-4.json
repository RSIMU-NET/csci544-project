In 2018, more than 36,000 organ transplants were performed at transplant centers across the country, including those within the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Organ Transplant Program.", "GAO was asked to review how VA administers and oversees its organ transplant program. This report, among other things, examines the process and timeliness with which VA reviews referrals and completes evaluations for organ transplants.", "GAO reviewed data from VHA's Transplant Referral and Cost Evaluation Reimbursement database, documents related to VA's transplant program, and federal internal control standards. GAO conducted site visits to three of the 12 VATCs, selected to obtain diversity in geography and types of organs transplanted. At the selected VATCs, GAO reviewed facility data and documents related to organ transplants and interviewed officials.

When a veteran is determined to be a potential candidate for an organ transplant, he or she can receive a formal referral to a VATC. Depending on the type of referral, the VATC must meet specific timeliness standards for reviewing the referral and deciding if the veteran should receive a full evaluation. Likewise, VATCs have timeliness standards for conducting the full evaluation, and generally showed improvement in meeting that standard from fiscal years 2014 through 2018. For those delays in conducting full evaluations that did occur, GAO found they varied by organ type and VATC. Specifically, in fiscal year 2018, transplant evaluation timeliness ranged from 60 percent at two VATC kidney programs to 100 percent at kidney, liver, heart or lung programs across seven different VATCs.", "According to VATC officials, transplant evaluation delays are caused when patients or caregivers are not available or not aware that they are required to be evaluated within 30 days of being referred. Although veterans may prefer to be seen at a later date, untimely evaluations can delay veterans' placement on the national organ donation waitlist. According to VHA data, 192 of the 1,617 transplant evaluation appointments completed in fiscal year 2018 did not meet the 30-day requirement. VATC officials said this was because veterans were not available or not aware of the requirement. GAO found that staff at referring VHA medical centers lacked a full understanding of the transplant referral and evaluation process. For example, VATC providers told GAO that transplant referrals are sometimes incomplete, requiring providers to spend extra time searching for information that should have been readily available. GAO found that additional training for medical center staff would help to improve the efficiency of the transplant referral process and the timeliness of transplant evaluations provided to veterans, a critical factor affecting veteran outcomes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["VHA should provide additional training for staff at VHA medical centers that refer patients for organ transplants on (1) submitting complete referrals and (2) understanding and communicating the veteran's role related to timely completion of transplant evaluations.", "VA concurred in principle with the recommendation and described actions the department will take to address the recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Organ transplantation is a life-saving procedure for many Americans and  is the leading form of treatment for patients with severe organ failure.

We assessed the  reliability of the data by reviewing relevant documentation, interviewing  knowledgeable United Network for Organ Sharing officials, and reviewing  the data for missing values. We concluded that the data were sufficiently  reliable for analyzing survival rates for the general population, but were  not sufficiently reliable for identifying veterans who received transplants  through VHA. As a result, we could not compare health outcomes,  including survival rates, between veterans in the database and the  general population.

We also  analyzed data from the TRACER database on organ transplant patient  referrals, evaluations, and transplants for fiscal years 2014 through  2018. To assess the timeliness of VATC referral reviews, we calculated  the number of business days or the number of hours\u2014between the  referral submission date/time and the decision date/time\u2014and compared  them to the timeliness standards.

See figure 2 for an overview of the five  steps.", "Step 1: Initial screening and referral. A veteran seeking an organ  transplant begins the process by having an initial screening at a referring  VHA medical center. If VHA medical center providers determine that the  veteran is a potential candidate for an organ transplant, they may prepare  a formal referral to a VATC. To prepare a referral, the providers use an  organ-specific checklist and other tools developed by VHA\u2019s National  Surgery Office with input from other experts in the field to perform a  standard set of assessments of the veteran\u2019s clinical, social, and mental  health status. In addition, VHA officials told us that the initial screening  includes an assessment of the veteran\u2019s social and family support; for  example, identifying a caregiver who can accompany and stay with the  veteran throughout the transplant process. In addition, there are organ- specific criteria, such as negative tobacco smoking screens for veterans  seeking a heart transplant, and up-to-date dialysis information for liver  and kidney transplant candidates. VHA officials noted that the providers  may consult with staff at a VATC as needed during the initial screening  phase.", "Following the initial screening, if VHA medical center providers determine  that the veteran is a potential candidate for a transplant, they enter the  checklist information into the TRACER database, include the results of  the required assessments outlined in the checklist, and attach any  additional medical information, such as testing performed through care in  the community. VHA officials told us that the VATC to which the veteran  is referred is chosen based on factors including distance from the  veteran\u2019s home and the types of organ transplants offered at the VATC.  Once the VHA medical center completes a referral in TRACER, the  information becomes available to the selected VATC.", "Step 2: VATC referral review and veteran evaluation. When the VATC  receives a veteran\u2019s referral, VATC staff review it to determine whether  the referral information is complete and the veteran meets the criteria to  continue the process. If so, VATC staff evaluate the veteran and perform  additional testing and clinical preparation needed to determine whether  the veteran is a transplant candidate. To reduce the travel burden on  veterans and their caregivers, providers at the veteran\u2019s referring VHA  medical center may arrange for telehealth visits with the VATC for pre- transplant education and consultation. However, travel for in-person  appointments at the VATC is required for most veterans referred for  evaluation.", "According to VATC officials we spoke with, the VATC considers the  severity of the veteran\u2019s illness and overall need for a transplant. In some  cases, this assessment is conducted by a panel of experts composed of  VATC providers and providers from the academic affiliate, where  applicable. For example, some VATCs hold regular review meetings to  discuss cases up for consideration jointly with providers from the VHA  medical center and the academic affiliate, because individual cases may  be co-managed depending on the type of organ being transplanted and  the services provided at an individual VATC. Providers at some VATCs  provide care at both the VATC and its academic affiliate, allowing for  integrated clinical management of patients.", "If the VATC determines the veteran is not a candidate for transplantation,  the referring VHA medical center can request a second opinion by  another VATC. If the veteran is once again determined not to be a  candidate, the referring VHA medical center can make a final appeal.  Appeals are forwarded to the VA\u2019s Transplant Surgical Advisory Board,  comprised of subject matter experts, for consideration. According to VHA  policy, the board considers the appeal and makes a recommendation to  the National Director of Surgery (the head of VHA\u2019s National Surgery  Office) who is responsible for facilitating second opinion requests, making  the final determination, and notifying the referring VHA medical center  regarding the final appeal determination. VHA reported that between  fiscal years 2014 and 2018, 39 decisions were appealed to the Transplant  Surgical Advisory Board, one of which was approved for resubmission to  another VATC for consideration.", "Step 3: Listing on the national organ donation waitlist. If the VATC  determines that the veteran is a candidate for an organ transplant, VATC  staff add the veteran to the national organ donation waitlist. At this point  in the process, veterans follow the same procedure as the general  population seeking an organ transplant. To maximize the chances that  the veteran will receive an organ, the VATC staff may also discuss options the veteran can pursue for personally identifying a potential living  donor (if applicable for the organ needed). VATC officials noted that  they may provide other clinical interventions to help prolong a veteran\u2019s  life and preserve his or her health while awaiting an organ; for example,  implanting a ventricular assist device into a veteran awaiting a heart  transplant.", "Step 4: Transplant surgery. According to VATC officials, once a veteran  is placed on the OPTN national organ donation waitlist, depending on the  type of organ needed, the veteran and their caregiver may be required to  travel to the VATC and remain in close proximity while awaiting organ  availability. In some cases, such as for a liver transplant, a harvested  organ can be kept viable for longer periods, allowing time for a veteran to  travel from their home to the VATC once the organ becomes available.  Depending on the arrangement between a particular VATC and its  academic affiliate, the veteran could receive the transplant surgery and  post-operative care at either the VATC or the affiliate. For example, the  VATC in Richmond performs heart transplants and contracts with its  affiliate for liver transplants. The VATC in Nashville performs kidney  transplants and contracts with its affiliate for heart and liver transplants.  From fiscal years 2014 through 2018, 61 percent of the transplant  surgeries provided within the VA Organ Transplant Program were  performed by a VATC and 39 percent were performed by an academic  affiliate. See table 1 for a list of VATCs, organ types transplanted, and  contracts with academic affiliates.", "Step 5: Follow-up care. Following the transplant surgery and the  immediate post-operative care provided by the VATC and its academic  affiliate, the veteran receives on-going follow-up care from both the VATC  and the referring VHA medical center. VHA providers monitor veterans  post-transplant for the remainder of their lives; for example, to oversee  post-transplant immunosuppression, and track survival rates and  outcomes for organ recipients. VA policy states that the VATC has  primary responsibility for providing care while the veteran is at the VATC  for the transplant and for providing specialized follow-up care after the  veteran is discharged. In general, however, following discharge from the  VATC, the veteran\u2019s referring VHA medical center maintains responsibility  for the veteran\u2019s care coordination.", "VHA has policies and processes to allow for some aspects of transplant- related care, including follow-up care, to be done via telehealth\u2014that is,  visits with a VATC provider remotely from the veteran\u2019s referring VHA  medical center. VHA medical centers may establish telehealth  agreements with VATCs to ease the burden of travel for veterans and  their caregivers, and to allow for ongoing monitoring of the veteran\u2019s  health post-transplant. Because VHA monitors transplant recipients for  the rest of their lives, using telehealth can decrease the need for the  veteran to travel back to the VATC unless a specific clinical need arises,  such as biopsies for heart transplant recipients. VHA officials noted that  follow-up care is facilitated by VA\u2019s shared electronic health record, which  allows VHA providers to share medical records and other patient  information over time and across locations. Further, VHA providers noted  that follow-up care and communication between VATCs and primary care  teams can be more complicated in the private sector when transplant  services are not generally part of a patient\u2019s whole system of care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Number of VHA Organ Transplants and Related Allocations and Spending Generally Increased from Fiscal Years 2014 through 2018", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Number of Organ Transplants at VATCs Increased between Fiscal Year 2014 and Fiscal Year 2018", "paragraphs": ["VATCs provided about 1,700 organ transplants between fiscal year 2014  and fiscal year 2018.

The percentage of  referrals for which VATCs met the timeliness standard increased from  94 percent in fiscal year 2014 to 98 percent in fiscal year 2018. (For  more information, see app. IV.)", "National Surgery Office officials identified two possible drivers of the  observed improvements: (1) increased monitoring, and (2) providing real- time feedback to VATCs through TRACER. Providers at one VATC  noted that they use information from the National Surgery Office\u2019s  Transplant Quarterly Reports to identify areas to improve and they  assigned a transplant team nurse the responsibility to monitor program  quality, including that timeliness requirements are being met. A provider  at a VATC where timeliness has improved since fiscal year 2014 and is  now at 100 percent explained that his facility has provided training to staff  at referring VHA medical centers they work with frequently. For example,  the official said he has hosted a workshop for transplant coordinators to  provide training on submitting transplant referral packets through  TRACER.", "While VATCs almost always met timeliness standards in fiscal year 2018,  VATC officials in our review noted that transplant coordinators at referring  VHA medical centers sometimes submit referral packets that are  incomplete, requiring additional time and effort by the provider to search  for information not readily available and potentially adding delays to the  VATC review times. VHA requires that a complete referral packet be  submitted through TRACER using a referral progress note that contains  the required assessments outlined in the organ-specific checklist. The  referral packet can also include attachments to transmit some required  information, such as results for tests performed by community providers.  Providers at three VATCs told us that reviewing a complete referral  packet generally takes 30 minutes to an hour. However, in cases where  the packet is incomplete (for example, it does not include the results from  all the required assessments) the process is much less efficient and,  according to two providers we interviewed, can take up to 5 hours. VATC  providers explained that when not all test results are available in the  referral packet, they have to access another VHA medical center\u2019s  electronic medical record system and search for the required information.  Accessing another medical center\u2019s system adds time to the referral  review process and can take time away from the provider\u2019s other duties,  such as providing follow-up care to transplant patients or monitoring  transplant outcomes.", "Internal controls state that management should assign responsibility to  discrete units and demonstrate a commitment to develop competent  individuals in those units, such as through training, to enable the  organization to operate in an efficient manner and help achieve the  organization\u2019s objectives. However, a lack of understanding or  implementation of the required information needed in the referral packets  can make the process for reviewing the referral packets inefficient in  some cases. Specifically, one VATC provider told us that incomplete  referral packets are often due to a lack of training for staff at the referring  VHA medical centers on the process for submitting referrals through  TRACER. In fact, four of the five transplant coordinators at referring VA  medical centers we interviewed reported a lack of training on submitting  transplant referrals through TRACER. Instead, for example, a transplant  coordinator at one referring VHA medical center said she received  assistance from a medical clerk at her facility on how to submit referrals  through TRACER. Officials at VHA\u2019s National Surgery Office told us that  although there is no centralized, in-person training available for referring  VHA medical centers, the office published a training guide, which is  available on VA\u2019s intranet and provides guidance on how to access  TRACER and refer patients for transplant evaluation. Despite this  resource, transplant coordinators from some referring VHA medical  centers still cited a need for additional training or other guidance. For  example, one official said training for new transplant coordinators would  be helpful as would regular updates on transplant criteria or policy  changes, such as through regular calls or a newsletter targeted at  transplant coordinators."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Timeliness of Potential Transplant Candidate Evaluations Improved From Fiscal Years 2014 through 2018, but Some Delays Remain", "paragraphs": ["In addition to timeliness requirements for referral review, VHA requires  that VATCs complete an evaluation of veterans within 30 calendar days  of receiving a referral to determine whether they are a candidate for  transplant and should be placed on the national organ donation waitlist.  From fiscal years 2014 through 2018, VATCs increased the percentage of  evaluations completed within this time frame, from 55 percent (576 of  1,045 appointments) in fiscal year 2014 to 89 percent (1,193 of 1,346  appointments) in fiscal year 2017, before dropping to 87 percent (1,325 of  1,521 appointments) in fiscal year 2018. National Surgery Office officials  attributed the overall improvement to increased monitoring and the  increased availability of telehealth for conducting transplant evaluations.  See appendix IV for more information on the timeliness of transplant  evaluations by VATCs from fiscal years 2014 through 2018.", "The extent to which delayed evaluations occurred varied by VATC  location and by organ type each fiscal year. For example, in fiscal year  2018, we found that the average time from referral to completed  evaluation was less than 30 days for 19 of the 20 organ transplant  programs, and overall, 13 percent of evaluations were not completed  within 30 days. Of note, 51 of 128, or 40 percent, of evaluations for  kidney transplant at the Bronx VATC were completed more than 30 days  after the referral was submitted, with evaluations ranging from 5 to 84  days after submission. In contrast, all 69, or 100 percent, of liver  evaluations at the Nashville VATC were completed within 30 days, with  evaluations ranging from 0 to 28 days after the referral was submitted.  (See fig. 4.)", "According to VHA data and three VATC providers we interviewed,  evaluation appointment availability is not a cause for delays in most  cases; rather, delays are primarily due to veteran preference. According  to VHA data for 1,617 evaluation appointments completed in fiscal year  2018, 1,412 appointments were scheduled within the 30-day requirement.  For the remaining 205 appointments, 13 were delayed due to lack of  appointment availability, and 192 appointments were delayed due to  veteran preference. According to providers at the three VATCs we  interviewed, while veterans may prefer to be seen at a later date for a  number of reasons, including that their caregiver is not available to travel,  veterans are not always aware that they should be evaluated within 30  days of being referred for a transplant. VHA requires the referring VHA  medical center to discuss the 30 day evaluation requirement with the  veteran prior to submitting the referral. According to VHA, in some cases  evaluation timeliness is a critical factor affecting patient outcomes.  Although a veteran may choose to be seen at a time beyond the 30-day  standard, postponing an evaluation may delay their placement on the  national organ donation waitlist, potentially having a negative impact on  their health and well-being.", "Officials at five VATCs and two referring VHA medical centers reported  that additional training for transplant coordinators would be helpful for  improving evaluation timeliness. Additional training enables employees to  develop competencies and reinforce requirements, which is consistent  with internal control standards that state that management should  develop competent individuals to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives.  According to one VATC provider, transplant coordinators at referring VHA  medical centers should be trained to discuss travel with the veteran  before submitting the referral, so the transplant coordinator and the  veteran understand that the evaluation should be completed within 30  days of referral, increasing the likelihood that veterans will be able to  schedule timely evaluations. A referring VHA medical center transplant  coordinator also said that additional training about the VATC\u2019s processes  would be helpful in order to be better able to inform veterans and their  caregivers about what to expect from the transplant process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Placing veterans on the national organ donation waitlist as soon as  possible is critical for potential transplant candidates to be matched with a  donor organ. Since fiscal year 2014, VHA has improved timeliness for  reviewing transplant referrals to determine if a veteran is a candidate and  for completing transplant evaluations. However, VHA medical center staff  do not always submit complete transplant referral packets through  TRACER, which can create inefficiencies and delay the referral review  process. Similarly, inefficiencies in the transplant evaluation process  occur when VATC and VHA medical center staff do not fully inform  veterans of their role in the transplant evaluation process, specifically,  that their evaluation be completed within 30 days of referral. Without  additional training to address these inefficiencies a veteran\u2019s placement  on the national organ donation waitlist could be delayed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["The Under Secretary for Health should establish a requirement that  VHA\u2019s National Surgery Office provide additional training to staff at  referring VHA medical centers on (a) submitting referral packets through  TRACER that are complete, and (b) understanding and communicating  the veteran\u2019s role in the evaluation process related to the timely  completion of transplant evaluations.
