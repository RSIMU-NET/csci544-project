Our work stresses the need for VA to address these challenges as  well as manage IT supply chain risks as it modernizes and secures its  information systems.", "Effectively Implementing Information Security Controls  VA has been challenged to effectively implement security controls over its  information and information systems. As previously mentioned in this  statement, the VA IG reported that the department did not have an  effective information security program and has had deficient information  security controls over its financial systems. The weaknesses described by  the IG are consistent with the control deficiencies we identified during an  examination of VA\u2019s high-impact systems that we reported on in 2016.  In those reports, we described deficiencies in VA\u2019s implementation of  access controls, patch management, and contingency planning. These  deficiencies existed, in part, because the department had not effectively  implemented key elements of its information security program. Until VA  rectifies reported shortcomings in its agency-wide information security  program, it will continue to have limited assurance that its sensitive  information and information systems are sufficiently safeguarded.", "Adequately Mitigating Known Security Deficiencies  VA has not consistently mitigated known security deficiencies in a timely  manner. As mentioned earlier, VA has reported a material weakness in  information security for financial reporting purposes for 17 consecutive  years. In fiscal year 2016, we recommended 74 actions for the  department to take to improve its cybersecurity program and remedy  known control deficiencies with selected high-impact systems. However,  as of October 2019, over 3 years later, VA had implemented only 32 (or  43 percent) of the 74 recommendations. One of the remaining  unimplemented recommendations calls for the department to consistently  and comprehensively perform security control assessments. This  recommended activity is an important element of a cybersecurity program  and helps to provide assurance that controls are operating as intended  and to detect controls that are not functioning correctly.", "VA has also been challenged in assuring that its actions to mitigate  vulnerabilities and implement recommended improvements are effective.  The department has asserted that it had implemented 39 of the 42  remaining open recommendations from our fiscal year 2016 reports.  However, the evidence VA provided was insufficient to demonstrate that it  had fully implemented the recommendations. The department  subsequently provided additional evidence, which was also insufficient,  indicating that its remedial action process was not validating the  effectiveness of actions taken to resolve known deficiencies. Until VA  adequately mitigates security control deficiencies, the sensitive data  maintained on its systems will remain at increased risk of unauthorized  modification and disclosure, and the systems will remain at risk of  disruption.", "Fully Establishing Elements of a Cybersecurity Risk Management  Program  VA has been challenged in managing its cybersecurity risk. In July 2019,  we reported that the department had fully met only one of the five  foundational practices for establishing a cybersecurity risk management  program. Although VA established the role of a cybersecurity risk  executive, the department had not fully: developed a cybersecurity risk management strategy that addressed  key elements, such as risk tolerance and risk mitigation strategies; documented risk-based policies that required the department to  perform agency-wide risk assessments;  conducted an agency-wide cybersecurity risk assessment to identify,  assess, and manage potential enterprise risks; or established coordination between cybersecurity and enterprise risk  management.", "VA concurred with our four recommendations to address these  deficiencies and asserted that it is acting to do so. Nevertheless, until VA  fully establishes a cybersecurity risk management program, its ability to  convey acceptable limits regarding the selection and implementation of  controls within the established organizational risk tolerance will be  diminished.", "Identifying Critical Cybersecurity Staffing Needs  VA has been challenged to accurately identify the work roles of its  workforce positions that perform IT, cybersecurity, or cyber-related  functions\u2014a key step in identifying its critical cybersecurity staffing  needs. In March 2019, we reported that the department had likely  miscategorized the work roles of many of these positions in its personnel  system.

Nevertheless, until VA completely and accurately categorizes the work  roles of its workforce positions performing IT, cybersecurity, and cyber- related functions, the reliability of the information needed to improve  workforce planning will be diminished and its ability to effectively identify  critical staffing needs will be impaired.", "Managing IT Supply Chain Risks as Part of IT Modernization  Programs  Assessing and managing supply chain risks are important considerations  for agencies, including VA, when operating and modernizing IT systems.  In July 2018, we reported that reliance on a global IT supply chain  introduces risks to federal information systems. We noted that supply  chain threats are present during various phases of a system\u2019s  development life cycle and we identified the following threats:  Installation of malicious or intentionally harmful hardware or software;  Installation of counterfeit hardware or software;", "Failure or disruption in the production or distribution of critical", "Reliance on a malicious or unqualified service provider; and  Installation of hardware or software that contains unintentional  vulnerabilities, such as defects in code that can be exploited.", "These threats can have a range of impacts, including allowing  adversaries to take control of systems or decreasing the availability of  materials or services needed to develop systems.", "Accordingly, agencies such as VA need to take appropriate measures to  assess and manage IT supply chain risks as they operate and modernize  their information systems. Failure to do so could result in data loss,  modification, or exfiltration; loss of system availability; and a persistent  negative impact on the agency\u2019s mission.", "In summary, similar to other federal agencies, VA continues to be  challenged in implementing an effective agency-wide program and  controls for securing its information and information systems.
