The Bureau recognizes this and has taken steps in at least three management areas toward achieving these goals. As requested, this report addresses the extent to which the Bureau is taking steps in accordance with selected leading practices that GAO identified for (1) organizational transformation, (2) long-term project planning, and (3) strategic workforce planning in preparing for the 2020 Census. To meet these objectives, GAO identified leading practices in these areas that are relevant to the Bureau\u0092s 2020 Census planning, reviewed Bureau documents, and interviewed officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Census Bureau\u0092s (Bureau) early planning and preparation efforts for the 2020 Census are consistent with most leading practices in each of the three management areas GAO reviewed. For example, with respect to its effort to transform its decennial organization, top Bureau leadership has been driving the transformation, and the agency has focused on a key set of principles as it begins to roll-out the strategy to staff. Furthermore, the Bureau has created a timeline to build momentum and show progress. At the same time, however, the amount of change-related activity the Bureau is considering as part of its reorganization of its decennial directorate may not be aligned with the resources the Bureau has allocated to plan, coordinate, and carry it out, and, as a result, the planned transformation efforts may not be sustainable or successful.", "Similarly, the Bureau is taking steps consistent with many of the leading practices for long-term project planning, such as by, among other activities, issuing its series of 2020 planning memorandums in 2009 and 2010 that laid out a highlevel framework documenting goals, assumptions, and timing of the remaining four phases of the 2020 Census. The Bureau also created a high-level schedule of program management activities for the remaining phases, documented key elements such as the Bureau\u0092s decennial mission, vision, and guiding principles, and produced a business plan to support budget requests, which is being updated annually. Still, the Bureau\u0092s schedule does not include milestones or deadlines for key decisions needed to support transition between the planning phases, which could result in later downstream planning activity not being based on evidence from such sources as early research and testing. Furthermore, there has been little effective outreach to the Bureau\u0092s congressional stakeholders about its reexamination of census processes and design, which could result in a lack of support on potentially complex or sensitive topics that can be crucial for creating a stable environment in which to prepare for a census.", "In the area of strategic workforce planning, the Bureau is taking steps consistent with leading practices such as by identifying current and future critical occupations with a pilot assessment of the skills and competencies of selected information technology 2020 Census positions. However, the Bureau has done little yet either to identify the goals that should guide workforce planning or to determine how to monitor, report, and evaluate its progress toward achieving them, which could help the Bureau identify and avoid possible barriers to implementing its workforce plans.", "The steps the Bureau has taken and has planned are positioning it well during this early phase of planning for the 2020 Census. Since much of the Bureau\u0092s early progress is tied to additional planning and other activity needed over the coming months, equally important will be the need to execute these activities in a timely manner to maintain the Bureau\u0092s early momentum toward a cost-effective 2020 Census."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Census Director take a number of actions to make 2020 Census planning more consistent with key practices in the three management areas, such as examining planned transformation activity to ensure its alignment with resources, developing a more-detailed long-term schedule to smooth transition to later planning phases, implementing effective congressional outreach to ensure a stable planning environment, and setting workforce planning goals and monitor them to ensure their attainment.", "The Department of Commerce concurred with GAO\u0092s findings and recommendations and provided minor clarifications, which were included in the final report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The characteristics of the census\u2014long-term, large-scale, complex, high- risk, and politically sensitive\u2014together make a cost-effective enumeration  of the nation\u2019s population and housing a monumental project-planning  and management challenge.

Leading up to the 2010 Census, we reported on  internal organizational, planning, funding, and human capital challenges  that jeopardized the Bureau\u2019s overall readiness. For example, we  reported that additional costs and risks associated with the data capture  technologies used in the 2010 Census were related to a failure to  adequately link specifications for key information technology (IT) systems  to requirements. And the lack of skilled cost estimators for the 2010  Census led to unreliable life-cycle cost estimates. Some of the  operational problems that occurred during the 2010 and prior censuses  are symptomatic of deeper organizational issues. For example, a Bureau  self-assessment carried out in October 2008 found that its organizational  structure made overseeing a large program difficult and hampered  accountability, succession planning, and staff development.", "We and other organizations, including the Bureau itself, have stated that  fundamental changes to the design, implementation, and management of  the census must be made in order to address these and other problems.", "In addition, the Bureau Director has testified that various parts of the  Bureau could collaborate more effectively. In response, the Bureau has  started numerous change initiatives, some directed at transforming the  Bureau\u2019s organization itself in addition to reexamining its fundamental  approach to how it will conduct the 2020 Census.", "GAO, 2010 Census: Preliminary Lessons Learned Highlight the Need for Fundamental  Reforms, GAO-11-496T (Washington, D.C.: Apr. 6, 2011).", "The Bureau\u2019s organizational transformation took a significant step forward  in July 2011 when it created a 2020 Census Directorate, with decennial  planning being led by its 2020 Research and Planning Office. The Bureau  is targeting to complete further reorganization of its decennial units by the  end of fiscal year 2013. In order to obtain necessary approval from the  Department of Commerce, the Bureau has set a target of February 2013  for submitting a proposal to the department. To support the organizational  transformation effort, the Bureau has designated an \u201corganizational  change manager,\u201d responsible for planning and managing the day-to-day  organizational change activities. Relatedly, the Bureau is attempting to  develop Bureau-wide, or \u201centerprise,\u201d standards, guidance, or tools, in  areas such as risk management, project management, systems  engineering, and IT investment management in order to reduce  duplicative efforts across the Bureau.", "The Bureau is also reexamining how it fundamentally conducts the  decennial census, committing to identify and implement innovation and  improvements as necessary to conduct the 2020 Census at a lower cost  per housing unit than the approximately $100 per housing unit cost of the  2010 Census (in constant 2010 dollars) while still maintaining high quality.  To do so, the Bureau has divided the 14-year life cycle of the 2020  Census into five phases, beginning in fiscal year 2009 with Options  Analysis. The figure below illustrates the sequencing of the five 2020  Census phases. The current, second, phase, Early Research and  Testing, comprises 35 research projects that are intended to explore how  design areas could be modified to control costs or improve quality, such  as by using the Internet, social media, and administrative records.", "As the Bureau reexamines how it will plan the 2020 Census, it is also  reviewing the employee skills and competencies needed to make that  happen, in part by a formal analysis comparing its needs to its in-house  capabilities being carried out by its Human Resources Division in  collaboration with the 2020 Census Directorate. One of the Bureau\u2019s  objectives listed within its early planning documents is to have a highly  competent workforce that is matched with the demands of the 2020  Census. The Bureau\u2019s 2008 internal assessment found that some  activities involving the management of large programs and projects, cost  estimation, and IT lacked staff with core skills and experience. The  Bureau has said that it needs to develop a clear understanding of how  existing skill sets align with emerging needs, determine the best use of  resources to close competency gaps, and provide information to  employees and managers to guide continuing workforce development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Bureau Is Beginning an Organizational Transformation Using Key Practices, but Further Planning Is Needed", "paragraphs": ["The Bureau is undertaking an organizational transformation of its entire  decennial directorate in order to improve collaboration and  communication across its divisions, improve operational efficiencies, and  instill a culture that, according to the Bureau, encourages risk-taking and  innovation without fear of reprisal. The Bureau believes such change is  necessary so that it can more-effectively control costs and enumerate the  population for 2020. In 2010, the Bureau generally completed its peak  census data-collection activities consistent with its operational plans and  released the state population counts used to apportion Congress on  December 21, 2010, several days ahead of the legally mandated end-of- year deadline, but did so at a cost that was higher than originally  estimated. The Bureau is incorporating several leading organizational  transformation practices, which we have previously reported can help  individuals affected by the organizational change adapt to the new  organization, while simultaneously managing the risk of reduced  productivity and effectiveness that often occurs as a result of change. Our  prior work has identified key practices in effective organizational  transformation, six of which are ensure top leadership drives the transformation, focus on a key set of principles and priorities at the outset of the  transformation,  set implementation goals and a timeline to build momentum and show  progress, dedicate an implementation team to manage the transformation  process,  involve employees to obtain their ideas and gain ownership for the  transformation, and establish a communication strategy to create shared expectations and  report related progress.", "The Bureau is at an early stage of planning for its transformation, and has  a difficult road ahead to finish the planning and begin implementing it. As  shown in figure 2, the Bureau has taken numerous steps consistent with  the key practices. For example, the Bureau Director has led the drive for  the reorganization, speaking in public and to Bureau staff a number of  times about the need for the Bureau to change if it is to remain cost- effective and relevant in the 21st century. Following the announcement of  the Director\u2019s upcoming August 2012 departure, several Bureau  executives said that they remained committed to the initiatives and vision  shared by the Director, including the organizational transformation. In  addition, the Bureau has focused on a key set of principles and  priorities at the outset of the transformation, by including in its  change-strategy documents not only explicit reliance on the guiding  principles for the 2020 Census, but specific principles to guide the  transformation itself, such as \u201cmake data-driven decisions,\u201d \u201cbe  responsive and transparent to decennial staff and stakeholders,\u201d and  \u201cfocus on an efficient and resilient organization.\u201d The Bureau has also  created a high-level transformation timeline to build momentum and  show progress that includes milestones such as staff workshops and  deliverables such as multiyear roadmaps.", "Figure 2 also shows that the Bureau plans to take further steps over the  next year. For example, the Bureau is planning to roll out much of its  transformation planning to its staff in June 2012. In July, the Bureau plans  to more directly engage decennial staff by beginning a series of data- collection activities, intended for staff to identify which decennial planning  processes work well and which need improving, and is considering  reliance on focus groups, online staff surveys, or workshops. Eventually,  and subject to sustained progress of the transformation process, the  Bureau plans by February 2013 to propose specific changes to its  decennial organization and finalize a timeline for carrying out the  transition to a new organization, subject to approval of the changes by the  department and the Office of Management and Budget.", "Although the Bureau is taking and planning many positive steps toward  carrying out its organizational transformation, it may be falling short in its  use of an implementation team. Specifically, the amount of change- related activity being planned may not be aligned with the resources the  Bureau has allocated to plan, coordinate, and carry them out. While  Bureau organizational transformation documents were largely in draft and  subject to change at the time we completed our review, the multiple  workshops being planned, the preparation of multiple plan and strategy  documents referenced as deliverables, as well as the collation and  analysis of data to be collected from staff, seem to be substantial work for  the sole staff member dedicated at this time to the transformation. That  person, the current organizational change manager, has time divided  among transformation planning and implementation, support of the  executive council advising on the transformation, leading a working group  on decennial strategic workforce planning, and leading a working group  on 2020 Census organizational change management communication as  well. We have previously observed that a strong and stable  implementation team responsible for the transformation\u2019s day-to-day  management is important to ensuring that transformation receives the  focused attention needed to be sustained and successful. If activity  planned for the transformation is not aligned with the resources dedicated  to it, various change initiatives may not be sequenced or implemented in  a coherent and integrated way, collected data may not be properly  analyzed and used, and risks to implementation may not be identified or  properly mitigated.", "In written comments on our draft report, the Department of Commerce  responded that after receiving the draft the Bureau assigned additional  staff and a contractor to support the Bureau\u2019s organizational  transformation activity. This action appears responsive to our finding, and,  as follow-up to this report, we will assess any action the Bureau may take  to examine the alignment between the levels of activity planned for the  transformation and the resources dedicated to their implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A More Detailed Schedule Could Improve the Bureau\u2019s Existing Project Planning Framework", "paragraphs": ["The Bureau is incorporating several long-term project-planning practices  that\u2014if continued and built upon throughout the decade\u2014should help the  Bureau avoid many of the management problems it has experienced in  prior censuses. For example, the Bureau experienced cost overruns for  the 2010 Census in large part because it had to abandon expensive plans  for increased use of automation in its field operations late in the planning  cycle. Furthermore, preparing a rigorous long-term project plan will help  the Bureau demonstrate to Congress and other stakeholders that it can  effectively design and manage operations as well as control costs. Our  prior work has identified key practices for effective long-term project  planning, five of which are develop a project plan, involve stakeholders, incorporate lessons learned, analyze and mitigate risks, and monitor progress.", "As shown in figure 3, the Bureau is taking steps to plan the 2020 Census  generally consistent with two of the five key practices we identified and  partially consistent with the other three. For example, early on, from June  2009 to November 2010, the Bureau began the practice to develop a  project plan by issuing a series of eight 2020 planning memorandumsthat laid out a framework documenting goals, assumptions, and timing of  the remaining four phases of 2020 Census. The Bureau also created a  high-level schedule of program management activities for the remaining  four phases, documented key elements such as the Bureau\u2019s decennial  mission, vision, and six guiding principles, and produced a business plan  to support budget requests, which is being updated annually. Also,  consistent with this practice, the Bureau has identified 19 specific  management-process areas from management literature and other  sources, for which it is developing strategies and plans, such as for  knowledge management and performance management (a complete list  is included in app. V).", "The Bureau also took steps to involve stakeholders internally in its early  planning when it officially kicked off the 2020 Census on October 3, 2008,  with a summit of decennial-census managers discussing challenges,  strengths, and weaknesses that would inform the 2020 Census strategic  decision-making process. The Bureau began briefing external  stakeholders in 2009, describing its approach and high-level plans for the  2020 Census at professional-association meetings, at meetings at the  National Academies of Sciences, and to oversight groups such as the  Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General (OIG) and us. To  help implement the practice to incorporate lessons learned, in 2011 the  Bureau created a recommendation follow-up process, built around a  database it created containing recommendations made in recent GAO  and OIG reports on the 2010 Census, and the Bureau has begun  including recommendations from its own 2010 Census evaluation reports  as well. Not having a formal process for recommendation follow-up for  prior censuses made it difficult to ensure that recommendations were  systematically considered by those at the Bureau best able to act on  them. In concert with a knowledge-management strategy, the Bureau has  provided these recommendations to relevant Bureau research and testing  teams for their consideration.", "Figure 3 also shows that the Bureau plans to take further steps over the  next several months. For example, the Bureau is planning in August 2012  to finalize both the detailed schedule of all program management,  systems engineering, and training activities for the current research and  testing phase of the 2020 Census, as well as all of the individual project  plans for the research and testing projects that it began during fiscal year  2012. According to Bureau officials, these processes will evolve and  mature as the Bureau learns from the initial implementation and progress  from one phase to the next. And in September, it will issue its initial plan  for managing communications on 2020 Census planning, progress, and  design with established 2020 Census external advisory boards as well as  its own staff.", "While the Bureau is taking steps generally consistent with two of the five  leading practices we identified in this area, additional steps are needed to  better implement three practices presented in figure 3. For example, to  better develop a project plan for long-term projects having multiple  phases, the Bureau can take steps to address three weaknesses with its  current scheduling. First, it will be important for the Bureau to include  milestones marking deadlines and decisions that affect later phases. The  Bureau\u2019s business plan for the 2020 Census notes one lesson it is trying  to leverage from prior censuses is to ensure that evidence from such  sources as research and testing is used to inform later planning. But,  current Bureau plans provide inadequate detail on when key decisions  will need to be made to support transition between the planning phases.  For example, while the Bureau has research and testing activity  continuing until 2018, it is not clear what specific activity must be  completed to inform design decisions that need to be made before the  next phase\u2014operational development and systems testing\u2014begins. With  the next phase scheduled to begin as early as 2015, if the needed  activities are not completed on time, the Bureau is at risk of not starting  downstream operations on schedule.", "Second, Bureau planning documents do not yet specify when milestones  for management activity will\u2014or needs to\u2014transition from the earlier  research and testing phase to later phases of 2020 Census planning.  Documentation of Bureau management planning focuses naturally and  primarily on the current research and testing phase, and much of it states  explicitly that the scope of consideration is limited to the research and  testing phase. Bureau officials explained that they expect to update most  if not all management plans for later phases according to experience  gained with them during early research and testing as well as the special  needs of later phases. Yet without a schedule for concerted planning to  create, revise, or update management plans to address the needs and  circumstances of later phases beyond research and testing, the Bureau  may find itself in transition without the management plans ready. This  runs the risk of the Bureau having to develop and manage parallel  processes if new ones need to be created before it has taken steps to  decide how pre-existing ones should be revised to support later phases.  A more-visible reflection of projected deadlines, or milestones, for  decisions related to later phases can help ensure that all necessary  efforts leading up to those milestones are prioritized and completed on  schedule.", "Third, the Bureau is still unsure when some initiatives to implement  Bureau-wide, or \u201centerprise,\u201d solutions in a variety of management areas  will be completed. The enterprise solutions the Bureau is implementing  show promise to reduce duplication of effort and improve consistency by  introducing common standards, processes, tools, and systems in areas  such as risk management, project management, systems engineering,  and IT investment management. Yet robust planning relies on  integrated scheduling to ensure that related and dependent activities are  coordinated and sequenced properly. Uncertainty over when enterprise  solutions that 2020 Census is expected to rely on will be ready could lead  to unnecessary duplication of effort or difficulty in mitigating risks of their  delayed completion. Indeed, the 2020 Census staff is already planning  and carrying out activities in these areas. Although it is consulting with  those responsible for the enterprise solutions, the Bureau\u2019s additionally  producing a schedule for each of the enterprise solutions\u2014including  expected dates of delivery for tools, processes, and systems, such as  2020 Census is expected to use\u2014would help minimize risks of  developing decennial processes and tools incompatible with, or requiring  time- or cost-intensive adjustment to harmonize with the forthcoming  enterprise solutions.", "Regarding the involvement of stakeholders in 2020 Census planning,  according to senior Bureau officials, there has been little effective  outreach by the Bureau to inform congressional staff about the scope of  topics the Bureau has planned as part of its approach to fundamentally  reexamine how it conducts a census. Bureau officials explained that their  congressional outreach thus far has been on budgetary and non- decennial issues. We have previously reported on the importance of  congressional outreach on the decennial to secure early agreement  between the Bureau and Congress on the Bureau\u2019s fundamental  approach for its next decennial. Congressional support\u2014regardless of  the approach ultimately selected\u2014is crucial for creating a stable  environment in which to prepare for the census. Some of the Bureau\u2019s  planned research, such as partial reliance on the Internet for data  collection, has not been used by the Bureau on a large scale before, and  the Director has also raised the possibility of a need for public debate on  the trade-offs between census cost and census quality. Engaging in  strategic bicameral and bipartisan communication can help build support  for the Bureau\u2019s approach to fundamentally reexamine how it plans for  and conducts a decennial census, and helps ensure an informed public  debate on any potentially complex or sensitive topics.", "The Bureau is piloting a process to incorporate lessons learned from  recent oversight reporting and 2010 Census evaluations, and will need to  take additional steps in order to rely on it as a mature tool to follow up on  prior recommendations. We have previously reported that it will be vitally  important for the Bureau to identify lessons learned from the 2010  Census to improve census-taking activities and address long-standing  challenges.recent 2010 Census evaluations and issues and assigns accountability  for follow-up to staff working on research and testing, and the Bureau has  plans to at least initially report on the status of recommendation follow-up.  However, the Bureau lacks a formal process for periodically assessing  the status of follow-up, and thus may lack consistent data to report and a  basis for knowing when to hold staff accountable for that follow-up. The  Bureau does not have in place a mechanism for systematic periodic  reporting on the status of follow-up\u2014such as on its intranet or Internet  pages. Nor does it have performance measures defined for measuring  the extent of recommendation follow-up, such as the percentage  implemented or the percent not followed up on within 12 months, which  would both allow the Bureau to more-easily track and report progress in  incorporating improvements and begin to systematically incentivize team   The Bureau\u2019s process captures recommendations from  or individual performance that incorporates lessons learned in order to  help build a more results-oriented culture. Research and testing project  teams reported out on which recommendations they would be addressing  within their projects, as required by Bureau timelines, and described their  plans for future action on recommendations. Taking these further steps  will help sustain progress in ensuring the Bureau takes advantage of  lessons from prior experiences and insights."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Bureau Is Incorporating Most Key Strategic Workforce Planning Practices but Does Not Yet Monitor Progress toward Workforce Goals", "paragraphs": ["The Bureau is incorporating several key strategic workforce planning  practices that address its objective of matching its managers, technical  experts, and workforce to the demands of the 2020 Census. Strategic  workforce planning encourages agency managers and stakeholders to  systematically consider what is to be done, when and how it will be done,  what skills will be needed, and how to gauge progress and results,  helping to avoid staffing problems the Bureau has experienced in the  past. For example, a Bureau assessment of its experience with 2010  Census observed that areas such as the management of large programs  and projects, cost estimation, and sophisticated IT lacked staff with core  skills and experience. Our prior work in human capital management has  identified key practices in effective strategic workforce planning, five of  which are:  identify current and future critical occupations, skills, and  competencies and analyze workforce gaps, develop current and future strategies tailored to address gaps and  human capital conditions in critical skills and competencies that need  attention,  involve top management, employees, and stakeholders in developing,  communicating, and implementing the strategic workforce plan, align workforce planning with strategic planning and budget monitor and evaluate progress toward achieving workforce planning  and strategic goals.", "As figure 4 indicates, the Bureau is taking steps generally consistent with  three of the five key strategic workforce planning leading practices for its  planning of the 2020 Census, although the steps thus far are largely  limited in scope to workforce planning for the second of the five 2020  Census phases\u2014early research and testing. For example, the Bureau  has begun to identify current and future critical occupations by  piloting a skills and competency assessment of selected IT 2020 Census  positions, including those for 2020 Census research and testing. In  support of developing current and future strategies tailored to  address workforce gaps that need attention, the Bureau has reviewed  its available strategic hiring, retention, and other workforce flexibilities. In  addition, top management has been actively engaged in  communicating the strategic workforce plan, with the Bureau Director  preparing staff for needed changes by speaking about it in town hall  meetings and postings on his intranet blog.", "Figure 4 also shows that the Bureau plans to take a number of steps over  the next few months that are generally consistent with the key strategic  workforce planning leading practices. For example, in support of the  practice to analyze workforce gaps the Bureau plans to finalize in May  its project plan detailing the steps, resources, and timeline for conducting  its Bureau-wide skills gap and competency assessment that it will  undertake later in 2012. To help develop current and future strategies,  in June, the Bureau plans to identify which of its existing training courses  can potentially help address gaps it expects it may identify, while in  August, it plans to document how its skills gap and competency analyses  will be updated and used during later census phases with target time- windows for later activity, including how it will align with budget  formulation. The Bureau planned some of these steps in response to our  discussions with its workforce planning officials.", "The Bureau\u2019s early effort to analyze competencies has the potential to  help it identify critical occupations and skills that will help it adjust to  changes in technology, budget constraints, and other factors that alter the  environment in which it operates. Top management is actively engaged  in developing the workforce plan and is setting the overall direction for  planning efforts. The Bureau\u2019s plan to document when skills gap and  competency analyses will be conducted for future 2020 Census phases  will help the Bureau manage other supporting activity to ensure that this  important workforce planning activity happens soon.", "Still, the Bureau could do more to implement its strategic workforce  planning consistent with key leading practices. The Bureau has not yet  determined its workforce goals from its skills gap and competency  analyses or laid out how it will monitor, report, and evaluate progress in  achieving them. According to the Bureau, it hopes to enable program  managers to flexibly, and on-demand, obtain reports on the status and  strategies targeted to their own goals and workforce needs. Identifying  agency goals for this initiative and a vital few performance measures can  help agency officials think through the scope, timing, and possible  barriers to evaluating and implementing the resulting workforce plans,  and the monitoring and evaluation itself can provide information for  effective oversight by identifying performance shortfalls and appropriate  corrective actions.", "Finally, the Bureau has traditionally obtained input on decennial technical,  operational, and policy issues from a diverse group of stakeholders, but,  according to Bureau officials, has not yet considered the role of external  stakeholders in developing, communicating, and implementing its  workforce planning. External stakeholders with appropriate expertise and  experience can play a useful role in supporting an agency with its  workforce planning such as by serving as a sounding board for agency  workforce initiatives. For example, academic institutions and their  accreditation organizations are positioned to discuss both the direction  the respective academic programs are headed and whether agency  needs can be expected to be met by them.

Applying leading management  practices in each of these areas of the Bureau\u2019s preparation for the 2020  Census can help ensure that the Bureau addresses these challenges and  delivers high-quality and timely results. Other areas of planning, such as  IT investment management, that are outside the scope of our review will  also require sustained attention. However, sustaining these efforts going  forward, especially given the Director\u2019s pending August 2012 departure  and the Bureau\u2019s historic issue of leadership continuity, will be a  challenge.", "The Bureau is generally or partially following most leading practices in the  management areas of organizational transformation, long-term project  planning, and strategic workforce planning\u2014positioning itself well during  this early phase of planning for the 2020 Census. Much of the Bureau\u2019s  early progress is visible in its plans for additional activity over the coming  months; equally important will be the need to finalize these plans and  execute these activities in a timely manner to maintain the Bureau\u2019s early  momentum toward a cost-effective 2020 Census.", "It will be important for the Bureau to take additional steps to further  implement leading practices in each of the three management areas we  reviewed. Reexamining its planned transformation activities in terms of  resources allocated to them will help ensure that its organizational  transformation team can prioritize and implement those activities,  properly use supporting data to enhance those activities, or identify and  mitigate risks to their implementation. The Bureau\u2019s long-term planning  will be aided by improvements in scheduling that will help to ensure the  coordination, management, and resource allocation to activities as  needed, and by a congressional outreach strategy that helps ensure  stakeholders are informed of new census design elements and possible  cost-quality trade-offs. In addition, improvements in the assessment and  reporting on the Bureau\u2019s recommendation follow-up system will help the  Bureau get the best return on that investment. Finally, for strategic  workforce planning, it will be important that the Bureau set agency  workforce goals so that it can determine how to monitor, report, and  evaluate its progress toward achieving those goals. Moving forward,  identifying external stakeholders with expertise and experience in  workforce planning challenges such as recruitment and soliciting  feedback from them will help the Bureau develop strategies to meet its  objective of having a workforce matched with the demands of the 2020  Census. Implementing these remaining leading practices can help the  Bureau stay on track for a well-planned, well-executed 2020 Census."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Commerce require the Under  Secretary for Economic Affairs who oversees the Economics and  Statistics Administration, as well as the Director of the U.S. Census  Bureau, to take the following six actions to improve the Bureau\u2019s process  of organizational transformation, long-term planning, and strategic  workforce planning for the 2020 Census, and thus better position the  Bureau to carry out a cost-effective decennial census:  1.  In order to ensure the Bureau\u2019s decennial organizational  transformation is sustained and successful, examine the alignment  between the levels of activity planned for the transformation and the  resources dedicated to their implementation, and adjust the activity  and resources as appropriate.  2.  In order to ensure prioritization and timely completion of all necessary  research and testing efforts, as well as timely transition to later 2020  Census phases, develop and implement a long-term planning  schedule that includes key milestones and deadlines, including deadlines for decisions that directly affect activity in later 2020 a schedule for creating, revising, or updating governance,  program management, and system engineering and architecture  plans to be used in later 2020 Census phases beyond research  and testing; and expected times of delivery for Bureau-wide enterprise tools,  processes, and standards that 2020 Census planning would be  expected to use.  3.  In order to inform congressional decision-making related to the 2020  Census, develop and implement an effective congressional outreach  strategy, particularly on new design elements the Bureau is  researching and considering as well as on cost-quality trade-offs of  potential design decisions.  4.  In order to improve the Bureau\u2019s process for following up on Bureau  and oversight agencies\u2019 recommendations to improve the 2020  Census, assess the status of recommendation follow-up at regular  intervals, such as every 12 months; and periodically report on the status of recommendation follow-up\u2014 such as on the Bureau\u2019s intranet or Internet pages  5.
