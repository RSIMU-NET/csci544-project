The federal government spent over $230 million on about 53,000 premium class tickets from July 1, 2005, through June 30, 2006. Premium class tickets are costly--for example, a Department of Agriculture (USDA) executive flew business class from Washington, D.C., to Zurich, Switzerland, at a cost of $7,500 compared to $900 for a coach class ticket. Based on statistical sampling, GAO estimated that 67 percent of premium class travel was not properly authorized, justified, or both. While business class travel accounted for 96 percent of all premium class travel, many agencies informed us that they did not track, and thus did not know the extent of, business class travel. OMB and GSA also did not require reporting of business class travel. GAO found large differences in premium class guidance governmentwide, with some agencies issuing less restrictive guidance that were tailored for executive travel. For example, the FTR allows premium class travel for flights over 14 hours if properly authorized. However, executives at the Foreign Agricultural Service frequently used \"mission critical\" to justify flights to Western Europe that typically lasted less than 10 hours. Other agencies, such as State and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), automatically approved premium class travel for all flights over 14 hours. GAO's analysis of flights involving destinations in the United States and Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Europe lasting 14 hours or more showed that 72 and 83 percent, respectively, of State's and MCC's flights involving these locations were in premium class. In contrast, 3 percent of all DOD's and the Department of Homeland Security's flights to the same locations were in premium class. There are examples representing specific cases of improper and abusive use of premium class, including employees of entities not subject to the Federal Travel Regulations that have issued policies that resulted in the purchase of costly premium class travel."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The serious fiscal challenges facing the federal government dictate that  agencies do everything they can to operate as efficiently as possible. With  respect to government travel, employees on official government travel are  expected to follow published guidelines related to when and how premium  (first and business) class travel should be undertaken. Due to the high cost  of premium class travel, the General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA)  Federal Travel Regulations (FTR) includes specific guidelines meant to  restrict premium class use. For example, agencies can provide business  class travel for agency mission; when an individual has a physical  disability that is certified by a medical professional; or a flight is to or from  a destination outside the continental United State, exceeds 14 hours, and  is taken without a rest stop en route or at destination (i.e., the 14-hour  rule). While travelers who meet these or a number of other criteria stated  in the FTR may qualify for premium class, GSA directs agencies to  evaluate each application, decide whether the circumstances warrant it,  and issue specific authorization before the traveler can travel premium  class. To safeguard taxpayer\u2019s money, the regulations state that agencies  are to conduct all travel as responsibly as possible. For their part, travelers  are told to exercise the same standard of care in incurring expenses that a  prudent person would exercise if traveling on personal business. However,  in 2003 and again in 2006, we reported that weaknesses in internal controls  at the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of State (State)led to improper use of premium class travel, that is, travel that was  unauthorized or unjustified. Premium class flights are of special concern  because they often cost thousands of dollars more than the coach class  alternatives. Subsequently, questions have arisen as to whether improper  and abusivepremium class travel was also occurring in other federal  government agencies. This report responds to your request that we  provide the results of our audit and investigative work on the use of  premium class travel governmentwide.", "Specifically, we (1) determined the magnitude of premium class travel  governmentwide and the extent such travel was improper, (2) identified  internal control weaknesses that contributed to improper and abusive  premium class travel, and (3) reported on specific cases of improper and  abusive premium class travel.", "To determine the magnitude of premium class travel, we extracted  premium round-trip airline ticket transactions from July 1, 2005, through  June 30, 2006, from the databases provided by the four banks that supplied  travel cards to federal government employees\u2014Bank of America,  Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, and US Bank. We drew and tested a statistical  sample of premium class travel transactions and conducted other audit  work to determine the extent to which this travel was improper. We  included in our statistical sample premium class transactions from all  executive agencies, wholly owned federal government corporations, and  independent establishments as defined by the United States Code. We  excluded transactions by employees or individuals approved to travel for  the legislative and judicial branches, executive entities with statutory  authority over their own travel that are not subject to the FTR, and entities  under treaty with the United States, and premium class travel obtained as  a result of mileage upgrades because they did not result in a cost to the  federal government.", "To identify underlying causes contributing to improper premium class  travel, we reviewed federal laws and regulations and selected agencies\u2019  implementing guidance, and interviewed agency officials on their agencies\u2019  approval processes for premium class travel. We also interviewed GSA and  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) officials on their oversight of  premium class travel. To identify whether variances existed in how  agencies used premium class travel, we calculated the extent to which  federal agencies flew premium class for flights over 14 hours to selected  locations. We used data mining to identify the most egregious examples of  premium class travel, including instances of high-priced or frequent  premium class travel by the same individual from July 1, 2005, through  September 30, 2006.

The purpose of the FTR is to ensure that official  travel is conducted responsibly and at minimal administrative expense.  Unless exempt by specific legislation, executive agencies, wholly owned  government corporations, and independent establishments are expected  to follow the FTR, including its promulgation related to premium class  travel. DOD\u2019s uniformed servicemembers and State employees exempt  from the FTR are covered by their agencies\u2019 travel regulations.", "OMB\u2019s general policy related to travel is that the taxpayers should pay no  more than necessary to transport government officials. Consistent with  this principle, the FTR states that with limited exceptions, travelers must  use coach class accommodations for both domestic and international  travel. Premium class travel can occur only when the traveler\u2019s agency  specifically authorizes the use of such accommodations (authorization)  and only under specific circumstances (justification). Specifically, the FTR  states that first class accommodation is authorized only when at least one  of the following conditions exists: coach class airline accommodations or premium class other than first  class airline accommodations are not reasonably available, when use of first class is necessary to accommodate a disability or other  special need that is substantiated in writing by a competent medical  authority, when exceptional security circumstances require first class travel, or when required because of agency mission.", "The FTR authorizes premium class accommodations other than first class  (business class) when at least one of the following conditions exists:  regularly scheduled flights between origin/destination points provide only  premium class, and this is certified on the travel voucher; coach class is not available in time to accomplish the mission, which is  urgent and cannot be postponed; premium class travel is necessary to accommodate the traveler\u2019s disability  or other physical impairment, and the condition is substantiated in writing  by competent medical authority; premium class travel is needed for security purposes or because  exceptional circumstances make its use essential to the successful  performance of the mission; coach class accommodations on authorized/approved foreign carriers do  not provide adequate sanitation or meet health standards; premium class accommodations would result in overall savings to the  government because of subsistence costs, overtime, or lost productive  time that would be incurred while awaiting coach class accommodations;  transportation is paid in full by a nonfederal source;  travel is to or from a destination outside the continental United States, and  the scheduled flight time (including stopovers) is in excess of 14 hours  (however, a rest stop en route or a rest period upon arrival is prohibited  when travel is authorized by premium class accommodations); or when required because of agency mission.", "As specified above, employees traveling in premium class have to meet  both authorization and justification requirements to qualify, meaning that  employees who, for example, traveled premium class on a trip exceeding  14 hours would violate the FTR if they traveled premium class without  receiving specific authorization to do so. Agencies subject to the FTR have  generally issued internal policies and procedures to clarify the premium  class travel provisions of the FTR, implement these provision, or both.  When issuing implementing policy, agencies have to follow executive  branch policy, which specifies that a subordinate organization seeking to  establish implementing regulation or guidance may make the regulations  more stringent but not relax the rules established by higher-level guidance.  For example, an agency\u2019s implementing policy related to premium class  travel because of disability can require that the traveler provides medical  certification that is updated annually, but cannot waive the requirement  that a certification by a competent medical authority be provided.", "DOD and State have also issued their own detailed implementing policies  and procedures that cover all aspects of travel, from authorization to  reimbursement to regulations for premium class. DOD issues the Joint  Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR) for uniformed service members not  covered by the FTR, and also updates the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR),  which implements the FTR for DOD civilian employees. Similarly, State\u2019s  Foreign Affairs Handbook and Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) represent  major sets of policies and procedures related to travel reimbursements to  Foreign Service employees pursuant to the Foreign Service Act of 1980.

Using statistical  sampling, we estimated that at least $146 million of this premium class  travel was unauthorized or unjustified. In addition, our statistical sample  population contained a number of flights taken by government executives.

We identified premium class tickets as any ticket that contained at  least one leg of travel in first or business class. Since the government did  not maintain centralized data on premium class travel, we extracted ticket  information from the government credit card banks\u2019 databases of  government individually and centrally billed account travel, which  included over 6.1 million transactions for airline tickets valued at almost  $3.4 billion.", "Although premium class travel represented less than 1 percent of the total  flights taken governmentwide, the high cost of premium class tickets  meant that premium class travel accounted for nearly 7 percent of total  dollars spent on government airline travel. In some instances, the price  difference between a business class and comparable coach class ticket  may be negligible\u2014particularly if the traveler traveled within Europe.  However, on routes where GSA had awarded a government fare for  economy and business classes, an average business class ticket in fiscal  year 2006 cost more than 5 times the cost of a coach class ticket. For  example, a traveler\u2019s one-way business class ticket from Madrid to  Washington, D.C., was over 7 times the price of a coach class ticket. First  class tickets can be even more costly. For example, another traveler from  the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) flew first class between Washington,  D.C., and London for more than $12,000, or more than 16 times the price of  a coach class flight. To put the total amount spent on premium class travel  into perspective, the over $230 million the government spent on premium  class travel during these 12 months exceeded the travel expenses on the  government travel cards of most individual government agencies,  including major executive agencies such as the Departments of  Agriculture, Energy, Health and Human Services, Labor, Transportation,  and the Treasury.", "Premium class travel usage also varied significantly across federal  agencies, both in the total amount and frequency with which premium  class travel was used. Some agencies spent only a fraction of total airline  expenditures on premium class, while premium class travel at other  agencies was substantial. Data provided by the travel card banks showed  that while DOD was the second largest user of premium class travel based  on total dollars, it had substantially reduced its use of premium class  travel charged to the government credit cards since 2004, following our  DOD premium class audit.Specifically, DOD\u2019s premium class charges  decreased from more than $124 million over fiscal years 2001 and 2002, or  more than $60 million annually, to slightly over $23 million in the 12-month  period ending June 30, 2006\u2014about 1 percent of its air travel  expenditures. In contrast, tickets bought by State for foreign affairs agency  travelers continued to account for the largest portion of governmentwide  premium class travel. Our data showed that the over $140 million that  State spent on nearly 30,000 premium class tickets for foreign affairs  agency travelers represented over 60 percent of its total air expenditures  during this period. This amount, which is comparable to our previous  finding at State, could decrease in the future based on actions taken by  State based on our previous audit findings and subsequent to the data  period we audited.

As a  result, the government did not have adequate data with which to identify  the extent of any abusive travel in the federal government.

Officials at GSA informed us  that they did not make determinations as to whether an agency  implementing guidance adhered to the spirit of the FTR. Similarly, OMB  does not oversee agencies\u2019 implementing guidance on premium class  travel.", "Without central oversight, it is therefore not surprising that we found  different interpretation and implementation of premium class policies  governmentwide. Some agencies, such as DOD, have made policy changes  designed to limit the use of premium class travel consistent with the spirit  of the FTR. Other agencies, however, have implemented the travel  regulations in ways that allow more frequent use of premium class travel.  For example, FAS\u2019s and Treasury\u2019s policies allowed employees to use  \u201cmission critical\u201d or \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d as criteria for premium  class travel less than 14 hours. In December 2005, in one instance, a FAS  executive traveled from Washington, D.C., to Hong Kong and back in  business class, a ticket that cost the government over $6,900. However, 11  other FAS employees traveled in coach class at a cost of less than $1,400  per ticket, despite the flight lasting over 14 hours. Data mining we  performed at these agencies found that the mission critical criterion is  typically used by senior executives to justify less than 10-hour trips to  Western Europe. Allowing senior officials to define their travel as mission  critical can have a substantial effect on overall travel costs. A department  travel policy allowing officials to justify their travel as mission critical  contributed to FAS spending nearly $2 million (about 30 percent) of its  total air dollars on premium class tickets, with a large proportion going to  fund executive premium class travel. We also found that while the FTR  requires physician\u2019s certification for premium class travel based on  disability, it did not require annual recertification. Consequently, we found  an instance where the doctor\u2019s note for a non-life-changing illness was  dated 3 years prior to the authorization for premium class travel.", "The variance in implementing guidance we observed was an important  factor in explaining the variances in the use of premium class  governmentwide, as shown in table 1.

For example, DOD\u2019s travel policy states that premium class flights  over 14 hours would be approved only if the travel is so urgent that it can  not be postponed or if alternatives did not exist. In contrast, MCC officials  informed us that its procedures permitted automatically providing  travelers with premium class for trips over 14 hours, without necessarily  requiring specific authorization.

More detailed information about some of the  cases follows table 4.", "Traveler #2 was a presidential appointee from Treasury who bought 21  tickets in premium class at a total cost to the government of $129,000.  Seven premium class tickets were not specifically authorized, and 12 were  authorized by a GS-12 subordinate and were therefore improper. Further,  the traveler took three trips in first class despite being specifically  authorized for business class travel. Treasury\u2019s implementing guidance  provides for premium class travel on trips that are mission critical. We  found that on trips of less than 10 hours, the traveler claimed to be  preparing briefing materials or reviewing materials en route that justified  the use of the mission-critical criteria.", "Traveler #3 bought 15 premium class tickets costing the government over  $100,000 from July 1, 2005, through September 30, 2006. According to the  travel orders for these trips, the official had a medical condition that  justified the majority of the trips. However, the only documentation of the  traveler\u2019s medical condition was a note signed by a peer of the traveler at  DOD. According to DOD regulations, flying premium class based on a  medical condition requires a physician\u2019s certification.

In particular, we found several instances where  groups of employees traveled to overseas destinations to attend meetings,  conferences, or trade negotiations. In one instance, a group trip in  premium class resulted in about $200,000 in increased costs to the  American taxpayers.", "We also found instances where State and Department of Justice (Justice)  authorized employees and their families to travel premium class in  permanent change of station (PCS) moves. As reported previously, while  State believed such practice to be necessary because it improves employee  morale, we question the need to provide premium class travel for PCS. In  particular, we note that although federal and State regulations allow  premium class travel if the flight is over 14 hours without a rest stop, DOD  had issued regulations prohibiting premium class travel for PCS, unless for  physical handicap or medical reasons. Specifically, DOD had determined  that premium class travel is permitted only for flights over 14 hours if and  only if the Temporary Duty Travel (TDY) purpose/mission is so  unexpected and urgent it cannot be delayed or postponed, and a rest  period cannot be scheduled en route or at the TDY site before starting  work. This decision is consistent with the prudent traveler\u2019s principle and  with DOD\u2019s new guidelines on the 14-hour rule, issued in early 2006.

We  found five trips that had no authorization for the travelers to fly in  premium class, and three trips that had duplicate tickets covering at least  part of the traveler\u2019s itinerary. In addition, we found that 17 travelers  arrived back in the United States on Saturday afternoon after flying in  business class. There was no evidence any of the travelers went to work  before taking a weekend rest period.", "Case study 2 involves a group of 21 travelers from the United States Trade  Representative Office within the Executive Office of the President. The  travelers each flew from Washington, D.C., to Hong Kong in December  2005 in business class to attend a World Trade Organization meeting at a  total cost to the government of nearly $100,000. The travelers ranged in  grade from GS-9 to SES. None of the travelers were authorized to fly  premium class, and therefore the use of premium class was improper.  According to GSA\u2019s city pair contract for this itinerary, the tickets would  have cost about $31,000 in coach class.", "As shown in table 5, the differences between premium and coach class  travel are made even more striking the larger the size of the group that is  approved to travel premium class. The high cost of premium class travel  by groups necessitates close scrutiny of whether it is absolutely necessary  for the whole group to travel in premium class. Even a mix of premium  class and coach class accommodations would represent significant savings  to the government as opposed to everyone traveling premium class.

In fact, some entities appeared to provide premium class as a  perquisite to senior-level executives.

We are encouraged that DOD has taken  steps to significantly curtail unnecessary use of premium class travel,  potentially saving millions of dollars.

The  databases contained airline transactions and nonairline transactions  charged to both the centrally and individually billed travel card accounts.  We queried the databases to identify transactions specifically related to  travel. The databases also contained transaction-specific information,  including the passenger name, the ticket price, and the fare and service  codes used to price the tickets purchased. We identified the fare basis  codes that corresponded to the issuance of first, business, and coach class  travel. Using these codes, we selected all airline transactions that  contained at least one leg in which the federal government paid for  premium class travel accommodations. We excluded from our audit  premium class travel accommodations obtained as a result of upgrades, as  these tickets did not result in costs to the federal government.", "As you requested, our audit covered premium class usage at executive  federal agencies and federally related entities. The population under audit  consists of transactions by travelers approved to use the government  travel card, except for employees and individuals whose travel was  approved by legislative or judicial entities and entities covered by treaty  with the U.S. government. Agencies included in the audit include executive  agencies as described in the Federal Travel Regulations (FTR), including  Chief Financial Officers Act agencies, other major executive agencies,  independent federally related establishments, and wholly owned  government corporations. As further detailed below, we performed  statistical sampling on these entities to assess their internal controls and  adherence to the FTR. However, to determine whether incidences of  costly premium class travel occurred at other federally related entities, we  expanded our data mining to premium class transactions of mixed  corporations, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and  other establishments specifically exempt from the FTR, such as the United  States Postal Service.", "We tested a statistical sample of premium class transactions to assess  whether premium class travel was properly authorized and properly  justified, and to project the results of these tests to the population of  governmentwide premium class travel. The population from which we  selected our transactions for testing was the set of debit transactions for  both first and business class travel that were charged during the 12 months  ending June 30, 2006. Because our objective was to test controls over  travel card expenses, we excluded transactions where half or more of the  ticket had been refunded. While these trips may not have been properly  authorized or justified, the amounts credited back to the government may  have been for the premium class portion of the ticket. We also excluded  refunded ticket transactions and miscellaneous debits (such as fees) that  would not have been for ticket purchases from the population of  transactions we reviewed.", "We further limited the business class transactions to those costing $750 or  more because many intra-European flight business class tickets cost less  than $750 and are for flights for which there is only a single premium class  cabin. By eliminating from our sample business class transactions less  than $750, we avoided the possibility of selecting a large number of  transactions in which the difference in cost was not significant enough to  raise concerns about the effectiveness of the internal controls. While we  excluded business class transactions costing less than $750, we (1) did not  exclude all intra-European single cabin flights and (2) potentially excluded  unauthorized business class flights costing less than $750. Limitations of  the database, specifically a lack of visibility between single- and  multicabin aircraft, prevented a more precise methodology of excluding  lower-cost business class tickets. For security reasons, we did not include  in our projection or data mining selections premium class transactions  related to agency-identified sensitive assignments and secretive details.", "To test the implementation of key control activities over the issuance of  premium class travel transactions, we selected a random probability  sample from the subset of centrally billed and individually billed account  transactions containing at least one premium class segment and for which  the business class ticket cost at least $750. We initially selected 192  premium class travel transactions. Seventy-nine transactions were  excluded because they were out of the scope of the sample. The final  sample size of reviewed, in-scope transactions was 96, totaling about  $391,000. We overselected initially because of the difficulty of perfectly  extracting transactions from all government corporations and  establishments that should be excluded from the sample population. For  each sample transaction, we requested that the entities provide the travel  authorization, travel voucher, travel itinerary, and other related supporting  documentations demonstrating justification for premium travel  arrangements. We also requested information on the rank or grade of the  traveler. Based on the information provided, we assessed whether  premium class travel was properly authorized and whether the premium  class travel was justified in accordance with the FTR or other applicable  travel regulations. If, after repeated requests, the entities did not provide  us with the supporting documentation, we concluded that the premium  class travel was improper. The results of the samples of these control  attributes can be projected to the population of transactions  governmentwide, not to any particular individual executive agency, federal  corporation, or independent federally related entity.", "Based on the sampled transactions, we also estimated the percentage of  premium class travel taken by federal executives, that is, presidential  appointees or members of the Senior Executive Service. With this  statistically valid probability sample, each transaction in the population  had a probability of being included, and that probability could be  computed for any transaction. Each sample element was subsequently  weighted in the analysis to account statistically for all the transactions in  the population, including those that were not selected. Because we  followed a probability procedure based on random selections, our sample  is only one of a large number of samples that we might have drawn. Since  each sample could have provided different estimates, we express our  confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as 95 percent  confidence intervals (i.e., plus or minus 10 percentage points). These are  the intervals that would contain the actual population value for 95 percent  of the samples we could have drawn. As a result, we are 95 percent  confident that each of the confidence intervals in this report will include  the true values in the study population. All percentage estimates from the  sample of premium class air travel have sampling errors of plus or minus  10 percentage points or less. In addition to percentage estimates, we also  estimate the lower bound for the cost of unauthorized/unjustified premium  class travel. This lower bound of $146 million is based on the one-sided 95  percent confidence interval for our sample estimate of $167 million spent  on unauthorized premium class travel, unjustified premium class travel, or  both.
