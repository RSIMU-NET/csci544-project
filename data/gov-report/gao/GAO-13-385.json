The Navy and Air Force have data on the baseline costs for some or all of their EOD activities, but the Army and Marine Corps do not have complete data on spending for EOD activities. Therefore, DOD does not have complete data on service spending on EOD activities needed to determine the costs of its current EOD capability and to provide a basis for future joint planning.

Joint doctrine facilitates planning for operations and establishes a link between what must be accomplished and the capabilities for doing so. DOD studies have noted commanders' limited awareness of EOD capabilities during combat operations, and EOD personnel reported challenges they attributed to non-EOD forces' lack of understanding of EOD operations. Several DOD organizations have responsibilities for some EOD functions, but no entity has been designated as the focal point for joint EOD doctrine. Joint doctrine could help leaders identify EOD capability requirements and better position combatant commanders in their use of EOD forces in future operations.

Each of the services met the combatant commanders\u2019 high  demand for EOD personnel by deploying EOD units and assuming risks  as other EOD missions and training activities were left unfulfilled. For  example, according to service officials, the services assumed some risks  in some mission areas such as countering sea mines, clearing  unexploded ordnance on training ranges, and providing defense support  to civil authorities. EOD personnel who participated in our group  discussions said they experienced multiple deployments and limited time  at home, maintaining a pace that was exacerbated by time spent away  from home in training and in support of the U.S. Secret Service and  Department of State in the protection of important officials.

For example, according to Navy  officials, Navy EOD personnel will re-emphasize skills\u2014such as diving\u2014 that are needed for their core missions. EOD forces will also be assigned  to traditional missions to fill gaps in capabilities that came about when  EOD forces were deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq. For example,  according to DOD officials, EOD personnel will be available to combatant  commanders for humanitarian demining, irregular warfare, and building  international partner capacity activities. Also, according to Army officials,  Army EOD forces will be available to respond more quickly to incidents  involving unexploded military ordnance found in local communities. In  addition, EOD forces will continue to provide support to the Very  Important Persons Protection Support Activity\u2019s mission of ensuring the  safety of federal officials, such as the President, as they travel. In fiscal  year 2012, the services provided more than 473,000 hours of support to  this activity; as a presidential election year, 2012 required greater than  the annual average of about 300,000 hours provided from fiscal years  2007 through 2011.", "DOD officials expect EOD capabilities to continue to be in demand by  combatant commanders for the foreseeable future. For example, officials  believe that the IED threat is likely to persist given its low cost and high  accessibility to non-state adversaries. In addition, based on the primary   the services  missions highlighted in DOD\u2019s current strategic guidance,anticipate continued requirements for EOD capabilities. For example,  EOD capabilities are expected to be needed for several missions  including, among others: (1) countering terrorism and irregular warfare;  (2) countering anti-access/area denial measures, including mining; (3)  countering weapons of mass destruction; and (4) providing support to civil  authorities. The mission of countering anti-access/area denial measures,  in particular, will require Navy EOD forces to train to counter anti-access  measures that use sea mines and to clear explosive obstacles in sea  lines of communication. Also, Air Force EOD forces will be expected to  train to support recovery operations to keep air bases and runways clear  of unexploded ordnance. All the services\u2019 EOD forces will need to  continue to train for homeland missions of providing support to civil  authorities.

In the future these costs will have to be  funded from regular appropriations, and to compete with other service  priorities. For example, the services received EOD robots and mine  resistant ambush-protected vehicles from overseas contingency  operations funding. Should EOD units need to continue to use the  equipment in the future or to acquire similar such equipment, maintaining  and procuring it may have to be funded through regular appropriations.  Overseas contingency operations funding also provided advanced  homemade explosive, forensic, and medical training opportunities that  EOD technicians in our discussion groups thought were valuable to their  missions and their safety.", "Service officials expressed concerns to us about the adequacy of future  funding for their EOD forces after overseas contingency operations  funding is phased out, but the extent to which the services have  identifiable funding plans for future EOD activities varied.

Looking toward the future,  DOD and the services believe that broad demand for this capability will  continue. Growth of the EOD forces until now has been funded in part by  overseas contingency operations dollars, but these funds are likely to  decrease as operations in Afghanistan diminish. A major challenge facing  the EOD community, especially the Army and Marine Corps, is the lack of  complete information to clearly show the resources it will take to sustain  their larger force levels. Further, DOD does not have good visibility into  service spending on EOD forces. Without comprehensive information on  the costs of the services\u2019 EOD forces, senior service and DOD leaders  are not well positioned to justify the current EOD force structure or to  ensure that funding goes to priorities in accordance with strategic  guidance.

After receiving the data showing the total number of  hours dedicated to support this activity, we reviewed the data and  interviewed the U.S. Northern Command official who provided them to  assess the data\u2019s reliability. Based on these actions, we determined that  these data were sufficiently reliable to include the amount of hours of  support EOD personnel provided to this activity. We also requested data  on the organizational structure of EOD forces from each of the services;  operational tempo of EOD units and the authorized numbers of EOD  officers and enlisted personnel within each service from fiscal year 2002  through fiscal year 2012; as well as projected manpower needs through  fiscal year 2017. After receiving the authorized EOD personnel data, as  identified by the services, we interviewed service officials who had  provided it and other subject matter experts to assess the reliability of the  data. Based on our review of the personnel data provided and our  interviews, we determined that the personnel data were sufficiently  reliable to describe growth in numbers of EOD personnel. Additionally, we  interviewed key cognizant DOD officials with responsibility for EOD  activities across the department\u2014including from the Office of the  Secretary of Defense, each of the military services, selected support  commands, and units\u2014to gain their perspectives on the operational  tempo of EOD forces, use of joint EOD forces for recent EOD combat  missions and challenges, and expected future EOD mission  requirements.", "To determine the extent to which DOD and the services have identified  funding to resource EOD forces to meet anticipated future requirements,  we collected and analyzed available EOD funding data from each of the  services for fiscal years 2010 through 2012. We requested that the  services provide EOD funding data from the base and overseas  contingency operations budgets for specific funding accounts, including  military personnel; operation and maintenance; procurement; and  research, development, test, and evaluation. Also, we requested that the  services identify funding, if any, received from the Joint IED Defeat  Organization, or other sources. The comprehensiveness of the data  provided by each of the military services varied. After receiving the  funding data, we interviewed service officials who had provided them to  assess the reliability of the data. Based on our review of the funding data  provided and our interviews, we determined that the funding data were  incomplete, potentially inaccurate, and not sufficiently reliable to establish  a baseline level of DOD\u2019s EOD spending.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has developed guidance for  employing the EOD capability effectively in joint operations, we  systematically analyzed 75 unclassified and for official use only  documents of existing joint DOD doctrine (Joint Publications) to identify  the inclusion of EOD functions. One GAO analyst conducted this analysis,  coding the information and entering it into a separate record, and another  GAO analyst verified the information for accuracy. All disagreements  were resolved by a third GAO analyst. The analysts then tallied the total  number of joint DOD doctrinal documents in which EOD functions were  included. In addition, we reviewed and analyzed prior DOD reports\u2019  findings about doctrine and examined whether associated  recommendations had been implemented. Specifically, we reviewed an  EOD report from the Joint Staff and an EOD report analyzing  transforming the joint EOD force. We also reviewed guidance on EOD  activities from the services, including multi-service tactics, techniques,  and procedures guidance. Additionally, we interviewed key EOD officials  across DOD to ascertain the extent to which DOD has comprehensive  joint EOD guidance and, if so, any potential benefits joint guidance has  provided. Moreover, we discussed with DOD and service officials how  EOD has been integrated jointly across DOD in areas such as joint  operations and the joint training and equipping of EOD forces.", "Finally, we met with EOD leadership and personnel from selected EOD  units in all four military services and conducted 28 group discussions with  EOD-qualified team members, team leaders, senior enlisted personnel,  and officers to obtain their perspectives on issues related to military  service-specific EOD missions, joint combat operations, training,  equipment, and operational tempo. We used these data to provide  illustrative examples throughout this report. A detailed discussion of how  we conducted those group discussions follows, and more details of the  themes from the group discussions can be found in appendix II. The  group discussions included EOD-qualified personnel from the following  military units:  52nd Ordnance Group (EOD), Fort Campbell, Kentucky", "49th EOD Company, Fort Campbell, Kentucky;", "723rd EOD Company, Fort Campbell, Kentucky; and", "788th EOD Company, Fort Campbell, Kentucky.", "EOD Group One, Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, California", "EOD Mobile Unit One, Naval Base Point Loma, California;", "EOD Mobile Unit Three, Naval Amphibious Base Coronado,", "EOD Mobile Unit Eleven, Imperial Beach, California.", "1st EOD Company, Camp Pendleton, California;", "3rd EOD Company, Okinawa, Japan; and", "EOD Personnel Supporting the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, Marine  Corps Air Station Miramar, California.", "96th EOD Flight Civil Engineering Squadron EOD Flight, Eglin Air  Force Base, Florida.", "We selected EOD units to visit based on information from the services for  units that had recent deployment experience as well as the ability to  provide sufficient quantities of EOD-qualified personnel who would be  available to participate in our group discussions.", "Our overall objective in using the group discussion approach was to  obtain insight and perspectives from EOD personnel on training,  equipment, operational tempo, joint military operations, and military  service-specific responsibilities. Group discussions, which are similar in  nature and intent to focus groups, involve structured small group  discussions designed to obtain in-depth information about specific issues.  The information obtained is such that it cannot easily be obtained from a  set of individual interviews. From each location, we requested that each  military service provide up to 10 volunteers to participate in our group  discussions. We also conducted group discussions separated by rank  and position. Specifically, we conducted separate group discussions that  were comprised of officers, senior enlisted personnel, team leaders, and  team members. At one location, two group discussions included both  officers and senior enlisted personnel, and two other group discussions  included all available EOD personnel assigned to those particular units.  The number of participants per group discussion ranged from 2 to 12.  Discussions were held in a semi-structured manner, led by a moderator  who followed a standardized list of questions. The group discussions  were documented by one or two analysts at each location. Group  discussions were conducted between August 2012 and October 2012."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Composition of the Discussion Groups", "paragraphs": ["We conducted 28 group discussions with EOD-qualified junior enlisted,  noncommissioned officer, warrant officer, and commissioned officer  personnel from the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. During  each discussion, we asked participants to complete a voluntary  questionnaire that provided us with supplemental information about each  person\u2019s EOD background, including:", "Rank;", "EOD qualification level (Basic, Senior, or Master Badge level);", "Number of deployments to Iraq or Afghanistan;", "Support provided to or received from another military service; and", "Support to the Very Important Persons Protection Support Activity.", "This information provided by participants helped us to ensure that we  obtained a wide range of perspectives from qualified EOD personnel with  a variety of EOD-related experiences. In total, we met with 188 EOD  personnel. Table 1 below shows the composition of our various  discussion groups.", "We performed content analysis of our group discussion sessions in order  to identify the themes that emerged during the sessions and to  summarize participant statements regarding EOD experiences and  perceptions. Specifically, at the conclusion of all our group discussion  sessions, we reviewed responses from the discussion groups and created  a list of themes. We then reviewed the comments from each of the 28  group discussions and assigned comments to the appropriate themes.  One GAO analyst conducted this analysis and a different GAO analyst  checked the information for accuracy. Any discrepancies in the  assignment of the comments to themes were resolved through discussion  by the analysts. The information gathered during our group discussions  with EOD personnel represents the responses of only the EOD enlisted  and officer personnel present in our 28 group discussions and it is not  projectable to other EOD personnel.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2012 to April 2013 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Themes from the Group Discussions", "paragraphs": ["In group discussions, we asked EOD personnel for their perspectives on  what is working well and what needs improvement with regard to military  service-specific missions, joint combat operations, training, equipment,  and operational tempo. We analyzed participants\u2019 responses to identify  the most common themes, which are summarized below.", "EOD Organizational Alignment and Career Path: Some participants  from each military service raised concerns about where EOD is aligned  within their respective military service. Some also noted issues with  career paths for EOD-qualified officers. For example, Army, Marine  Corps, and Air Force personnel expressed concerns about EOD  alignment under the Ordnance Corps (Army) or Engineers (Marine Corps  and Air Force). They perceived these alignments as hampering EOD  forces\u2019 influence for resourcing and operations. Additionally, Army officers  reported that officer career paths are of concern because the EOD  specialty is a technical area that is not the same as others in their  organization. For example, the Army EOD officer career path is within the  Logistics Branch of the Army, and all EOD officers are expected to have  logistic skills; however, an Army officer noted that learning about  managing fuel farms has nothing to do with EOD. Conversely, Navy  participants viewed the officer career path as generally positive and noted  that enabling an officer to stay within EOD for his or her entire career was  beneficial to the EOD force.", "Training: Participants in the majority of the group discussions said they  felt positive about the training they received, and almost all of our group  discussion participants reported that they wanted more training or more  time for training. Some group discussion participants reported concerns  about not being able to train with the same types of equipment, such as  robots, as they would be using when deployed. Both Army and Marine  Corps personnel expressed the desire for more training in homemade  explosives and casualty care. Additionally, Army and Navy personnel  reported that they needed additional access to training ranges. Army  participants at Fort Campbell noted that access to training ranges is  difficult to provide because there are not enough training ranges for all  EOD companies to train at their installation. Likewise, Navy personnel in  the San Diego area noted that they have issues accessing training  ranges, particularly for exercises involving demolition.", "Frequency of deployments: Participants in our discussions expressed  mixed opinions regarding operational tempo. Some EOD personnel felt  that the high pace of deployments and other missions put stress on EOD  personnel and their families. For example, some personnel felt that EOD  team leaders are getting burned out because they are always away from  home. In addition, some personnel said that to cover missions clearing  training ranges they had to turn down annual leave or cancel doctors\u2019  appointments because of staffing shortages. Also, some personnel noted  that during their 12 months home between overseas deployments they  are often away from their families because of the need to attend training  or sometimes to travel in support of the Very Important Persons  Protection Support Activity. Some personnel liked a high operational  tempo and voiced concerns about having too much down time as  operational tempo slows.", "Support to Very Important Persons Protection Support Activity:  Participants in many of our group discussions noted that the time they  spent in support of the Very Important Persons Protection Support Activity  exacerbated their high operational tempo, and some raised the concern  that these missions are not an effective use of EOD skills. EOD personnel  reported that these missions had a negative effect on EOD personnel and  their families by taking them away from home too often. Further, they  noted that to support these missions they missed training for overseas  missions. Moreover, some participants said that the Very Important  Persons Protection Support Activity missions were not a good use of the  EOD skill set or did not use EOD to its full potential because EOD  personnel are asked only to identify potentially explosive hazards but are  not allowed to disarm anything that is found.", "Funding for Training EOD Units: Some participants in our group  discussions reported concerns about the adequacy of funding for EOD  training. For example, some Army EOD personnel said that they  sometimes had to buy materials needed for training aides, such as  electrical tape and electronic parts. Moreover, Army and Marine Corps  personnel reported that specialized training, such as post-blast analysis  or homemade explosive courses, is expensive, which limits the number of  people who can take the training. In particular, Marine Corps personnel  expressed concerns that money for training might be scaled back in the  future.", "Incentive and Special Duty Assignment Pays: Participants in our  discussion groups noted that incentive pay, special duty assignment pay,  and retention bonuses are important to EOD personnel, and that  availability of such pays is a factor in retaining EOD personnel, but that  availability of incentives varied across the military services. Some  participants from the Marine Corps raised issues regarding incentive pay,  special duty assignment pay, and retention bonuses. Marine Corps  personnel stated that, unlike the other military services, the Marine Corps  does not provide any additional pays or bonuses for EOD, and they felt  that not receiving these types of pay like the other services constituted an  issue of equity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Margaret G.
