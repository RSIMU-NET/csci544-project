GAO identified five areas of concern: (1) ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes; (2) inadequate oversight and accountability; (3) information technology challenges; (4) inadequate training for VA staff; and (5) unclear resource needs and allocation priorities. VA's efforts to address each of these areas have been impeded by leadership instability. However, since his July 2018 confirmation, Secretary Wilkie has demonstrated his commitment to address the department's high-risk designations. His actions to date have allowed the department to maintain its leadership commitment rating of partially met in GAO's 2019 High-Risk update. VA also partially met the action plan criteria. As of March 2019, it did not meet the other three criteria for removal from the High-Risk List (agency capacity, monitoring, and demonstrated progress). This is, in part, because GAO continues to have audit findings that illustrate that the five areas of concern have not been fully addressed. For example:", "In a series of reports from 2012 through 2018, GAO found VA's wait time data unreliable for primary and specialty care as well as for care in the community.

To date, GAO has identified challenges in the following areas: (1) outdated acquisition regulations and policies; (2) lack of an effective medical supplies procurement strategy; (3) inadequate acquisition training; (4) contracting officer workload challenges; (5) lack of reliable data systems; (6) limited contract oversight and incomplete contract documentation; and (7) leadership instability. For example, as of May 2019, VA does not have updated acquisition regulations and officials expect to have a full update by 2021; a process which has been in place since 2011.", "GAO designated improving and modernizing federal disability programs, including VA's program, as high risk in 2003. GAO identified two areas of concern related to VA: (1) managing disability claims workload and (2) updating disability benefit eligibility criteria. As a result of these concerns, veterans may not have their disability claims and appeals processed in a timely manner. GAO reported in March 2018 that VA is making a major effort to reform its appeals process by onboarding new staff and implementing new technology. However, its appeals planning process does not provide reasonable assurance that it will have the capacity to successfully implement the new process and manage risks. VA agreed with GAO's recommendation to better assess risks associated with appeals reform.", "VA leadership has committed to addressing GAO's high-risk concerns and has launched several transformational efforts. For example, VA is currently implementing the Veterans Health Administration Plan for Modernization, a framework that aims to modernize the department, as well as the VA MISSION Act of 2018. This Act requires VA to consolidate programs that allow veterans to receive care outside VA. If successful, these efforts could be transformative for VA.

In March 2019, the rating for this criterion  improved to partially met. Since our 2017 High-Risk Report, VA  conducted a root cause analysis of this area of concern. However,  VA\u2019s action plan lacks metrics for monitoring progress and does not  include all of VA\u2019s ongoing actions, such as efforts to assess current  and future regional demand for veterans\u2019 health care services.", "Monitoring: not met. Since VA\u2019s action plan lacks specific metrics and  mechanisms for assessing and reporting progress, it is not clear how  VA is monitoring its progress.", "Demonstrating progress: not met. Our work continues to indicate VA  is not yet able to show progress in this area. Since its 2015  designation, we have made 16 new recommendations in this area of  concern, 10 of which were made since our 2017 report. For example:  In May 2017, we reported identifying several limitations with VA\u2019s  clinical productivity metrics and statistical models for tracking  clinical efficiency; this limits VA\u2019s ability to assess whether  resources are being used effectively to serve veterans.  Specifically, we found that productivity metrics may not account  for all providers or clinical services, reflect the intensity of clinical  workload, and reflect providers\u2019 clinical staffing levels. Additionally,  we found that efficiency models may also be adversely affected by  inaccurate workload and staffing data. As a result, VA cannot  systematically identify best practices to address low productivity  and inefficiency as well as determine the factors VA medical  centers commonly identify as contributing to low productivity and  inefficiency.", "We made four recommendations to address these findings; three  of which VA implemented in the spring of 2018 by improving  productivity metrics and staffing and workload data. To implement  the remaining recommendation, VA should establish a process to  oversee medical centers\u2019 plans for addressing low clinical  productivity and inefficiency.", "In August 2018 we reported that VA medical centers face  challenges operating their Sterile Processing Services programs\u2014 notably, addressing workforce needs, such as lengthy hiring time  frames and limited pay and professional growth potential. VHA\u2019s  Sterile Processing Services workforce challenges pose a potential  risk to VA medical centers\u2019 ability to ensure access to sterilized  medical equipment. Until VHA examines these workforce needs,  VHA won\u2019t know whether or to what extent the reported  challenges adversely affect VA medical centers\u2019 ability to  effectively operate their Sterile Processing Services programs and  ensure access to safe care for veterans.", "We recommended that VA examine workforce needs and take  action based on this assessment, as appropriate.

VA\u2019s procurement  policies have historically been outdated, disjointed, and difficult for  contracting officers to use. In September 2016, we reported that (1) the  acquisition regulations contracting officers currently follow have not been  fully updated since 2008 and (2) VA had been working on completing a  comprehensive revision of its acquisition regulations since 2011.", "VA\u2019s delay in updating this fundamental source of policy has impeded the  ability of contracting officers to effectively carry out their duties. We  recommended in September 2016 that VA identify measures to expedite  the revision of its acquisition regulations and clarify what policies are  currently in effect. VA concurred with this priority recommendation and, as  of January 2019, had rescinded or re-issued updated policy memoranda  for all information letters, which VA previously used to provide guidance  that was temporary in nature.", "VA has also made some progress in updating its acquisition regulations,  but more work remains to be done over the next several years. As of April  2019, VA reports that 15 of the 41 parts in its acquisition regulations  update were published as final rules, 10 were issued as proposed rules  for public comment, and the remainder are at an earlier stage of the  rulemaking process. All parts are scheduled to be out for public comment  by March 2020, but the final rules are not expected to be published until  April 2021.", "Lack of an effective medical supplies procurement strategy. VA\u2019s  program for purchasing medical supplies has not been effectively  executed, nor is it in line with practices at leading hospitals. To support  more efficient purchasing of medical supplies for its 172 medical centers  that serve the needs of about 9 million veterans, VA launched the Medical  Surgical Prime Vendor-Next Generation (MSPV-NG) program in  December 2016. MSPV-NG was part of VA\u2019s overall effort to transform its  supply chain and achieve $150 million in cost avoidance.", "In November 2017, we reported that VA\u2019s approach to developing its  catalog of supplies was rushed and lacked key stakeholder involvement  and buy-in. It also relied on establishing non-competitive blanket  purchase agreements for the overwhelming majority of products, resulting  in low utilization by medical centers. VA had set a target that medical  centers would order 40 percent of their supplies from the MSPV-NG  catalog, but utilization rates were below this target with a nationwide  average utilization rate across medical centers of about 24 percent as of  May 2017. This low utilization adversely affected VA\u2019s ability to achieve  its cost avoidance goal.", "We recommended in November 2017 that VA develop, document, and  communicate to stakeholders an overarching strategy for the program.  VA concurred with this priority recommendation and is developing  strategies to address it. First, in February 2019, VA developed and  documented a new, overarching acquisition strategy for its Medical  Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) program, and has begun the process of  communicating it to key stakeholders, including clinical and logistics staff.  Further, VA is developing a separate strategy to involve clinicians in  developing requirements with plans to complete a pre-pilot of this strategy  by September 2019. In response to a congressional request to assess  these and other program changes, we recently began a review of VA\u2019s  MSPV program.", "Inadequate acquisition training. VA acquisition training, at times, has  not been comprehensive nor provided to staff that could benefit from it. A  2006 statute required, and a 2016 Supreme Court decision  (Kingdomware Technologies, Inc. v. United States) reaffirmed, that VA is  to give preference to veteran-owned small businesses when competitively  awarding contracts\u2014a program known as Veterans First. In September  2018, we reported that training on VA\u2019s Veterans First policy did not  address some of its more challenging aspects. For example, many of the  contracting officers we interviewed were uncertain about how to balance  the preference for veteran-owned small businesses with fair and  reasonable price determinations when lower prices might be found on the  open market.", "In addition, VA provided several installments of online training sessions  on the Veterans First policy to contracting officers but did not make them  mandatory. As a result, only 52 percent of VA contacting officers  completed the follow-up training by the spring of 2018. We recommended  in September 2018 that VA provide more targeted training to contracting  officers on how to implement the Veterans First policy, particularly in the  area of making fair and reasonable price determinations, and assess  whether this training should be designated as mandatory. VA concurred,  and in April 2019, VA\u2019s Chief Acquisition Officer (CAO) stated that VA is  taking steps to make this training mandatory. VA also reported that its  Acquisition Academy will provide Veterans First training to all contracting  staff on May 30, 2019.", "Contracting officer workload challenges. The majority of our reviews  since 2015 have highlighted workload as a contributing factor to the  challenges that contracting officers face. Most recently, in September  2018, we reported that about 54 percent of surveyed VA contracting  officers said their workload was not reasonable and found that workload  stresses have exacerbated the struggles that they face implementing the  department\u2019s Veterans First policy.", "In addition, in September 2016, we reported that VHA contracting officers  processed a large number of small dollar-value actions to support medical  center operations, many of which involve emergency procurements of  routine items to support immediate patient care. Contracting officers and  the department\u2019s Acting CAO told us that these frequent and urgent  small-dollar transactions reduce contracting officers\u2019 efficiency and ability  to take a strategic view of VHA\u2019s overarching procurement needs. We  reported in November 2017 that emergency procurements accounted for  approximately 20 percent\u2014$1.9 billion\u2014of VHA\u2019s overall contract actions  in fiscal year 2016. Figure 3 shows the percent of VHA contract actions  designated as emergencies in fiscal year 2016 by each network  contracting office.", "We recommended in November 2017 that VHA network contracting  offices work with medical centers to identify opportunities to more  strategically purchase goods and services frequently purchased on an  emergency basis. VA concurred with this recommendation and recently  offered to provide us with a demonstration of the supply chain dashboard  that VA uses to track items purchased on an emergency basis, which we  plan to attend by the end of May 2019. VA also agreed to conduct an  analysis of its purchase card spending to identify items that should be  purchased through its MSPV program. VA expects to complete this  analysis by July 2019. If implemented, this would allow for both greater  contracting officer efficiency and cost savings. For example, based on a  similar recommendation we made in 2012, VA began more systematically  employing strategic sourcing in FY 2013, and in subsequent fiscal years  reported about $10 billion in savings over a 5-year period.", "Lack of reliable data systems. The lack of accurate data has been a  long-standing problem at VA. In September 2016, we reported that VA  had not integrated its contract management and accounting systems,  resulting in duplicative efforts on the part of contracting officers and  increased risk of errors. We and VA\u2019s Inspector General each  recommended that VA perform data checks between the two systems. VA  concurred with this recommendation and some VA contracting  organizations have made efforts to address this risk. Further, VA reported  in March 2019, that it plans to adopt a new integrated financial and  contract management system, which it plans to install VA-wide over a 9- year period, with the final site receiving the system in 2027.", "Limited contract oversight and incomplete contract file  documentation. VA has had difficulty ensuring that its contracts are  properly monitored and documented. In September 2018, we reported  that, although VA obligated $3.9 billion to veteran-owned small  businesses in fiscal year 2017, its contracting officers were not effectively  monitoring compliance with key aspects of the department\u2019s Veterans  First policy, such as limits on subcontracting (which ensure that the goal  of the program\u2014to promote opportunities for veteran-owned  businesses\u2014is not undermined). In many cases, we found that clauses  requiring compliance were not included in the VA\u2019s contracts and orders  with veteran businesses because the contracting officers either forgot to  include them or were unaware of the requirement.", "The contracting officers we spoke with also said that they do not have  sufficient time or knowledge to conduct oversight. Through limited  reviews, VA has identified a number of violations that would warrant a  broader assessment of the fraud risks to the program. We recommended  in September 2018 that VA establish a mechanism to ensure that  mandatory subcontracting-related clauses be consistently incorporated  into set-aside contracts with veteran-owned businesses and that VA  conduct a fraud risk assessment for the Veterans First program. VA  concurred with these recommendations and is taking steps to implement  them. For example, VA reported in April 2019 that it had made  modifications to its electronic contract management system to ensure the  clauses would be included in set-aside contracts and anticipated  completing testing of the modifications in May 2019.", "We also reported in September 2016 that a number of VA contract files  we reviewed were missing key documents, increasing the risk that key  processes and regulations were not followed. We recommended that  VA focus its internal compliance reviews to ensure that required contract  documents are properly prepared and documented. VA concurred with  this recommendation. Since then, VA has made policy changes that  revised its processes for compliance reviews of contract documentation.  We are currently following up with VA to obtain the results of its  compliance reviews to determine if VA has fully implemented this  recommendation.", "Leadership instability. We have previously reported, most recently in  September 2018, that procurement leadership instability has made it  difficult for the VA to execute and monitor the implementation of key  acquisition programs and policies. For example, changes in senior  procurement leadership, including the CAO and VHA\u2019s Chief  Procurement and Logistics Officer, occurred during the implementation of  MSPV-NG and similar instability in leadership affected the MSPV-NG  program office itself. Overall, the MSPV-NG program office has had four  directors, two of whom served in an acting capacity, since its inception in  2014.", "To address this instability, we recommended in November 2017 that VA  appoint a non-career employee as the CAO and prioritize the hiring of the  MSPV-NG program office\u2019s director position on a permanent basis. VA  concurred with these recommendations and implemented them in 2018.  Stable leadership should help bring consistent and much needed  direction to the MSPV-NG program, but we recently identified other areas  within the VA where sustained leadership is also needed.

For example, VA  has not developed plans to fully address risks, such as veterans  choosing more resource-intensive options at higher rates than  expected.", "Action plan: partially met. VA continues to implement plans to reduce  the initial disability claims backlog. For appeals reform, VA submitted  its appeals plan in November 2017 and provided several progress  reports throughout 2018.

As of April 2019, VA has taken  actions to address our recommendations, although key steps remain.  For example, VA has not fully articulated detailed steps and time  frames for assessing the relative performance of the new and legacy  appeals processes. Without this assessment, VA cannot determine  the extent to which the new process will achieve final resolution of  veterans\u2019 appeals sooner than the legacy process.", "Monitoring: partially met.

The executive branch has undertaken numerous initiatives to better  manage the more than $90 billion that is annually invested in IT  across the government. However, our work shows that federal IT  investments, including those made by VA, too frequently fail or incur  cost overruns and schedule slippages while contributing little to  mission-related outcomes. Thus, in 2015, we added improving the  management of IT acquisitions and operations to the High-Risk List.  To address the portion of the high-risk area for which it is responsible,  VA should, among other things, implement our past recommendations  on improving IT workforce planning practices and establishing action  plans to modernize or replace obsolete IT investments.", "In August 2018, for example, we found that VA\u2019s policies did not fully  address the role of its CIO consistent with federal laws and guidance  in the areas of IT workforce, IT strategic plan, IT budgeting, and IT  investment management. Until VA fully addresses the role of the CIO  in all of its policies, it will be limited in addressing longstanding IT  management challenges.

VA concurred with this  recommendation, which remains open.", "Strategic human capital management. This area was added to our  High-Risk List in 2001 and continues to be at risk today because  mission-critical skills gaps both within federal agencies and across the  federal workforce are impeding the government from cost-effectively  serving the public and achieving results. As of December 2018, VA  reported an overall vacancy rate of 11 percent at VHA medical  facilities, including vacancies of over 24,000 medical and dental  positions and around 900 human resource positions. Also, with 32  percent of the VA workforce eligible to retire in the next 5 fiscal years,  VA must address these mission-critical skill gaps and vacancies that  we continue to identify in our work.", "In December 2016, for example, we found that VHA\u2019s limited human  resources capacity combined with weak internal control practices has  undermined VHA\u2019s human resources operations and its ability to  improve delivery of health care services to veterans. Further, VHA is  challenged by inefficiencies in its performance management  processes, including the lack of a performance appraisal IT system,  which prevents it from identifying trends and opportunities for  improvement. VHA can better support medical centers by establishing  clear lines of accountability for engagement efforts, collecting and  leveraging leading practices, and addressing barriers to improving  engagement. We made three recommendations to VA to improve its  performance management system. VA partially concurred with these  recommendations, which remain open.", "Managing federal real property. Since federal real property  management was placed on the High-Risk List in 2003, the federal  government has given high-level attention to this issue. However,  federal agencies, including VA, continue to face long-standing  challenges, including (1) effectively disposing of excess and  underutilized property, (2) relying too heavily on leasing, (3) collecting  reliable real property data for decision making, and (4) protecting  federal facilities.", "In January 2019, for example, we reported that VA has enhanced its  data collection on vacant properties, but the agency does not collect  information needed to track and monitor disposal projects at the  headquarters level. Without information on the status of disposal  projects, VA cannot readily track and monitor its progress and identify  areas where facilities\u2019 managers may need additional assistance. As a  result, we recommended that VA improve its procedures related to  disposal of excess and underutilized property to help local facility  managers plan, implement, and execute projects to dispose of those  properties. In addition, VA should collect key information on the status  of these disposal projects to help manage the process and identify  areas where management attention is needed.
