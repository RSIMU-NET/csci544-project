Change, improvement, and innovation based on highway  research have long been important to the highway system. While this  research is a shared responsibility among FHWA, state departments of  transportation, and private organizations, we focused on FHWA\u2019s  important leadership role as the primary federal agency involved in  highway research. Throughout the past decade, FHWA has received  hundreds of millions of dollars for its surface transportation research and  technology program, including nearly half of the Department of  Transportation\u2019s (DOT) approximate $1 billion budget for research,  development, and technology in fiscal year 2002. Given the important  expectations of highway research and the significant level of resources  dedicated to it, it is important for the Congress and the American people  to know that the agency is conducting research that is relevant and useful  to stakeholders and that is of high quality. In May 2002 we issued a report  on these issues and made recommendations to FHWA, which the agency  agreed with, aimed at improving its processes for setting research agendas  and evaluating its research efforts. As it considers reauthorizing FHWA\u2019s  research and technology program, Congress will be making decisions  about the structure of the program. Accordingly, my testimony today will  discuss (1) best practices for developing research agendas and evaluating  research outcomes for federal research programs; (2) the extent to which  FHWA\u2019s processes for developing research agendas align with the best  practices for similar federal research programs; and (3) the extent to  which FHWA\u2019s processes for evaluating research outcomes align with  these best practices.", "My statement is based in part on our May 2002 report, which focused  primarily on those activities funded by the surface transportation research  and technology deployment funding categories identified in the  Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. In developing that report,  we held discussions with FHWA officials and reviewed relevant program  documents, legislation, and publications on best practices in federal  research from the Transportation Research Board, the Committee on  Science, Engineering, and Public Policy and others. In preparing for this  hearing, we also updated FHWA\u2019s activities in response to our findings and  recommendations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["FHWA is the DOT agency responsible for federal highway programs\u2014 including distributing billions of dollars in federal highway funds to the  states\u2014and developing federal policy regarding the nation\u2019s highways. The  agency provides technical assistance to improve the quality of the  transportation network, conducts transportation research, and  disseminates research results throughout the country. FHWA\u2019s program  offices conduct these activities through its Research and Technology  Program, which includes \u201cresearch\u201d (conducting research activities),  \u201cdevelopment\u201d (developing practical applications or prototypes of  research findings), and \u201ctechnology\u201d (communicating research and  development knowledge and products to users). FHWA maintains a  highway research facility in McLean, Virginia. This facility, known as the  Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center, has over 24 indoor and  outdoor laboratories and support facilities. Approximately 300 federal  employees, on-site contract employees, and students are currently  engaged in transportation research at the center.", "FHWA\u2019s research and technology program is based on the research and  technology needs of each of its program offices such as the Offices of  Infrastructure, Safety, or Policy. Each of the program offices is responsible  for identifying research needs, formulating strategies to address  transportation problems, and setting goals for research and technology  activities that support the agency\u2019s strategic goals. (See Appendix I for  examples of research that these offices undertake.) One program office  that is located at FHWA\u2019s research facility provides support for  administering the overall program and conducts some of the research. The  agency\u2019s leadership team, consisting of the associate administrators of the  program offices and other FHWA offices, provides periodic oversight of  the overall program. In 2002 FHWA appointed the Director of its Office of  Research, Development, and Technology as the focal point for achieving  the agency\u2019s national performance objective of increasing the  effectiveness of all FHWA program offices, as well as its partners and  stakeholders, in determining research priorities and deploying  technologies and innovation.", "In addition to the research activities within FHWA, the agency  collaborates with other DOT agencies to conduct research and technology  activities. For example, FHWA works with DOT\u2019s Research and Special  Programs Administration to coordinate efforts to support key research  identified in the department\u2019s strategic plan. Other nonfederal research  and technology organizations also conduct research funded by FHWA  related to highways and bridges. Among these are state research and  technology programs that address technical questions associated with the  planning, design, construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance of  highways. In addition, the National Cooperative Highway Research  Program conducts research on acute problems related to highway  planning, design, construction, operation, and maintenance that are  common to most states. Private organizations, including companies that  design and construct highways and supply highway-related products,  national associations of industry components, and engineering  associations active in construction and highway transportation, also  conduct or sponsor individual programs.

According to the  Transportation Research Board\u2019s Research and Technology Coordinating  Committee, research has to be closely connected to its stakeholders to  help ensure relevance and program support, and stakeholders are more  likely to promote the use of research results if they are involved in the  research process from the start. The committee also identified merit  review of research proposals by independent technical experts based on  technical criteria as being necessary to help ensure the most effective use  of federal research funds. In 1999, we reported that other federal science  agencies\u2014such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National  Science Foundation\u2014used such reviews to varying degrees to assess the  merits of competitive and noncompetitive research proposals. In April  2002, the Office of Management and Budget issued investment criteria for  federal research and technology program budgets that urge these agencies  to put into place processes to assure the relevance, quality and  performance of their programs.

Nevertheless, the committee found that research programs,  no matter what their character and goals, can be evaluated meaningfully  on a regular basis and in accordance with the Government Performance  and Results Act. Similarly, in April 2002 the Office of Management and  Budget  issued investment criteria for federal research and technology  program budgets that require these programs to define appropriate  outcome measures and milestones that can be used to track progress  toward goals and assess whether funding should be enhanced or  redirected. In addition, program quality should be assessed periodically in  relation to these criteria through retrospective expert review. The  Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy also emphasized  that the evaluation methods must match the type of research and its  objectives, and it concluded that expert or peer review is a particularly  effective means to evaluate federally funded research.", "Peer review is a process that includes an independent assessment of the  technical and scientific merit or quality of research by peers with essential  subject area expertise and perspective equal to that of the researchers.  Peer review does not require that the final impact of the research be  known. In 1999, we reported that federal agencies, such as the Department  of Agriculture, the National Institutes of Health, and the Department of  Energy, use peer review to help them (1) determine whether to continue  or renew research projects, (2) evaluate the results of research prior to  publication of those results, and (3) evaluate the performance of programs  and scientists. In its 1999 report, the Committee on Science, Engineering,  and Public Policy also stated that expert review is widely used to evaluate:  (1) the quality of current research as compared with other work being  conducted in the field, (2) the relevance of research to the agency\u2019s goals  and mission, and (3) whether the research is at the \u201ccutting edge.\u201d"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "External Stakeholders\u2019 Involvement in Developing FHWA\u2019s Research Agendas Has Been Limited", "paragraphs": ["Although FHWA engages external stakeholders in elements of its research  and technology program, the agency currently does not follow the best  practice of engaging external stakeholders on a consistent and transparent  basis in setting its research agendas. The agency expects each program  office to determine how or whether to involve external stakeholders in the  agenda setting process. As we reported in May 2002, FHWA acknowledges  that its approach to preparing research agendas is inconsistent and that  the associate administrators of FHWA\u2019s program offices primarily use  input from the agency\u2019s program offices, resource centers, and division  offices. Although agency officials told us that resource center and division  office staff provide the associate administrators with input based on their  interactions with external stakeholders, to the extent that external  stakeholder input into developing research agendas occurs, it is usually ad  hoc and provided through technical committees and professional  societies. For example, the agency\u2019s agenda for environmental research  was developed with input from both internal sources (including DOT\u2019s and  FHWA\u2019s strategic plans and staff) and external sources (including the  Transportation Research Board\u2019s reports on environmental research needs  and clean air, environmental justice leaders, planners, civil rights  advocates, and legal experts).", "In our May 2002 report we recommended that FHWA develop a systematic  approach for obtaining input from external stakeholders in determining its  research and technology program\u2019s agendas. FHWA concurred with our  recommendation and has taken steps to develop such an approach. FHWA  formed a planning group consisting of internal stakeholders as well as  representatives from the Research and Special Programs Administration  and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation to determine how to  implement our recommendation. This planning group prepared a report  analyzing the approaches that four other federal agencies are taking to  involve external stakeholders in setting their research and technology  program agendas. Using the lessons learned from reviewing these other  agencies\u2019 activities, FHWA has drafted a Corporate Master Plan for  Research and Deployment of Technology & Innovation. Under the draft  plan, the agency would be required to establish specific steps for including  external stakeholders in the agenda setting process for all areas of  research throughout the agency\u2019s research and technology program by  fiscal year 2004. In drafting this plan, FHWA officials obtained input from  internal stakeholders as well as external stakeholders, including state  departments of transportation, academia, consultants, and members of the  Transportation Research Board. It appears that FHWA has committed to  taking the necessary steps to adopt the best practice of developing a  systematic process for involving external stakeholders in the agenda  setting process. The draft plan invites external stakeholders to assist  FHWA with such activities as providing focus and direction to the research  and technology program and setting the program\u2019s agendas and priorities.

According to agency officials, success stories are  examples of research results adopted or implemented by such  stakeholders as state departments of transportation. These officials told us  that success stories can document the financial returns on investment and  nonmonetary benefits of research and technology efforts.

Therefore, the committee recommended a variety of  actions, including a systematic evaluation of outcomes by panels of  external stakeholders and technical experts to help ensure the maximum  return on investment in research. Agency officials told us that increased  stakeholder involvement and peer review will require significant  additional expenditures for the program. However, a Transportation  Research Board official told us that the cost of obtaining expert assistance  could be relatively low because the time needed to provide input would be  minimal and could be provided by such inexpensive methods as electronic  mail.", "In our May 2002 report, we recommended that FHWA develop a systematic  process for evaluating significant ongoing and completed research that  incorporates peer review or other best practices in use at federal agencies  that conduct research. While FHWA has concurred that the agency must  measure the performance of its research and technology program, it has  not developed, defined or adopted a framework for measuring  performance. FHWA\u2019s report on efforts of other federal agencies that  conduct research, discussed above, analyzed the approaches that four  other federal agencies are taking to evaluate their research and technology  programs using these best practices. According to FHWA\u2019s assistant  director for Research, Technology, and Innovation Deployment, the  agency is using the results of this report to develop its own systematic  approach for evaluating its research and technology program. However,  this official noted that FHWA has been challenged to find the most useful  and effective ways to evaluate the performance and results of the agency\u2019s  research and technology program. According to FHWA\u2019s draft Corporate  Master Plan for Research and Deployment of Technology & Innovation,  FHWA is committed to developing a systematic method of evaluating its  research and technology program that includes the use of a merit review  panel. This panel would conduct evaluations and reviews in collaboration  with representatives from FHWA staff, technical experts, peers, special  interest groups, senior management, and contracting officers. According  to the draft plan, these merit reviews would be conducted on a periodic  basis for program-level and agency-level evaluations, while merit reviews  at the project level would depend on the project\u2019s size and complexity.
