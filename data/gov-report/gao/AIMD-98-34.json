The study found that management accountants are increasingly being asked to supplement their traditional accounting role with more financial analysis and management consulting. Specifically, the IMA study reported that accountant work activities most critical to company success now include not only traditional financial management skills\u2014those associated with accounting systems and financial reporting\u2014but also strategic planning, internal consulting, and short-term budgeting processes. The IMA study characterized this change as a  \u201c. . . shift from number cruncher and corporate cop to decision-support specialist.\u201d A recent study by a major public accounting firm also underscored the need for financial management personnel to have financial expertise, augmented by interpersonal and communication skills, an enterprise perspective, initiative, and overall organizational savvy.", "These evolving expectations for accountants parallel a similar movement in the auditing profession. As a result of technological innovations, coupled with complex business structures and other economic forces, auditors are being asked to provide a wide range of services that go beyond the traditional audit of historical financial statements, such as management consulting services.

The Congress has taken various steps to help ensure that federal agencies improve their financial management. One of the key pieces of legislation was the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. The CFO Act spelled out an ambitious agenda for financial management reform, including expectations for the (1) deployment of modern systems to replace existing antiquated, often manual, processes, (2) development of better performance and cost measures, and (3) design of results-oriented reports on the government\u2019s financial condition and operating performance by integrating budget, accounting, and program information. The Government Management Reform Act of 1994 expanded and made permanent the requirement in the CFO Act for audited financial statements to the 24 largest federal departments and agencies and mandated annual audited governmentwide financial statements.", "The CFO Act also established chief financial officers throughout government to provide needed leadership. One of the key responsibilities assigned to agency CFOs is overseeing the recruitment, selection, and training of personnel to carry out agency financial management functions. The development of highly qualified financial managers will be crucial to successfully implementing the CFO Act. We have reported many instances in which the federal government\u2019s ability to produce accurate financial data was undermined simply because personnel with financial management responsibilities did not follow rudimentary policies and procedures, such as accurate transaction processing and routine account reconciliations.", "Further, the requirements of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 call for federal managers to fundamentally shift their focus from a preoccupation with rigid adherence to prescribed processes to assessing the extent to which federal programs have achieved desired outcomes and results. Accordingly, agency financial personnel are increasingly being asked to draw on new sets of skills to produce cost and other performance-based financial data. Such data are essential if congressional and executive branch decisionmakers are to make well-informed decisions on the relative efficiency and effectiveness of federal programs.", "While these financial management improvement efforts may be new to many financial personnel in the federal government, similar requirements have been in place for personnel in the private sector and in state governments for many years. The disciplined process required to generate reliable, accurate financial data has been in place in the private sector for over 60 years following the 1929 stock market crash, and in state governments since the early 1980s.

The design of the questionnaire used in our study was based on a framework for measuring the quality of the federal workforce presented in a previous GAO report. That framework identified education, work experience, training, and professional certifications as quantifiable factors for assessing the qualifications of federal government personnel.", "In using this framework, we asked surveyed organizations for information on the education, work experience, and professional certifications of their key financial management personnel: chief financial officers, controllers, and managers and supervisors working in financial reporting, financial analysis, and accounting operations positions.
