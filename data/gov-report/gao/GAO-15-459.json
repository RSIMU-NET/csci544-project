DOD's most recent SATCOM usage report estimates that over 30 percent of commercial SATCOM is bought independently by DOD components, even though DOD found the average cost of commercial SATCOM bought through DISA is about 16 percent lower than independently bought commercial SATCOM. Fragmentation limits opportunities for DOD to bundle purchases, share services, and streamline its procurement of commercial SATCOM.", "DOD recently completed two studies aimed at identifying the appropriate future mix of military and commercial SATCOM and predicting future SATCOM needs, however, the reports are partially based on incomplete data.

Because these platforms consume large amounts of  bandwidth, support high-priority missions, and will only operate with  commercial band services, commercial SATCOM procurement was  further fragmented.", "Finally, the Congress made supplemental funds available to the  combatant commands and military services in an effort to offset the  cost of increased military operations, which resulted in those  commands and military services procuring commercial SATCOM on a  piecemeal basis.", "With few exceptions, DOD does not currently budget funds to acquire  commercial SATCOM.

While we recognize  DOD is often confronted with addressing immediate needs to ensure  mission effectiveness, particularly in times of conflict, utilizing a central  point of contact could better position DOD to not only meet mission needs  but to do so both effectively and efficiently. Supplemental funding allows  DOD components the flexibility to acquire commercial SATCOM at their  discretion, but it also impedes centralized, multi-year acquisitions, and  hinders DOD\u2019s ability to manage military and commercial SATCOM as a  whole. DOD\u2019s most recent commercial SATCOM usage report stated that  the costs of the known DOD contracts for fixed satellite services during  the reporting period totaled about $875 million.

The Strategy Report also presented  plans which, if implemented, may enable DOD to determine the optimal  mix of military and commercial SATCOM in the future. For example,  DOD\u2019s 5-year strategy calls for improving forecasting demand tools to  enable better predictions; monitoring the impact of diminishing  supplemental funding on commercial SATCOM leases; identifying stable  requirements; and refining or developing tools to compare predicted  versus actual SATCOM use.

After  the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, however, DOD\u2019s operations  supporting overseas contingency missions triggered a dramatic growth in  commercial SATCOM demand. As military demand for commercial  SATCOM grew, DOD decision makers struggled to define the appropriate  mix of military and commercial SATCOM based on capability and cost. In  its 2014 Strategy Report, DOD determined its best strategy is to  maximize the use of military satellites. DOD identified, however, three  conditions under which it would use commercial services: when military  satellite bandwidth is unavailable, when user demand exceeds military  satellite capability, or when end user ground terminals will only operate  with commercial satellites.", "DOD\u2019s determination to rely on military SATCOM as much as possible is  based on several factors, including a military versus commercial cost  comparison, protection and resiliency features of military satellites, and  guidance provided in Senate Report 133-44. DOD calculated the cost of  military SATCOM by including associated costs in addition to actual  satellites costs; for example, the military SATCOM cost included  acquisition and launch costs, in addition to those costs of military satellite  operations. DOD then compared this value to the average cost of leasing  commercial bandwidth, and determined that acquiring military bandwidth  is less expensive than leasing commercial services, concluding that it  would continue to use military SATCOM to the greatest extent possible.  DOD compared the average Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) costs to  an average commercial lease value. We did not evaluate DOD\u2019s cost  analysis, but commercial SATCOM providers have been critical of  previous analyses because they believe the cost of commercial services  is overstated. For example, in 2013, executives from five leading  commercial satellite providers authored a white paper on the ways to  make DOD a better buyer of commercial SATCOM. According to this  paper, DOD leases commercial SATCOM using high cost, short-term  contracts, thereby overstating the costs of commercial services. The  paper further noted that if DOD procured commercial SATCOM using a  long-term baseline approach, the costs would be substantially lower. In  addition to the cost comparison results, DOD reported that commercial  SATCOM is not all designed for military use and some do not include the  same capabilities as military SATCOM, such as encryption and jamming  protection. DOD\u2019s plan to use military SATCOM to the greatest extent  possible is consistent with Senate Report 133-44 guidance that  alternative procurement arrangements, such as leasing commercial  services, should only be pursued when military or other government  satellites are unavailable or commercial SATCOM cost less."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Study Aimed at Identifying SATCOM Needs Was Partially Based on Incomplete Information", "paragraphs": ["In September 2014, DISA completed its Media Report, which was  intended to provide a representation of future SATCOM demand and  capacity in a planning scenario, but the data on which the SATCOM  demand predictions in that study were based were incomplete.

DOD currently  uses costly small scale, short duration commercial SATCOM leases. The  analysis of alternatives examined opportunities for DOD to save on  commercial SATCOM leases through longer-term contracts on existing  commercial satellites, capital lease or purchase of commercial high  capacity satellites, and procurement of additional military satellites. The  focus of the analysis was on life-cycle costs, comparing the current  leasing practice, or baseline, with these and other alternatives that could  result in savings to DOD. For example, according to DOD, the use of  longer duration, higher capacity operating leases could save about $1.5  billion compared to the current baseline. DISA also estimated that if DOD  used a capital lease or purchase of a single band satellite based on  commercially available technology, the department could avoid costs of  about $4.5 billion over 15 years compared to the current baseline. This  was the lowest cost alternative identified by the analysis.", "Lastly, DOD is planning to conduct an additional analysis of alternatives  to determine the replenishment strategy for its wideband military  SATCOM, the WGS satellite. The WGS analysis is not expected to begin  until fiscal year 2017, but DOD officials are optimistic that the resulting  investments could mitigate DOD\u2019s future reliance on commercial  SATCOM, and could also help the department maximize its military  SATCOM capability and usage.", "While DOD\u2019s recent actions represent good steps, two long-standing  challenges will make it difficult to make meaningful changes. First, DOD  still does not know what it spends annually on either military or  commercial SATCOM. Without this knowledge, DOD cannot effectively  manage and plan for its SATCOM procurement. The studies performed to  date are based on incomplete and older data. More importantly, even  when combined with the pathfinder initiatives focused on requirements  and utilization, the studies represent just a portion of what leading  companies typically analyze when seeking to make their procurements of  services more efficient. On a broad level, for instance, our body of work  on acquisitions has found that leading companies conduct spend  analyses of all their services procurements each year to review how much  their company has spent each year, what was bought, from whom it was  bought, and who was purchasing it. The analyses identify where  numerous suppliers are providing similar goods and services\u2014often at  varying prices\u2014and where purchasing costs can be reduced and  performance improved by better leveraging buying power and reducing  the number of suppliers. These analyses are subjected to an extensive  review for accuracy and consistency, and steps are taken to standardize  the data in the same format, which involves creation of uniform  purchasing codes. For specific categories of spending, companies assess  such factors as current and projected requirements, volume, cyclicality of  demand, risk, the services that the market is able to provide, supplier  base competition trends, the company\u2019s relative buying power, and  market price trends.", "Second, centralized management of service procurements is a leading  practice that DOD has already embraced. But it has not been able to  enforce it for a variety of reasons, notably increasing demand for  bandwidth to conduct military operations, resistance to using the  centralized process, and the fact that the military services have the  authority to fund their own procurements.  While DISA is responsible for  acquiring all commercial SATCOM services for DOD, it does not have  oversight or control over commercial SATCOM procured outside DISA.  Thus, at present, there is no single person or organization responsible for  balancing needs with wants and ensuring coordination among the many  organizations involved with the military and commercial SATCOM  acquisition process. Strategic Command officials stated they support a  centrally managed commercial SATCOM procurement approach;  however, the Strategic Command lacks the enforcement ability, funding,  and situational awareness to centrally manage.", "The leading organizations we have studied similarly encountered  resistance to centralizing procurements of services. But without  centralizing, companies ran the risk that different parts of the organization  could be unwittingly buying the same item or service. They relied on  clearly defined and communicated policies to ensure users did not  engage suppliers without procurement organization involvement as well  as tools that could enable cost data to be shared globally. Some  companies focused more on centralizing knowledge on procurements or  ensuring an approved contract was used than on creating a centralized  organization.", "If these hurdles can be overcome and the pathfinders prove successful,  adopting additional practices could better position DOD to optimize its  procurements. Our studies of leading organizations have found that in  addition to maintaining spend visibility and centralizing procurements,  companies found it was necessary to tailor buying tactics to specific  categories of services. They also regularly reviewed strategies and tactics  to adapt to market trends. In addition, they focused on total cost of  ownership\u2014making a holistic purchase decision by considering factors  other than price, for instance, risk to the company\u2019s mission, innovation,  operational performance, and demand management. For the long term,  the Defense Business Board also suggested establishing a governance  and usage plan for both military satellites and commercial satellites and  facilitating future governance by designating a single DOD point for  procuring all military and commercial SATCOM assets and services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s use of SATCOM is critical to military operations worldwide and its  dependency is expected to increase over the next decade. DOD\u2019s long- standing history of supplementing military communications with  commercial SATCOM has led to a fragmented and individualized  approach to contracting for commercial satellite services across the  military services and combatant commands. This approach is inefficient  and costly. Fragmentation has remained problematic since our earlier  reviews partly due to pressing demands and the availability of  supplemental funds. While DISA and the Air Force are taking steps to  transform the commercial SATCOM management and acquisition  process, these efforts will be hampered by the lack of complete spending  and usage data as well as resistance from DOD entities that prefer the  current acquisition process so they can individually control their own  SATCOM. Utilizing strategic sourcing best practices for DOD\u2019s use of  commercial and military satellite bandwidth, beginning with robust  analyses of spending and better enforcement of centralized management,  would increase chances of success for DOD\u2019s improvement efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to improve DOD\u2019s procurement of SATCOM, we are making the  following three recommendations.
