FSM and RMI eligibility for some other U.S. grants and programs is expected to continue after 2023.", "Disbursements from the compact trust funds face risks that the trust fund committees have not addressed. GAO found that the trust funds are increasingly likely to provide no annual disbursements in some years and to not sustain their value. Potential strategies such as reduced trust fund disbursements or additional contributions from the countries or other sources could help address these risks. Changing the trust fund disbursement policies could also address these risks but may require revising the trust fund agreements with each country. However, the trust fund committees have not prepared distribution policies, required by the agreements, which could assist the countries in planning for the 2023 transition to trust fund income. The committees also have not prepared the required fiscal procedures for oversight of the disbursements or addressed differences between the timing of their annual determination of the disbursement amounts and the FSM's and RMI's annual budget cycles.", "The FSM and RMI did not implement planned budget reductions to address decreasing compact grants owing to increased revenues from other sources that offset the grant decreases.

We used the unaudited fiscal year 2017 year-end balances of the  compact trust funds as the starting point for our projections. To  assess the reliability of the unaudited balances, we reviewed the  previous years\u2019 audits and discussed with the trust funds\u2019  administrator whether these audits had resulted in any significant  change between the preliminary unaudited balances and the final  audited balances. The March 2018 audited fund balances, released  after we completed our analysis, were within $5 of the unaudited fund  balances. We concluded that the unaudited balances were sufficiently  reliable as a basis for our projections of future trust fund performance.  To assess our net rate of return assumptions, we reviewed the trust  fund money managers\u2019 capital market assumptions and projections  and tested varying rates of return and return distributions.", "To consider the effects of alternative trust fund strategies, we again  performed the Monte Carlo analysis to determine the likely effects,  relative to the baseline, of five potential strategies that used one of  three approaches: (1) reducing annual compact trust fund  disbursements, (2) making additional contributions, and (3) changing  the disbursement policies, including strategies that would require  changes to the trust fund agreements.

The FSM also noted that we had reported the potential  for the FSM compact trust fund to not provide disbursements sufficient  to cover the estimated value of expiring federal services in 2002, prior  to the signing of the amended compact.

The  RMI asserted that, absent accountability issues, the maximum annual  disbursement amount should be disbursed from the compact trust  fund. However, as our report notes, the compact trust fund  agreements state the maximum allowable disbursement level and do  not establish or guarantee a minimum disbursement level. The RMI  also stated that it would prefer that future accountability procedures  be based on a new agreement rather than a reshaping of the current  fiscal procedures agreement. In addition, the RMI raised the issue of  compensation under the tax and trade provision of the original  compact as well as the effect of delays in investing the RMI compact  trust fund on its current value. We discuss the tax and trade  provisions in Appendix VII of our report. The RMI also recommended  that amendments to the trust fund agreement should not require  action by the U.S. Congress. As our report notes, the U.S. legislation  implementing the amended compacts requires that any amendment,  change, or termination of all or any part of the compact trust fund  agreements shall not enter into force until incorporated into an act of  Congress. Finally, the RMI noted that programs and services provided  through the amended compacts' implementing legislation (Pub. L.

For the programs and services agreement with each country, we  reviewed the status of programs and services when the agreements end  in fiscal year 2024. Our legal analysis included programs, services, and  grants that we identified from the compacts, the amended compacts\u2019  implementing legislation, the military use and operating rights  agreements, and the programs and services agreements.

We  identified previous studies through a literature search and by interviewing  cognizant agency and trust fund officials.

These five strategies are  examples of many possible strategies, including varying amounts of  disbursement reductions, additional contributions, and methods of  calculating annual disbursements. We are not recommending any specific  strategy. To provide additional information about potential outcomes, we  also analyzed another four strategies that assumed a lower amount of  additional trust fund contributions, lower disbursement reductions, or a  lower percentage of the compact trust fund balance that could be  withdrawn (see app. VII). To help ensure that we had appropriately  reproduced the methods used in previous studies, we shared our  preliminary results for strategy 4, which modeled the Moving Adjustment  Rule, and strategy 5, which modeled the Sustainability Adjustment for  Enhanced Reliability (SAFER), with the Graduate School USA  representatives who had initially prepared these potential strategies. We  analyzed each strategy separately to isolate the impact of individual  changes in the strategy on compact trust fund balance and  disbursements. However, in practice, these individual changes could  occur in combination with each other. We again performed the Monte  Carlo analysis, using the same key assumptions as in the baseline  scenario, to determine the likely effects, relative to the baseline, of five  potential strategies representing three approaches: (1) reducing annual  compact trust fund disbursements; (2) making additional contributions; (3)  and changing the disbursement policies, including strategies that would  require changing the trust fund agreements to permit disbursements from  the A account.
