The Convention\u2019s ultimate objective is to stabilize the concentrations of human-induced greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous interference with the climate system.", "To accomplish this objective, the Convention directs the Annex I parties to adopt policies and measures to limit greenhouse gases and to protect and enhance the greenhouse gas sinks and reservoirs that absorb and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The Convention also directs the Annex I parties to submit plans to the Conference of the Parties with detailed information on the policies and measures that will help return net greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000.

This determination was formally designated by the Conference of the Parties as the Berlin Mandate. To address the inadequacies, the parties agreed to begin a process to define actions in the post-2000 period, including strengthening the commitments of the parties included in Annex I by elaborating policies and measures, as well as by setting quantified objectives for limiting and reducing emissions. The Department of State\u2019s Under Secretary for Global Affairs recently announced to the Conference of the Parties that the United States supports the adoption of binding emissions targets beyond 2000. The process of determining actions beyond 2000, designed to include in its early stages an analysis and assessment phase, is scheduled for completion before the third Conference of the Parties, currently set for late 1997.", "Carbon dioxide is considered the major contributor to global warming. Developed countries\u2014as identified by their membership in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\u2014accounted for about half of the world\u2019s energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in 1990. The United States was responsible for about 22 percent of the total carbon dioxide emissions. Developing countries are projected to account for an increasing share of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions in the future as a result of their increasing growth in energy demand. For example, the Energy Information Administration estimates that China\u2019s share of carbon dioxide emissions will almost double from about 10 percent in 1990 to about 19 percent in 2015. Therefore, even if the developed countries are able to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions, worldwide emissions are likely to increase because of the expected large growth in developing countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Countries\u2019 Progress Toward Meeting the Convention\u2019s Goal Cannot Be Fully Assessed", "paragraphs": ["The incomplete, unreliable, and inconsistent data on emissions prevent a complete assessment of Annex I countries\u2019 efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000.

These countries accounted for 60 percent of the estimated global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion in 1990. All 29 countries reported 1990 data on carbon dioxide, and 28 of the 29 reported similar data on methane and nitrous oxide. However, eight countries did not provide projections to 2000 for at least one of those gases. For example, Spain did not include projections of either methane or nitrous oxide in its plan. Additionally, only eight countries provided projections of the other greenhouse gases also covered under the Convention, such as hydrofluorocarbons. While emissions for such gases are now small, they are projected to increase in the future.", "Also, some reported data lack precision. Specifically, although countries provided emissions data for methane and nitrous oxide, the level of certainty in such data is low. For example, the uncertainty range for reported methane emissions in Canada\u2019s national plan is plus or minus 30 percent at a 90-percent confidence level; the range is plus or minus 40 percent for nitrous oxide at an 85-percent confidence level. In contrast, the uncertainty level for Canada\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions was only plus or minus 4 percent at a 95-percent confidence level. Reliability in measuring the emissions data for methane and nitrous oxide is not as high as for carbon dioxide. Because these gases come from many sources and are nontoxic, little effort has been given to measuring their emissions.", "Additionally, the countries\u2019 emissions data were not always consistent. For example, some Annex I countries adjusted their 1990 inventory levels in order to develop what they believed to be a more reasonable starting point for projections to 2000. As a result, a different picture emerges of a country\u2019s ability to meet the goal, depending on whether the projections are compared to actual or adjusted 1990 levels. To illustrate, Denmark adjusted its 1990 inventory level upward to show what emissions would have been if imported hydroelectric power had been generated domestically with fossil fuels. Consequently, Denmark\u2019s carbon dioxide projections exceed the actual 1990 levels; but when the adjusted level for 1990 is used, the projections for 2000 are below the 1990 level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Problems With Greenhouse Gas Data Have Two Major Causes", "paragraphs": ["Two major factors contributed to problems in the Annex I countries\u2019 reporting of emissions data. First, the parties to the Convention did not formally adopt reporting guidelines until April 1995\u2014after most countries had submitted their national plans\u2014and the guidelines adopted in 1995 were not specific in all cases. For example, the guidelines did not specify whether emissions\u2019 projections were to be reported on the basis of gross emissions or net emissions, which account for the carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere by forests and other greenhouse gas sinks. Only 13 of 29 Annex I countries separately reported projections of carbon dioxide sinks.", "The parties to the Convention have recognized shortcomings in the guidance. In its comments on a draft of this report, the Department of State noted that the parties had adopted revised reporting guidelines at their Second Conference in July 1996. These revised guidelines will be used for the second round of national plans due to be submitted in April 1997. The Department of State has stated that these national plans will be significantly improved because of the revised guidelines. Furthermore, it expects that the Conference of the Parties will continue to revise and improve the guidelines.", "The other major factor contributing to problems with the data on greenhouse gas emissions is that, as previously noted, the countries have not yet been able to quantify with certainty the emissions of methane and nitrous oxide because of the limited reporting data."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Economic Factors Make Most Annex I Countries Unlikely to Meet the Convention\u2019s Goal", "paragraphs": ["Although the currently available emissions data prevent a complete assessment of countries\u2019 progress in meeting the Convention\u2019s goal, projections by energy forecasting agencies of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use\u2014which is the largest single category of greenhouse gas emissions\u2014indicate that few Annex I countries will likely be able to return emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. Of the major developed countries, only Germany and the United Kingdom appear likely to reduce carbon emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Other major developed countries\u2014including Canada, Italy, Japan, and the United States\u2014will probably not reach the goal. A few other Annex I countries in eastern Europe, such as the Czech Republic, may be able to meet the Convention\u2019s goal.", "The projections by the Annex I countries themselves indicate that only 7 of the 24 countries that provided point estimates of carbon dioxide emissions in 2000 project that they can hold emissions near or below 1990 levels. (See table 1.) For the remaining countries, the increases over the 1990 inventory levels ranged from 1.7 percent to 28.8 percent.", "The projections from other organizations also indicate that few countries will be able to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions. For example, the Energy Information Administration\u2019s May 1996 International Energy Outlook forecasts that carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption will increase for most of the Annex I countries from 1990 to 2000. Specifically, the agency projects that carbon dioxide emissions will increase 11 percent in the United States, 21 percent in Japan, 18 percent in Canada, and 6 percent in OECD Europe. The International Energy Agency (IEA) also projects increases in carbon dioxide emissions between 1990 and 2000 for Annex I countries. In its 1994 Review of Energy Policies of IEA Countries, published in July 1995, this agency forecasts increases in energy-related carbon dioxide of 10 percent for the United States, 13 percent for Canada, and 8 percent for Europe."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Factors Affecting Energy Use Also Affect Progress Toward the Goal", "paragraphs": ["On the basis of our review of six developed countries\u2014Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States\u2014we found that energy use is the major factor affecting the ability of those countries to meet the goal of returning greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. Therefore, the major factors that affect trends in energy use\u2014such as growth in gross domestic product (GDP), population growth, energy prices, and energy efficiency\u2014also affect trends in greenhouse gas emissions. The ability to shift from coal, the burning of which produces a high level of greenhouse gases, to other fuels is also a major factor.

The plan includes 44 largely voluntary initiatives designed to return net emissions of the major greenhouse gases\u2014carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxides, and hydrofluorocarbons\u2014to 1990 levels by 2000. The CCAP aimed to cut the net projected growth of 7 percent in the major greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 2000 and to achieve stabilization at the 1990 level of 1,462 million metric tons of carbon equivalent (MMTCE). Without the plan\u2019s initiatives, emissions were projected to grow to 1,568 MMTCE. The CCAP laid the foundation for the U.S. national plan submitted to the Convention in September 1994.", "The United States estimates that it will fall short of its target. Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States have been hampered by changes in forecasts of key economic variables, such as higher-than-projected economic growth and lower-than-expected energy prices, that differ from the assumptions made in the CCAP. The changes in these economic indicators tend to increase energy use and therefore also increase greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the world oil price per barrel in 2000 was estimated to be $24.04 (1994 dollars) in the CCAP, but the Energy Information Administration\u2019s 1996 Annual Energy Outlook\u2014which contains the executive branch\u2019s latest forecasts\u2014now estimates that the price will be $19.27 per barrel (1994 dollars). Also, annual population growth is now projected to be higher than expected when the CCAP was formulated\u2014about 1.0 percent per year as compared with the 0.7 percent projected in 1993. Population growth tends to increase energy use and consequently greenhouse gas emissions. (App. III compares in more detail the changes in key economic factors and fuel prices affecting the U.S. efforts.)", "Officials at the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency\u2014which are responsible for implementing the bulk of the CCAP actions\u2014noted that the reductions in the funding for the plan also have a substantial negative effect on the United States\u2019 ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2000 by limiting the agencies\u2019 ability to implement voluntary initiatives in the plan. For example, in fiscal year 1996, only about one-half of the requested funds were appropriated. Table 3 provides annual budget requests and appropriations for fiscal years 1995 through 1997. Lower estimated prices will, in general, also make the implementation of voluntary initiatives less likely. According to an official with the Council on Environmental Quality, legislation has also precluded the implementation of the few nonvoluntary actions in the plan, such as requiring that tires be labeled for fuel economy.", "The Council on Environmental Quality, the Department of Energy, the Department of State, and the Environmental Protection Agency are currently revising the CCAP.

Factors such as low population density, large distances between urban areas, and a cold climate create unique circumstances that make Canada a highly energy-intensive country. A recent estimate indicates that Canada will likely miss the Convention goal by a significant amount\u2014carbon dioxide emissions are estimated to increase by 18 percent by the Energy Information Administration.

Japan\u2019s Action Report on Climate Change, issued in 1994, estimated that total carbon dioxide emissions in 2000 would exceed their 1990 levels. Current projections by the Energy Information Administration indicate that carbon dioxide emissions in Japan may increase by 21 percent. Over the last 20 years, Japan has consistently consumed one of the lowest percentages of energy per dollar of economic output for developed countries because of energy efficiency programs and initiatives. Therefore, achieving additional greenhouse gas reductions is difficult. As a result, even low levels of growth in the economy and population increase energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, Japan had planned to build several additional nuclear power plants that would emit fewer greenhouse gases than the coal-powered facilities they would replace. However, the country has encountered difficulties in siting and building those plants.", "Italy also is low in energy-intensity as compared to other major developed countries. According to a State Department official, Italy is more energy efficient than other developed countries because of high energy prices and regulations limiting energy use. Therefore, additional energy savings and greenhouse gas reductions may be difficult to achieve, although Italy is forecast to experience a relatively low rate of economic growth. Italy\u2019s national plan discusses additional measures to further reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but their impact may be minimal.

The depressed economic conditions in East Germany, including low productivity levels and high unemployment, and the shift from inefficient coal technology to natural gas are helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly. For instance, carbon dioxide emissions in the former East Germany have already decreased by about 43 percent from 1990 to 1994. In contrast, during the same period, carbon dioxide emissions increased about 3 percent in what was formerly West Germany. In its national plan, Germany has also sought to achieve the Convention\u2019s goal by implementing a broad range of voluntary and regulatory measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.", "Progress in the United Kingdom is largely attributable to the privatization of its energy utilities over the last decade, which is bringing about a significant switch from coal to natural gas, the fossil fuel that produces the lowest level of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of energy consumed. To illustrate, the Energy Information Administration has estimated that natural gas as a percentage of total energy consumption will increase in the United Kingdom from 23 percent in 1990 to 35 percent in 2000. The United Kingdom has also increased its taxes on energy use, which it believes will also help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

We have revised our report to reflect the recent adoption of revised reporting guidelines for national plans to be submitted in conjunction with the Convention\u2019s current goal and the potential improvement they provide. 2. We continue to believe that a significant portion of the emissions data from national plans submitted thus far are incomplete, unreliable, or inconsistent. Therefore, as noted in the report, these data limit an assessment of countries\u2019 progress against the Convention\u2019s goal. We agree that estimates provided by other groups, such as the International Energy Agency, also provide some basis for determining progress, especially given that many Annex I countries will probably not come close to reaching the Convention\u2019s current goal. However, these other estimates are limited to carbon dioxide. Additionally, it is unclear how emissions data from these other groups will be considered by the Conference of the Parties in assessing progress against the current goal or any future binding targets. 3. We revised our report to note the formulation and adoption of improved guidelines from the Conference of the Parties in July 1996. We also noted that the original guidelines were adopted in April 1995, after the submission of many of the national plans. 4. We do not state in our report that progress will be assessed solely on the basis of the national plans but rather that the ability to assess countries\u2019 progress depends greatly on complete, reliable, and consistent data. We believe national plans will be a key component of that assessment and therefore improving the data in the plans is important. Additionally, as noted in comment 2, estimates from other groups apply only to carbon dioxide, and it is unclear how such estimates would be factored into assessing progress by the Conference of the Parties. 5. We revised our recommendation to note that reporting guidance could help enhance the completeness, reliability, and consistency of the reported emissions data rather than solve all the data problems. Also, despite broad agreement on methodologies for calculation of historical emissions, high levels of uncertainty still exist on reported emissions data other than carbon dioxide."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Council on Environmental Quality", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Council on Environmental Quality\u2019s letter dated July 31, 1996."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. The Council on Environmental Quality notes that it is not surprising that differences exist in details reported by the countries, particularly for gases that constitute only a small fraction of greenhouse gases.

Additionally, emissions of greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide\u2014for which reported emissions data were incomplete in some cases and for which the reliability of the data was uncertain\u2014constitute a significant enough portion of estimated total greenhouse gases to influence whether or not countries can meet the Convention\u2019s current goal or future binding targets.
