The Climate Leaders Program, managed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), focuses on firms. The Climate VISION (Voluntary Innovative Sector Initiatives: Opportunities Now) Program, managed by the Department of Energy (DOE) along with other agencies, focuses on trade groups. GAO examined (1) participants' progress in completing program steps, the agencies' procedures for tracking progress, and their policies for dealing with participants that are not progressing as expected; (2) the types of emissions reduction goals established by participants; and (3) the agencies' estimates of the share of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions that their programs account for and their estimates of the programs' impacts on U.S. emissions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["EPA expects Climate Leaders firms to complete several program steps within general time frames, but firms' progress on completing those steps is mixed. For example, EPA asks firms to set an emissions reduction goal, generally within 2 years of joining. As of November 2005, 38 of the program's 74 participating firms had set a goal. Of the 36 firms that had not set a goal, 13 joined in 2002 and thus took longer than expected to set a goal. EPA is developing a system for tracking firms' progress in completing these steps, but it has no written policy on what to do about firms that are not progressing as expected. Trade groups generally established an emissions reduction goal before joining Climate VISION, and DOE generally expects them to develop a plan for measuring and reporting emissions within about 1 year of joining. As of November 2005, 11 of the 15 participating groups had such a plan, but 2 of the groups without a plan joined in 2003, the program's first year. DOE has no means of tracking trade groups' progress in completing the steps in their plans and no written policy on what to do about groups that are not progressing as expected. A tracking system would enable the agency to ascertain whether participants are meeting program expectations in a timely manner, thereby helping the program to achieve its goals. By establishing a written policy on the consequences of not progressing as expected, both agencies could better ensure that participants are actively engaged in the programs, thus helping to achieve the programs' goals. The types of emissions reduction goals established by Climate Leaders firms and Climate VISION groups vary in how reductions are measured and the time periods covered, among other things. For example, one Climate Leaders firm's goal is to reduce its domestic emissions by 5 percent over 10 years; another's is to reduce its worldwide emissions per dollar of revenue by 35 percent over 7 years. Similarly, one Climate VISION group's goal is to reduce emissions of one greenhouse gas by 10 percent, while another's is to reduce its emissions per unit of output by 12 percent. GAO noted that some Climate VISION groups said meeting their goals may be linked to reciprocal federal actions, such as tax incentives or regulatory relief. EPA officials estimated that the first 50 firms to join Climate Leaders account for at least 8 percent of U.S. greenhouse emissions. DOE estimated that Climate VISION participants account for at least 40 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. EPA and DOE are working through an interagency process to quantify the emissions reductions attributable to their programs; the process is expected to be completed in 2006. However, determining the reductions attributable to each program will be challenging because of the overlap between these programs and other voluntary programs, as well as other factors."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For over a century, scientists have known that concentrations of carbon  dioxide and other greenhouse gases can alter the atmosphere in ways that  affect the earth\u2019s climate. Humans continue to release large quantities of  carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere through,  among other things, the combustion of fossil fuels, industrial and  agriculture processes, landfills, and some land use changes. In 1992, the  United States ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on  Climate Change, which has as its objective the stabilization of greenhouse  gas concentrations in the earth\u2019s atmosphere but does not impose specific  goals or timetables for limiting emissions. In response, federal agencies  developed a plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through  voluntary efforts by companies, state and local governments, and other  organizations. Since that time, federal agencies have sponsored voluntary  programs that encourage private and public sector entities to curb their  greenhouse gas emissions by providing technical assistance, education,  research, and information sharing. The administration has promoted such  voluntary programs, along with other measures, as an alternative to  mandatory emissions reductions.", "In February 2002, the President announced a Global Climate Change  Initiative to reduce the rate of increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the  United States. Specifically, he established the goal of reducing the  emissions intensity of the United States by 18 percent between 2002 and  2012. Emissions intensity is a ratio calculated by dividing emissions in a  given year by economic output for that year. In support of this goal, the  President announced two new voluntary programs aimed at securing  private sector agreements to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gas emissions  or emissions intensity.", "Climate Leaders, an Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA)-sponsored government-industry partnership established in  February 2002, works with firms to develop long-term climate change  strategies.

Most industries participating in the  program are represented by a single trade group. As of November 2005,  14 industry sectors and the Business Roundtable\u2014an association of  chief executive officers representing diverse sectors of the  economy\u2014were participating in the program. According to DOE, the  trade groups participating in Climate VISION typically have high energy  requirements.", "This report examines the progress EPA and DOE have made in  implementing their respective programs. Specifically, for each program,  this report discusses (1) the key steps that the agencies expect participants  to complete (such as preparing a plan for measuring emissions and  reporting data), the progress participants have made in completing these  steps, the agencies\u2019 efforts to track participants\u2019 progress, and the agencies\u2019  strategies for dealing with participants not progressing as expected; (2) the  types of emissions or emissions intensity reduction goals being established  by participants in this program; and (3) the agencies\u2019 estimates of the  programs\u2019 current coverage (that is, the share of U.S. emissions that  participants contribute to total U.S. emissions) and impact (in terms of  emissions reduced). In addition, as you requested, a list of other federal  voluntary climate change programs is presented in appendix I.", "In conducting our work, we reviewed and analyzed EPA and DOE  documents on the Climate Leaders and Climate VISION programs, as well  as other voluntary climate programs and met with these agencies\u2019 officials.  For the sake of brevity, we refer to all participants in the Climate Leaders  programs as firms, even though one of them, the National Renewable  Energy Laboratory, is a federal research laboratory. Similarly, we refer to  all Climate VISION participants as trade groups, even though one  participant, the Tennessee Valley Authority, is a utility. For the sake of  consistency, we describe both Climate Leaders and Climate VISION  participants\u2019 emissions or emissions intensity targets as goals, even though  DOE describes Climate VISION participants\u2019 targets as commitments. Most  of the information in the report, except where otherwise noted, reflects the  status of the two programs as of November 2005. As of March 2006, an  additional 10 firms had joined Climate Leaders. To assess the reliability of  the EPA, DOE, and other data, we spoke with agency officials about data  quality control procedures and reviewed relevant documentation. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. We conducted our work between June 2004 and March 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards,  including an assessment of data reliability. Additional details on our scope  and methodology are presented in appendix II."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Carbon dioxide is by far the most prevalent greenhouse gas emitted in the  United States, as shown in table 1. The other principal greenhouse gases, in  order of percentage of emissions in 2003, are methane, nitrous oxide, and  three types of synthetic gases\u2014hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),  perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF).", "In response to the May 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on  Climate Change, the United States developed the Climate Change Action  Plan aimed at reducing domestic greenhouse gas emissions. As a part of  this plan, programs were developed during the 1990s to provide  information and tools to encourage participants to voluntarily undertake  changes to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other  greenhouse gases. The intent of programs such as Energy STAR is to help  organizations improve energy efficiency, thereby helping to reduce  emissions. Other programs, such as the Coalbed Methane Outreach  Program, encourage emissions reductions in other greenhouse gases, such  as methane.", "The amount of energy used to generate each dollar of national output has  declined over time. The ratio of energy used to economic output is called  energy intensity. According to the Energy Information Administration  (EIA), the independent statistical and analytical agency within DOE, energy  intensity declined between 1990 and 2003, at an average rate of 1.8 percent per year. The rate of decline was the result of, among other things, energy  efficiency improvements in industrial and transportation equipment and in  commercial and residential lighting, heating, and refrigeration  technologies. In early 2006, EIA projected that energy intensity will decline  at an average annual rate of 1.8 percent between 2005 and 2025.", "The U.S. economy has also become more efficient in terms of emissions  intensity. (According to EIA, energy and emissions intensity are closely  related because energy-related carbon dioxide emissions make up more  than 80 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.) U.S. emissions  intensity declined between 1990 and 2003 at a rate of 1.9 percent a year. The  reasons for the decline include general improvements in energy efficiency  and a long-term shift toward a service economy. Other reasons include  greater use of nuclear power, development of renewable resources,  substitution of less emissions-intensive natural gas for coal and oil, and the  use of transportation fuels with biogenic components, such as ethanol. EIA  projected in early 2006 that between 2005 and 2025, emissions intensity will  decline at a rate of 1.7 percent per year (see fig. 1).", "The goal of the President\u2019s 2002 initiative was to reduce the emissions  intensity of the U.S. economy by 18 percent between 2002 and 2012, a  reduction 4 percentage points greater than would be expected absent any  new policy. In particular, according to EIA projections cited by the  administration, without the initiative, emissions would increase from 1,917  million metric tons of carbon equivalent (MMTCE) in 2002 to 2,279  MMTCE in 2012. Under the initiative, emissions will increase to 2,173 MMTCE in 2012, which is 106 MMTCE less than otherwise expected. In  2002, EIA projected that U.S. emissions intensity would decline (improve)  by 14 percent between 2002 and 2012 without any new policy. In 2006, EIA  updated its estimate, projecting a decline in emissions intensity of 17  percent between 2002 and 2012. According to EIA, further reductions in  emissions intensity are projected to result from, among other things,  increasing energy prices that will tend to reduce energy consumption  growth below prior estimates. Nevertheless, according to this estimate,  total greenhouse gas emissions will continue to rise. Specifically, EIA  projected in 2006 that total emissions would increase by 14.2 percent  between 2002 and 2012.", "The President\u2019s 2002 initiative comprised about 30 elements. In addition to  challenging businesses and industry to voluntarily reduce emissions, it  included tax incentives for renewable energy and conservation,  transportation programs, and other efforts. Climate Leaders and Climate  VISION are two of the federal government\u2019s newest voluntary climate  programs. According to a DOE official, they are the only federal programs  that ask potential members for an emissions or emissions intensity  reduction goal in order to participate. According to EPA, for firms that are  already participating in other EPA voluntary programs, Climate Leaders  can serve as a coordinating umbrella to comprehensively manage their  voluntary climate change activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Climate Leaders and Climate VISION Participants Have Not Completed Program Steps as Soon as Expected, and Both Agencies Lack a Written Policy for Dealing with Such Participants", "paragraphs": ["According to EPA officials, all program participants agree to complete four  program steps, and EPA guidelines suggest that these steps generally be  completed within about 1 year, although the goal negotiation process can  take as long as 2 years. The first step is to prepare a greenhouse gas  emissions inventory; the second step is to prepare an inventory  management plan (IMP); the third step is to enter into negotiations with  EPA regarding a goal; and the fourth step is to report annually. (However,  EPA does not insist that firms perform all four steps in that order). Overall,  we found that some firms were taking longer to complete these steps and  that EPA has no written policy for dealing with such firms. According to  DOE officials, all program participants agree to complete two program  steps: the first within about 1 year of joining the program, and the second  after they have finished training their members in the use of reporting  protocols, most in 2006. Overall, we found that some groups had not  completed the first step within the specified time frame. EPA has started to  develop a system for tracking participants\u2019 progress; DOE does not yet  have such a system. Neither agency has written criteria detailing expected  time frames for meeting expectations or the consequences of not meeting  expectations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "EPA Expects Firms to Complete Certain Program Steps, but Not All Have Done So", "paragraphs": ["First, firms complete their base-year inventories, which EPA encourages  and expects them to do, on average, within 1 year of joining the program.  The base-year inventory contains the data that will be used to measure  firms\u2019 progress toward their goals. As of November 2005, 61 of the 74 firms  had submitted base-year inventory data to EPA. After the inventory has  been submitted, the participant works with EPA to refine its inventory.  Eleven of the 61 inventories had been finalized and approved by EPA. The  other 50 were still in development or review. An EPA official noted that  some firms did not submit inventories earlier because EPA\u2019s reporting  guidelines were not completed until April 2004. In addition, these officials  told us that it often takes firms more than a year to prepare their base-year  inventory because firms start at different levels of sophistication with  respect to developing an inventory. Some firms start with no knowledge of  how to develop an inventory and no infrastructure in place for doing so.  Furthermore, some corporate inventories may take longer due to their  complexity, including complicated corporate structures, a wide variety of  emissions sources, and the lack of available emissions data. Corporate  reorganizations and staff turnover also contribute to delays. An EPA  official told us that the average amount of time it takes firms to complete  their base-year inventory once they join the program has been 2 years, but  the average amount of time firms have taken since EPA completed its  reporting guidelines is 1 year.", "Firms have two options for having their inventories reviewed. They can  either submit their data to EPA for review, or they can choose third-party  verification, in which an outside organization, such as an environmental  engineering firm with greenhouse gas verification experience, reviews their  data.", "After they have submitted base-year inventory data to EPA, firms work  with EPA to refine the inventory, usually resulting in some revisions. In  reporting data, firms are to follow guidance developed by EPA that is based  on a standardized reporting protocol established by the World Resources  Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.  The protocol consists of corporate emissions accounting standards  developed by representatives from industry, government, and  nongovernmental organizations.", "Second, EPA officials told us that EPA expects all firms to prepare an IMP,  which is the firm\u2019s plan for collecting data, preparing the inventory, and  managing inventory quality. EPA officials informed us that, as of November  2005, 60 of the 74 firms had submitted draft IMPs. Firms that choose to  have EPA review their emissions inventories must also submit their IMP to  EPA, while firms that choose to undergo third-party verification must  submit a letter from the third party stating that all the specified  components of the IMP checklist are in place and that at least one site visit  was conducted. The IMP checklist consists of 30 components in seven  major categories, including, among other things, boundary conditions (i.e.,  which parts of the facility will be covered under the program), emissions  quantification methods, and data management processes. Nineteen of the  30 IMP components are to be in place within 1 year of joining the program  and must be in place for base-year reporting to be finalized. Fifty-four of  the 60 firms completing IMPs submitted their IMPs to EPA for review, while  the other 6 chose to have their inventories and IMPs reviewed by third  parties. According to EPA officials, the remaining 14 firms had not  submitted a draft IMP or informed EPA of their intention to choose  third-party verification, although eight of these firms joined the program  within the past year and so, according to EPA officials, would not be  expected to have completed these steps. EPA officials told us that these  remaining firms are still working on the necessary documentation.", "EPA conducts at least one site visit per firm to review facility-level  implementation of the IMP to determine whether there are ways to improve  the plan\u2019s accuracy, among other things. The site to be visited is mutually  agreed upon; EPA aims to review the company facility with the highest  overall risk to the accuracy of reported emissions. (Such a site should be a  large emitter, have many of the largest emission types, and represent the  firm\u2019s most common business activity, among other criteria.) As of  November 2005, EPA had conducted 25 site visits (about one-third of all  firms), with 10 more visits scheduled before the end of 2005.", "The base-year inventory is not considered final until EPA has reviewed  both it and the IMP and conducted a site visit. An EPA official told us that  initial inventories generally contain about 95 percent of each member\u2019s  total emissions, so only minor and incremental revisions are needed at the  on-site review stage.", "EPA provides up to 80 hours of technical assistance to help each firm  complete its base-year inventory and develop and document its IMP.  Technical assistance can include implementing greenhouse gas accounting  methods as well as measuring, tracking, and reporting emissions. After the  firm\u2019s base-year inventory is complete, EPA experts continue to offer up to  10 hours annually of technical assistance during subsequent years.", "Since Climate Leaders provides technical assistance to each firm as it  develops and documents its inventory and IMP, an EPA official stated that  most major issues that might arise in inventory design and development are  addressed informally at the technical assistance stage. However, according  to EPA, some issues are identified during the site visits. In general, the site  visits have identified only a few areas where EPA asked for revisions.  These usually involved missing small sources of on-site emissions (such as  those from propane for forklifts or on-site diesel purchases for a yard  truck). EPA officials told us that most of the items they identified during  the site visits were minor calculation errors or ways to improve the firm\u2019s  data quality assurance and quality control processes. They said that the  majority of these areas are corrected on location during the site visit, and  any others are verified by the submission of an updated IMP and  greenhouse gas reporting form that describe respectively, the changes to  the inventory process and the greenhouse gas emissions that were made in  response to the findings.", "As noted earlier, firms choosing third-party verification instead of EPA  review are to submit an independent verifier\u2019s report stating that at least  one site visit was conducted and that all the necessary components of the  IMP checklist were successfully implemented. As of November 2005, six  firms had chosen to have their data verified by a third party, and all of these  firms had undergone their third-party verification. Three firms had  submitted inventory data and initial auditor reports to EPA. EPA is awaiting  letters from the other three firms indicating that all of the components of  the IMP checklist are in place and that any corrective actions identified in  the verification process have been addressed.", "Third, EPA officials told us that the agency expects firms to enter into  negotiations with EPA to set their reduction goals once their base-year  inventory is finalized, generally within about 1 year after joining the  program, and to complete negotiations within 1 year after that. However,  we found that some firms have taken longer to do so. Thirty-eight of the 74  participating firms had set goals as of November 2005. Of the 36 firms  without goals, 20 were working with EPA to develop goals. Seven of these  20 firms were still working on their base-year inventories, and 9 had joined  the program within the past year and hence would not be expected to have  set goals. The 36 firms without goals included 18 firms that joined the  program in 2002 or 2003. Specifically, of the 35 firms that joined in 2002, the  program\u2019s first year, 22 had set goals, 9 firms were in the process of  negotiating their goals with EPA, and 4 more had not begun such  negotiations. Of the 16 firms that joined in 2003, 11 had set goals, 3 were in  negotiation with EPA regarding goals, and 2 had not yet begun such  negotiations. According to EPA officials, the 6 firms had not begun  negotiations because their base-year inventories were not finalized.", "In describing why it may take a long time to set goals, EPA officials told us  that many firms require considerable time to develop their inventories,  which can be complex. Firms must also obtain internal approval of their  emissions reduction goals from their senior management, and some firms  lack enough resources to devote to inventory development to meet the time  frame of EPA\u2019s reporting guidelines. Other reasons also exist. For example,  one firm disagreed with EPA regarding whether to report a certain type of  emission in its inventory and needed to come to agreement with EPA on  addressing those emissions. Another firm is involved in litigation that will  likely affect its future emissions levels and does not want to set an  emissions reduction goal until the case is resolved, while yet a third firm is  facing regulation that could affect its ability to meet an aggressive  reduction goal.", "Finally, according to EPA\u2019s reporting guidelines, all firms agree to report to  EPA annually on their emissions using EPA\u2019s Annual Greenhouse Gas  Inventory Summary and Goal Tracking Form. This form describes the  firm\u2019s emissions at a corporate level broken out by emissions type for both  domestic and international sources and details progress toward the firm\u2019s  emissions reduction goal. As of November 2005, 10 of the 11 firms with  finalized inventories had submitted annual data through 2004 to EPA. An  EPA official told us that the other firm was currently resolving some  outstanding issues and would likely submit a report in early 2006.", "Although all firms are expected to complete all four steps listed above, EPA  officials told us that firms do not need to complete the steps in any  particular order. For example, some firms may choose to finalize their  base-year inventory before submitting annual reports with multiple years of  data, while other firms may choose to submit annual data before the  inventory is fully finalized."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Is Developing a System to Track Participants\u2019 Progress, but It Lacks a Written Policy for Dealing with Firms That Do Not Complete Program Steps in a Timely Manner", "paragraphs": ["EPA officials told us that they had started to develop a database to track  firms\u2019 progress and are currently in the process of entering and validating  the data. Although some firms are not completing the various program  steps as quickly as EPA expected, the agency has not yet established a  written policy for dealing with such firms. An EPA official noted that firms  that voluntarily agree to participate in the program are aware of program  expectations and are generally proactive in meeting them. EPA officials  further stated that the agency has three options for dealing with firms that  do not appear to be proceeding in a timely manner: (1) telephone calls from  EPA or its contractor to reinvigorate the process, (2) a letter to firms urging  them to act more expeditiously, or (3) removal from the program if the firm  is not putting forth a good-faith effort to meet the program\u2019s expectations.  However, EPA believes that it is better for the environment to work with  firms that are making a good-faith effort to implement appropriate  management systems than to remove them from the program. To date, EPA  has not removed any firm from the program for lack of progress, although  one firm voluntarily left after realizing it did not have sufficient resources  to continue participation. According to EPA officials, as of November 2005,  two firms did not appear to be working toward completing their reporting  duties in a timely manner, and EPA anticipated sending letters to those  firms. EPA officials noted that, since Climate Leaders is a voluntary  program, it is difficult for EPA to sanction firms that do not meet all of the  program\u2019s expectations in a timely manner.

The template includes four items: (1) emissions measurement  and reporting protocols; (2) plans to identify and implement near-term,  cost-effective opportunities; (3) development of cross-sector projects for  reducing greenhouse gas emissions intensity; and (4) plans to accelerate  research and development and commercialization of advanced technology.  However, DOE officials explained that specific elements of each industry  group\u2019s work plans are different because each industry is different.

DOE officials  said they were still working with the groups to finalize their work plans.  They also noted that getting the trade groups to adhere to DOE\u2019s time lines  can be challenging because the groups often have to clear all their activities  through their individual member companies or through their boards of  directors, which can be time consuming.", "In addition to developing a work plan, trade groups are expected to report  data on their greenhouse gas emissions. As of November 2005, 5 of the 15  groups had reported data: 2 groups reported data to DOE, and 3 groups that  have been working with EPA as participants in EPA-sponsored programs  reported to that agency. According to a DOE official, as the trade groups  finish developing and training their members in the use of reporting  protocols, they are expected to begin reporting on their emissions, most in  2006. DOE will then ask the groups to report annually. Program officials  explained that, at least in one case, a group did not report earlier because,  among other things, DOE was revising its interim final voluntary emissions  reporting guidelines, which were released in late 2005.", "DOE does not specify a particular format that trade groups should use in  reporting emissions data, since all industries are different and the nature of  the goals differ. However, the program encourages the groups to have their  individual members report using EIA\u2019s Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse  Gases program or another appropriate reporting system, such as EPA\u2019s.

Of the 19 companies with intensity goals, 15  measured emissions intensity in terms of their physical units of output  (such as tons of cement or barrels of beer produced), while the other 4  firms measured emissions intensity in financial terms (such as dollar of  revenue.) In addition, EPA expects that many firms that meet their intensity  goals will also achieve absolute emissions reductions. In fact, EPA  projected that four of the five firms that were expected to reach their goals  in 2005 would also achieve absolute emissions reductions, even though  only one of them has an absolute target. Second, 29 of the 38 companies  established goals relating to their U.S. or North American facilities only,  while the other 9 established goals relating to their global facilities. Third,  the time periods covered ranged from 5 to 10 years, and all goal periods  began in 2000 or later because EPA asked firms to use the most recent data  available when establishing the base year for their goal. EPA did this to  prevent firms from counting reductions made prior to joining the program  and to prevent them from selecting as their baseline a year in which their  emissions were particularly high, hence making reductions appear steeper  than they actually were, relative to average conditions.", "Reflecting various combinations of the three characteristics, the firms\u2019  goals are expressed in different terms. For example, Cinergy Corporation  pledged to reduce its total domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 5 percent  from 2000 to 2010, while Miller Brewing Company pledged to reduce its  domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 18 percent per barrel of production  (a unit of production intensity goal) from 2001 to 2006, and Pfizer, Inc.,  pledged to reduce its worldwide emissions by 35 percent per dollar of  revenue (a monetary intensity goal) from 2000 to 2007.

DOE  officials told us that the agency remained flexible on goal setting because  some groups had initiated their own internal emissions reduction programs  before joining the program or had an existing arrangement with another  agency, such as EPA. In addition, DOE officials believe it is important for  the groups to establish goals that meet their unique circumstances. The  officials told us that they compared the trade groups\u2019 goals with projected  emissions for their respective industries to gauge their robustness.

Specifically, nine groups used 2000 or 2002 as a base year. For example, the  National Lime Association stated its intention to reduce emissions intensity  by 8 percent between 2002 and 2012. However, four goals had a base year of  1995 or earlier. For example, the Portland Cement Association pledged to  reduce its emissions intensity by 10 percent between 1990 and 2020. DOE  officials told us that, even though some participants are using 1990 or  another pre-2003 year as a base year, DOE will count only reductions  occurring between 2002 and 2012 as part of the program\u2019s contribution  toward the President\u2019s 18 percent emissions intensity reduction goal.", "In addition to setting emissions-related goals, some groups also set other  kinds of goals. For example, the American Petroleum Institute committed  to 100 percent member participation in EPA\u2019s voluntary Natural Gas STAR  program (which helps U.S. natural gas companies adopt technologies and  practices to reduce emissions of methane) and DOE\u2019s Combined Heat and  Power Program (which works to eliminate barriers to the adoption of  combined heat and power technology systems.)

This amount is equivalent to the annual  emissions of 5 million automobiles and represents less than one-half of 1  percent of U.S. emissions in 2003 (the latest year for which data are  available.) EPA derived this estimate by adding up the average annual  expected emissions reductions for the first 35 firms that had set goals.  (Three other firms set goals later.)

If the trade group comprises an entire industry, DOE will use the  EIA projection for the entire industry; if the trade group comprises less  than the entire industry, DOE will prorate the industry total based on the  trade group\u2019s share of the industry.", "Estimating the effect of the two programs, as opposed to other voluntary  programs and other factors, will be challenging for two reasons. First,  because the firms and trade groups participating in these two programs  may also participate in other voluntary programs, it will be difficult to  determine the two programs\u2019 effect on reducing emissions, as opposed to  other programs\u2019 effects on reducing emissions. Unless EPA and DOE find  an effective way to disaggregate the emissions reductions attributable to  each program, there is the possibility that total emission reductions from  voluntary federal programs will be overstated because the same emissions  reductions reported by organizations participating in Climate Leaders,  Climate VISION, and other programs will be counted by more than one  program. EPA officials told us that they recognize the challenge of  attributing the effects of the various voluntary programs and stated that  they are trying to avoid double counting of the programs\u2019 results. Second,  the reductions in a participants\u2019 emissions that are due to a program are the  difference between its actual emissions generated during a period of time  and the amount of emissions that it would have generated for that period if  it were not participating in the program. Although a participant can  estimate its future emissions based on its estimate of future conditions  (e.g., energy prices and other factors), all of these conditions may change  during the time period. Any such change would need to be assessed to  determine how it might have affected the participant\u2019s emissions.", "There are three types of overlap involving the firms and trade groups  participating in Climate Leaders and Climate VISION. First, as of November  2005, most Climate Leaders firms also participate in other voluntary EPA  programs. Specifically, 60 of the 74 firms took part in one or more other  programs, while the other 14 firms did not take part in any other programs,  as shown in figure 2. Of the 60 firms, 36 took part in one to three other  voluntary climate programs. For example, Calpine participated in three  programs, including the Combined Heat and Power Partnership, and  Natural Gas STAR. Another 18 firms participate in four to six other  programs. For example, Cinergy Corporation participated in EPA\u2019s Coalbed  Methane Outreach Program, Combined Heat and Power Partnership, and  Natural Gas STAR, among others. Additionally, six firms participate in  seven or more programs. IBM, for example, participates in 11 other  programs, including Energy STAR and the PFC Emissions Reduction  Partnership for the Semiconductor Industry.", "Second, some firms participating in Climate Leaders are members of trade  groups participating in Climate VISION. We identified such firms in the  automobile manufacturing, cement, electric power, and paper industries.  For example, General Motors, a Climate Leaders participant, is a member  of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a Climate VISION participant.", "Finally, three of the Climate VISION trade groups also participate in EPA  voluntary programs. Specifically, the Aluminum, Magnesium, and  Semiconductor Associations also participate in industry-focused EPA  programs. Further, the Aluminum and Semiconductor Associations  previously developed their goals in conjunction with other EPA voluntary  programs.", "The fact that there is overlap among the organizations participating in both  Climate Leaders and Climate VISION, and among participants in these  programs and other federal voluntary programs, creates the possibility that  their emissions reductions will be counted more than once. For example,  the emissions reductions claimed by firms participating in Climate Leaders  who are also members of trade groups participating in Climate VISION may  be counted twice\u2014the individual firm\u2019s achievement may be credited  under the Climate Leaders program, while the same achievement may be  counted toward the trade group achieving its goal under Climate VISION.  Further, for those trade groups that participate in Climate VISION and  other EPA voluntary programs, it is possible that the same actions and the  same emissions reductions will be counted by both programs. If  participants\u2019 emissions reductions are counted by multiple programs, it is  possible that any attempt to estimate the overall impact of voluntary  federal climate change programs on greenhouse gas emissions will be  overstated.", "In addition, it will be challenging to accurately estimate the programs\u2019  effects because it is difficult to determine the level of emissions for a firm  or trade group in the absence of these programs and other factors. For  example, increases in energy prices can be expected to reduce energy  consumption, which is significant because carbon dioxide emissions from  energy use account for more than 80 percent of U.S. emissions. According  to EIA\u2019s 2002 estimate, which was reflected in the President\u2019s February  2002 plan, U.S. emissions intensity was projected to improve 14 percent by  2012. However, according to EIA\u2019s 2006 estimate, largely because of an  increase in energy prices, emissions intensity is now projected to improve  17 percent over the same period. If participants had anticipated such an  improvement, they might have projected lower emissions over time. This  means that the difference between their reported emissions and their  projected emissions would be smaller, which would decrease the emissions  reductions attributable to participation in a voluntary program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The administration has chosen to pursue voluntary rather than mandatory  activities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Given the potential gravity  of the climate change problem, programs such as Climate Leaders and  Climate VISION will need to be especially robust and involve a substantial  portion of the economy if they are going to achieve the desired results. To  date, according to EPA and DOE estimates, these two voluntary programs  involve companies and industries representing less than one-half of total  U.S. emissions, which immediately limits their potential impact. This  makes it all the more important that the voluntary programs maximize the  extent to which their potential is achieved.", "To this end, we found that opportunities remain to improve the  management of both programs. First, while many participants appear to  have made considerable progress in completing program steps in a timely  manner, some participants in both programs appear not to be progressing  at the rate expected by the sponsoring agencies. For example, although  EPA expects that firms will generally take about 2 years to establish their  emissions reduction goals, of the 51 firms that joined in 2002 and 2003, the  first 2 years of the program, 18 firms had not done so as of November 2005.  Second, while 12 of these 18 firms are currently negotiating their goals with  EPA, 6 others had not begun negotiations because their inventories had not  been finalized. Similarly, although DOE expects that groups will generally  complete their work plans within about a year of joining the program, of  the 13 groups that joined during 2003, the program\u2019s first year, 2 had not  completed their plans as of November 2005. EPA is developing a system for  tracking firms\u2019 progress in completing key steps under Climate Leaders,  but DOE does not have a system for tracking trade group\u2019s progress under  Climate VISION. We believe that, without a system to track how long  participants take to complete key program steps, DOE cannot ensure that  the program\u2019s goals are being accomplished. Moreover, neither agency has  a written policy on what action to take when a firm is not making sufficient  progress in setting goals and completing other key program steps. We  believe that, by establishing written policies regarding consequences for  not completing these steps on schedule, the agencies could more easily  ensure participants' active involvement in the programs, thereby increasing  the opportunities for contributing to the President\u2019s emissions intensity  reduction goal.", "Both agencies are working this year to estimate the emissions reductions  attributable to their programs. No matter how many firms and trade groups  have joined the programs and how well they are meeting program  expectations, to demonstrate the value of voluntary programs\u2014as opposed  to mandatory reductions\u2014the agencies will need robust estimates of the  programs\u2019 effect on reducing emissions. However, as we noted, making this  estimate will be challenging for two reasons. First, the overlaps between  organizations participating in these two programs and other voluntary  programs make it difficult to attribute specific emissions reductions to one  program. EPA and DOE will need to find a way to determine the emissions  reductions attributable to each program so that the same emissions  reductions reported by organizations participating in Climate Leaders,  Climate VISION, and other voluntary programs are not counted by more  than one program. Otherwise, estimates of total emission reductions from  voluntary federal programs could be overstated. Second, it will be difficult  to determine the emissions reductions stemming from participants\u2019  involvement in the program, as opposed to higher energy prices or other  factors, because it is difficult to determine what participants\u2019 emissions  would be in the absence of these programs. It will therefore be difficult to  evaluate the merits of these voluntary programs. Nevertheless, it will be  important for the agencies to overcome these challenges in determining  their programs\u2019 emission reduction contributions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that the Congress and the public have information with which to  evaluate the effectiveness of these voluntary programs and to increase the  opportunities for contributing to the President\u2019s emissions intensity  reduction goal, we are recommending that DOE develop a system for  tracking participants\u2019 progress in completing key steps associated with the  program.

EPA did not comment on our recommendation, but rather  provided a summary of the program\u2019s accomplishments, noting that 85  firms now participate in Climate Leaders and that 5 firms had met their  emissions reduction goals (see app. IV). DOE stated that, overall, the draft  report provided a useful overview of the Climate VISION program and  agreed with our recommendation regarding a tracking system and said it  will consider our recommendation regarding establishing a written policy  (see app. V). However, DOE stated that the Climate VISION Web page  contains a wealth of information on the program, which may be sufficient  to ensure the active involvement of participating groups. Because DOE\u2019s  Web site does not contain information regarding the expected time frames  for completing key program steps or the consequences for groups not  meeting the agency\u2019s expectations, we continue to believe that DOE should  establish a written policy regarding what actions it will take when a trade  group is not making sufficient progress in completing key steps. Although  DOE agreed with our statement that Climate VISION participants account  for at least 40 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, it noted that  the program covers about four-fifths of total U.S. industrial- and  power-related greenhouse gas emissions, which makes the potential impact  of the program substantial. Also, although DOE agreed that higher energy  prices may lead to lower emissions overall, it noted that, in the power  sector, higher energy prices may lead to greater emissions.

We determined the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "To ascertain how many firms participating in Climate Leaders also  participate in other EPA voluntary climate programs, we cross-referenced a  Climate Leaders roster against EPA lists of membership in other EPA  voluntary programs. Similarly, we reviewed membership in DOE\u2019s Climate  VISION program and cross-referenced selected individual trade group  members with the list of Climate Leaders members.", "Finally, to create a list of other government-sponsored, voluntary  greenhouse gas emissions reduction programs, we requested information  from EPA on all current U.S. policies and measures designed to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions. We narrowed the list to those programs that  were voluntary. We defined voluntary programs to include only those  programs in which private sector parties agree, of their own free will, to  reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, we excluded regulatory  programs. We also excluded programs consisting primarily of research and  development, tax incentive, or financial assistance, and  government/industry cost share arrangements. However, we determined  that voluntary programs can include programs in which the government  provides information to private sector parties, individuals, or state and  local governments. We also included programs that were created both for  the specific purpose of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and that were  created to reduce other pollutants but have as a side benefit the reduction  of greenhouse gases. We included programs that are supported by the  Departments of Agriculture, Energy, and Transportation, as well as EPA.", "We conducted our review from June 2004 through March 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Climate VISION Participant Qualifying Statements", "paragraphs": ["\u201cClearly, achievement of this commitment and the national goal will depend on a number of external factors,  including economic stability, coordinated regulatory policies that avoid mandates and other market barriers,  weather variations which skew energy use, and support from the utilities\u2019 energy mix, including emission factors  reductions.\u201d", "Aluminum Association No qualifying statement noted. \u201c . . . government can help by removing barriers that impede efficiency upgrades and by providing incentives for  companies to implement state-of-the-art technology. Without an aggressive government role in removing  barriers to progress and providing incentives, it will be difficult, if not impossible, for the business of chemistry to  do its share to reach the president\u2019s goal of reducing national greenhouse gas intensity by 18 percent during the  2002-2012 timeframe.\u201d \u201cAs an organization, we believe that our success will depend in part on the Administration\u2019s efforts to rationalize  and manage the activities of all government agencies, especially with respect to the promulgation of regulatory  requirements that may result in increases in greenhouse gas emissions. Our commitment also will naturally  depend on the parameters of any implementation guidelines that may be developed. Specifically, we strongly  encourage the Administration to address regulatory requirements where the negative climate impacts outweigh  any environmental benefits.\u201d \u201cWe propose to use the  Roadmap goals as a basis for addressing the President\u2019s  Business Challenge. The Roadmap goals, however, are expressed in terms of technical feasibility and are  qualified by the fact that the cost of acquiring and implementing any new technology must be economically  justifiable for it to achieve widespread adoption in the industry.\u201d \u201cFuture progress will be particularly difficult because of the increased energy and capital requirements at  refineries due to significant tightening of gasoline and diesel fuel specifications in the coming decade. As part of  this program, API will look to the Administration to aggressively work to eliminate any potential regulatory  barriers to progress in these areas.\u201d \u201cMost recently we have embarked on a cooperative venture with DOE\u2019s Office of Energy Efficiency and  Renewable Energy to explore methods of improving railroad fuel efficiency. . . The industry\u2019s efforts, of course,  will also depend upon DOE\u2019s funding the above-described government/rail industry cooperative venture to  improve railroad fuel efficiency as DOE had previously indicated it was prepared to do. . .
