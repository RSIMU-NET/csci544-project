To determine the insurance sector's preparedness to protect and recover critical insurance operations, GAO was asked to (1) describe the potential effects of disruptions to the operations of insurers, state insurance regulators, and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC); (2) identify actions taken by those organizations to protect and restore their operations; and (3) assess the extent to which regulations require reviews of insurer efforts in these areas."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Adequate business continuity capabilities are necessary to prevent terrorist attacks or natural disasters from severely disrupting the operations of large insurers and leaving the companies unable to provide important services to policyholders when needed. And while a disruption to a large insurer could potentially affect millions of policyholders, any effects would likely not spread throughout the insurance sector because of limited interdependencies among insurers and, unlike the securities markets, the lack of a single point through which insurance transactions must pass. Further, while state insurance regulators and NAIC provide important services to consumers and insurers, such services are generally not time sensitive and a disruption of 1 or 2 weeks would not have a significant effect. All of the 18 insurers and most of the five state regulators GAO spoke with, as well as NAIC, indicated that they had taken actions designed to protect their operations from disruption and recover critical operations should a disruption occur. For insurers, these actions typically included establishing geographically dispersed backup sites and conducting critical operations at multiple geographically dispersed facilities. Among property/casualty and life insurers, the highest priority was generally to recover investment and cash management functions, while among health insurers it was customer service and claims processing. Most insurers said they could recover their highest priority operations within 1 day, and most other operations within 3 days. While all of the state regulators GAO spoke with had processes in place to back up critical data, one had no backup computer systems, one had no business continuity plans, and one had neither. NAIC has also taken steps to protect critical data and has implemented business continuity capabilities designed to recover critical operations within 24 hours. Current federal and state regulations, as well as NAIC examination guidelines, require insurers to have information security programs and business continuity plans, but do not require minimum recovery times. For example, state insurance examinations review information security and business continuity as part of the larger objective of reviewing insurers' internal controls and insurer solvency, and do not require insurers to meet specific recovery objectives. However, while state regulators stated they had informal expectations that insurers would recover certain critical operations, such as claims processing, within 2 days after a disruption, half of the insurers GAO spoke with had set recovery goals for their claims processing operations that would appear not to meet these expectations. Further, it is not clear whether current examination guidelines and practices adequately address the trend among insurers to outsource certain functions, especially information technology functions. For example, some of the insurers GAO spoke with were outsourcing their computer system backup functions or portions of their claims-processing operations, but only one of the regulators said they had ever conducted audit work at such a service provider."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As you know, the insurance sector is a key component of the U.S. financial  sector and is vital to the overall functioning of our nation\u2019s economy,  particularly following a terrorist attack or other disaster, such as a  hurricane, in which lives have been lost, property has been damaged, and  people and businesses need funds to rebuild their lives. The smooth  functioning of the insurance sector depends on the ability of key  businesses and organizations to protect their operations from disruption  and recover their operating ability quickly should a disruption occur. The  importance of such preparedness was made clear when, in August 2004, the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that terrorists had  identified several financial institutions as potential targets, including at  least one large insurer.", "GAO has previously reviewed the actions taken by critical financial market  participants to ensure the continued processing of securities transactions  and to reduce the potential for disruptions to market operations after  disasters such as the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks (9/11). Your  request that we perform similar work with respect to the insurance sector  is in many ways an extension of this earlier work. As agreed with the  committee, our objectives for this project were to  describe the potential effects of disruptions to the operations of  insurers, state insurance regulators, and the National Association of  Insurance Commissioners (NAIC); identify the actions these organizations have undertaken to protect their  operations from disruption and restore operations should a disruption  occur; and   assess the extent to which certain current laws and regulations require  reviews of insurers\u2019 efforts in these areas and the extent to which state  examinations include such reviews.", "To achieve our objectives, we reviewed regulatory documents, such as  insurance laws and examination guidelines, and interviewed officials from  a judgmental sample of 18 large health, life, and property/casualty insurers  in five states, the insurance regulators in those states, and NAIC regarding  their business continuity capabilities and their physical and information  security protections. The insurers were selected, in part, based on total  revenue in 2003 and included 5 health insurers, 6 life insurers, and 7  property/casualty insurers. In assessing the organizations\u2019 capabilities in  these areas, we used criteria that were either established by regulators or  were generally accepted by government or industry. For our reviews, we  generally relied on documentation and descriptions provided by the  organizations, although we did directly observe some security controls and  business continuity elements at NAIC and at some insurers. As part of our  work to assess actions taken by state insurance regulators, we also  reviewed a sample of examination workpapers from each of the state  regulators we contacted. We performed our work from December 2004  through October 2005 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

Insurers provide services that allow individuals  and businesses to manage their risk by providing compensation for certain  losses or expenses, such as car crashes, fires, medical services, or loss of  the ability to work. Some insurers also provide access to certain financial  services, such as annuities and mutual funds. State insurance regulators are  responsible for enforcing state insurance regulations, and do so primarily  through the licensing of agents, the approval of insurance rates and  products, and the examination of insurers\u2019 financial solvency and conduct.  State regulators typically conduct financial solvency examinations every 3  to 5 years, while examinations reviewing insurers\u2019 conduct are generally  done in response to specific complaints by consumers or concerns on the  part of the regulator. State regulators also monitor the resolution of  consumer complaints against insurers.", "NAIC is a body composed of state insurance regulators, and while it does  not regulate insurers, it does provide optional services designed to make  certain interactions between insurers and regulators more efficient. For  example, NAIC operates automated systems that insurers can use to  request approvals from state regulators for new insurance products and  rates as well as licenses for their insurance agents. Most of the insurers and  state regulators we spoke with used these services to some extent,  although some insurers said that they did not. NAIC also provides services  to state regulators that help them monitor insurers\u2019 financial condition and  prepare for examinations. This service primarily involves collecting  financial data that insurers are required by state insurance regulations to  provide to NAIC, analyzing that data, and providing the analyses to state  regulators. State regulators can also access this database to conduct  analyses of their own. According to NAIC, all state regulators use these  services to at least some extent. Finally, NAIC develops guidance to be  used by state examiners, regularly updating this guidance to ensure it  adequately addresses existing or emerging conditions in the insurance  sector."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Organizations Take Actions to Protect Operations from Disruption, and Recover Operations Should a Disruption Occur", "paragraphs": ["In order to protect their operations from potential disruptions,  organizations can invest in both physical and information security  measures. Physical security measures are intended to reduce the risk that  facilities and personnel could be harmed by individuals or groups  attempting unauthorized entry, sabotage, or other criminal acts. Typical  measures might include employee access badges, security guards, or video  monitoring systems. Information security measures are intended to protect  the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an organization\u2019s  information and information systems and to reduce the risk and magnitude  of harm resulting from threats such as hackers and computer viruses.  These measures might include password controls, firewalls, and intrusion  detection systems.", "In order to recover their operations should a disruption occur,  organizations can develop business continuity plans and invest in business  continuity capabilities. Organizations design such plans to guide their  response to disruptions, and generally create their plans by identifying the  most critical functions and the resources needed to carry out those  functions. Business continuity plans and capabilities might include  alternate work space should facilities become inaccessible, and backup  computer systems and data centers should primary systems and facilities  be damaged or destroyed.", "Effectively managing the risk of operations disruptions may involve making  trade-offs between protecting facilities, personnel, and systems and  ensuring business continuity. For example, organizations must weigh the  expected costs of operations disruptions against the expected cost of  implementing security protections, developing facilities, or implementing  other business continuity capabilities to ensure that the organizations  would be able to resume operations after a disaster. Costs of disruptions  can include revenues actually lost during the outage, as well as lost income  because of damage to an organization\u2019s reputation resulting from its  inability to resume operations. In addition, risk management guidance  suggests that organizations identify potential threats that could cause  disruptions, estimate the likelihood of these events, and develop their plans  accordingly. By quantifying the costs and probabilities of various types of  disruptions, organizations can better allocate their resources. For example,  an organization whose primary site is located in a highly trafficked public  area may have limited ability to increase the physical security of these  facilities but could reduce the risk of disruption with a backup facility  manned by staff capable of supporting its critical operations or by cross- training other staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Department of Homeland Security Delegated Responsibility for Protection of the Financial Sector to Treasury", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), created to help coordinate  the efforts of organizations and institutions involved in protecting the  nation\u2019s critical infrastructures against terrorist attacks, has delegated to  the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) this coordinating role within the  banking and finance sector, which includes the insurance sector.

Disruptions to the  operations of a state insurance regulator could also delay some important  services, such as licensing and product approvals for insurers and  complaint resolution for consumers, but such services do not appear to be  highly time sensitive, and in the short term, such disruptions would have a  limited effect on insurers\u2019 normal operations. Similarly, a disruption to  NAIC\u2019s operations could delay services to insurers and state regulators, but  these services also do not appear to be highly time sensitive."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Disruptions to Insurers\u2019 Operations Could Delay Important Services, but Limited Risk Exists of Disruption to Larger Insurance Sector", "paragraphs": ["Unless insurers implement security and business continuity capabilities  that adequately protect their operations from disruption and allow them to  recover those operations in a reasonable amount of time should a  disruption occur, important policyholder services could be delayed.  Potentially disruptive events could include natural disasters, such as  earthquakes or hurricanes, as well as intentional acts like bombings or  computer attacks. The primary insurance services insurers provide to  policyholders include assessing damage, making payments on claims or  through other arrangements such as annuities, and, for health insurers,  ensuring access to medical services. A disruption to any of these services  has the potential to negatively impact policyholders, holding up funds  needed to repair property or pay living expenses and, in some cases,  cutting off access to necessary medical attention. Some large insurers have  millions of policies, and while it is unlikely that all policyholders would  require services at the same time, a disruption at one of these large insurers  could affect a large number of people. For example, the annual report of  one of the large insurers we spoke with stated that in 2004 they had  approximately 65 million policies in force and handled approximately  30,000 claims a day.", "The majority of insurers we spoke with generally determined the period of  time customers could reasonably be without certain key services before  being significantly inconvenienced and set their recovery goals for those  services based on these determinations. For most property/casualty and  life insurers, recovery goals for claims-processing functions were 3 days or  less. For most health insurers, such goals for customer service functions,  including telephone information lines and authorizations necessary to  receive medical services, was 1 day or less. Three of the five health insurers  also told us, however, that access to critical services was not dependent on  verification or preauthorization provided by the insurer, so that  policyholders could obtain many critical medical services even if the  insurer\u2019s operations were disrupted. For example, two health insurers said  that possession of an insurance card, and not any action by the insurer,  established policyholders\u2019 eligibility for medical services. This is discussed  in more detail later in the report.", "We also found, however, that several distinctive characteristics of the  insurance industry would likely mitigate the potential effects of a  disruption at one insurer, even a large company, on the rest of the  insurance sector or the larger financial sector. First, limited  interdependencies exist among insurers\u2014that is, an insurer\u2019s interactions  are primarily limited to those involving its own policyholders, and insurers  generally do not depend on other insurers for critical business functions.  Second, insurance transactions do not need to pass through a central point  or process and thus are unlikely to be caught in a potential bottleneck  involving the operations of many insurers. For example, in the securities  trading markets, all trades must pass through an exchange and a clearing  organization, creating potential single points of failure that could affect the  entire securities market. In contrast, no such potential single point of  failure exists in the insurance sector. Third, while there are some areas of  geographic concentration of insurers, the insurance sector as a whole is  geographically dispersed across the United States, making it unlikely that a  single wide-scale event could disrupt the operations of a large number of  insurers. For instance, a number of large insurance companies are located  in New York City, but many more are located in other states. Finally, while  insurers do depend on reinsurers to help them manage their level of risk,  industry officials told us that the relationship is primarily financial rather  than operational, and the interactions are not highly time sensitive. Thus, a  disruption at a reinsurer could delay a payment to an insurer but would not  affect the insurer\u2019s normal operations. In addition, reinsurers we spoke  with told us that a delay of 1 week in the payment of a reinsurance claim  would not have a significant negative effect on an insurer, since such  claims can take anywhere from several days to years to resolve, depending  on their complexity.", "Of the seven insurers that told us about their experience with previous  potentially disruptive events, such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks, power  outages, or hurricanes, all said that the events had not caused a disruption  to their operations. Those insurers that were in the areas affected by those  events, even one with operations in the World Trade Center on 9/11, said  that they were able to restore operations within several days and that their  policyholders did not experience a disruption in their service. However, all  of the insurers said that the events of 9/11 had caused them to reassess and  improve their business continuity capabilities. Specifically, 13 of the  insurers said that they now plan for wider-scale disruptions or have more  comprehensive plans, 5 had increased their physical security, and 3 had  increased the pace of previously planned business continuity  improvements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disruptions to Insurance Regulators\u2019 and NAIC\u2019s Operations Could Delay Some Services but Would Have Limited Effect in the Short Term", "paragraphs": ["A disruption to the operations of a state insurance regulator could delay  some services to insurers and consumers but would generally have a  limited effect in the short term. Insurance regulators provide services  necessary to insurers\u2019 operations\u2014such as the licensing of agents and the  approval of insurance rates and products\u2014as well as services designed to  protect consumers, such as the examination of insurers\u2019 financial solvency  and conduct, and the resolution of consumer complaints. In addition,  regulators may play an important role in overseeing insurers\u2019 response to  policyholders\u2019 needs following a disaster. And while a disruption to a  regulator\u2019s operations could delay the provision of these services, almost  all of the insurers we spoke with said that a delay of even 1 or 2 weeks  would likely not have a significant negative effect on insurers or  consumers. For example, according to some insurers, a delay of a week or  two in a regulator\u2019s approval of a new insurance product or rate would have  little effect on their operations. While there are occasions when a  regulator\u2019s approval is time sensitive, such as during a merger of insurance  companies, such events are infrequent, and insurers do not consider them  to be part of their normal operations. Similarly, state regulators\u2019 services on  behalf of consumers do not appear to be highly time-sensitive. Because the  resolution of consumer complaints against insurers can take several  months, and examinations generally occur once every 3 to 5 years, a delay  of 1 or 2 weeks would not be substantial.", "A disruption to NAIC\u2019s operations could also delay some services to  insurers and state regulators but would generally have a limited short-term  effect on insurers\u2019 and regulators\u2019 normal operations. As noted earlier,  NAIC provides optional automated services to both insurers and state  regulators, services that were used to at least some extent by most of the  insurers and regulators we spoke with.

A disruption to NAIC\u2019s operations could  disrupt the provision of any of these services but would generally have only  a limited short-term effect. As noted above, product and rate approvals and  agent licensing did not appear to be highly time sensitive, and a delay of 1  to 2 weeks would not have a significant negative effect. In addition, several  of the regulators and insurers that used these NAIC services said that if  NAIC\u2019s systems were not operational, other means were available, such as  e-mail and standard mail, to complete the same transactions (although less  efficiently). Because the examination process is also not highly time  sensitive, a delay of 1 or 2 weeks in state regulators\u2019 ability to obtain  financial analyses from NAIC or use NAIC\u2019s financial database would not  have significant negative effects.

For example, some insurers said they had based  their recovery time objectives on their need to manage their assets and  liquidity, while others said they looked at the length of disruption that  would be tolerable to their customers. Those using cost-benefit analyses  estimated the costs of disruptions of varying lengths and compared them  with the costs of different recovery time capabilities. None of the insurers  we spoke with were aware of any generally accepted, industrywide  recovery time objectives for insurers\u2019 operations.", "Most of the insurers we spoke with said that while they generally faced the  same level of threats as financial market organizations, they were less  likely to be the target of intentional disruptions because they believed they  had a lower public profile than many financial market organizations. That  is, while insurers said they generally faced the same threats from events  such as natural disasters, power outages, and computer viruses, they also  said that they were less likely to be specifically targeted by terrorists,  computer hackers, or others because they were not as well known publicly  as certain organizations in the financial markets. In addition, most insurers  also believed that the insurance sector as a whole faced a lower risk of  industrywide disruptions than the financial markets, largely because\u2014 unlike the financial markets\u2014the industry did not have a single point  through which all transactions passed. A number of insurers also pointed  to the geographic dispersion of insurers across the country, compared with  the concentration of financial market organizations in New York City, as a  reason why the overall insurance sector faced a lower risk of disruption.", "The majority of insurers told us that there was less of a need for quick  recovery of insurers\u2019 operations compared with other financial market  organizations. For example, 10 of the 18 insurers we spoke with felt that  their individual company\u2019s need to recover quickly was less than it was for  other financial market organizations. In addition, most of the insurers felt  that the need for quick recovery in the insurance sector as a whole was less  urgent than in the financial markets. These insurers cited several reasons  for this, including that most insurance transactions were less time sensitive  than financial market transactions and, again, the lack of a potential single  point of failure in the insurance sector that could spread a disruption from  one insurer throughout the industry."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Insurers Took Similar Actions to Protect Their Operations from Disruption", "paragraphs": ["Most of the 18 insurers we spoke with indicated that they had taken similar  actions designed to protect their operations from disruption and meet their  recovery needs should a disruption occur.

For example, all of the insurers we spoke  with told us that they had implemented access controls and intrusion  detection systems and did regular assessments of potential vulnerabilities  in their information systems, including tests in which internal or external  parties attempted to gain unauthorized access to their systems. In addition,  all of the insurers indicated that they had taken steps designed to ensure  their compliance with provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)  requiring that they protect consumer privacy information, incorporating  GLBA requirements in their information security program and performing  internal compliance reviews. The insurers we spoke with reported varying  levels of intrusion or hacking attempts, with one insurer stating it  experienced what it considered to be \u201cfrequent\u201d intrusion attempts, six  stating they had experienced what they would consider an \u201caverage\u201d  amount of such attempts for companies such as theirs, and four reporting  they had experienced only \u201coccasional\u201d or \u201cinfrequent\u201d intrusion attempts.

For example, all of the insurers we spoke with utilized some  combination of employee badges or scan cards, visitor stations, or security  guards to protect their facilities, but at high-risk locations, such as those  located in large cities, or at more critical facilities, such as computer data  centers, they implemented greater physical security protections. For  example, one insurer established minimum standards for most facilities  that included security guards, surveillance cameras, and employee badges.  In areas containing critical computer systems, however, the firm installed  tailgating alarms\u2014which are tripped if more than one person attempts to  enter based on a single employee badge\u2014and biometric devices that  ensure a single employee is never alone within the area, reducing the risk  that someone could cause a disruption without being observed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Insurers Implemented Similar Business Continuity Capabilities, Most of Which Are Designed to Recover Critical Operations within a Day", "paragraphs": ["Insurers also told us that they had implemented similar capabilities  designed to restore critical operations following potential disruptions.  First, all of the insurers we spoke with had separate computer backup  facilities designed to be capable of running critical operations that, for  almost all of the insurers, were located in different geographic areas from  their primary facility. Of the 18 insurers, 14 owned their own backup  facility, 3 had contracted with a vendor for backup space and computer  systems at the vendor\u2019s facilities, and 1 used a combination of owned and  contracted facilities. Second, at least 16 of the 18 insurers were conducting  at least some critical operations at multiple geographically dispersed  facilities, so that if one facility experienced a disruption, the other facilities  could continue those critical operations. Third, at least 13 of the insurers  had multiple, geographically dispersed customer call centers and had the  ability to immediately reroute calls to any of the call centers should one  experience a disruption. Finally, at least 11 of the insurers had the  capability for certain staff to log in to the company\u2019s computer systems  remotely, from home or other locations, should their offices become  inaccessible. Some insurers also had additional capabilities that enhanced  their ability to continue operations following a disruption. For example, 4  insurers either owned or had contracted for mobile operations vehicles  that could be driven to wherever they were needed. These trailers generally  had full computer systems, generators, and satellite communications  capabilities and could be used to conduct claims processing or other  critical operations. For example, 2 of the insurers used such vehicles to set  up temporary claim processing or customer service operations in areas  affected by Hurricane Katrina in September 2005 to provide better access  for their policyholders. Figure 1 shows an example of one such vehicle.", "Most of the insurers told us that they were capable of recovering what they  considered to be their most critical operations within 1 day, and recover  most other operations within 3 days (see fig. 2). The type of operations  considered to be most critical varied somewhat by the type of insurer. All  of the health insurers considered customer service functions, including  customer call centers and services required to receive medical care, to be  one of their highest priorities, and 4 of the 5 health insurers we spoke with  said they could restore such operations within 24 hours. All of the  property/casualty and life insurers we spoke with considered their  investment management functions one of their highest priorities, with all 6  of the life insurers and 6 of the 7 property/casualty insurers telling us they  could restore such operations within 24 hours. Claims-processing  operations were considered to be of highest priority by 3 of the 5 health  insurers, 3 of the 7 property/casualty insurers, and none of the 6 life  insurers. For a number of the insurers, the relatively low priority given to  claims-processing operations was reflected in longer recovery time  objectives. For example, while all 6 life insurers told us they could restore  their investment management functions within 24 hours, only 2 could  restore their claims-processing operations that quickly. The remaining 4  insurers needed 2 to 4 days. Similarly, while 6 of 7 property/casualty  insurers said they could restore their investment management functions  within 24 hours, only 3 said they could restore claims-processing  operations as quickly. The remaining 4 insurers could restore such  operations within 2 or 3 days. As noted earlier in this report, insurers often  set their recovery time objectives based on the length of delay tolerable to  their customers; thus, while a number of insurers have longer recovery  objectives for claims operations, they believe such objectives will still  adequately meet their customers needs.", "Insurers indicated that they were also taking steps to help ensure the  resiliency of their telecommunications capabilities and reduce the risk of a  disruption to their ability to communicate and transfer data. As we have  noted in a previous report, the September 2001 terrorist attacks highlighted  the critical importance of resilient telecommunications services, as the  resulting damage disrupted service to thousands of business and  residences. We also described some of the difficulties of ensuring that  telecommunications services can withstand the effects of disruptions, as  well as actions taken by organizations to enhance the resiliency of their  telecommunications systems, such as using diversely routed lines and  circuits. All of the insurers we spoke with were also taking actions to  address their need for telecommunications resiliency. Most of the insurers  did so by purchasing services from multiple telecommunications carriers  and obtaining contractual provisions that required carriers to ensure  diverse routing of the insurer\u2019s lines. One of the insurers that did not use  multiple carriers had paid to have its own private optical lines laid in a  trench between its primary and backup data centers and planned on using  these lines if normal telecommunications capabilities were disrupted.

Penetration testing, which was  generally done by external consultants, usually involved trying to break  into the insurer\u2019s information systems, just as an external hacker might do.  A few insurers also gave the consultants the same level of computer access  as a typical employee in order to test company protections against internal  employees gaining access to systems or data for which they did not have  access privileges.

Many insurers conducted scenario- based exercises that simulated particular events, such as power or  telecommunications disruptions, and two insurers conducted surprise  recovery tests that required certain units or facilities to activate their  continuity plans with no warning. Further, some insurers had their data  centers connected in such a way that they tested their recovery capabilities  daily.

The most commonly outsourced function  was software application development, with about half of the insurers  outsourcing some work in this area and most of those using overseas  vendors. Four of the insurers had outsourced part or all of their data  centers\u2019 backup functions, and three had outsourced some portion of their  claims-processing operations. In order to help ensure that information  shared with vendors was safeguarded and that any backup arrangements  with vendors functioned properly, all of the insurers monitored their  outsourced functions to some extent. Most of the insurers required their  vendors to adhere to certain information security or business continuity  standards, had obtained contractual rights to audit certain aspects of  vendors\u2019 operations, and had reviewed audit reports on the vendors\u2019  operations, such as Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) 70 reports. For  example, several insurers said that they required vendors to work only on  computer systems owned and maintained by the insurer or to separate the  computer systems they used to do work for the insurer from other  computer systems.

Only two of five the state regulators we  spoke with appeared aware of any guidance from their state regarding their  business continuity capabilities. And while we did not find any laws in any  of the five states requiring state agencies to have business continuity plans,  the governor of one state had issued an order requiring all state agencies to  have continuity of operations plans, and subsequent to our visit in another  state, that state established a policy requiring all state agencies to have a  business continuity plan. In addition, all of the states appeared to have an  office within the state responsible for coordinating the state\u2019s response  during an emergency as well as helping state agencies with their recovery  plans or capabilities. In the absence of specific state requirements for the  business continuity plans of state insurance regulators, we compared what  the regulators had in place with guidance issued by the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA) to federal executive branch agencies for use  in developing contingency plans and programs for continuity of  government operations. The guidance states that continuity of operations  planning is simply a good business practice and part of the fundamental  mission of agencies as responsible and reliable public institutions. The  guidance states that all such plans should provide procedures for  conducting operations and administration at alternate operating facilities,  and that such facilities should have all computer equipment, software, and  other automated data processing equipment necessary to carry out  essential functions.", "Most of the state insurance regulators we spoke with indicated that they  had business continuity plans in place to guide their actions during a  potential disruption. Specifically, all of the state regulators had procedures  in place to back up critical data, most had plans for how they would  operate if their primary facilities were inaccessible, and most had backup  computer systems. Despite these precautions, we found that some  insurance regulators had not developed certain key components of a  business continuity plan. For example, two did not have backup computer  capabilities that could be used if their primary computer systems  experienced a disruption. Officials at one state regulator said that it was  the state\u2019s responsibility to provide such backup systems, and although  such capabilities had been promised several years ago, they had yet to be  put in place. In addition, two of the state regulators\u2014including one of the  regulators that had no backup computer capabilities\u2014had no plans for  what actions they would take, or how they would conduct critical  operations, if their primary offices were inaccessible.

First, by servicing as a repository for much  of the states\u2019 critical data, including insurer financial data as well as insurer  licensing and market regulatory information, NAIC acts as a backup for  critical data also possessed by state regulators. Second, NAIC can provide  some resources to assist state regulators in the event that a disaster or  other disruption affects regulators\u2019 ability to conduct business.

To review NAIC\u2019s information security capabilities, we  also compared NAIC\u2019s practices with information security guidance  developed for federal agencies in the Federal Information System  Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM) and recommended security controls  published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. To  review NAIC\u2019s physical security capabilities, we used standards developed  by the Department of Justice for federal facilities.

NAIC implemented numerous information security controls to  help protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its systems and  information. For example, it required the use of passwords, user IDs, and  personal identification numbers to access systems. NAIC also installed  devices or software designed to detect intrusions or attempts to gain  unauthorized access to their networks and systems and developed  appropriate procedures for responding to information security intrusion  attempts or incidents. In addition, NAIC established and maintained a  security awareness and training program for its personnel and others  having access to their systems and networks. Furthermore, NAIC staff  periodically tested and assessed the effectiveness of its controls and  overall vulnerability of its computer environment. However, it has not had  an independent organization test its controls or overall computer  vulnerability since 2002. Information security literature suggests that an  independent organization, on an annual or biannual basis, should test  security controls and the overall vulnerability of an organization\u2019s  computer environment. The lack of independent testing does not give NAIC  an objective evaluation of its security controls and overall computer  environment vulnerability. NAIC, however, has budgeted funds for  independent testing purposes in 2006. NAIC also took steps to protect its  primary facility from a physical attack. For example, it monitors the  exterior and interior of this facility with closed circuit televisions, requires  employees and visitors to display identification while on the premises, and  limits access to sensitive areas such as computer areas and  telecommunication closets.", "NAIC had also implemented business continuity capabilities designed to  allow it to recover critical operations within 24 hours of a disruption\u2014even  the total destruction of its primary facility. NAIC\u2019s current capabilities  include a backup computer data center\u2014located off-site within a vendor\u2019s  facility\u2014to which critical data is copied many times a day, allowing NAIC  to restore operations at the center within several hours. The backup center  has work space for six NAIC staff, is on a separate power grid from their  primary facility, and is connected to the primary facility via redundant  telecommunications lines. In addition, NAIC staff can connect to both the  primary and backup sites from remote locations via a telephone line  connection. NAIC\u2019s business continuity capabilities also include backup  power generators at its primary facility and cross-training for staff to help  ensure the availability of critical skills in the event that some staff are  incapacitated. Finally, the systems used by NAIC\u2019s Securities Valuation  Office can be run out of either NAIC\u2019s primary or backup computer data  centers.", "NAIC told us they have tested its business continuity capabilities in several  ways. First, NAIC tests its entire business continuity plan annually. Second,  NAIC tests its backup power capabilities at its primary facility quarterly by  shutting down the main power systems and switching over to its backup  generators. Third, NAIC conducts an annual audit of both on-site and off- site backup procedures and includes a risk assessment of NAIC\u2019s computer  data center. In an actual recovery situation, NAIC was forced to restore the  operations of its Securities Valuation Office when the September 11, 2001,  terrorist attacks destroyed that facility.

In addition, HIPAA requires the Secretary of Health and Human  Services to adopt standards for the electronic exchange, privacy, and  security of health information. The regulations that govern these laws  outline general security and recovery guidance that insurers must address.  But these laws and regulations do not outline specific information security  and business continuity protections or minimum requirements to serve  customers. For example, the regulations do not require insurers to take  specific actions to protect or recover the financial management systems  that ensure claims payment in a timely manner.", "State regulators we visited examine insurers\u2019 business continuity  programs, but only when reviewing internal controls over the information  systems critical for insurers\u2019 financial solvency. In addition, these states do  not require that insurers meet minimum recovery standards. The  placement of business continuity within the context of the overall financial  solvency exam poses a potential disconnect between regulators\u2019 concern  over insurers\u2019 recovery capability and where business continuity fits in the  state exam process. For example, regulators told us that business  continuity is an important issue and that making sure insurers can recover  the ability to service policyholders, particularly the processing and  payment of claims, following a disruption, is of concern to regulators.  However, within the financial solvency exam, state regulators review  business continuity as a part of their review of information system  controls, which may not result in business continuity getting the warranted  attention. In contrast, examination guidelines used by federal financial  regulators, published by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination  Council (FFIEC), contain a separate examination handbook devoted to  business continuity planning. In addition, although state insurance  regulators had informal expectations that insurers recover certain critical  operations, especially claims processing, within two days of a disruption,  examination guidelines do not call for examiners to review insurers\u2019 ability  to meet certain recovery time objectives. As a result, a potential disparity  exists between what regulators expect, and know, regarding insurers\u2019  recovery capabilities and those insurers\u2019 actual capabilities. For example, 9  of the 18 insurers had a goal of recovering their claims- processing  operations within 3 or more days, which is beyond regulators\u2019 informal  expectations.", "On the other hand, the lack of specific recovery time objectives in the  insurance sector is similar to the situation for most other financial sector  organizations. For example, with the exception of the most critical  organizations in the securities markets, many financial services  organizations are not required to meet specific recovery time objectives for  key operational and information systems. Critical organizations in  securities markets\u2014those that are unique, provide centralized functions, or  have single points of failure\u2014are required to recover within several hours,  but organizations such as broker-dealers are not required to meet specific  recovery times. Banks are required to meet certain criteria for developing  and testing business continuity plans, but not specific recovery times.", "Financial solvency examinations review the accuracy and soundness of  insurers\u2019 financial information and seek to protect the public by making  sure insurers maintain a financial position sufficient to stay in business and  meet customer needs. As part of the exam, regulators review insurers\u2019  business continuity efforts by sending insurers a series of questions from  NAIC\u2019s Information Systems Questionnaire (ISQ), which insurers answer  prior to the exam. The questions generally ask whether insurers\u2019 business  continuity plans prioritize and cover all critical systems, provide for  backup computer operations, and ensure that plan components have been  tested and remain current. Examiners review the answers and then obtain  documentation during the exam to verify insurers\u2019 responses. Often, state  examiners will also seek other company files or records or conduct tests of  their own to verify responses.

In addition,  while regulators have informal expectations for how soon after a  disruption insurers should be able to recover certain critical operations,  such as claims processing, the examination process does not require  examiners to determine whether insurers can meet these informal  expectations.

According to a number of insurers and regulators  we spoke with, insurers are increasingly outsourcing certain business  functions, including information technology operations. While insurance  regulators seek to hold outsourced functions to the same standards as  those performed by insurers, examining these arrangements is generally  limited to reviewing documentation on insurers\u2019 outsourcing arrangements  and, at least among the regulators we spoke with, rarely involves on-site  work at vendor locations.

For the purposes of our analysis, we  selected large insurers by determining those with the highest total revenue  in 2003 in each of the life, health, and property/casualty lines of insurance.  The combined 2003 revenue of the life and health insurers in our sample  represented approximately 44 percent of the 2003 revenue of all such  insurers, while the combined 2003 revenue of the property/casualty  insurers represented approximately 37 percent of the 2003 revenue of all  such insurers. We selected state insurance regulators according to the  states where those 18 insurers were located.", "To determine what actions insurers, state regulators, and NAIC had taken  to protect against and recover from business disruptions, we interviewed  insurers, state regulators, and NAIC officials to ask what protective actions  they had taken in the areas of physical security and information security.

In  assessing the organizations\u2019 capabilities in these areas, we used criteria  that were either established by regulators or were generally accepted by  government or industry. As part of our work to assess actions taken by  state regulators, we reviewed a sample of examination workpapers from  each of the state regulators with whom we spoke. We attempted to review  examinations of the insurers we spoke with, but were unable to do so in all  cases.
