This report examines the extent to which  VA has taken steps to ensure that (1) researchers and universities  disclose inventions and (2) universities have reported information to VA  about commercialization activities for joint inventions.", "For both objectives, we reviewed documents provided by VA, affiliated  universities, and a VA advisory committee. These included documents on  the history of VA\u2019s technology transfer program; technology transfer  policies and procedures; and documents outlining challenges faced in  implementing the program and recent efforts to address these challenges.  We also examined relevant statutes and regulations. We compared VA\u2019s  procedures, policies, and internal and external communications to federal  internal control standards for control activities and information and  communication. We also interviewed officials from the VA technology  transfer office and the VA Office of the General Counsel; officials selected  through a nonprobability sample of six VA medical centers and their  affiliated universities; and two of the three members of a subcommittee of  the National Research Advisory Council that submitted a report to VA on  the department\u2019s technology transfer program in fiscal year 2017. We  conducted site visits at five of the six VA medical centers\u2014Atlanta,  Georgia; Baltimore, Maryland; Palo Alto and San Francisco, California;  and Salt Lake City, Utah\u2014for interviews with researchers who were  inventors and with the Associate Chiefs of Staff for Research at each  medical center, to whom we refer as the research administrators.

In  addition, we conducted telephone interviews with researchers and the  research administrator at the sixth VA medical center in Cleveland, Ohio,  and officials of the university affiliated with it, Case Western Reserve  University. We selected the medical centers and their respective  university affiliates based on high levels of license activity or backlogs of  disclosures, among other factors. The results of these interviews are not  generalizable to all VA medical centers and their affiliated universities but  provide illustrative examples.", "The VA technology transfer program is affiliated with 79 universities and  has agreements in place with all but three of these. VA began negotiating  these, which we refer to as original agreements, soon after the creation of  the VA technology transfer program in 2000. Beginning in fiscal year  2015, VA initiated a new type of agreement establishing new provisions  for VA, which we will refer to as new agreements. We reviewed original  agreements for five of the six universities in our sample. One of the  universities in our sample, Emory University, did not have an agreement  with VA as of January 2018. We also reviewed a nonprobability sample  of an additional three original agreements with other universities based on  their licensing and commercialization activities, for a total of eight original  agreements. In addition to the original agreements, we also reviewed the  first eight new agreements that VA negotiated with universities. In total,  we reviewed 16 agreements\u2014the 8 original agreements and 8 new ones  to determine whether they contained requirements for disclosure and  reporting to VA.", "For objective two, we requested and reviewed annual reports from VA for  the eight universities whose original technology transfer agreements we  reviewed. The annual reports VA provided were those the eight  universities submitted to VA in 2016 and 2017, covering technology  transfer activities, for a total of 12 reports.

Since the early 1980s, the  federal government has taken several actions related to technology  transfer from federal laboratories.", "Technology transfer is the process of transferring scientific findings from  one organization to another for the purpose of further development and  commercialization. In this regard, federal agencies are authorized to issue  licenses to outside entities granting rights to make, use, or sell  government owned inventions. One of the first technology transfer laws,  the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, articulated the  need for a strong national policy supporting domestic technology transfer.  The law requires federal laboratories to establish an office of research  and technology applications and devote budget and personnel resources  to promoting technology cooperation and the transfer of technologies to  private industry and state and local governments. In addition, the act  requires federal agencies that operate or direct federal laboratories to  report information on technology transfer performance annually to the  Office of Management and Budget, as part of their annual budget  submission. Copies of those reports should be transmitted to the  Secretary of Commerce who must submit a summary report to Congress  and the President.", "For many years after the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of  1980, VA waived ownership rights to inventions generated by its  researchers, leaving the responsibilities for patenting, marketing, and  licensing with the inventor and the VA medical center\u2019s university partner.  As a result of this practice, according to former VA officials, some VA  research was not commercialized because VA did not have a technology  transfer program or other means to promote commercialization.", "In 2000, VA created the VA Technology Transfer Program to facilitate the  commercialization of VA inventions to benefit veterans and the American  public. VA developed technology transfer agreements with universities to  help facilitate technology transfer. Under the terms of the agreements, the  universities can take the lead on patenting and commercialization, and  VA can retain joint ownership of inventions. Among other things, the  original agreements gave the universities the right of first refusal to apply  for and manage patents, market the technologies, negotiate licenses, and  collect royalties to be shared with VA.", "As of November 2017, the VA Technology Transfer Office, located in  Washington, D.C., employed five technology transfer specialists  responsible for all technology transfer activities for VA\u2019s solely owned  inventions. These inventions may come from more than 3,000 VA  researchers at over 100 VA medical centers, as well as from VA  employees at other VA locations. In addition, the technology transfer  specialists are responsible for coordinating with universities on inventions  made by dually appointed researchers. According to VA officials, VA  relies on affiliated universities for most of the technology transfer efforts  connected with such inventions, since the universities have their own  offices with expertise in technology transfer and are usually willing to take  the lead.", "Under a Veterans Health Administration 2002 policy on invention  disclosures, which was revised in January 2017, VA employees who  invent something are directed to disclose those inventions to VA using a  disclosure form and complete a certification form to certify whether VA  resources were used. VA employees are to disclose inventions to VA  even if they were not created with VA resources. Affiliated universities  may also require dually appointed researchers to disclose inventions to  the university. Under agreements between the universities and VA,  universities are required to disclose a dually appointed researcher\u2019s  invention to VA, as an additional assurance to aid VA in capturing  relevant inventions. Similarly, VA is to notify the university when a dually  appointed researcher\u2019s invention comes to its attention.", "According to VA policy, researchers\u2019 supervisors or research  administrators at VA medical centers are to review the disclosure forms  and send them to the VA Technology Transfer Office. The office  evaluates the information and provides a recommendation to VA\u2019s  General Counsel on whether VA should assert ownership. If General  Counsel\u2019s review finds that VA should assert ownership, the General  Counsel notifies the VA researcher\u2019s and the VA medical center\u2019s  research and development office of the determination. The Technology  Transfer Office then notifies the researcher\u2019s university about VA\u2019s  ownership of the invention. At this point the department expects the  university to include VA as an owner during the patenting process,  according to VA officials. Figure 1 shows VA\u2019s process for determining  ownership of inventions created by dually appointed researchers,  according to VA policies.", "If the university takes the lead on an invention of a dually appointed  researcher, original VA agreements require universities to provide annual  reports to update VA on commercialization activities, such as progress in  licensing inventions or collecting royalties from licensees. While less  commonly used, alternative processes for commercialization are shown in  appendix I.", "We and others have identified a number of challenges associated with  technology transfer from federal research facilities. For example, we  found that technology transfer is often not a priority for laboratory  managers; researchers may not understand the potential commercial  applicability of their innovations; or the technologies are often not  developed enough for use in market-ready products and may require  investment of additional time and money to develop.

For example, in  December 2016, VA officials said that once the technology transfer office  began sending researchers e-mail notices about the need to disclose  inventions, the number of disclosures increased, which they said  suggested underreporting had been occurring. In March 2017, the  officials told us that many of the inventions from more than 50  researchers during a 5-year period at one university had not been  disclosed until VA checked with the university and discovered the error.  By November 2017, VA technology transfer officials thought disclosure  had improved throughout VA, but they were still not able to describe the  extent of the problem.", "The researchers we interviewed at the six medical centers in our sample  generally believed that they had properly disclosed inventions. However,  according to VA officials, a university official, and two VA researchers,  there could be several reasons that contributed to researchers not  consistently disclosing their inventions to VA, including the following:", "Researchers may have disclosed inventions to their university,  assuming the university would disclose them to VA on their behalf.", "Researchers may have disclosed their inventions to the university  because it was more convenient than disclosing to VA, as the  university\u2019s technology transfer officials were more accessible to  answer questions.", "Researchers were not familiar with VA\u2019s invention disclosure process  because the process was not routine to them.", "Researchers may have believed they did not use VA resources and  did not realize they were still required to disclose to VA.", "VA research administrators may not always have reminded  researchers of the need to disclose inventions, as they did not  consider this requirement a priority.", "VA made efforts since fiscal year 2016 to inform researchers about its  disclosure policy. For example, according to VA officials, the department  has increased its in-person communication with VA researchers. In the  first 8 months of fiscal year 2017, VA staff made 26 visits to universities  and VA medical centers to meet with researchers to encourage the  disclosure of inventions. However, VA officials said participation rates  among researchers at these voluntary meetings were low in some cases.  At one medical center, only the research administrator and one other  researcher attended the meeting, according to the administrator.", "In addition, VA established an online training program in 2017 covering  the invention disclosure process, but the training is not mandatory. VA  provided us with a report from October 2017 indicating that out of over  3,000 eligible researchers, 130 had taken the training (about 4 percent).  One VA research administrator said that mandatory training would be  helpful. Under federal internal control standards, management is to  internally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the  entity\u2019s objectives, such as by communicating that information down and  across reporting lines to enable personnel to perform key roles in  achieving those objectives. Given that VA has not made the meetings or  online training on disclosure policy mandatory, its importance may not be  clear to all researchers. Also, because researchers do not make  discoveries every year, and the process is not routine, taking such  training once may not be sufficient to educate users. Without requiring  researchers to take online training on the invention disclosure process  annually, researchers may not be fully informed about the requirement to  disclose inventions, which can result in lost technology transfer  opportunities and lost royalties for VA if the inventions are not disclosed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Has Taken Steps to Make Universities Aware of VA Researchers and Disclosure Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Based on our interviews with VA and university officials in our sample,  since fiscal year 2016, the department took steps to make universities  aware of VA researchers and their disclosure requirements in an effort to  improve university disclosures to VA. We reviewed 16 agreements  between VA and affiliated universities, including the five universities with  agreements in our sample, and all of the universities agreed to disclose  joint inventions to the department. However, VA officials we interviewed  said that universities may not always disclose all inventions to VA.  Although they said they could not identify the extent of the problem, the  officials highlighted one university in our sample that had not disclosed  inventions to VA for at least 5 years. This university did not disclose  inventions to VA, as agreed, until prompted by VA\u2019s technology transfer  office late in fiscal year 2016. Responsible university officials said they  had assumed the dually appointed researchers were disclosing the  inventions to VA. According to VA officials, when the VA technology  transfer office received a report from the university in fiscal year 2017 that  covered 5 years of disclosures, VA learned it had not received 80 percent  of the disclosures from that university for that period. VA officials said  they had not contacted the university sooner because their technology  transfer office had been understaffed until early in calendar year 2016. VA  officials from the technology transfer office had not identified a similar  problem of this magnitude with the other universities, including those in  our sample.", "According to our interviews with VA and university officials, some of VA\u2019s  university partners may not have been aware of which researchers were  also VA employees because the universities\u2019 lists of VA researchers were  not current and universities generally relied on the researchers to disclose  whether they were VA employees. Furthermore, in some cases, the  university disclosure forms did not specifically ask whether the researcher  also worked at VA. For example, two of the six forms used by universities  in our sample did not specifically ask the researcher to indicate whether  they were VA employees. Upon recognizing some shortcomings in  universities\u2019 disclosures to VA, the department provided current lists of  VA researchers at affiliated VA medical centers to their respective  universities in fiscal year 2017, and VA technology transfer officials said  they intend to provide such updated lists to the universities semi-annually.  VA officials said that universities may not be using these lists, but they will  not know until time has elapsed.

Under the original  agreements, such as the ones in our sample of eight agreements,  universities have the exclusive right to license and commercialize joint  inventions. VA\u2019s awareness of the commercialization of such inventions  depends on universities providing this information through annual reports,  as required by the agreements. However, according to VA officials, prior  to 2011, only about 20 percent of the 79 universities with which VA has  agreements submitted annual reports. According to VA officials, VA made  an effort to increase annual reporting, and by 2013 it was up to 80  percent. The officials said, however, that the percentage of universities  submitting annual reports dropped again after losing staff in the  technology transfer office\u2014the office retained only three staff in  subsequent years until fiscal year 2017 when there were 11 staff,  including 5 technology transfer specialists.", "In addition, VA officials we interviewed said that there was some  confusion among universities regarding when they needed to submit  annual reports. For example, they said that some universities may not  have understood whether they needed to provide annual reports during  years when there was no new patenting or licensing activity. The officials  said that this was at least part of the reason some universities did not  submit annual reports. VA officials told us that they expect universities to  provide annual reports even when there is no new patenting or licensing  activity, and in fiscal year 2016 technology transfer officials e-mailed  universities to clarify this expectation. The officials also said that in  October 2016 they sent a letter to each of the 79 universities with which  the department has agreements to remind universities to submit the  required annual reports. Further, as stated earlier, VA staff made 26 visits  to VA medical centers and universities in the first 8 months of fiscal year  2017 to discuss reporting and disclosure requirements. However, VA  reported that 24 percent of the 79 affiliated universities provided annual  reports in fiscal year 2017 even after VA\u2019s outreach. Because they did not  always receive annual reports, VA officials said they were often not aware  of a joint license until the university sent VA the first royalty check for a  joint invention. VA officials said they plan to conduct audits to check the  accuracy of university information.", "Beginning in fiscal year 2015, VA began creating new agreements with  universities to give VA enhanced responsibility in licensing and  commercialization of joint inventions. By the end of fiscal year 2017, VA  had new agreements in place with 11 of the 79 universities. Based on our  review of 8 of the new agreements, VA will now, for the first time, have  the option to take the lead in licensing joint inventions. For inventions for  which VA does not take the lead role, under the new agreements, it will  have the right to review and provide input on all joint licenses. This new  provision improves VA\u2019s awareness of any joint licenses created in the  future. However, because original agreements did not include this  provision, VA will still need to rely on accurate and updated annual  reports from universities for information on licenses negotiated under  those agreements.", "In addition, the new agreements do not improve or clarify language from  the original agreements about what details need to be included in the  annual reports. According to our analysis, these eight new agreements,  similar to the original eight agreements we reviewed, do not contain  details on the specific information and format in which to present the  annual report. For example, both the original and four of the new  agreements we reviewed require universities to provide an annual  report, but four other new agreements state that the universities will  provide annual reports upon request. The original agreements as well as  all eight of the new agreements indicate that reports should include the  status of all patent prosecution, commercial development, and licensing  activity on joint inventions but do not explain whether an annual report is  needed if there has been no commercialization activity. As noted above,  VA officials said universities were confused about whether they were  required to report to VA if they had no new activity in a given period;  however, VA officials told us they still need reports in these situations.", "Furthermore, based on our analysis of 12 annual reports from eight  universities, the format and content of the reports has been inconsistent.  Four universities submitted reports in a spreadsheet format; two  universities submitted reports in portable document format (PDF); one  university submitted a report in a Word format; and one submitted five  different documents, including both PDF and spreadsheet. In addition to  differences in format, the annual reports differed considerably in the  content they provided\u2014the more detailed annual reports included patent  application numbers, patent expenses, the status of patent applications,  and information about whether the patent had been licensed. In contrast,  the less detailed annual reports did not provide any of this information on  patents for the joint inventions. Moreover, one university only included  active license agreements in its annual report, while other universities  also included license agreements that were terminated. VA officials we  interviewed agreed that the reports are not very detailed or standardized  but said they would like to eventually standardize the annual report format  and content so they can use the reports to track and audit joint inventions  The differences in annual reports exist because VA has not provided the  universities with a standardized method for reporting, including the format  that should be used for the annual reports and the content to include in  them. Under federal standards for internal control, management should  design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks. Such  control activities include providing a standardized method that guides  universities in fulfilling VA\u2019s reporting requirements to ensure the  objectives of the program are being achieved. Without providing a  standardized method that clearly guides universities in fulfilling VA\u2019s  reporting requirements for these annual reports, including their format and  content, the department will not be able to ensure detailed and  standardized annual reports that include details about licenses and  royalties. VA officials said that they were working on a template for  universities to use in reporting on commercialization activities for joint  inventions.
