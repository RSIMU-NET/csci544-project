However, GAO previously reported that some VAMCs have struggled to manage the program's workload. The VA MISSION Act of 2018 requires the expansion of program eligibility to veterans of all eras contingent upon implementation and certification of a new IT system.", "The VA MISSION Act included a provision for GAO to review VA's efforts to implement a new IT system. GAO was also asked to examine staffing for the program. This report examines the extent to which VA 1) has established staffing requirements and has data to track program staffing; 2) monitors whether VAMCs are meeting departmental requirements for application review timeliness and required contacts; and 3) has implemented an IT system that fully supports the program. GAO reviewed program documentation and data. GAO also interviewed VHA officials and officials from four VAMCs and their VISNs that varied in their numbers of applications and approved caregivers. GAO also interviewed OIT officials and reviewed documentation related to their efforts to acquire and develop an IT system for the program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has established staffing requirements for its Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (Family Caregiver Program) that allow for variation, but its staffing data are not complete or accurate. VHA requires its local VA medical centers (VAMC) to have at least one Caregiver Support Coordinator to manage the program. Otherwise, VAMCs have flexibility in determining the additional staff needed. VHA's Caregiver Support Program Office funds most Family Caregiver Program staff at VAMCs. VAMCs also may fund additional program staff or have other VAMC staff assist the program as a collateral duty, but GAO found that the program office only tracks the staff it has funded. GAO also identified discrepancies between the number of staff it observed at selected VAMCs and the program office's staffing data. Without complete and accurate staffing data, the program office does not have reliable information about the program's current staffing levels, which could hamper its efforts to project needed staff when the program's eligibility is expanded.", "The program office routinely monitors VAMCs' performance in meeting departmental timeliness requirements for reviewing enrollment applications for the Family Caregiver Program. However, it is not able to monitor whether VAMCs are completing required quarterly contacts and annual home visits to enrolled caregivers and veterans. The Family Caregiver Program's current information technology (IT) system\u2014the Caregiver Application Tracker (CAT)\u2014has limited reporting capabilities and cannot provide system-wide data on the completion of these contacts and visits even though this information is documented in CAT. GAO found that some VAMCs and the regional Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) that oversee them use spreadsheets to track the completion of these requirements, but the program office does not collect these data. Without system-wide data on contacts and visits, the program office is limited in its ability to monitor and identify when VAMCs may need additional staff to meet these requirements, including once the program's eligibility is expanded.", "VA has yet to implement a new IT system that fully supports the Family Caregiver Program as required by the VA MISSION Act. VHA and the Office of Information and Technology (OIT) have been working jointly on projects since 2015 to improve and replace CAT. However, two of these projects were terminated without delivering viable software improvements or a replacement system. According to two independent assessments, these prior efforts lacked both effective leadership and implementation of the processes needed for requirements management. VA has asserted that its third project, in which OIT and VHA have begun to acquire and implement a commercial product to replace CAT, will take steps to avoid the issues that have impacted its past efforts. However, the initial replacement for CAT is not expected until late October 2019. Further, despite this initial deployment and additional releases expected through the summer of 2020, the department has not yet fully committed to a date by which it will certify that the new IT system fully supports the program. Until the system is implemented and certified, the expansion of eligibility for the Family Caregiver Program will be delayed."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations to VA to collect complete staffing data, establish a process to ensure the data are accurate, and establish an interim method for collecting system-wide data on required contacts and visits.

Family  caregivers typically assist veterans with tasks of everyday living, like  bathing and eating, as well as making and keeping appointments and  making medical, legal, or financial decisions. The assistance that family  caregivers provide can enable veterans to achieve a better quality of life  and contribute to their rehabilitation and recovery. However, while these  caregivers enable seriously injured veterans to continue living in their  homes rather than institutions, caregivers may encounter financial  difficulties due to lost income, and caregiving activities can take a toll on  their physical and emotional health.", "To provide greater support for caregivers of post-9/11 veterans, the  Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 required  the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to establish a program to assist  these caregivers with caring for seriously injured veterans. In May 2011,  the Veterans Health Administration (VHA)\u2014which operates VA\u2019s health  care system\u2014implemented the Caregiver Support Program, which  included the establishment of the Program of Comprehensive Assistance  for Family Caregivers (Family Caregiver Program) at each of its VA  medical centers (VAMC) across the United States. In accordance with  applicable requirements, the program provides approved primary  caregivers with a monthly financial stipend based on the level of caregiver  support that the veteran needs. The program also offers other types of  assistance to caregivers, including training, referral services, counseling,  some mental health services, and respite care, among others. As of  September 30, 2018, an estimated 19,690 caregivers of post-9/11  veterans were enrolled in the Family Caregiver Program.", "In 2014, we reported that VHA had experienced difficulties with  implementing the program because it had significantly underestimated the  number of caregivers who would apply for and be eligible to enroll in the  program. Specifically, we found that VAMCs had insufficient staff to  manage the program, and as a result, some VAMCs had difficulty  meeting the department\u2019s timeliness requirements for reviewing  applications and making all required contacts with enrolled veterans and  their caregivers. We also reported that VHA\u2019s ability to use the program\u2019s  information technology (IT) system, the Caregiver Application Tracker  (CAT), for tasks beyond tracking the status of applications was difficult  and time-consuming, limiting VHA\u2019s capability to monitor the program. We  recommended, among other things, that VA implement an IT system that  would support the Family Caregiver Program and enable officials to  comprehensively monitor the program. As of July 2019, this  recommendation had not been implemented. Since 2015, VA\u2019s Office of  Information and Technology (OIT) and VHA\u2019s Caregiver Support Program  Office have jointly worked to acquire new IT system capabilities to replace  CAT.", "The population of caregivers enrolled in the Family Caregiver Program is  expected to increase with the future expansion of program eligibility. The  VA MISSION Act of 2018, enacted in June 2018, requires the expansion  of Family Caregiver Program eligibility to include caregivers of veterans  who served prior to September 11, 2001. However, before the expansion  of eligibility can occur, the VA MISSION Act requires VA to implement an  IT system for the program, and the VA Secretary must certify to Congress  that the new system will fully support the Family Caregiver Program by  allowing for data assessment and comprehensive monitoring by October  1, 2019.", "We were asked to review issues related to VHA\u2019s staffing of the Family  Caregiver Program.

VHA has established staffing requirements for the Family Caregiver  Program and has data to track program staffing at VAMCs;  2.  VHA monitors whether VAMCs are meeting departmental  requirements for the timeliness of application reviews and for contacts  with caregivers and veterans for the Family Caregiver Program; and  3.

We interviewed VHA officials from the  Caregiver Support Program Office, which sets policy for the Family Caregiver Program. We also reviewed VHA staffing data for the positions  that the Caregiver Support Program Office funded at all VAMCs for fiscal  years 2016, 2017, 2018, and the first quarter of 2019, the most recent  period for which data were available. We determined that these were the  only staffing data available, and while they were suitable for the purposes  of site selection, they also have limitations, which we discuss in the  report. We visited four selected VAMCs to discuss their staffing and  workload for the Family Caregiver Program. We also interviewed lead  officials for the Family Caregiver Program from each Veterans Integrated  Service Network (VISN) associated with the four selected VAMCs, to  discuss their roles as well as program staffing within the VISNs. We  selected VAMCs with varying program sizes and workloads based on 1)  the number of applications received from fiscal year 2016 through fiscal  year 2018 (as of September 4, 2018); 2) the number of caregivers  enrolled as of June 1, 2018; and 3) the number and types of caregiver  support coordinators (CSCs), who administer the program at VAMCs, as  of fiscal year 2018. The VAMCs we selected were Altoona,  Pennsylvania (VISN 4); Augusta, Georgia (VISN 7); Orlando, Florida  (VISN 8); and Chicago, Illinois (VISN 12). For the four VAMCs we visited,  we identified the program\u2019s staffing levels and compared this information  to the Caregiver Support Program Office\u2019s staffing data for these facilities.  We also interviewed CSCs and other program staff as well as staff who  assist the program as a collateral duty. The information we obtained from  the selected VAMCs and VISNs cannot be generalized.

We also reviewed Family Caregiver Program data  from fiscal year 2018, to the extent it was available from CAT, on the  timeliness with which VAMCs process applications for the Family  Caregiver program and the extent to which VAMC staff met departmental  requirements for contacting caregivers and veterans on a quarterly basis  and making annual home visits. We reviewed documentation and  interviewed officials about the application processing data from CAT and  determined that it was reliable for the purposes of our engagement.  However, we could not obtain system-wide data on required contacts and  visits with caregivers and veterans from CAT, which we discuss in the  report. We interviewed officials from VHA\u2019s Caregiver Support Program  Office about their monitoring of Family Caregiver Program requirements,  including the types of data they use for this purpose. Further, to  understand how officials at VAMCs are meeting program requirements,  we interviewed leadership and staff associated with the Family Caregiver  Program at the four VAMCs we visited. We also interviewed the officials  who serve as VISN lead officials for the VAMCs we visited.

Furthermore, officials could  not readily provide these data for the four VAMCs we visited because  doing so would have required them to manually review each veteran\u2019s  record (921 records across the four VAMCs).", "Given CAT\u2019s reporting limitations, some VAMC and VISN lead officials we  spoke with indicated that they have developed their own methods for  tracking contacts and visits at the facility or regional levels. For example,  officials at one VAMC told us they had developed a spreadsheet for the  purpose of tracking quarterly contacts and annual home visits. Further,  the VISN lead officials from one VISN told us that their VAMCs report  information on their ability to schedule and complete contacts and visits  on a monthly basis. The program office does not collect these data from  the VAMCs or VISNs.", "The Caregiver Support Program Office has been able to collect limited  information on the extent to which quarterly contacts and annual home  visits are completed through 1) bi-annual audits of a sample of Family  Caregiver Program participant records that are rolled into in an annual  report and 2) site visits to select VAMCs. Caregiver Support Program  Office officials told us that the audits of program participants\u2019 records  serve as their main source of information on the completion of required  contacts and visits. However, the focus of the audits vary each year,  which means that officials cannot monitor trends in performance over time  because the information is not comparable year-to-year. For example, in  fiscal years 2017 and 2018, the focus was on the records of caregivers  and veterans who had been discharged from the program, and in fiscal  year 2016, the focus was on newly approved caregivers and veterans. In  addition, because the audits are focused on a random sample of  individual participants\u2019 records, they do not provide the Caregiver Support  Program Office with information to determine whether individual VAMCs  are meeting these requirements. Program office officials also told us that  their site visits to VAMCs include a review of the processes for required  quarterly contacts and annual home visits. As of January 2019, program  office officials had conducted 16 site visits since fiscal year 2016\u2014 representing about 11 percent of VAMCs. Caregiver Support Program  Office officials also report that they intend to develop a site visit plan as  part of MISSION Act implementation planning.", "Without system-wide data on VAMCs\u2019 monitoring efforts, the program  office does not know whether contacts and visits are being completed as  required or whether VAMCs may need more staff to conduct them. The  VAMC officials we spoke with acknowledged that their ability to complete  quarterly contacts and annual home visits was dependent upon having  enough staff. For example, one VAMC official reported that its facility did  not complete an entire quarter of contacts and visits to caregivers and  veterans because they did not have sufficient staffing resources.  Similarly, a VISN lead official said that the VAMCs in its network also  have had trouble meeting monitoring requirements due to insufficient  staff. The lack of system-wide data on VAMCs\u2019 completion of required  contacts and visits is inconsistent with federal internal control standards  that require management to use quality information to achieve their  objectives. Furthermore, without these data, the Caregiver Support  Program Office is also limited in its ability to estimate the additional staff  that will be needed to conduct these contacts and visits once the  program\u2019s eligibility expands."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA Has Yet to Implement an IT System That Fully Supports the Family Caregiver Program", "paragraphs": ["VHA and OIT have worked jointly over the last four years to both fix and  replace the existing Family Caregiver Program IT system, CAT, but these  efforts have not led to the implementation of an IT system that fully  supports the needs of the program. The VA MISSION Act included  provisions that directed the department to implement an IT system for the  Family Caregiver Program by October 1, 2018 and required certification  of the system from the VA Secretary by October 1, 2019. However, the  department reported to congressional committees in October 2018 that  meeting the system implementation deadline of the VA MISSION Act was  not feasible. Consequently, that deadline has not yet been met.", "Specifically, VHA and OIT undertook two related efforts beginning in  2015:", "CAT Rescue was initiated in July 2015 as a short-term project  intended to improve both the quality of CAT\u2019s data and the system\u2019s  reliability and security. However, schedule delays and significant  defects identified during system testing contributed to CAT Rescue\u2019s  termination in April 2018. According to OIT officials, the department  spent about $2.86 million on CAT Rescue. However, the project did  not deliver viable software improvements.", "Caregivers Tool (CareT), a companion project to CAT Rescue, was  initiated in September 2015 and was intended to produce a  replacement for CAT. The project was to develop and deliver a  replacement system with expanded capabilities, such as easier  caregiver application submission and enhanced caregiver program  analysis capabilities. However, the CareT acquisition depended on  CAT Rescue, which did not deliver the needed data improvements.  When CAT Rescue was terminated, data improvement and migration  activities that were previously part of CAT Rescue were moved to the  CareT project and contract extensions were necessary to allow more  time for system development and testing in relation to these expanded  requirements.", "Subsequently, OIT and VHA Caregiver Support Program Office  officials acknowledged that development delays and the number and  critical nature of system defects identified during user acceptance  testing had led to the VHA Caregiver Support Program Office\u2019s loss of  confidence in CareT as a viable replacement for CAT. As a result,  VA suspended the CareT acquisition in January 2019 to assess the  way forward. Ultimately, work on CareT ended in late February 2019.  According to OIT officials, the department spent about $8.11 million  on CareT between 2015 and 2019. However, no fully functioning  system replacement was delivered as intended.", "VA commissioned two independent assessments that examined issues  impacting the CAT Rescue and CareT projects. These assessments,  completed by Digital Service at VA and the MITRE Corporation in early  2019, cited a number of deficiencies that likely contributed to the  termination of CAT Rescue and impacted the ability of CareT to  successfully deliver new system capabilities. For example, the  assessments identified deficiencies in the following areas:", "Requirements management: The department did not effectively  implement a process for requirements development and prioritization.  As a result, OIT, program office staff, and the development  contractors did not have a shared understanding of how the system  was to perform. In addition, the requirements identified may have  been overly complex and insufficient to facilitate IT development.  Efforts to elaborate on the requirements over the course of the  projects were not consistent and led to delays. Further, significant  defects identified during testing were not effectively prioritized and  requirements remained unmet.", "Leadership: CAT Rescue and CareT did not have stable leadership  and experienced staff throughout the department\u2019s efforts to address  issues with the program. Specifically, there was a lack of sustained  leadership or a product owner needed to create and enforce a  technical vision across contractors and the department. Without such  leadership, there was a lack of effective governance and shared  accountability across VHA, OIT, and the development contractor.", "According to the assessments, these deficiencies, among others, have  resulted in VA\u2019s inability to successfully deliver IT improvements as  planned. We have previously reported that successfully overcoming  challenges in areas such as those identified in the independent  assessments of CAT Rescue and CareT is critical to increasing an  agency\u2019s odds for delivering an IT system acquisition.", "With the loss of confidence in CareT as a viable solution and the  subsequent results of the independent assessments, VA has redirected  its efforts for a third time and initiated a new project, referred to as the  Caregiver Record Management Application (CARMA), in March 2019.  Specifically, CARMA is focused on acquiring a solution to CAT using a  commercial product that is to be configured to fit the needs of the Family  Caregiver Program and support the program\u2019s expansion.", "The first CARMA release, planned for late October 2019, is intended to  replace CAT and improve program reporting. According to program  officials, this release is expected to include expanded capabilities needed  to develop system-wide reports on the completion of the required  quarterly contacts and annual home visits. The second release, planned  for January 2020, is intended to refine initial functionality and improve  stipend processing capabilities. Additional product releases are expected  at least through the summer of 2020 to incorporate new capabilities, such  as online application submissions for veterans and the ability to connect  to existing VA systems that manage veteran and caregiver identity and  relationship management.", "However, it is unclear what additional work may be necessary to  accommodate the expansion of the Family Caregiver Program given that  the department is only in the early stages of planning. Further, the  department has not yet established a target date for certifying CARMA.  According to OIT officials, the cost for CARMA is estimated to be between  $5.7 million and $6.3 million, but additional costs for licensing and  modifications to legacy systems are also expected.", "As of June 2019, OIT and VHA with assistance from the Digital Service at  VA had taken steps to identify key project stakeholders, estimate costs,  establish a timeline, and compile the initial set of requirements for  implementing the first release. The department had also identified a  Product Manager, who is to be responsible for coordinating efforts  between OIT and VHA. According to officials from the Digital Service at  VA, the CARMA project plans to use a better, more agile approach for  managing requirements. In addition, the staff asserted that the  department has established and filled the new Product Manager position,  which is intended to improve project leadership.", "Despite these actions, VA has not yet demonstrated results to show  whether these changes will be sufficiently effective to overcome the  issues that contributed to the failure of both CAT Rescue and CareT. It is  also not yet certain when VA will successfully implement and certify its IT  system as required by the VA MISSION Act. Further, because the  expansion of the program is contingent on the certification by the VA  Secretary that the IT system fully supports the program, continued delays  with the IT system will postpone needed assistance for caregivers and  veterans who may qualify for these benefits when eligibility requirements  are expanded. Thus, it will be important that VA ensure that the actions  taken to improve requirements management and leadership of the  CARMA project are effectively implemented in order to improve the  likelihood that the project will deliver an IT system that fully supports the  Family Caregiver Program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As VA prepares for the expansion of the Family Caregiver Program to  include caregivers of veterans who served prior to September 11, 2001, it  will be important that VA have an informed understanding of the staffing  resources needed to support the program. However, we found that VA  continues to struggle to have the information and tools needed to  effectively monitor the Family Caregiver Program. Since the Family  Caregiver Program was implemented in 2011, it has experienced  difficulties in meeting program requirements, such as for monitoring  program enrollees, potentially impacting the caregivers and veterans it is  intended to support. As both we and the VA OIG have reported,  determining and ensuring there are sufficient program staff to support the  program is one of VHA\u2019s greatest obstacles in meeting program  requirements. In particular, VHA\u2019s Caregiver Support Program Office  does not have complete and accurate staffing data with which to assess  current and future staffing levels because it is not collecting data on all  VAMC staff who support the program, and the data that are collected are  not validated. The Caregiver Support Program Office is further impeded in  its ability to assess whether VAMCs\u2019 staffing levels for the program are  adequate because it lacks system-wide data on the completion of periodic  contacts and visits with caregivers and veterans. While the new IT system  should address this issue, the program office would benefit from having  an interim method to collect this information as VA\u2019s previous efforts to fix  and replace CAT have not been successful.
