As DOD\u2019s logistics manager for consumable items, DLA is responsible for a range of complex and important DOD operations, including providing supply support, contract administration services, and technical and logistics services to all branches of the military and to civilian agencies. DLA reported in 1997 that these operations involve processing more than 20 million supply requisitions a year, which result in more than $11 billion in sales annually; managing more than 380,000 prime contracts valued at more than $950 billion and involving 24,000 contractors; and coordinating 31 million transactions involving receiving, storing, and issuing of materiel.", "Like all large businesses, DLA relies heavily on computer systems to carry out these operations. Most of these systems are vulnerable to the Year 2000 problem. The Year 2000 problem is rooted in the way dates are recorded and computed in automated information systems. For the past several decades, systems have typically used two digits to represent the year, such as \u201c97\u201d representing 1997, in order to conserve on electronic data storage and reduce operating costs. With this two-digit format, however, the year 2000 is indistinguishable from 1900, or 2001 from 1901. As a result of this ambiguity, system or application programs that use dates to perform calculations, comparisons, or sorting may generate incorrect results.", "Should DLA\u2019s computer systems fail because of the Year 2000 problem, Defense logistics operations could be affected by the incorrect processing of inventory and contracts, corrupted databases, or even massive system failures. For example, if a system is corrupted with bad data, is not compliant on time, or fails, it could result in shortages of critical items needed to sustain military operations and readiness\u2014such as food, fuel, medical supplies, clothing, spare and repair parts, and support for over 1,400 weapons systems.", "In addressing the Year 2000 problem, DLA also must consider the hundreds of computer systems that interface with, or connect to, its own systems. These systems belong to the military services, DOD components, and other federal agencies that DLA does business with, and they play a critical role in carrying out logistics services. For example, supply orders originating from the military services are filled and payments to contractors are made with the help of these interfaces. The systems that interface with DLA systems are just as vulnerable to the Year 2000 problem as DLA\u2019s own systems.", "In February 1997, we published the Year 2000 Computing Crisis: An Assessment Guide, which addresses common issues affecting most federal agencies and presents a structured approach and a checklist to aid in planning, managing, and evaluating Year 2000 programs. The guidance is consistent with DOD\u2019s Year 2000 Management Plan.

The Center, which reports to the CIO, has established a Year 2000 program office and designated a program manager. The Center has taken the following actions as part of its efforts to address the Year 2000 problem: developed a detailed Year 2000 plan; conducted a Year 2000 impact assessment, which identified the number of systems owned by DLA and the lines of code associated with those systems; estimated which mainframe, mid-tier processors, and desktop computers would still be in use by the year 2000; conducted pilot projects with DLA\u2019s major automated information systems, including SAMMS, MOCAS, Defense Integrated Subsistence Management System, and Defense Fuels Automated Management System, to assess potential Year 2000 impact on these systems; and developed Year 2000 policies, guidelines, standards, and recommendations for the agency.", "In addition, DLA has entered its mission-critical systems into the DOD\u2019s Defense Integration Support Tools (DIST) database.

This is especially critical for those agencies like DLA that are heavily dependent on system interfaces to carry out their operations. As two experts on the Year 2000 problem recently noted, \u201cToday\u2019s businesses and government agencies have developed an integrated  through their information systems and computer-controlled processes. If one falters, there is a rapidly cascading effect on many other stakeholders. Failure to address this integrated  will compromise many Year 2000 projects.\u201d", "For the most part, DLA is not changing the two-digit date formats that their systems use to send and receive information. DLA officials told us most of their interface partners will continue using the date formats they have always used. DLA plans to use filters, such as firewall protection to prevent the receipt of erroneous data into their systems. DLA has also assigned responsibility for interface control to the individual system level, but it has not required system managers to execute written interface agreements for all of their system interfaces.", "We believe that DLA needs to communicate its interface plans to its customers and contractors so that its data exchange partners will be aware of DLA\u2019s plans and can alert the agency to possible conflicts with their own plans. This is consistent with DOD\u2019s management plan and our Year 2000 assessment guide, which included written notification of Year 2000 changes to interface partners as a step toward Year 2000 compliance because it enables the agency and its partners to agree early on such matters as format changes, schedules, or the need for data bridges. According to the DOD plan, this notification can take the form of Memorandums of Agreement or the equivalent. In not placing more attention on communicating with its external interface partners, DLA is increasing the risk of discovering too late in the Year 2000 effort that an interfacing system will not be able to accommodate the agency\u2019s own Year 2000 changes. Changes would have to be made on short notice rather than in a planned manner.

As a result, the unique applications have the potential to introduce and propagate errors into DLA systems much like the external interfaces do. To date, however, these applications have not been included in DLA\u2019s information system inventory, primarily because these systems are not under the control of DLA\u2019s Systems Design Center. Instead, DLA is placing responsibility for Year 2000 corrections on the unique application owners.", "We believe that DLA\u2019s plans with respect to these unique applications leave the agency exposed to a host of problems as it moves into the next century. First, in relying on the owners of the unique applications to make Year 2000 corrections and by not having a complete inventory of these applications, DLA cannot adequately ensure that all the applications will be compliant before the Year 2000 deadline. Second, it will have difficulty ensuring that interfaces between the unique applications and the larger standard systems are properly identified and handled. Third, inventorying these programs and assigning responsibility for ensuring progress in their correction would also help DLA raise awareness of potential Year 2000 problems and operational impact to the managers of these unique applications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DLA Has Not Prioritized Its Systems", "paragraphs": ["An important aspect of Year 2000 correction is prioritizing which systems have the highest impact on an agency\u2019s mission and thus need to be corrected first.

However, DLA\u2019s Systems Design Center officials told us that they do not believe that they need to prioritize their systems for correction because they must succeed in correcting all their major systems by the Year 2000 deadline. They also told us that each of their customers believes that its system is the most important.", "Our Year 2000 guide and DOD\u2019s plan both highlight the importance of prioritization of system conversions and replacements. DLA needs to do systems prioritization and to continually revisit its systems prioritization strategy to assure the most current appraisal of systems importance and vulnerability estimates are being used.

DLA\u2019s Systems Design Center expressed concern as early as November 1996 that FAS fielding slippage, the inherent risk of implementing any major level system on time, and the long development time that would be required to convert DFAMS to be Year 2000 compliant, increase the risk associated with FAS not being ready by the October 1998 target.

Oversight of Year 2000 project management functions for unique applications/systems could be more effectively carried out by the DLA Program Manager in conjunction with a DLA organization that actually performs these functions as its primary mission, such as the Year 2000 program office within the DLA Systems Design Center. DLA\u2019s headquarters Year 2000 Program Manager would then have a higher level of assurance that the unique applications/systems would be corrected on time.

In responding to a draft of this report, DLA officials told us that each business area within the agency had prepared a prioritized systems list that would be used in correcting Year 2000 date problems. We remain concerned that without an agencywide system priority list linked with the execution priorities of the agency\u2019s Year 2000 plan, DLA\u2019s business area managers will continue to view their own systems as most important to the agency.
