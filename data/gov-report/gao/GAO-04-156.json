While it has largely completed revamping its policies and other requirements, it still had considerable work to complete in order to implement managerial and oversight mechanisms, such as strategic sourcing, monitoring, and auditing. However, to implement the legislative requirement that DOD evaluate credit worthiness prior to issuing a purchase card, DOD is allowing cardholders to self-certify their credit worthiness rather than conducting credit checks on cardholders, as is typically done in the private sector. DOD started actions to implement nearly all of the 109 GAO recommendations, some of which may closely relate to the legislative provisions. DOD and the military services have taken disciplinary actions against cardholders whom a court of law determined had fraudulently used their purchase cards. They have also started to educate cardholders and approving officials on the proper use of the purchase card. The military services have not taken strong disciplinary actions against cardholders GAO identified as making improper and abusive or questionable purchase card acquisitions.

For fiscal year 2002, DOD  reported that an average of about 207,000 cardholders used purchase cards  to make about 11 million transactions at a cost of nearly $7 billion.   In prior  years, the DOD purchase card program at DOD has not been well managed.   As we stated in various testimonies and reports issued between July 2001  and December 2002, significant breakdowns in internal controls over the  Army, Navy, and Air Force management of the purchase card program left  the services vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse.

The  purchase card can be used for both micropurchases and payment of other  purchases.  Although most cardholders have single purchase transaction  limits of $2,500, some have limits of $25,000 or higher. The Federal  Acquisition Regulation, Part 13, \u201cSimplified Acquisition Procedures,\u201d  establishes criteria for using purchase cards to place orders and make  payments.  DOD has issued supplemental guidance to the Federal  Acquisition Regulation that contain sections on simplified acquisition  procedures.", "General Services Administration (GSA) reports show that DOD used  purchase cards for nearly 11 million transactions, valued at almost   $6.8 billion and representing nearly 45 percent of the federal government\u2019s  fiscal year 2002 purchase card activity.  According to unaudited GSA data,  the Army, Navy, and Air Force made about $2.7 billion, $1.9 billion, and  $1.6 billion, respectively, in purchase card acquisitions during fiscal year  2002.  Other DOD agencies, such as the Defense Logistics Agency and the  Defense Finance and Account Service, made the remaining $564 million in  purchase card acquisitions.", "The overall management of DOD\u2019s purchase card program has been  delegated to the DOD Purchase Card Joint Program Management Office,  which is in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition  Logistics and Technology.  At each service installation, personnel in three  positions\u2014program coordinator, cardholder, and approving official\u2014are  collectively responsible for providing reasonable assurance that purchase  card transactions are appropriate and meet a valid government need.  The  installation program coordinator is responsible for the day-to-day  management, administration, and oversight of the program, including  developing local operating procedures, issuing and canceling cards, and  providing training to cardholders and approving officials.  Cardholders\u2014 members and civilian personnel\u2014use purchase cards to order goods and  services for their units and their customers, to be picked up or delivered to  themselves or to an end user.  The cardholders are responsible for  recording the transactions in their purchase log, obtaining documented  independent confirmation that the items have been received and accepted  by the government, and notifying the property book-officer of accountable  items received so that these items can be recorded in the accountable  property records.  Approving officials, who typically are responsible for  more than one cardholder, are to review cardholders\u2019 transactions and the  cardholders\u2019 reconciled statements and certify the official consolidated bill  for payment.  Approving officials are to ensure that (1) all purchases made  by the cardholders within his or her cognizance are appropriate and that  the charges are accurate and (2) the monthly summary statement is  certified for payment on time by the Defense Finance and Accounting  Service (DFAS).  DFAS relies on the approving official\u2019s certification of the  monthly bill as support to make the payment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Our Previous Findings on DOD\u2019s Purchase Card Program", "paragraphs": ["Between July 2001 and December 2002, we testified four times and issued  four reports highlighting a weak control environment and breakdowns in  specific internal controls over the purchase card program at the Army,  Navy, and Air Force.  Based on statistical sampling and selected reviews of  at- risk transactions we identified through data mining, we reported that  these weaknesses left the purchase card program at the three services  vulnerable to fraudulent, improper, and abusive purchases.  The  testimonies and reports we issued pointed to common weaknesses.  We  identified (1) a proliferation of cardholders, (2) lack of documented  evidence of training of cardholders and approving officials, (3) inadequate  program monitoring, and (4) lack of disciplinary actions against  cardholders who abused the purchase cards.  We made recommendations  to each of the services for improving the purchase card program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Proliferation of Cardholders", "paragraphs": ["We reported that the proliferation of cardholders resulted in an  unmanageable approving official span of control and excessive credit limits  compared to historical spending.   This problem originated from the fact  that the services did not have specific policies governing the number of  cards to be issued or criteria for identifying employees eligible for the  privilege of cardholder status.  Consequently, as of September 2002, the Air  Force reported that it had about 77,000 purchase card accounts\u2014 translating to about 1 purchase card for every 7 employees.  By contrast,  the Navy, which in 2000 had 1 cardholder for every 3 employees in some of  its units, had taken positive steps to reduce the number of its purchase  cardholders to only about 1 cardholder for every 31 employees by  September 2002.  The proliferation of cardholders also resulted in a span of  control problem for some approving officials.  For example, at the end of  fiscal year 2002, some officials at two Air Force installations had multiple  job responsibilities in addition to being approving officials for more than 20  cardholders, making it difficult for them to systemically scrutinize each  purchase card statement they had to certify for payment.", "We also found that the credit limits on the purchase cards exceeded  procurement needs.  We saw little evidence that limits were set based on an  analysis of individual cardholders\u2019 needs or past spending patterns.  For  example, at the Marine Corps, the credit limit as of March 2002 exceeded  average fiscal year 2001 monthly expenditures by a ratio of 34 to 1, while at  an Air Force location, the credit limit exceeded fiscal year 2001 monthly  purchases by a ratio of 20 to 1.  At the Army, we saw infrequently used  cards that, nevertheless, had spending limits set at the maximum. In some  cases, we were told that the monthly limits were based on anticipated peak  spending to avoid possible limit changes.  Limits that are higher than  justified by the cardholder\u2019s authorized and expected use unnecessarily  increase the government\u2019s exposure to fraudulent, improper, and abusive  purchases.  Limiting credit available to cardholders is a key factor in  managing the purchase card program and in minimizing the government\u2019s  financial exposure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inadequate Training of Cardholders and Approving Officials", "paragraphs": ["We reported that cardholders, approving officials, and/or agency program  coordinators did not receive adequate training necessary to carry out their  responsibilities.

Further, we  noted that, even though the functions performed by the agency program  coordinators, approving officials, and cardholders were substantially  different, the training curriculum for the three positions was identical.

According to DOD, this capability will eventually be  implemented across the department.  In addition, on June 27, 2003, the  DOD Inspector General issued a report summarizing the results of in- depth review of purchase card transactions made by 1,357 purchase  cardholders.  The report identified 182 cardholders who potentially used  their purchase cards inappropriately or fraudulently.", "With respect to the National Defense Authorization Act\u2019s requirement to  use strategic sourcing (i.e., that the Inspectors General identify categories  of purchases that should be made by means other than purchase cards in  order to better aggregate purchases and obtain lower prices), DOD issued a  memorandum on June 5, 2003, reiterating a prior decision requiring all  DOD components to review fiscal year 2002 purchase card transaction files  and stratify the volume of purchases by vendors.  According to the  memorandum, these data will be used to determine if any componentwide  contracts should be established to optimize purchasing power.  DOD also  indicated that each of the military departments have initiated a strategic  sourcing plan, contract, or Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to take  advantage of purchase card demand (sales volume) data.  As an example,  DOD said that the Army had awarded a BPA for office supplies in 2002 to  address long-standing concerns over cardholder compliance with  mandatory sourcing requirements.  Likewise, the Air Force entered into a  BPA with a large provider of office supplies and anticipates others.  The  Navy is expected to make similar BPA arrangements when its sales volume  analysis is completed.  According to DOD, the strategic sourcing initiative  is still in the infancy stage, but the department is committed to expanding  opportunities to leverage its purchase card purchasing power.

The civilian  guide has a sample range of potential charge card offenses and remedies or  penalties for such offenses as shown in table 3.", "According to the disciplinary guidelines, there is no single response for all  cases.  Instead, a progression of increasingly severe disciplinary measures  is often appropriate in the case of minor instances of misuse, but more  serious cases may warrant the most severe sanctions in the first instance.   The disciplinary guide for military employees indicates that actions  available when military personnel misuse a purchase or travel card include  counseling, admonishment, reprimand, nonjudicial punishment (Article 15,  Uniform Code of Military Justice \u2013 UCMJ), court-martial, and  administrative separation.  In addition to corrective disciplinary actions,  military personnel who misuse their government charge cards may have  their access to classified information modified or revoked if warranted in  the interests of national security.

In general, when a  court of law determined that a cardholder fraudulently used the purchase  card, all the military services took strong disciplinary actions (i.e., assessed  fines, and in the case of uniformed personnel, sentenced the individual to  jail/confinement).  We also found that the military services either took  strong disciplinary actions or were actively investigating the cases we  reported as potentially fraudulent.  For example, our two Navy reports  identified 26 fraudulent and potentially fraudulent transactions totaling  more than $1,342,000.  The Navy reported that in response, it fired six  cardholders, reduced the grade of others, confined several uniformed  serviceman to from 14 months to 60 months, and required repayment to the  government of over $460,000.  Other actions taken on fraudulent or  potentially fraudulent transactions included suspending or revoking  purchase card privileges, requiring repayment to the government for the  cost of the items obtained, giving the items obtained back to the  government, and written reprimands.  In eight instances where no action  was taken against cardholders we categorized as having used the purchase  card in a fraudulent or potentially fraudulent manner, the military services  and the credit card company determined that the fraud was committed by a  third party, and the government had no responsibility for the charge.

Therefore, the military services did not think  that they had the authority to discipline the cardholders or approving  officials.  Rather, the military services told us they modified their policies  and procedures to prohibit similar acquisitions in the future.   The Navy, for  example, told us that it had issued numerous e-mails and updated its  policies to indicate that some products purchased in the past were now  prohibited, and that it planned to better monitor purchases so that none of  these purchases would occur in the future.  While clarifying purchase card  policies and procedures is appropriate, failure to take any disciplinary  actions against individuals who purchased or authorized the purchase of  items that clearly exceed the needs of the government (designer  briefcases) or were excessive in cost ($350 clock radios) does not serve as  a deterrent to future abuse or the waste of tax dollars."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD and the military services have taken strong actions to improve the  controls over the purchase card program.
