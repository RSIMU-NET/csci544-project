The Bureau's plans also lack a substantial amount of supporting analysis, budgetary transparency, and other information that made it difficult to verify the Bureau's assertions concerning the costs and benefits of its proposed approach. Further, unlike in previous censuses, the Bureau does not intend to develop coverage measurement procedures that would allow it to adjust census data for certain purposes. Although its experience in 2000 shows that its coverage measurement methodology needs improvement, GAO believes the Bureau should have researched alternative approaches more thoroughly and disclosed the results of its research before making a decision. In designing the 2010 Census, the Bureau hoped to address several shortcomings of the 2000 enumeration, namely to (1) increase the relevance and timeliness of data, (2) reduce operational risk, (3) increase coverage and accuracy, and (4) contain costs. To achieve these goals, three components--all new operations--are key to the Bureau's plans for 2010. They include enhancing procedures for building the census address list and associated maps, replacing the census long-form questionnaire with a more frequent sample survey, and conducting a short-form-only census. The Bureau's approach has the potential to achieve the first three goals, but reducing operational risk could prove to be more difficult as each of the three components actually introduces new risks. The Bureau will also be challenged to control the cost of the 2010 Census, now estimated at over $11 billion. The current budget reporting process masks the long-term costs of the census, most of which will be incurred in 2010; making it difficult for Congress to monitor the Bureau's planned expenditures. Certain actions by the Office of Management and Budget could produce greater fiscal transparency, and thus help inform congressional deliberations on how to best balance the need for an accurate census, with the need to ensure a reasonable cost for this endeavor."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In designing the 2010 Census, the U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) faces the  daunting challenge of cost effectively counting a population that is growing  steadily larger, more diverse, and increasingly difficult to enumerate, with a  design that meets the sometimes competing requirements and interests of a  vast spectrum of stakeholders that include Congress, government agencies,  the statistical community, advocacy groups, and the public.", "Planning a successful census\u2014one that is acceptable to Congress and  other stakeholders and achieves desired outcomes\uf8e7requires the Bureau to  assess the lessons learned from past enumerations, identify initiatives that  show promise for producing a better census while controlling costs, test  the feasibility of these initiatives, and convince stakeholders of the value of  the proposed plans.

Members of Congress  questioned the use of sampling and estimation for legal and methodological  reasons.  Contributing to Congress\u2019s skepticism was the Bureau\u2019s failure to  provide sufficiently detailed data on the effects of its proposed approach.    Although the U.S. Supreme Court settled the dispute in January 1999, the  Bureau ultimately wound up having to plan for both a \u201ctraditional\u201d census  and one involving sampling, which added to the costs and risks of the 2000  decennial census.", "To help secure congressional support for its 2010 reform efforts, it will be  important for the Bureau to convincingly demonstrate that it has chosen  the optimum design given various resource and other constraints and that  it will effectively manage operations and costs.

Since  1980, the Bureau has used statistical methods to generate detailed  measures of the undercounts of particular ethnic, racial, and other  population groups.  To assess the quality of population data for the 2000  Census and to possibly adjust for any errors, the Bureau conducted the  Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (A.C.E.) program.  Although the U.S.  Supreme Court ruled in 1999 that the Census Act prohibited the use of  statistical sampling for purposes of apportioning seats in the House of  Representatives, the Court did not specifically address the use of statistical  sampling for other purposes.", "In March 2001, the Acting Director of the U.S. Census Bureau  recommended to the Secretary of Commerce that only unadjusted data be  released for purposes of congressional redistricting.  The Acting Director  made this recommendation when, after considerable research, the Bureau  was unable to conclude that the adjusted data were more accurate for use  in redistricting.  Specifically, the Acting Director cited the apparent  inconsistency in population growth over the decade as estimated by the  A.C.E., and demographic analysis, which estimated the population using  birth, death, and similar records.  He noted that the inconsistency raised  the possibility of an unidentified error in either the A.C.E. estimates or the  census numbers, and the inconsistency could not be resolved prior to   April 1, 2001, the legally mandated deadline for releasing redistricting data.    Later that year, following additional research, the Acting Director decided  against using adjusted census data for nonredistricting purposes, such as  allocating federal aid, because A.C.E. estimates failed to identify a  significant number of people erroneously included in the census.  The  Acting Director noted that  \u201cthis finding of substantial error, in conjunction  with remaining uncertainties, necessitates that revisions, based on  additional review and analysis, be made to the A.C.E. estimates before any  potential uses of these data can be considered.\u201d", "As the Bureau turned toward the 2010 Census, it needed to decide whether  it would have a coverage measurement program and how the results would  be used.  Because of the 1999 U.S. Supreme Court ruling noted earlier, the  Bureau could not use coverage measurement results to adjust census data  for purposes of congressional apportionment.  However, adjusting census  data for other purposes remained an open question.", "In our January 2003 report on the objectives and results of the 2000 A.C.E.  program, we noted that an evaluation of the accuracy and completeness of  the census is critical given the many uses of census data, the importance of  identifying the magnitude and characteristics of any undercounts and  overcounts, and the cost of the census overall.  We cautioned that the  longer the 2010 planning process continues without a firm decision on the  role of coverage measurement, the greater the risk of wasted resources and  disappointing results.", "Consequently, we recommended that the Bureau, in conjunction with  Congress and other stakeholders, come to an early decision on whether  and how coverage measurement will be used in the 2010 Census.  In  reaching this decision, we recommended that the Bureau (1) demonstrate  both the operational and technical feasibility of its coverage measurement  methods, (2) determine the level of geography at which coverage can be  reliably measured, (3) keep Congress and other stakeholders informed of  its plans, and (4) adequately test its coverage measurement methodology  prior to full implementation.", "The Bureau agreed with our recommendations, noting that we had  identified important steps that should be followed in developing a coverage  measurement methodology for the 2010 Census.  While certain aspects of  the Bureau\u2019s coverage measurement plans are still being developed, the  Bureau is not currently planning to develop a procedure that would allow it  to adjust census numbers for purposes of redistricting.", "According to the Director of the U.S. Census Bureau, although the Bureau  plans to evaluate the accuracy of the coverage it achieves in the 2010  Census, its experience during the 2000 Census demonstrated \u201cthat the  science is insufficiently advanced to allow making statistical adjustment to  population counts of a successful decennial census in which the  percentage of error is presumed to be so small that adjustment would  introduce as much or more error than it was designed to correct.\u201d", "Furthermore, irrespective of whether it is both legal and appropriate to do  so, the Bureau does not believe that it can both collect coverage  measurement data and complete the analysis of those data\u2019s accuracy in  time to deliver the information to the states to meet their redistricting  deadlines.", "Although the Bureau\u2019s experience during the 2000 Census shows that its  approach to measuring coverage needs to be improved if it is to be used to  adjust census numbers, the Bureau has not yet determined the feasibility of  refinements to the 2000 approach or alternative methodologies.   Consequently, the Bureau\u2019s decision on how coverage evaluation data will  be used in 2010 appears to be premature.  Indeed, while the Bureau has  reported that the 2000 Census had better coverage compared to the 1990  Census, as noted below, the U.S. population is becoming increasingly  difficult to count, a factor that could affect the quality of the 2010 Census.", "More generally, the decennial census is an inherently fragile endeavor,  where an accurate population count requires the near-perfect alignment of  a myriad of factors ranging from the successful execution of dozens of  census-taking operations to the public\u2019s willingness to cooperate with  enumerators.  External factors such as the state of the economy and world  events might also affect the outcome of the census.  The bottom line is that  while the census is under way, the tolerance for any breakdowns is quite  small.", "Therefore, the Bureau\u2019s ability to maintain the level of quality reported for  the 2000 Census is far from guaranteed.  Thus, to ensure that the nation  uses the best available census data, it will be important for the Bureau to  research procedures that depending on what the results of the coverage  evaluation say about the quality of the census data, would allow  adjustment, if necessary, for those purposes for which it is both legal and  appropriate to do so.

Consequently, fiscal transparency is  critical to better reflect the magnitude of the government\u2019s long-term  spending on the census and signal unanticipated cost growth.

The two options are (1) annually reporting the planned life  cycle cash flow and explaining any material changes from previous plans  (currently, the Bureau does not make this information available) and   (2) setting triggers to signal when the amount of money expected to be  spent in any one year exceeded a predetermined amount.

As we noted in the report, societal  changes have reduced the cost-effectiveness of the census, and it has  become more and more difficult to stay on par with the results of previous  enumerations.  Similarly, we stated that \u201cthe legal requirement to count  everyone leads the Bureau to employ operations that only marginally  improve coverage but that are relatively expensive to conduct.\u201d", "Further, we do not, as the Bureau asserts, treat the cost issue in a vacuum,  and agree with the Bureau that little would be gained by focusing on the  cost of the 2010 Census alone.

In fact, our report even notes  that the Bureau's reengineering strategy has the potential to reduce costs  relative to a design that would repeat the Census 2000 approach.  To help  clarify this point, we added text that describes how a repeat of the 2000  approach would be more costly than the reengineered design, according to  Bureau estimates.", "The Bureau disagreed with our recommendation to OMB regarding the  need for greater budgetary transparency, noting that the real reason for the  vagueness of out-year cost estimates stems from a fundamental difference  of opinion between the administration and Congress over the appropriate  time to share that information.

Whether it is called a business plan or a project plan, such  information is not, as the Bureau maintains, simply \u201cmore process.\u201d  Quite  the contrary, this information is essential for improving performance;  facilitating a thorough, independent review of the Bureau\u2019s plans; and  demonstrating to Congress and other stakeholders that the Bureau can  effectively design and manage operations and control costs.", "The Bureau incorrectly asserts that our report criticizes it for not  completing the evaluations of the 2000 Census in a timely manner.

We  agree with the Bureau\u2019s assessment that the coverage measurement  approach used in the 2000 Census needs to be reworked.  However, this  should not preclude it from researching alternative approaches for the 2010  Census in light of the fact that the Bureau\u2019s ability to maintain the level of  quality reported for the 2000 Census is less than certain.", "Finally, the Bureau questioned our assessment that the only contingency  plan for conducting the 2010 Census, if the reengineered effort fails, was to  fall back on the Census 2000 methods.  The Bureau maintains that the 2000  Census was by most accounts a very successful census and, accordingly,  the Bureau already has available the methods and procedures for taking an  excellent census.  Our report does not advocate the development of  another set of census methods.  Rather, we were trying to illustrate the  challenge the Bureau faces in implementing its reengineering plans, where  the failure of any one leg could compromise the other two, thereby  requiring the Bureau to rely on the approach it used for the 2000 Census.   According to Bureau officials, this in turn could make it difficult for the  Bureau to accomplish its goals for the 2010 Census, which include cost  containment and better quality data.", "On October 14, 2003, the Associate Director for General Government  Programs, OMB, provided written comments on a draft of this report,  which are reprinted in appendix II.

OMB also agreed that it is essential to  understand the key cost drivers and said that it is working with the U.S.  Census Bureau to ensure that the Bureau develops high-quality, transparent  life cycle cost estimates.", "However, OMB disagreed with our recommendation that it ensure that the  Bureau, include a notational item in the Program and Financing (P&F)  schedule of the President\u2019s Budget with an updated estimate of the life  cycle costs of the census and the amount of money the Bureau expects to  spend in each year of the cycle, as well as an explanation of any significant  changes from previous plans.  OMB believes that the Bureau\u2019s report on the  life cycle costs, which is updated regularly, is the best mechanism to  present estimates of the total life cycle costs and explanations for any  material changes from previous plans.  Further, OMB noted that presenting  this information in the P&F schedule is cumbersome and unnecessary  because the Analytical Perspectives volume of the President\u2019s Budget  currently shows out-year estimates that incorporate anticipated  programmatic changes of the Decennial Census within the Periodic  Censuses and Program account.", "As noted in our report, we do not believe the information OMB currently  reports to Congress is sufficiently timely or detailed to provide the level of  transparency needed for effective congressional oversight and cost control.   Indeed, while OMB cites the Bureau\u2019s life cycle report, the document that  we reviewed for this report took the Bureau nearly 2 years to revise.   Moreover, the revised estimates, like the original estimates, overstated the  life cycle cost estimate by $300 million because the Bureau did not take  into account a surplus of that amount that it identified near the end of fiscal  year 2000.  Although the Bureau is to reissue the 2010 life cycle cost  estimates early in calendar year 2004, the incorrect estimates will have  been in circulation for more than 2 years.", "Additionally, the information contained in the Analytical Perspectives  volume of the President\u2019s Budget is limited.  For example, it only provides  information on out-year estimates for 5 years.  As a result, the volume will  not include estimates for the high-cost year of 2010 until the release of the  President\u2019s fiscal year 2006 budget.  Further, the Analytical Perspectives  volume lacks information on the sensitivity of cost figures to specific  assumptions and the likelihood of these estimates.  It also does not contain  any explanations of changes in cost estimates from year to year.  Complete  and transparent information on out-year costs is important to inform  deliberations on the acceptability of these costs and to ensure that  Congress understands the possible range of census life cycle costs.", "OMB also disagreed with our recommendation to establish triggers to  signal when the yearly 2010 Census costs, total 2010 Census costs, or both  exceeded some predetermined amount.  OMB noted that it has established  internal procedures within its budget reviews to monitor 2010 Census costs  and believes they are sufficient for ensuring that estimates are not  exceeded without clear justification.  OMB added that this justification  could be included in the Bureau\u2019s updates to its life cycle cost estimates.", "Although OMB\u2019s internal procedures might be sufficient for OMB\u2019s  requirements, they do little to address the fundamental need for greater  fiscal transparency.  Continued reliance on these procedures would inhibit  independent review by congressional and other external stakeholders, as  well as limit informed discussion of the trade-offs of dollars versus  accuracy and what cost control measures, if any, might be needed to make  the 2010 Census more affordable.", "In closing, OMB commented that the Bureau\u2019s reengineering plan is being  reviewed by NAS as well as seven advisory committees.  OMB stated that  the analyses stemming from these reviews, such as NAS\u2019s recently issued  report on census planning, enhance the Bureau\u2019s accountability and help  ensure \u201cthat the ultimate 2010 Census design is optimal.\u201d", "We agree with OMB that NAS and the advisory committees are important  for reviewing the Bureau\u2019s plans and holding the Bureau accountable for a  cost-effective census in 2010.  And this is precisely why we made the  recommendations that we did.  Without a transparent budgeting and  planning process, a thorough, independent review by these and other  external groups would be difficult to impossible.  That greater  transparency is needed in both these areas is highlighted not just in our  report, but in the very NAS study that OMB cites.   Indeed, NAS found that   \u201ca major conclusion of the panel is that discussion of the 2010 Census  design needs to be more fully informed by the evaluation of various trade- offs\u2014the costs and benefits of various reasonable approaches in order to  make wise decisions.\u201d", "As agreed with your offices, unless you release its contents earlier, we plan  no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its issue date.
