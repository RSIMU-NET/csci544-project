The framework is to provide a flexible and risk-based approach for entities within the nation's 16 critical infrastructure sectors to protect their vital assets from cyber-based threats. To develop the framework in a collaborative manner, NIST solicited input from sector stakeholders through a formal request for information and conducted multiple workshops with critical infrastructure owners and operators, industry associations, government agencies, and other stakeholders. Participants GAO surveyed were generally satisfied with the approach NIST took to develop the framework. Further, the framework meets the requirements established in federal law that it be flexible, repeatable, performance-based, and cost-effective.

However, while DHS has established  a program dedicated to encouraging the framework\u2019s adoption, without  establishing metrics to assess the effectiveness of these efforts, it has  less assurance that it is meeting its objectives.

In addition, we analyzed  Executive Order 13636, issued in February 2013, and the Cybersecurity  Enhancement Act of 2014, enacted in December 2014, to identify key  NIST responsibilities for developing a cybersecurity framework. We  analyzed documents and performed interviews with NIST officials to  assess its collaborative efforts with industry stakeholders in soliciting  input in the development of the framework, including workshops it hosted  and the website it set up to disseminate updates on the framework.  Specifically, we reviewed documentation and videos of the six workshops  hosted by NIST intended to obtain industry, academia, and government  representative feedback in the development of the framework, in addition  to NIST\u2019s two requests for information to the public for input on  cybersecurity standards and methodologies. We also analyzed the  resulting framework to assess whether NIST had fulfilled its  responsibilities under law.", "Additionally, to address this objective, we conducted a web-based survey  of individuals who (1) provided written comments with contact information  in response to a NIST request for information notice or (2) registered for  at least one of the workshops hosted by NIST to develop the framework.  There were 2,082 individuals in the population that we targeted, and to  make the survey as inclusive as possible we sent the survey request to all  of them. The questionnaire included questions about the effectiveness of  NIST\u2019s collaborative efforts in fulfilling requirements to develop the  framework using an open and public comment process. To minimize  errors arising from differences in how questions might be interpreted and  to reduce variability in responses that should be qualitatively the same,  we conducted pretests with critical infrastructure representatives over the  telephone. Based on feedback from these pretests, we revised the  questionnaire to improve the clarity of the questions. An independent  survey specialist within GAO also reviewed a draft of the questionnaire  prior to its administration.", "After completing the pretests, we administered the survey to the NIST  workshop attendees and request for information respondents on August  10, 2015, notifying them that our online questionnaire would be activated  within a couple of days. On August 18, 2015, we sent a second e-mail  message to these individuals, informing them that the questionnaire was  available online and providing them with unique passwords and  usernames. We collected responses through August 24, 2015. We were  able to obtain 252 completed questionnaires, a 12 percent response rate,  in the time available for survey fieldwork.

For DHS, we  analyzed agency documentation and the website of its Critical  Infrastructure Cyber Community (C) Voluntary Program to identify the  framework promotional guidance and tools provided to the critical  infrastructure sectors. Also, we analyzed the metrics and information  being used by the DHS CTo analyze NIST\u2019s promotional efforts, we analyzed documentation and  interviewed relevant NIST officials.
