The 21st Century Cures Act changed how Medicare pays certain long-term care hospitals (LTCH) that provide spinal cord specialty treatment. For these hospitals, the act included a temporary exception from how Medicare pays other LTCHs. Two LTCHs\u2014Craig Hospital in Englewood, Colorado and Shepherd Center in Atlanta, Georgia\u2014have qualified for this exception. GAO found that most Medicare beneficiaries treated at these two hospitals typically receive specialized care for multiple chronic conditions and other long-term complications that develop after initial injuries, such as pressure ulcers that can result in life-threatening infection. The two hospitals also provide specialty care for acquired brain injuries, such as traumatic brain injuries.", "GAO's simulations of Medicare payments to these two hospitals using claims data from two baseline years\u2014fiscal years 2013 and 2016\u2014illustrate potential effects of payment policies. LTCHs are paid under a two-tiered system for care provided to beneficiaries: they receive the LTCH standard federal payment rate\u2014or standard rate\u2014for certain patients discharged from the LTCH, and a generally lower rate\u2014known as a \u201csite-neutral\u201d rate\u2014for all other discharges. Under the temporary exception, Craig Hospital and Shepherd Center receive the standard rate for all discharges during fiscal years 2018 and 2019.

Patients with spinal cord and brain injuries may receive care in other LTCHs, but GAO found that most Medicare beneficiaries at these other LTCHs are treated for conditions other than spinal cord and brain injuries. Certain inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRF) also provide post-acute rehabilitation services to patients with spinal cord and brain injuries. While data limitations make a direct comparison between these facilities and the two qualifying hospitals difficult, GAO identified some similarities and differences. For example, officials from some IRFs we interviewed reported providing several of the same programs and services as the two qualifying hospitals to medically complex patients, but the availability of services and complexity of patients varied. Among other reasons, the different Medicare payment requirements that apply to LTCHs and IRFs affect the types of services they provide and the patients they treat."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) provide care to individuals, including  Medicare beneficiaries, who receive hospital services that require  inpatient lengths of stay greater than 25 days, on average.

Traditionally, LTCHs have been paid by Medicare  under the LTCH prospective payment system (PPS) at the LTCH PPS  standard federal payment rate (hereafter standard rate). However, the  Pathway for SGR Reform Act of 2013 introduced site-neutral payment  policy, which changed Medicare\u2019s payment for services that could be  provided in other less costly settings, beginning in fiscal year (FY) 2016.  As a result, LTCH PPS is now a two-tiered payment system under which  certain LTCH discharges continue to be paid at the standard rate, while  other discharges are paid at a generally lower site-neutral rate. Site- neutral payment policy is being phased into the LTCH PPS over five  years, with certain exceptions. In addition, statute provides that by fiscal  year 2021 LTCHs will no longer receive the standard rate if they fail to  meet certain requirements, raising concerns that some LTCHs may no  longer provide care to certain patients if they are paid at the site-neutral  rate.", "The 21st Century Cures Act provided a temporary exception to this two- tiered approach for certain LTCHs that provide spinal cord specialty  treatment for cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal years 2018  and 2019.

We found that while some of the  baseline discharges would qualify for the standard rate, most  discharges would have been paid at the blended site-neutral rate.  Specifically, 8 to 20 percent of Craig Hospital\u2019s baseline Medicare  discharges would have qualified for the standard rate, resulting in  simulated payments of about $3.86 million (baseline year 1) and  $3.22 million (baseline year 2) under blended site-neutral rate policy.", "For Shepherd Center, between 23 percent and 40 percent of baseline  Medicare discharges would have qualified for the standard rate,  resulting in simulated payments of about $5.16 million (baseline year  1) and $5.31 million (baseline year 2).

We found that both qualifying hospitals would receive some  payments at the standard rate, but that most of their discharges would  be paid at the lower, site-neutral rate\u2014assuming similar caseloads  (e.g., patient mix). As a result, simulated baseline year payments at  Craig Hospital are about $3.47 million (baseline year 1) and $3.03  million (baseline year 2), and simulated baseline payments to  Shepherd are about $4.42 million (baseline year 1) and $4.55 million  (baseline year 2).

Most of the baseline year  discharges did not qualify for the standard rate, and therefore  simulated payments are based on the generally lower comparable  acute care rate. However, simulated payments stayed about the same  between fiscal year 2020 and 2021, in part due to differences in  calculations for high-cost outlier payments. A high-cost outlier  payment is made to hospitals for those cases that are extraordinarily  costly, which can occur because of the severity of the case and/or a  particularly long length of stay. Specifically, simulated payments  were about $3.49 million (baseline year 1) and $3.02 million (baseline  year 2) for Craig Hospital and about $4.24 million (baseline year 1)  and $4.16 million (baseline year 2) for Shepherd Center. Without the  high-cost outlier payments, the simulated payments would have  decreased by at least $2 million. If the mix of patients at Craig  Hospital and Shepherd Center changes so that they meet the 50  percent threshold in fiscal year 2020, then simulated payments for  fiscal year 2021 could be higher. As of September 2018, Craig  Hospital officials told us that they expect to meet the 50 percent  threshold with their current patient mix. Shepherd Center officials told  us they do not expect to meet the 50 percent threshold.", "See figures 1 and 2 below for the results of our simulations.", "Our simulations of payments assume the number and type of Medicare  discharges at the two qualifying hospitals remain the same as those in  fiscal years 2013 and 2016. However, the full effect of payment policy on  future Medicare payments to the qualifying hospitals will depend on three  key factors that are subject to change:  1.  Severity of patient conditions: Medicare payment is typically higher  for more severe injuries, such as a traumatic injury with major  comorbidities or complications, relative to less severe injuries. In the  two baseline years we used for our simulations\u2014fiscal year 2013 and  fiscal year 2016\u2014more than half of the Medicare discharges at the  qualifying hospitals were associated with conditions with multiple  comorbidities and complications, as indicated by the diagnosis  groups, and this level of severity is reflected in the simulation results.  Future payments to qualifying hospitals will depend on the extent to  which the severity of patient conditions changes over time.  2.  Volume of discharges meeting criteria for the standard rate: As  previously noted, for a hospital to receive the standard rate for a  discharge, the discharge must meet certain criteria, such as having a  preceding acute care hospital stay with either an intensive care unit  stay of at least 3 days or an assigned diagnosis group based on the  receipt of at least 96 hours of mechanical ventilation services in the  LTCH. Our simulations reflect that in the two baseline years, about  23 percent of the fiscal year 2013 discharges and about 40 percent of  the fiscal year 2016 discharges met the criteria to receive the  standard rate for Shepherd Center; and about 8 percent of the fiscal  year 2013 discharges and about 20 percent of the fiscal year 2016  discharges met the criteria for Craig Hospital. Changes to these  amounts could affect future payments to the qualifying hospitals. In  particular, if 50 percent or more of either hospital\u2019s discharges  beginning in fiscal year 2020 meet the standard rate criteria, then the  hospitals would be eligible for payments at the standard rate in fiscal  year 2021, which may result in higher payments compared to our  simulations.  3.  Payment adjustments: LTCHs may receive a payment adjustment  for certain types of discharges, such as short-stay outliers, interrupted  stays, or high-cost outliers. In particular, most discharges at Craig  Hospital received high-cost outlier payments (additional payments for  extraordinarily costly cases) during the two baseline years\u201476  percent in fiscal year 2013 and 85 percent in fiscal year 2016. At  Shepherd Center, at least 40 percent of discharges during the two  baseline years received high-cost outlier payments\u2014about 42 percent  in fiscal year 2013 and about 58 percent in fiscal year 2016. The  amount of future payments to qualifying hospitals will depend on the  extent to which they continue to have a high proportion of discharges  with high-cost outlier payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Qualifying Hospitals and Some Stakeholders Reported that Payment Policies May Result in Fewer Services Provided and Fewer Patients Served by LTCHs", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the effect on payments, officials from both qualifying  hospitals and some stakeholders we interviewed noted that the LTCH  site-neutral payment policies may result in fewer services provided and  fewer patients served by the qualifying hospitals and other LTCHs. For  example, officials from Craig Hospital told us they stopped providing post- operative care to patients requiring spinal surgery, such as patients with  syringomyelia, in 2016\u2014instead referring them to other facilities\u2014in part  because these discharges do not meet the criteria for the standard rate.  As of September 2018, they told us they do not plan to provide this care  in the future unless the temporary exception is extended. Officials from  Shepherd Center told us while they have not yet made changes to  services they offer to Medicare patients, they may limit which Medicare  beneficiaries they serve in the future. For example, they told us that most  of their Medicare beneficiaries were admitted from home or sought care in  their outpatient clinic. When the temporary exception expires after fiscal  year 2019, hospital officials expected that these patients will not qualify  for the standard rate. Shepherd Center officials said they may not be able  to serve similar patients in future years.", "MedPAC officials and some stakeholders\u2014a specialty association and  health care providers with experience treating patients with similar  conditions at other LTCHs\u2014told us that some LTCHs have changed the  services they offer and the patients they treat to increase the proportion of  discharges that qualify for the standard rate. For example,", "MedPAC officials cited reports that indicate how some LTCHs have  adjusted to the site-neutral policies. For example, a 2018 MedPAC  report indicated that LTCHs in one large for-profit chain were able to  make adjustments so that, as of September 30, 2016, close to 100  percent of their Medicare discharges met the criteria to receive the  standard rate.", "A representative from an LTCH association told us that many LTCHs  have adjusted their patient mix by increasing the number of  discharges that meet criteria for the standard rate and turning away  some Medicare beneficiaries to reduce the number of discharges  subject to the site-neutral rate. The representative noted that certain  LTCHs have already been able to adjust their patient mix because  they have existing programs in place that focus on chronic, critically ill  patients who would have a preceding acute care hospital stay. The  representative told us that some LTCHs specialize in care for patients  who do not meet the criteria to receive the standard rate and would  generally be paid at the site-neutral rate; therefore, changing their  patient mix is not a viable strategy for these LTCHs. According to the  stakeholder, as of February 2018, about two-thirds of all LTCHs are  above the 50 percent threshold.", "Providers from another LTCH told us that before the site-neutral  payment policy went into effect, only about 40 to 45 percent of its  discharges met criteria for the standard rate. However, they worked to  ensure most patients referred to the LTCH would qualify for the  standard rate. Officials told us patients who do not meet the criteria for  that rate typically either stay longer in the acute care hospital or are  transferred to a different post-acute care setting, such as a skilled  nursing facility. Officials noted that, in both cases, the patient may not  receive the specialized services often required for their injuries,  including those patients with spinal cord or brain injuries.", "A provider we interviewed from another LTCH said that, historically,  the LTCH has accepted patients who acquire pressure ulcers at home  following discharge, but they may choose not to continue this practice  because the patients\u2019 discharges would not meet the criteria to  receive the standard rate.", "A few of these stakeholders told us some LTCHs are in markets that do  not have alternative providers of care, such as skilled nursing facilities, for  patients who do not meet the criteria. These LTCHs may have difficulty  adjusting their patient mix to avoid site-neutral payments. For example, a  provider from one LTCH said his facility continues to take \u201csite-neutral  patients\u201d because those patients often do not have another option to  receive the specialized services they need. The provider emphasized  concerns about the long-term viability of caring for those patients at the  facility, because their care is paid at lower rates."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Similarities and Differences May Exist Between the Two Qualifying Hospitals and Other Facilities that Treat Medicare Patients with Spinal Cord and Brain Injuries", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Two Qualifying Hospitals Treat Patients with Conditions Different Than Those at Most Other LTCHs, and Treat Fewer Medicare Patients", "paragraphs": ["Our review of Medicare claims data, other information, and interviews  with stakeholders indicated the two qualifying hospitals treated Medicare  beneficiaries with different conditions than most of those treated at other  LTCHs. Our analysis of Medicare claims data indicates Craig Hospital  and Shepherd Center treat very few patients in the Medicare diagnosis  groups that are most common to other LTCHs. Specifically, for several  years, MedPAC has reported that LTCH patient discharges are  concentrated in a relatively small number of diagnosis groups. For  example, in March 2018, MedPAC reported that 20 diagnosis groups  accounted for over 61 percent of LTCH discharges at both for-profit and  not-for-profit facilities, in fiscal year 2016. However, in fiscal year 2016,  these diagnosis groups accounted for approximately 30 percent of  Medicare discharges\u201426 out of 88\u2014at Shepherd Center, and most of  these discharges fell within a single diagnosis group which covers a  range of conditions. Craig Hospital did not discharge any Medicare  beneficiaries assigned to these 20 diagnosis groups, in fiscal year 2016.

However, Medicare  claims data and other information provided by the two qualifying hospitals  indicate Medicare beneficiaries account for a significantly smaller  proportion (about 8 percent) of patients discharged from Craig Hospital  and Shepherd Center in 2016. Specifically, 40 of the 486 patients  discharged from Craig Hospital in fiscal year 2016 and 75 of the 912  patients discharged from Shepherd Center in calendar year 2016, were  Medicare beneficiaries. Officials from the qualifying hospitals told us  they treat few Medicare patients primarily because of the younger  average age of persons with spinal cord injuries and acquired brain  injuries.", "While patients with spinal cord and brain injuries may receive care in  other LTCHs, most stakeholders we interviewed also suggested the two  qualifying hospitals treat patients that are different from those treated at  most other LTCHs, and can offer specialized care. Officials from the two  qualifying hospitals told us that, relative to most other facilities\u2014including  most traditional LTCHs\u2014they offer a more complete continuum of care to  meet the needs of patients at different stages of spinal cord and brain  injury treatment, without the need to transfer to different facilities. Officials  also stated that, unlike most traditional LTCHs, they are able to offer more  specialized care for patients with spinal cord and brain injuries, including  more comprehensive rehabilitation services. Stakeholders we interviewed  generally agreed that the two qualifying hospitals have developed  expertise in treating spinal cord and brain injury patients and offer  intensive rehabilitation services that are not provided in most other  LTCHs. In addition, officials from the Colorado Department of Health Care  Policy & Financing noted that Craig Hospital treats a patient population  that is different from most other LTCHs in the state of Colorado.  Specifically, according to officials, in comparison to other LTCHs in the  state, Craig Hospital treats: (1) a higher percentage of patients with more  severe conditions, (2) more patients from outside the state of Colorado,  (3) fewer patients requiring ventilator weaning or requiring wound care\u2014 conditions typically characteristic of LTCH patients\u2014and (4) patients that  are, on average, younger than most other LTCHs in the state of Colorado.

According to CMS officials, IRFs are specifically  designed to provide post-acute rehabilitation services to patients with  spinal cord injuries, brain injuries, and other neuromuscular conditions.  CMS officials noted that patients with these conditions typically respond  well to intensive rehabilitation therapy provided in a resource intensive  inpatient hospital environment and to the specific interdisciplinary  approach to care that is provided in the IRF setting.

Medicare uses separate payment systems to pay LTCHs and  IRFs, for care provided to beneficiaries. LTCHs are paid pre-determined  fixed amounts for care provided to Medicare beneficiaries, under the  LTCH PPS. Medicare beneficiaries treated in LTCHs are assigned to  diagnosis groups (MS-LTC-DRGs) for each stay\u2014based on the patient\u2019s  primary and secondary diagnoses, age, gender, discharge status, and  procedures performed.

Medicare beneficiaries treated in IRFs are assigned to  case-mix groups\u2014based on age, and level of motor and cognitive  function\u2014and then further assigned to one of four tiers (within these  groups) based on the presence of specific comorbidities that may  increase their cost of care. According to CMS officials, because the  payment groups and assignments to those groups are different, it is  difficult to directly compare LTCH patients, classified in diagnosis groups,  with IRF patients, classified in case-mix groups. See Appendix II for more  information on these payment systems.", "MedPAC has previously reported the differences in patient assessment  tools used by post-acute care providers undermines Medicare\u2019s ability to  compare the patients admitted, costs of care, and outcomes beneficiaries  achieve in these settings, on a risk-adjusted basis.

Key similarities and differences include the following:  Volume of services. Our review of Medicare claims data, other  information, and interviews with stakeholders indicate that\u2014similar to the  two qualifying hospitals\u2014some IRFs treat a high volume (at least 100) of  patients with complex spinal cord injury, brain injury, and other related  conditions. Officials from the two qualifying hospitals, as well as some  other stakeholders we interviewed\u2014including officials from the  Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation and the Brain Injury Association of  America\u2014emphasized the importance of facilities treating a high volume  of patients with these specialized conditions, which can be an indicator of  expertise in treating these patients. Our review of Medicare claims data  for 1,148 IRFs in fiscal year 2016 identified 21 IRFs that treated at least  100 Medicare beneficiaries with non-traumatic and traumatic spinal cord  injuries and 109 IRFs that treated at least 100 Medicare beneficiaries with  non-traumatic and traumatic brain injuries.", "Our review of Medicare claims data indicated that, similar to the two  qualifying hospitals\u2014some IRFs also treat a high volume of patients with  \u201ccatastrophic\u201d injuries\u2014traumatic brain injury, traumatic spinal cord injury,  and major multiple traumas with brain or spinal cord injuries. Specifically,  we identified 25 IRFs that treated a high volume (at least 100) of  Medicare beneficiaries with catastrophic injuries, in fiscal year 2016. In  the absence of patient assessment data from the facilities, we did not  independently evaluate the level and severity of these patients\u2019 injuries,  which can vary due to the presence of other co-morbid conditions. The  Medicare case mix indexes we reviewed for these 25 IRFs indicated that,  relative to other IRFs, most of these facilities treat patients who are more  resource intensive.", "Specialty accreditation and designation as model systems. Like  Shepherd Center, some IRFs receive CARF-accreditation for specialty  programs to treat spinal cord and brain injuries. According to most  stakeholders, this accreditation indicates expertise in treating these  patients, as CARF International has established standards using  evidence-based practices, among other factors. Officials from the two  qualifying hospitals also noted CARF International has a specific focus on  quality and outcomes. However, officials from Shepherd Center noted  similarities in care and services offered at CARF-accredited facilities  would depend on the specialties for which they are certified.", "Most of the stakeholders we interviewed also noted that designation as a  NIDILRR model system is an indicator of similar expertise in treating  patients with spinal cord and brain injuries. According to the Model  Systems Knowledge Translation Center, spinal cord injury and brain  injury model systems are recognized as national leaders in medical  research and patient care and provide the highest level of comprehensive  specialty services from the point of injury through eventual re-entry into  full community life. While stakeholders we interviewed from NIDILRR  model systems indicated the model system designation is focused  primarily on research, rather than clinical care, most noted that model  systems\u2019 research often complements the facilities\u2019 clinical efforts to  address the unique needs of these patients. Officials from HHS\u2019s  Administration for Community Living also noted that all model system  grantees must provide a continuum of care\u2014emergency care, acute  medical care, acute medical rehabilitation, and post-acute care\u2014and that  can happen in various provider types. According to officials from the  qualifying hospitals and stakeholders from one other NIDILRR model  system we interviewed, Craig Hospital and Shepherd Center are the only  two LTCHs currently classified as spinal cord injury model systems; 12 of  14 spinal cord injury model systems are IRFs.", "Specialized programs and services. Similar to the two qualifying  hospitals, some IRFs may also offer specialized programs and services  for patients with brain and spinal cord injuries, but the availability of these  programs and services may vary by facility. Officials from some of the  IRFs that responded to our information request\u2014which included both  NIDILRR facilities and IRFs with CARF-accredited programs\u2014told us  they provide specialized programs and services for patients with similar  conditions as those treated at two qualifying hospitals, and sometimes  compete with the two qualifying hospitals for the same patients. For  example, each IRF reported having interdisciplinary treatment teams; the  capacity to provide medical management of medically complex and high  acuity patients with spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, or other  major multiple traumas associated with a brain or spinal cord injury; family  education and training; and skin and wound programs or services, among  other services. However, the availability of certain services\u2014including but  not limited to ventilator-dependent weaning programs, diaphragmatic  pacing, and outpatient programs for spinal cord and traumatic brain injury  patients\u2014varied by facility.", "Staff with specialized training and clinical expertise. Similar to the two  qualifying hospitals, most facilities that responded to our information  request also reported having physicians, nurses, and physical and  occupational therapists with specialty training in medical rehabilitation,  spinal cord, and/or brain injury. However, the number of staff with these  trainings, varied by facility. In comparison to the other facilities that  responded to our information request, the number of nurses and physical  and occupational therapists with these specialty trainings were generally  higher at Craig Hospital and Shepherd Center. According to an American  Spinal Injury Association consumer guideline that the Christopher & Dana  Reeve Foundation typically provides to spinal cord injury patients and  families, programs should regularly admit persons with spinal cord injury  each year, to develop and maintain the necessary skills to manage a  person with spinal cord injury, and a substantial portion of those admitted  should have traumatic injuries.", "Out-of-state Admissions. Officials from the two qualifying hospitals  emphasized they admit a significant number of patients from out-of-state,  and our review of information provided by the qualifying hospitals and a  select group of IRFs indicated the qualifying hospitals admit a higher  percentage of patients from out-of-state. Specifically, information provided  by these IRFs indicates that less than a quarter of patients admitted to  these facilities, in 2016, were from out-of-state. Information provided by  Craig Hospital and Shepherd Center indicate that about half of their  patients were admitted from out-of-state in 2016. Officials from the  Colorado Department of Health Care Policy & Financing also noted Craig  Hospital treats a higher percentage of out-of-state patients, compared to  IRFs in the state.", "Ability to treat medically complex patients. Officials from the two  qualifying hospitals told us they treat more medically complex patients  and provide a more complete range of medical services to spinal cord  and brain injury patients, not provided by most IRFs. Specifically, officials  from the two qualifying hospitals both noted they are able to treat patients  much sooner in their recovery process than most IRFs, due to their LTCH  status. Officials from the Shepherd Center noted that they have a 10-bed intensive care unit which allows them to take patients with certain injures  that some IRFs may not be equipped to admit\u2014such as patients requiring  advance medical management and advanced level procedural services  and monitoring. Information provided by Shepherd Center indicated that,  in calendar year 2017, approximately 20 percent of all inpatients were  admitted to this unit and 13 percent of all inpatients were internally  transferred to this unit after developing medical complications. According  to officials, Craig Hospital does not have an intensive care unit, but noted  their ability to similarly care for medically complex patients\u2014including  telemetry (e.g., specialized heart monitoring) and one-to-one nursing  care, if necessary. Most stakeholders we interviewed agreed that both  qualifying hospitals\u2019 LTCH status provides certain advantages over IRFs,  such as the ability to admit some medically complex patients earlier in the  recovery process and longer lengths of stay. Stakeholders from most of  the IRFs we interviewed also reported having the flexibility to admit some  medically complex patients requiring more advanced level monitoring and  resources earlier in the recovery process\u2014such as patients with  disorders of consciousness.", "Officials from the two qualifying hospitals also said they offer a continuum  of care that can meet patient\u2019s changing needs, without the need to  transfer them to different facilities. Information provided by Craig Hospital  indicated that 83 percent of patients treated at its facility, in 2016, were  discharged to home, 13 percent were discharged to another post-acute  care facility, and 3 percent were discharged to an acute care hospital. In  2016, approximately 91 percent of patients treated at Shepherd Center  were discharged to home, 7 percent were discharged to another post- acute care facility, and 2 percent were discharged to an acute care  hospital. Information provided by the IRFs that responded to our written  request varied by facility, but\u2014similar to the two qualifying hospitals\u2014 each facility discharged more than 65 percent of patients to home.", "IRF payment criteria. CMS and most other stakeholders we interviewed  noted that two Medicare payment policies applicable to IRFs, but not  LTCHs, may contribute to their different patient populations. Specifically,  to be classified for payment under Medicare\u2019s IRF PPS, at least 60  percent of the IRF\u2019s total inpatient population must require intensive  rehabilitative treatment for one or more of 13 conditions\u2014which includes  both spinal cord and brain injury. To be admitted to an IRF, Medicare  beneficiaries must reasonably be expected to actively participate in and  benefit from the intensive rehabilitation therapy program, typically  provided in IRFs. According to HHS, per industry standard, the intensive  rehabilitation therapy program is often demonstrated by providing three  hours of rehabilitation services per day for at least five days per week, but  this is not the only way such intensity can be demonstrated. Officials  from the two qualifying hospitals told us they generally use Medicare\u2019s  intensive rehabilitation requirement as a minimum standard for their  rehabilitation patients\u2014even though they are not held to this requirement,  for the purposes of Medicare payment\u2014but noted that some of their  patients may not meet this requirement, due to their medical complexity.", "Length of stay and site-neutral payment requirements, for LTCHs. As  previously noted, LTCHs\u2014including the two qualifying hospitals\u2014must  have an average length of stay of greater than 25 days; IRFs are not  subject to this requirement. The average length of stay for patients  discharged from the Craig Hospital was about 60 days, in fiscal year  2016, and the average length of stay for patients discharged from  Shepherd Center was about 53 days, in calendar year 2016.", "Stakeholders from the IRFs that responded to our information request  reported average lengths of stay ranging from 14 to 31 days, for patients  discharged in fiscal year 2016; the ranges of lengths of stay were slightly  higher for spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury inpatients for the  IRFs, during the same period. LTCHs are also generally subject to site- neutral payment policy that is not applicable to IRFs and may decrease  LTCHs payments for certain discharges, under Medicare.", "Other services provided. In addition to these Medicare specific  differences, a few stakeholders we interviewed also noted the two  qualifying hospitals receive additional funding from their strong  philanthropic donor base that may allow them to provide other services  and resources, not covered by Medicare or offered at some IRFs. For  example, while a few IRFs that responded to our information request  reported offering housing for families of injured patients, the two qualifying  hospitals offer up to 30 days of free housing to families of newly injured  rehabilitation patients, if both the family and patient live more than 60  miles from the hospital. Officials from Shepherd Center told us their  revenues are supplemented by investment income and donor funds.  Craig Hospital has also established a foundation that supports the  hospital in achieving its goals through philanthropy."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS.

We first identified discharges at each hospital in  two baseline years\u2014federal fiscal years 2013 and 2016. We selected  fiscal year 2016 because it was the year with the most recent data  available at the time of our analysis, and we selected a second baseline  year because data for 2016 was different than data for other recent years.  For example, the number of discharges for one qualifying hospital  declined by nearly half between fiscal years 2013 and 2016. We chose  fiscal year 2013 because data from that year was used to help determine  which hospitals are subject to the temporary exception.", "To identify how to appropriately calculate the long-term care hospital  (LTCH) payment for each of these discharges in future payment years,  we reviewed applicable federal regulation and documents from the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Medicare  Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), and interviewed officials from  both organizations. See table 4 for the relevant components in the  formulas, such as Medicare severity long-term care diagnosis related  group (MS-LTC-DRG) weights, identified from final rule tables.", "When conducting these simulations, we made the following assumptions:", "For simulated payments for payment policies in effect for fiscal years  2017 and 2018, we used the base rates, relative weights (e.g., the  MS-LTC-DRG weights), geometric mean length of stay, wage index,  geographic adjustment factor, fixed-loss amounts, and outlier  thresholds that were published in the final rule tables for LTCH and  inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) hospitals\u2014also known  as acute care hospitals\u2014for each respective year. At the time we  began our analysis, this information was not known for fiscal years  2019 through 2021. We chose to use the fiscal year 2018 rates when  conducting simulations for payment policies in those years because  historical trends showed that annual changes were minimal\u2014about 1  percent. Therefore, to the extent that these values continue to change  over time, our findings may understate or overstate the amount that  the qualifying hospitals would have been paid in our baseline years  based on these future payment policies.", "The site-neutral payment policy did not apply to discharges from the  fiscal year 2013 baseline year. Therefore, we examined Medicare  claims data to determine whether each discharge would have met the  criteria to receive the LTCH standard rate in that year. Specifically, we  determined whether each discharge had an acute care hospital stay  that immediately preceded their LTCH stay. We then determined  whether the time at the acute care hospital included three or more  days in the intensive care unit or whether there was a code on the  LTCH claim that indicated at least 96 hours of mechanical ventilation  services were provided. Per Medicare\u2019s payment policy, we assumed  any discharge that met these two criteria would qualify for full LTCH  payment rate, unless the case was a psychiatric or rehabilitation stay,  as identified by the following MS-LTC-DRG codes: 876, 880, 881,  882, 883, 884, 885, 886, 887, 894, 895, 896, 897, 945, or 946.", "Under statute, unless 50 percent or more of the hospital\u2019s discharges  beginning during or after 2020 qualify for the standard rate, no  subsequent payments will be made to a hospital at that rate.  Therefore, when calculating simulated payments for fiscal year 2021,  we applied the 50 percent threshold. At the time of our analysis, CMS  had not yet finalized this policy through rule-making. As of November  2018, CMS officials told us that it is unlikely that any payment  adjustment under this provision would apply until 2022 because the  percentage cannot be determined until after an LTCH\u2019s cost reporting  period has ended and data have been submitted.", "Shepherd Center\u2019s fiscal year is different than the federal fiscal year.", "Therefore, the variables used to determine whether discharges in  federal fiscal year 2016 met criteria to receive the standard rate were  not available to use for some of the discharges that year. Of those  discharges, we assumed that the same percentage of discharges that  met the criteria to receive the standard rate in Shepherd\u2019s fiscal  year\u201430 percent\u2014met the criteria in federal fiscal year 2016.", "When calculating site-neutral payments, we assumed that each  discharge would be paid at a rate comparable to that for acute care  hospitals\u2014the IPPS comparable amount rate. Site-neutral payments  may also be based on the estimated cost-of-care, if it is lower than the  IPPS comparable amount rate. However, over 90 percent of  discharges at the qualifying hospitals were paid at the IPPS  comparable amount rate in fiscal year 2016.", "Per CMS\u2019s recommendation, we applied the cost-to-charge ratio that  was effective October 1, 2017, for each qualifying hospital, regardless  of discharge date. For Craig Hospital this value was 0.442 and for  Shepherd Center this value was 0.464.
