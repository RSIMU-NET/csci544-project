For example, the agencies have established measures to track program outputs, such as the percentage of servicemembers who have participated in TAP. However, the agencies' efforts to evaluate TAP results have focused on basic end-of-course evaluations and gauging servicemembers' readiness prior to separation instead of higher impact program evaluations, such as assessing the effectiveness of TAP on servicemembers 6 months after they have separated from the military. According to agency officials, such evaluations are being considered for certain components of TAP, but they could not provide GAO with a justification for including or excluding specific components of TAP in their evaluation planning efforts.", "Based on GAO's prior work and according to officials from the agencies and organizations GAO spoke with, a key remaining challenge for TAP may be the unfavorable timing and location of program delivery for National Guard and Reserve members. Unlike active duty servicemembers, National Guard and Reserve members receive TAP services closer to their transition and in locations that are generally neither where they work nor live. As a result, they may be distracted and have less time to benefit from TAP services.

According to Navy officials, they obtained funding and plan  to develop such a system by late June 2014 and plan to start using the  data for oversight no later than fiscal year 2015. Marine officials said that  because they have a long-standing culture of requiring servicemembers  to attend TAP training, such an oversight mechanism was not  necessary.

Their evaluation plan  includes (1) gauging participant reaction to all TAP components through  end-of-course evaluations and (2) determining whether servicemembers  met the career readiness standards prior to separation. Higher level  evaluations are also important to help gauge the effectiveness of TAP,  and the agencies have not demonstrated a strategic approach to planning  such evaluations. Since the program is administered by multiple  agencies, planning an evaluation is more challenging than if it were  administered by a single agency. In December 2011, the agencies stated,  in an internal report, that they would develop a methodology to assess the  effectiveness of TAP by engaging new veterans approximately six months  after they have separated from the military. Despite the modular nature of  TAP, this report did not specify whether this type of higher level  evaluation would assess all of TAP or certain components. DOL and VA  are considering higher level evaluations for the employment workshop  and VA benefits briefings. For example, DOL is considering different  methodologies it could use to conduct an impact evaluation of the  employment workshop.

Best practices call for the development of a written evaluation strategy,  which the agencies prepared for lower evaluation levels, but not for higher  levels.

DOD\u2019s policy generally requires all eligible servicemembers, including  members of the National Guard and Reserve, to be exposed to the entire  TAP experience even if their circumstances differ. Unlike active duty  servicemembers, many members of the National Guard and Reserve hold  civilian occupations, and federal law protects their employment rights  when they return from active duty. If they can document their civilian  employment or acceptance to an institution of higher education or  accredited technical training, members of the National Guard and  Reserve and other eligible servicemembers can be exempted from  attending the DOL employment workshop. Nevertheless, they are  generally required to complete pre-separation counseling, the VA benefits  I and II briefings and, under DOD policy, participate in the capstone  event. Further, the policy states that they must attend the DOD core  curriculum and applicable career specific tracks if they cannot meet the  career readiness standards associated with these two components.", "However, according to many stakeholders that we talked with, including  officials from the services and organizations that support members of the  National Guard and Reserve and other servicemembers, DOD has not  resolved long-standing concerns that eligible members of the National  Guard and Reserve attend TAP offerings in locations and on a timetable  that diminish their experience. Specifically, given that eligible National Guard and Reserve members generally demobilize at locations where  they neither work nor live, they may be distracted by their desire to return  home, which can affect how much the training benefits them. Separating  servicemembers need to be aware of the benefits and services and know  how to access them to take advantage of them, such as the Post-9/11 GI  Bill. In a January 2013 report, the Defense Business Board Task Group  recommended that eligible National Guard and Reserve members be  afforded the opportunity to demobilize and transition in their home unit\u2019s  geographical area. According to stakeholders, eligible National Guard  and Reserve members also typically have less time to complete the  program because they often demobilize more quickly than active duty  servicemembers separate. For example, according to DOD\u2019s 2011  Handbook, the Reserve demobilization timeline makes scheduling a pre- separation counseling appointment not later than 90 days prior to leaving  active duty impractical for Reserve members.", "According to officials from DOD and the services, they took steps to help  meet the needs of National Guard and Reserve members eligible for  TAP.

These eligible Army National Guard  members will remain on active duty while participating in these two  components.", "Nonetheless, DOD may not be well positioned to determine whether its  actions successfully address the long-standing challenges in designing  transition services for the National Guard and Reserve. This is because  while DOD collects participant feedback through the online assessment,  this tool does not ask whether the timing and location met the needs of  servicemembers, including the National Guard and Reserve. Moreover,  DOD\u2019s planned survey to active duty servicemembers contains questions  about the timing of TAP, but DOD has not drafted similar questions for its  survey to the National Guard and Reserve. According to OMB, being  able to track and measure specific program data can help agencies  diagnose problems, identify drivers of future performance, evaluate risk,  support collaboration, and inform follow-up actions.

The agencies undertook  an ambitious effort to redesign the 1990s-era program to provide  servicemembers with training and skills to successfully transition to  civilian life. The increase in the number of servicemembers attending the  revised TAP components, along with the significant coordination effort  among multiple agencies and military services, pose significant  implementation challenges. Efforts to implement the redesigned program  continue to evolve. The importance of serving the ongoing and projected  wave of servicemembers departing the military increases the urgency to  fully implement TAP components as well as to finalize related policies and  procedures. To the extent that the program remains behind schedule in  implementing TAP, some transitioning servicemembers may be denied  the full benefit of the revamped program. Because TAP is not fully  implemented, the full impact of the revamped TAP, particularly the warm  handover\u2014a key effort to serve those deemed at greater risk of not being  career ready\u2014remains to be seen.", "The revamped TAP exhibits elements important for the effective  implementation and evaluation of the program. Yet, we found room for  improvement in several key areas. In particular, while federal law  generally requires DOD to mandate participation in the employment  workshop and DOD policy requires that all eligible transitioning  servicemembers participate in TAP overall, the Navy and the Marines  lack the ability to provide unit commanders and their leaders with  information on participation levels of servicemembers under their  command. Without the capability to gauge and report participation in TAP  components by unit commander\u2014those directly responsible for ensuring  servicemember participation\u2014leaders may find that holding them  accountable is difficult.", "While the administration cites the revamped TAP as a key strategy of its  crosscutting goal to improve the career readiness of veterans, it may not  be positioned to determine the extent to which the program prepared  veterans to pursue their post-separation goals. Without a written  evaluation strategy that identifies the TAP components to be evaluated  and includes the appropriate level and timing of the evaluation methods,  the agencies may miss important opportunities to obtain information  needed to make fully informed decisions on whether and how to modify  TAP and may either over invest or under invest in evaluations.", "The circumstances of National Guard and Reserve members differ from  those of other active duty servicemembers. Many stakeholders have  raised concerns that these circumstances diminish eligible National  Guard and Reserve members\u2019 TAP experience.

To better ensure servicemember participation in and completion of  TAP, direct the Under Secretary for Personnel and Readiness to  require that all services provide unit commanders and their leaders  information on TAP participation levels of servicemembers under their  command, similar to that provided by the Army and Air Force. Such  information could be used to help hold leaders accountable for  ensuring TAP participation and completion.  2.  To provide information on the extent to which the revamped TAP is  effective, direct the Under Secretary for Personnel and Readiness to  work with the partner agencies to develop a written strategy for  determining which components and tracks to evaluate and the most  appropriate evaluation methods. This strategy should include a plan to  use the results of evaluations to modify or redesign the program, as  appropriate.  3.  To ensure that decisions about the participation of eligible members of  the National Guard and Reserves in TAP are fully informed, direct the  Under Secretary for Personnel and Readiness to systematically  collect information on any challenges facing demobilizing members of  the National Guard and Reserves regarding the logistics of the timing  and location to attend TAP.

In its comments, DOD agreed with one recommendation and  disagreed with the other two recommendations. VA generally agreed with  our findings. Written comments from DOD and VA are reproduced in  appendices III and IV. DOL and SBA did not provide comments, but all  four agencies provided technical comments, which we incorporated into  the final report as appropriate.", "DOD agreed with our recommendation to work with partner agencies to  develop a written strategy for determining which components and tracks  to evaluate and the most appropriate evaluation methods. DOD stated  that it will continue to support interagency collaboration, which, as of  January 31, 2014, has been formalized in a memorandum of  understanding among the agencies administering TAP.", "DOD disagreed with our recommendation to require that all of the  services provide unit commanders and their leaders information on TAP  participation levels of servicemembers under their command. DOD stated  that we justified the need for a mechanism to ensure a servicemember\u2019s  completion of TAP by commander based on concerns that without such a  mechanism, commanders will not support the release of servicemembers  to attend TAP. DOD also said that these concerns are based on  observations that preceded full implementation of the capstone event. In  October 2013, DOD launched the capstone as a mandatory process by  which commanders verify TAP participation and positively affirm that  servicemembers have or have not met career readiness standards. In  addition, DOD said that capstone event implementation was  accompanied by a communications campaign to inform both commanders  and the services\u2019 TAP providers of this key requirement. Finally, DOD  said that capstone event completion is monitored departmentwide to  ensure compliance.", "We agree with DOD that departmentwide monitoring of capstone event  completion is an important element in helping ensure compliance.  However, such monitoring does not provide routine information to  commanders and their leaders and not all TAP locations will be monitored  routinely. As noted in our report, based on the pilot of the capstone event  last fall, DOD reported that ensuring servicemember participation in  capstone events was a challenge for most of the services (with the  exception of the Air Force), adding that this challenge is possibly due in  part to lack of commanders\u2019 support. Commander support for the program  has been a long-standing challenge for the program. Therefore, we  continue to believe that our recommendation is needed because it would  establish an accountability mechanism for TAP that mirrors the level at  which responsibility has been assigned. DOD has assigned unit  commanders the responsibility of ensuring that eligible servicemembers  have full access to and successfully complete required TAP components.  Providing information to unit commanders and their leaders on TAP  participation levels of servicemembers under their command\u2014similar to  that provided by the Army and Air Force\u2014could thus promote  accountability and oversight. Servicemember participation in TAP is  generally required by law and DOD policy, and also relates to a Cross- Agency Priority Goal, which reinforces the need for an appropriate  accountability mechanism.", "DOD also stated that the Navy is funding IT system upgrades to provide  the ability to analyze and report program compliance at the command  level. DOD added that the Marine Corps has mandated participation since  the program's inception, and Marine Corps commanders leverage the  capabilities of the personnel system to identify eligible Marines and  schedule their TAP attendance. DOD stated that despite the limitations of  a data tracking system that underreports compliance figures, the Marine  Corps had the highest compliance rate of all services, as of December  2013. DOD said it recommends that department-wide compliance data be  allowed to normalize to show true compliance percentages before the  services are required to fund and implement expensive systems for the  sole purpose of providing an additional mechanism for commander  accountability. However, we continue to believe that our recommendation  is needed. Three of the services either have or are working to develop the  kind of accountability mechanism that we are recommending, but the  Marine Corps does not plan to develop such a system. While DOD  reports that the Marine Corps has the highest TAP compliance rate of all  services, DOD did not provide any data on these rates. Finally, in  response to DOD\u2019s recommendation to wait until compliance data  normalize, we believe that this would not be appropriate. We do not see  any advantage to delaying the implementation of appropriate  accountability mechanisms to provide assurance that the ongoing and  projected wave of servicemembers departing the military receive the  expected level of services from TAP.", "DOD disagreed with our recommendation to systematically collect  information on challenges facing demobilizing members of the National  Guard and Reserve regarding the timing and location to attend TAP.  Specifically, DOD stated that it has long understood that the National  Guard and Reserves operate under schedules and logistical constraints  that differ from those of active duty servicemembers. DOD stated that  several processes (which we note in our report) are already in place to  identity and rectify any misalignments between TAP services and the  needs of eligible National Guard and Reserve members, including regular  coordinating councils that include representation from the National Guard  and Reserve and TAP managers, as well as a participant assessment  that provides ample opportunity for eligible National Guard and Reserve  members to voice concerns. In addition, DOD highlighted the  implementation of the military life cycle transition model in which DOD  plans to provide the services, including to the National Guard and  Reserve, with the latitude to optimize placement of certain elements of  TAP throughout a servicemember's military service. According to DOD,  the military life cycle transition model may help address some of the  challenges related to the timing and location of program delivery. As we  note in the report, full implementation of the military life cycle transition  model is planned by October 2014.", "Nonetheless, at this time DOD is not fully positioned to know whether or  not the revamped program addresses the long-standing challenges facing  eligible members of the National Guard and Reserve in taking TAP. As  we describe in the report, all eligible servicemembers, including the  National Guard and Reserve members, have an opportunity to provide  feedback about the instruction, content, and facilities for TAP. However,  the participant assessment does not ask questions specific to the  National Guard and Reserve experience even though they face different  circumstances than active duty servicemembers. Given these differences,  we continue to believe that unless DOD systematically collects  information on any challenges facing eligible members of the National  Guard and Reserve, DOD is at risk of not fully knowing whether the  revamped TAP addresses long-standing challenges. In addition, the  move to a military life cycle transition model could enable active duty  servicemembers and members of the National Guard and Reserve to  benefit from transition-related assistance throughout their military service.  Recognizing that the military life cycle transition model is not implemented  and specific policies and plans are not completed, many unknowns  remain about how it will work in general and how National Guard and  Reserve members will fare specifically.
