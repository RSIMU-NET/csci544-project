A substantial portion of this assistance was directed to emergency assistance and meeting short-term needs arising from the hurricanes, leaving a smaller portion for longer-term rebuilding. To understand the long-term financial implications of Gulf Coast rebuilding, it is helpful to view potential federal assistance within the context of overall estimates of the damages incurred by the region. Some estimates put capital losses at a range of $70 billion to more than $150 billion, while the state of Louisiana estimated that the economic effect on its state alone could reach $200 billion. These estimates raise questions regarding how much additional assistance may be needed to help the Gulf Coast continue to rebuild, and who should be responsible for providing the related resources. Demands for additional federal resources to rebuild the Gulf Coast are likely to continue. The bulk of federal rebuilding assistance provided to the Gulf Coast states funds two key programs--the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Public Assistance (PA) program and the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. In addition to funding PA and CDBG, the federal government's recovery and rebuilding assistance also includes payouts from the National Flood Insurance Program as well as funds for levee restoration and repair, coastal wetlands and barrier islands restoration, and benefits provided through Gulf Opportunity Zone tax expenditures. As states and localities continue to rebuild, there are difficult policy decisions that will confront Congress about the federal government's continued contribution to the rebuilding effort and the role it might play over the long-term in an era of competing priorities. GAO's ongoing and preliminary work on Gulf Coast rebuilding suggests the following questions: How much could it ultimately cost to rebuild the Gulf Coast and how much of this cost should the federal government bear? How effective are current funding delivery mechanisms--such as PA and CDBG--and should they be modified or supplemented by other mechanisms? What options exist to effectively build in federal oversight to accompany the receipt of federal funds, particularly as federal funding has shifted from emergency response to rebuilding? How can the federal government further partner with state and local governments and the nonprofit and private sectors to leverage public investment in rebuilding?

The Gulf Coast and the nation continue to face  daunting rebuilding costs, uncertainty surrounding numerous decisions  linked to the availability of federal funds, and the complexity of integrating  multiple public and private decisions that will influence the future of the  region. The size and scope of the devastation caused by the Gulf Coast  hurricanes presents the nation with unprecedented rebuilding challenges  as well as opportunities to reexamine shared responsibility among all  levels of government. Wide swaths of housing, infrastructure, and  businesses were destroyed, leaving more than 1,500 people dead and  hundreds of thousands of others displaced without shelter and  employment. Our ongoing work in Mississippi, southern Louisiana, and  New Orleans confirms that some communities still lack fulfillment of basic  needs, such as schools, hospitals, and other infrastructure, while the doors  of many businesses remain closed. Almost 2 years since the hurricanes  made landfall, many Gulf Coast neighborhoods and communities still need  to be rebuilt\u2014some from the ground up.", "Major decisions still need to be made regarding infrastructure, housing,  levee protection, coastal restoration, and economic recovery, among other  issues.

These  observations may assist you in your oversight of these activities\u2014now and  over the longer term. I would like to: (1) place the federal assistance  provided to date in the context of varied damage estimates for the Gulf  Coast; and (2) discuss the key federal programs that provide rebuilding  assistance, with an emphasis on Public Assistance (PA) and Community  Development Block Grants (CDBG). In doing so, we will highlight aspects  of Gulf Coast rebuilding likely to place continued demands on federal  resources.", "My statement is based largely on our completed and ongoing work in  Washington, D.C., as well as Louisiana and Mississippi\u2014the two states  most directly affected by the Gulf Coast hurricanes. Specifically, we  analyzed state and local documentation related to funding for rebuilding  and interviewed state and local officials as well as representatives from  nongovernmental organizations in these two states. We also interviewed  various federal officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and  the Coordinator of Federal Support for the Recovery and Rebuilding of the  Gulf Coast Region within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  and analyzed federal regulations and state policies regarding funding for  the Gulf Coast.

To understand the long-term federal financial implications of Gulf  Coast rebuilding it is helpful to view potential federal assistance within the  context of overall estimates of the damages incurred by the region.  Although there are no definitive or authoritative estimates of the amount  of federal funds that could be invested to rebuild the Gulf Coast, various  estimates of aspects of rebuilding offer a sense of the long-term financial  implications. For example, early damage estimates from the Congressional  Budget Office (CBO) put capital losses from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  at a range of $70 billion to $130 billion while another estimate put losses  solely from Hurricane Katrina\u2014including capital losses\u2014at more than  $150 billion. Further, the state of Louisiana has estimated that the  economic effect on its state alone could reach $200 billion. The exact costs  of damages from the Gulf Coast hurricanes may never be known, but will  likely far surpass those from the three other costliest disasters in recent  history\u2014Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the 1994 Northridge earthquake, and  the September 2001 terrorist attacks.

The bulk of this assistance was provided between September  2005 and May 2007 through five emergency supplemental appropriations.  A substantial portion of this assistance was directed to emergency  assistance and meeting short-term needs arising from the hurricanes, such  as relocation assistance, emergency housing, immediate levee repair, and  debris removal efforts. The Brookings Institution has estimated that  approximately $35 billion of the federal resources provided supports  longer-term rebuilding efforts.", "The federal funding I have mentioned presents an informative, but likely  incomplete picture of the federal government\u2019s total financial investments  to date. Tracking total funds provided for federal Gulf Coast rebuilding  efforts requires knowledge of a host of programs administered by multiple  federal agencies. We previously reported that the federal government does  not have a governmentwide framework or mechanism in place to collect  and consolidate information from the individual federal agencies that  received appropriations in emergency supplementals for hurricane relief  and recovery efforts or to report on this information. It is important to  provide transparency by collecting and publishing this information so that  hurricane victims, affected states, and American taxpayers know how  these funds are being spent.

After the President declares a  disaster, a state becomes eligible for federal PA funds through FEMA\u2019s  Disaster Relief Fund. Officials at the local, state, and federal level are  involved in the PA process in a variety of ways. The grant applicant, such  as a local government or nonprofit organization, works with state and  FEMA officials to develop a scope of work and cost estimate for each  project that is documented in individual project worksheets. In addition to  documenting scope of work and cost considerations, each project  worksheet is reviewed by FEMA and the state to determine whether the  applicant and type of facility are eligible for funding. Once approved, funds  are obligated, that is, made available, to the state. PA generally operates on  a reimbursement basis. Reimbursement for small projects (up to $59,700)  are made based on the project\u2019s estimated costs, while large projects  (more than $59,700) are reimbursed based upon actual eligible costs when  they are incurred.", "As of the middle of July 2007, FEMA had approved a total of 67,253 project  worksheets for emergency and permanent work, making available about  $8.2 billion in PA grants to the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and  Alabama. A smaller portion of PA program funds are going toward longer- term rebuilding activities than emergency work. Of the approximately $8.2  billion made available to the Gulf Coast states overall, about $3.4 billion  (41 percent) is for permanent work such as repairing and rebuilding  schools and hospitals and reestablishing sewer and water systems, while  about $4.6 billion (56 percent) is for emergency response work such as  clearing roads for access and sandbagging low-lying areas. The remaining  amount of PA funds, about $0.2 billion (3 percent) is for administrative  costs. (See fig. 1.) Of the funds made available by FEMA to the states for  permanent rebuilding, localities have only received a portion of these  funds since many projects have not yet been completed. Specifically, in  Louisiana and Mississippi, 26 and 22 percent of obligated funds,  respectively, have been paid by the state to applicants for these projects.", "The total cost of PA funding for the Gulf Coast hurricanes will likely  exceed the approximately $8.2 billion already made available to the states  for two reasons: (1) the funds do not reflect all current and future projects,  and (2) the cost of some of these projects will likely be higher than  FEMA\u2019s original estimates. According to FEMA, as of the middle of July  2007, an additional 1,916 project worksheets were in process (these  projects are in addition to the 67,253 approved project worksheets  mentioned above). FEMA expects that another 2,730 project worksheets  will be written. FEMA expects these worksheets to increase the total cost  by about $2.1 billion, resulting in a total expected PA cost of about $10.3  billion.", "Some state and local officials have also expressed concerns about  unrealistically low cost estimates contained in project worksheets, which  could lead to even higher than anticipated costs to the federal government.  A senior official within the Louisiana Governor\u2019s Office of Homeland  Security and Emergency Preparedness recently testified that some of the  projects were underestimated by a factor of 4 or 5 times compared to the  actual cost. For example, the lowest bids on 11 project worksheets for  repairing or rebuilding state-owned facilities, such as universities and  hospitals, totaled $5.5 million while FEMA approved $1.9 million for these  projects.", "The extent to which the number of new project worksheets and actual  costs that exceed estimated costs will result in demands for additional  federal funds remains unknown. In addition, PA costs may increase until a  disaster is closed, which can take many years in the case of a catastrophic  disaster. For instance, PA costs from the Northridge earthquake that hit  California in January 1994 have not been closed out more than 13 years  after the event.

Congress has provided even greater flexibility when allocating additional  CDBG funds to affected communities and states to help them recover from  presidentially-declared disasters, such as the Gulf Coast hurricanes. To  date, the affected Gulf Coast states have received $16.7 billion in CDBG  funding from supplemental appropriations\u2014so far, the largest federal  provider of long-term Gulf Coast rebuilding funding.

As shown in figure 4,  Louisiana set aside about $6.3 billion of these funds to develop the  homeowner assistance component of the program and nearly $1.7 billion  for rental, low-income housing, and other housing-related projects.  Louisiana anticipated that FEMA would provide the homeowner  assistance component with another $1.2 billion in grant assistance.  Louisiana based these funding amounts on estimates of need within the  state. Accordingly, Louisiana estimated that $7.5 billion would be needed  to assist 114,532 homeowners with major or severe damage. Louisiana also  estimated these funds would provide an average grant award of $60,109  per homeowner.", "The LRA launched the Road Home homeowner assistance program in  August 2006. Under the program, homeowners who decide to stay in  Louisiana and rebuild are eligible for the full amount of grant assistance\u2014 up to $150,000. Aside from the elderly, residents who choose to sell their  homes and leave the state will have their grant awards reduced by 40  percent, while residents who did not have insurance at the time of the  hurricanes will have their grant awards reduced by 30 percent. To receive  compensation, homeowners must comply with applicable code and zoning  requirements and FEMA advisory base flood elevations when rebuilding  and agree to use their home as a primary residence at some point during a  3-year period following closing. Further, the amount of compensation that  homeowners can receive depends on the value of their homes before the  storms and the amount of flood or wind damage that was not covered by  insurance or other forms of assistance.", "As of July 16, 2007, the Road Home program had received 158,489  applications and had held 36,655 closings with an average award amount  of $74,216. With the number of applications exceeding initial estimates and  average award amounts higher than expected, recent concerns have been  raised about a potential funding shortfall and the Road Home program\u2019s  ability to achieve its objective of compensating all eligible homeowners.  Concerns over the potential shortfall have led to questions about the Road  Home program\u2019s policy to pay for uninsured wind damage instead of  limiting compensation to flood damage. In recent congressional hearings,  the Executive Director of the LRA testified that the Road Home program  will require additional funds to compensate all eligible homeowners, citing  a higher than projected number of homeowners applying to the program,  higher costs for homeowner repairs, and a smaller percentage of private  insurance payouts than expected.", "According to the Federal Coordinator for Gulf Coast Rebuilding, CDBG  funds were allocated to Louisiana on the basis of a negotiation with the  state conducted between January and February 2006. That negotiation  considered the provision of federal funding for the state\u2019s need to conduct  a homeowner assistance program covering homes that experienced major  or severe damage from flooding. The state requested the allocation of  federal funding at that time to expand the program to assist homeowners  who experienced only wind damage. That request to provide federal funds  to establish a homeowner program for homes which only experienced  wind damage was denied, as were similar requests from Gulf Coast states  such as Texas. The Administration requested the negotiated amount from  Congress on February 15, 2006. Congress approved that amount and it was  signed into law by the President on June 15, 2006. Subsequently, Louisiana  announced the expansion of the Road Home program to cover damage  exclusively from wind regardless of the stated intention of the federal  allocation, but fully within their statutory authority.", "In addition, the Executive Director of the LRA testified that Louisiana had  not received $1.2 billion in funds from FEMA\u2014assistance that had been  part of the Road Home program\u2019s original funding design. Specifically, the  state expected FEMA to provide grant assistance through its Hazard  Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP)\u2014a program that generally provides  assistance to address long-term community safety needs. Louisiana had  planned to use this funding to assist homeowners with meeting elevation  standards and other storm protection measures, as they rebuilt their  homes. However, FEMA has asserted that it cannot release the money  because the Road Home program discriminates against younger residents.  Specifically, the program exempts elderly recipients from the 40 percent  grant reduction if they choose to leave the state or do not agree to reside  in their home as a primary residence at some point during a 3-year period.", "Although we have not assessed their assumptions, recent estimates from  the Road Home program and Louisiana\u2019s state legislative auditor\u2019s office  have estimated a potential shortfall in the range of $2.9 billion to $5 billion.", "While these issues will not be immediately resolved, they raise a number  of questions about the potential demands for additional federal funding for  the states\u2019 rebuilding efforts.

Disputes over coverage between policyholders and property-casualty  insurers from the 2005 hurricane season highlight the challenges of  determining the appropriateness of claims for multiple-peril events.
