The federal government does not have a single definition of terrorism, and agencies use different terms to describe protective and deterrent programs and activities and countermeasures against the threat of terrorist attack.U.S. policy and strategy for dealing with terrorism, along with the nature and perception of the terrorist threat, has been evolving since the 1970s. A variety of presidential directives, implementing guidance, executive orders, interagency agreements, and legislation provide the complex framework for the programs and activities to combat terrorism in more than 40 federal agencies, bureaus, and offices. Formal interagency coordination is managed at the National Security Council (NSC), which also sponsors a number of interagency working groups on certain terrorism matters. For intelligence issues related to terrorism, the Community Counterterrorism Board\u2019s Interagency Intelligence Committee on Terrorism is the mechanism for interagency coordination among U.S. military, regulatory, law enforcement, and intelligence agencies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Threat of Terrorism at Home and Abroad", "paragraphs": ["While the number of terrorist incidents both worldwide and in the United States has declined in recent years, the level of violence and lethality of attacks has increased. The State Department reported that the number of international terrorist incidents has fallen from a peak of 665 in 1987 to 296 in 1996, a 25-year low. Of the 296 international incidents during 1996, 73 were against U.S. persons and facilities overseas. But casualties resulting from international terrorist incidents during 1996 were among the highest ever recorded\u2014311 persons killed and 2,652 wounded. Of those, 24 Americans were killed and 250 Americans were wounded. Similarly, between 1989 and the end of 1993, there were 23 recorded acts of terrorism in the United States, and for 1995, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported only one domestic terrorist incident in the United States\u2014the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City. That incident\u2014the most destructive ever on U.S. soil\u2014killed 168 and wounded 500 persons. Figure 1.1 shows State Department statistics on U.S. casualties of international terrorism from 1991 through 1996, and figure 1.2 shows FBI statistics on domestic terrorist incidents in the United States from 1980 through 1995.", "In its annual report on international terrorism, the State Department noted a continuing trend toward more ruthless attacks on mass civilian targets and the use of more powerful bombs. State also noted that finding clear patterns in terrorism is becoming more difficult. The FBI\u2019s most recent report discussing domestic U.S. terrorism notes an upsurge in rhetoric from domestic right-wing extremist groups, many members of which believe they are being displaced by the rapidly changing U.S. culture, or hate or fear of the federal government. Also, the intelligence community has issued classified National Intelligence Estimates on the terrorist threat.", "In 1995 and 1996, about one-fourth of international terrorist attacks were against U.S. targets, and historically, the United States has not been immune from terrorist acts. However, certain key, large-scale incidents at home and abroad since 1993 have dramatically raised the profile of U.S. vulnerability to terrorist attack. For example, the February 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City raised the specter of foreign terrorism in the United States. The April 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City turned attention to domestic sources of terrorist threats and violence. The June 1996 truck bombing of a U.S. military housing facility near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, prompted a reexamination of DOD programs to protect its forces and installations overseas. The 1995 terrorist use of a nerve agent in the Tokyo subway elevated concerns about the greater likelihood of terrorist\u2019s use of weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, biological, and chemical) and the need to shore up U.S. federal and cities\u2019 capabilities to respond to and manage such incidents.", "One expert noted there are three schools of thought on the terrorist threat: (1) some believe the threat and likelihood of terrorist attack is very low and does not pose a serious risk ; (2) others believe the threat and likelihood of terrorist attack is high and could seriously disrupt the U.S. national and economic security; and (3) still others believe assessments of the threat and vulnerability to terrorist attack need to be accompanied by risk assessments to rationally guide the allocation of resources and attention. The expert further stated that such risk assessments would include analyses of vulnerability and susceptibility to terrorist attack and the severity of potential damage.", "According to U.S. intelligence agencies, conventional explosives continue to be the weapon of choice for terrorists. Although the probability of their use may increase over time, chemical and biological materials are less likely terrorist weapons because they are more difficult to weaponize and the results are unpredictable.

Because of this broader definition, the FBI includes in its annual reports on terrorism in the United States acts such as bombings, arson, kidnapping, assaults, and hijackings committed by persons who may be suspected of associating with militia groups, animal rights groups, and others.", "Federal agencies also use different terms to describe their programs and activities for combating terrorism. For example, FBI uses \u201ccounterterrorism\u201d to refer to the full range of its activities directed against terrorism, including preventive and crisis management efforts. On the other hand, DOD uses the term \u201ccounterterrorism\u201d to refer to offensive measures to prevent, deter, and respond to terrorist attack and \u201cantiterrorism\u201d to cover defensive measures to reduce the vulnerability of individuals and property to terrorist acts.

The directive was primarily focused on crisis response to terrorist incidents abroad. It tasked an NSC sponsored Interagency Working Group to coordinate the national response and designated lead federal agencies to respond to and resolve terrorist incidents overseas and domestically.

It also reaffirms lead agency responsibilities for responding to domestic (FBI, through the Department of Justice) and international (State Department) terrorist incidents, and for managing the consequences of domestic terrorist attacks (Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)). PDD 39 further charges the State Department to work closely with other governments to carry out U.S. policy to combat terrorist threats. The PDD also states that agencies directed to participate in operations and activities to combat terrorism shall bear the cost of their participation, unless otherwise directed by the President. It further directs the Director, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to report on the adequacy of funding for programs related to combating terrorism and assigns OMB ongoing responsibility to ensure that certain technology research, development, and acquisition efforts associated with efforts to combat terrorism are adequately funded.", "On reducing vulnerabilities, PDD 39 directed the Attorney General to identify and review the vulnerability to terrorist attack of critical national infrastructures, such as telecommunications, transportation, and banking and financial institutions. The Attorney General identified eight critical infrastructures that, if attacked, could significantly affect the national and/or economic security. This review resulted in Executive Order 13010 on protection of the critical infrastructure, which formed a government-private sector commission to further review vulnerabilities and propose solutions, as appropriate. In addition, all department and agency heads have been directed to ensure that their personnel and facilities are protected against terrorism. These efforts to identify vulnerabilities and protect persons and facilities are further discussed in chapter 2.", "For crisis management, the PDD also discusses interagency, multidisciplinary Domestic and Foreign Emergency Support Teams, DEST and FEST. These quick-response teams are to include expertise and capabilities that are tailored to the specific conditions of the threat or incident, including WMD. For domestic terrorist incidents, the Attorney General, through the FBI, is to lead the operational response, while also performing law enforcement and investigative efforts to pursue, apprehend, and punish the terrorist perpetrators as criminals. The goal is to terminate terrorist attacks before the terrorists can accomplish their objectives or to capture them, while seeking to minimize damage and loss of life and provide emergency assistance. For international terrorist incidents, the Secretary of State is to lead U.S. crisis management abroad. These interagency teams and the federal role in responding to and managing terrorist crises are further discussed in chapter 3.", "The PDD also directed FEMA to ensure the Federal Response Plan is adequate for consequence management activities in response to terrorist attacks against large U.S. populations, including those in which weapons of mass destruction are involved.

The group deals with issues relating to each agency\u2019s exercise objectives, discusses after-action report items and lessons learned that have an impact on interagency operations, and plans future exercises. The Technical Support Working Group coordinates certain research and development activities across the antiterrorism/counterterrorism community in seven categories of terrorism-related products. The seven categories are: (1) assault support, (2) explosive detection and disposal, (3) investigative support and forensics, (4) personnel protection, (5) physical security and infrastructure protection, (6) surveillance collection and operations support, and (7) WMD countermeasures. While the group is to coordinate and ensure against duplication of about $30 million in terrorism-related projects, it is not responsible for oversight, coordination, or ensuring against duplication of the full range of research and development efforts in these fields governmentwide. Projects in the Technical Support Working Group\u2019s purview represent a minor share of all terrorism-related research and development being conducted across the federal government.
