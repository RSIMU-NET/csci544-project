However, after conducting an audit in 2013, DOD determined that 680 of its civilian employees had erroneously received LQA. Most erroneous LQA payments were attributed to misinterpretations of eligibility requirements. This determination was based in part on a 2011 interpretation of a DSSR eligibility requirement for LQA by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which settles federal employee compensation claims. After the audit, DOD issued a memorandum and point paper to implement OPM's interpretation and clarify LQA eligibility requirements. DOD is also updating its LQA Instruction, DOD Instruction 1400.25, Volume 1250, to incorporate OPM's 2011 interpretation. Some DOD components also issued clarifying guidance and adopted new procedures for making LQA eligibility determinations. For example, U.S. Air Forces in Europe developed a flow chart to help human resource specialists determine whether overseas job applicants are eligible for LQA. DOD's LQA Instruction directs DOD components to conduct periodic quality assurance reviews of LQA eligibility and payments, but according to DOD and component officials, they have not consistently done so.

However, the draft LQA Instruction we reviewed also  includes a proposal to eliminate LQA for DOD civilian employees hired  overseas unless a Service Secretary or equivalent grants an exception.

In the memorandum, the Army Civilian  Human Resources Agency explained that the Department of the Army  had been interpreting DOD\u2019s LQA Instruction to mean that a physical  presence overseas during time of recruitment (that is, from the time of  application to a job offer), for any reason, disqualified a job applicant from  meeting the definition of a U.S. hire.

Specifically, it  clarified that a job applicant should be considered to physically reside in  the United States and considered a U.S. hire if he or she takes a vacation  outside the United States, travels outside the United States on a  temporary duty assignment, or is deployed overseas as a reservist or  National Guard member during the time of recruitment. In addition, the  policy advisory stated that reservists and National Guard members  deployed overseas benefit from the provisions afforded by the Uniformed  Service Employment and Reemployment Rights Act when determinations  are made as to whether they are recruited from the United States, and  they should be allowed employment benefits that would accrue as if a  deployment had not occurred. Regarding the issue of U.S. hire, the  policy advisory stated that it was DCPAS\u2019s intent for personnel physically  residing in the United States before being deployed overseas to be  considered for LQA eligibility as if they were not deployed.", "The definition of a U.S. hire in DOD\u2019s September 2013 policy advisory  appears to conflict with OPM\u2019s interpretation of the DSSR in  compensation claim decisions since at least 2012.

However, officials told us that they have since recognized such a conflict  may exist. As a result, DCPAS is currently soliciting DOD components\u2019  views on the definition of a U.S. hire. DCPAS officials stated that if DOD  components support the definition in DOD\u2019s policy advisory, then DCPAS  will determine with senior DOD officials whether to discuss the matter with  State and request a revision to the DSSR that reflects the definition in  DOD\u2019s policy advisory. (This issue is discussed in greater detail later in  the report.) They explained that if the components or senior officials do  not support the definition in DOD\u2019s policy advisory, then the definition in  the updated LQA Instruction will invalidate the policy advisory\u2019s  interpretation and no further action would be necessary. As of April 2015,  DCPAS had not yet decided which definition will be included in DOD\u2019s  updated LQA Instruction. According to DCPAS officials, they discussed  the definition of a U.S. hire with OPM in April 2015, at which time OPM  officials agreed that DCPAS should discuss with State revising the DSSR  if DOD continues to use its September 2013 policy advisory.

DCPAS officials  explained that they became aware of issues with LQA eligibility  determinations in the EUCOM area of responsibility approximately in May  2012, shortly after the February 2012 LQA Instruction with the new  requirement for ongoing quality assurance reviews was issued. DCPAS  officials chose not to have DOD components begin conducting the  periodic quality assurance reviews because they anticipated that the  components would soon be involved in what became the 2013 LQA audit.", "DCPAS officials told us that they added this requirement in response to one of the  recommendations in the DOD Inspector General\u2019s report, although it differs from the  actual recommendation for the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Civilian Personnel  Policy to conduct the review of DOD components.

Of particular concern are the DSSR requirements related to  \u201csubstantially continuous employment by such employer\u201d and the  definition of a U.S. hire, as discussed earlier.", "Officials from one military service component command, as well as  regional and local human resource offices in the EUCOM and  PACOM areas of responsibility, told us that the DSSR requirement for  \u201csubstantially continuous employment by such employer\u201d remains  unclear, even after the 2013 LQA audit. In particular, the DSSR has  not been modified to explicitly reflect OPM\u2019s single employer  interpretation. Officials we spoke with at the service component  command and local human resource office levels stated that even if  DOD\u2019s LQA Instruction was updated to include the single employer  interpretation, as previously discussed, it would still be helpful to  revise the DSSR to clarify the phrase \u201csubstantially continuous  employment by such employer,\u201d since local human resource  specialists routinely use both the LQA Instruction and the DSSR to  make LQA eligibility determinations.", "Officials from the military department headquarters, military service  component commands, and regional and local human resource  offices in the EUCOM and PACOM areas of responsibility informed us  that the DSSR\u2019s U.S. hire definition should be updated to reflect  modern travel and Internet access realities, temporary duty  assignments, and the overseas deployment of reservists and National  Guard members. DCPAS\u2019s definition of a U.S. hire in its September  2013 policy advisory to the Army attempts to update the definition  within DOD, as previously discussed, but it may also expand the  DSSR\u2019s LQA eligibility requirements, thereby exceeding DOD\u2019s  authority according to OPM\u2019s interpretation of the DSSR.", "State officials told us that, although there is no requirement for State to  proactively review the DSSR and assess the need for revisions, there  have been occasions when State collaborated with other federal  agencies\u2014including DOD\u2014on eligibility issues for overseas allowances.  According to State officials, they have done so when other federal  agencies have initiated the collaboration. For example, in 2014, DCPAS  officials requested that State\u2019s Office of Allowances consider revising a  provision within the DSSR relating to the separate maintenance  allowance. Previously, if the overseas employee was a former military  member whose family had access to military commissary and exchange  facilities, the separate maintenance allowance provided was reduced by  10 percent. DCPAS officials communicated to State that former military  members and their families appeared to be unfairly penalized by this  requirement. In response to DCPAS\u2019s request, State reviewed the  proposed revision and sent it to other federal agencies for comment.  Neither the other federal agencies nor State\u2019s legal counsel had any  substantive objections to the proposed amendment, so the DSSR was  updated in January 2015. DCPAS officials told us they requested that  State revise this provision of the DSSR because it was negatively  affecting a specific class of DOD employees.", "State officials also told us that they initiated an internal review of the  DSSR in early 2015. The review encompasses offices within State\u2014such  as the Office of Overseas Schools\u2014and is intended to provide State\u2019s  Office of Allowances with suggestions for revisions or updates to sections  of the DSSR that those offices routinely use. Once the Office of  Allowances receives all internal suggestions, officials told us that they  intend to compile a list of proposed changes to the DSSR and share them  with other agencies, including DOD, for comment. The officials told us  that when they send this list to other agencies, they plan to ask whether  the agencies have any other suggestions for revising the DSSR. State  officials indicated that they expect this review to be completed by the end  of 2015.", "Notwithstanding the example cited above, and the concerns about LQA  eligibility raised by the DOD component officials with whom we spoke,  DCPAS officials stated that they have not yet discussed with State their  concerns related to the DSSR, particularly with regard to OPM\u2019s single  employer interpretation and the definition of a U.S. hire. According to  DCPAS officials, they did not feel the need to collaborate with State to  discuss modifications to the requirement for \u201csubstantially continuous  employment by such employer\u201d in the DSSR because they believe that  updating DOD\u2019s LQA Instruction would be sufficient to resolve any  ambiguity. However, DOD component officials we interviewed who  determined LQA eligibility told us that updating DOD\u2019s LQA Instruction  and revising the DSSR is needed to help ensure consistent eligibility  determinations as both documents are considered in making such  determinations. DCPAS officials also stated that they have not discussed  with State their concerns with the DSSR\u2019s definition of a U.S. hire or  requested a potential revision of the DSSR definition because, as  previously discussed, they have not yet made a decision about whether  the definition in the September 2013 policy advisory will be included in  DOD\u2019s updated LQA Instruction.", "While federal agencies are not required to collaborate with State about  questions related to LQA eligibility requirements, the Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government state that, in addition to  internal communications, management should ensure that there are  adequate means of communicating with, and obtaining information from,  external stakeholders who may have a significant effect on the federal  agency achieving its goals.

One of these practices  is to establish compatible policies, procedures, and other means to  operate across federal agency boundaries. Frequent communication  among collaborating agencies is another means to facilitate working  across agency boundaries.

OPM officials added that, under some  circumstances, they send compensation claim decisions to other offices  higher in the employee\u2019s chain of command. To make compensation  claim decisions more widely available, OPM maintains a public website  on which it can post compensation claim decisions. This website is the  primary means by which federal agencies could learn of compensation  claim decisions involving another federal agency that could have  implications for LQA eligibility determinations. However, until recently  OPM did not post its compensation claim decisions on its website for the  years 2003 through 2012. This is because, according to OPM officials,  they lacked the funds needed during that 10-year period to comply with  the statutory requirement that federal agencies make their electronic and  information technology accessible to individuals with disabilities. OPM  compensation claim decisions could not be posted unless they were  compliant. These officials stated that they did not have the resources  available to make the postings accessible to individuals with disabilities  because funding for other OPM programs was prioritized ahead of  funding for the updates necessary to comply with this requirement during  that time. OPM officials stated that those compensation claim decisions  are now compliant with the statutory requirement and are being posted.
