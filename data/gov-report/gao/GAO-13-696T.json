EPA has had difficulty demonstrating that chemicals should be banned or have limits placed on their production or use under section 6--provisions for controlling chemicals. The agency issued regulations to ban or limit production or use of five existing chemicals, or chemical classes, out of tens of thousands of chemicals listed for commercial use. A court reversal of EPA's 1989 asbestos rule illustrates the difficulties EPA has had in issuing regulations to control existing chemicals.", "Disclosing data and managing assertions of confidentiality .

In February 2012, EPA announced a plan that identified and prioritized 83 existing chemicals for risk assessment; the agency initiated assessments for 7 chemicals in 2012 and announced plans to start 18 additional assessments during 2013 and 2014. At its current pace, it would take EPA at least 10 years to complete risk assessments for the 83 chemicals.", "In addition, it is unclear whether EPA's new approach to managing chemicals will position the agency to achieve its goal of ensuring the safety of chemicals. EPA's Existing Chemicals Program Strategy, which is intended to guide EPA's efforts to assess and control chemicals in the coming years, does not discuss how EPA will address identified challenges.

Tens of  thousands of chemicals are listed with EPA for commercial use in the  United States, with an average of 600 new chemicals listed each year.  EPA\u2019s ability to effectively implement its mission of protecting public  health and the environment depends on credible and timely assessments  of the risks posed by toxic chemicals. In 1976, Congress passed the  Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to provide EPA with the authority to  obtain more information on chemicals and to regulate those chemicals  that EPA determines pose unreasonable risks to human health or the  environment. TSCA authorizes EPA to review chemicals already in  commerce (existing chemicals) and chemicals yet to enter commerce  (new chemicals).", "We have reported in the past that EPA has found many of the provisions  of TSCA difficult to implement. In our past reports, we have suggested  that Congress consider making statutory changes to strengthen EPA\u2019s  authority to obtain toxicity information from the chemical industry and  establish a framework for taking action that is less burdensome for EPA.  We have also made several recommendations to better position EPA to  collect chemical toxicity and exposure-related data and ensure chemical  safety under existing TSCA authority. Among other recommendations, in   we recommended that EPA strengthen its ability to regulate  June 2005, harmful chemicals under TSCA by, for example, promulgating a rule  requiring that companies submit copies to EPA of any health and safety  studies, as well as other information concerning the environmental and  health effects of chemicals that they submit to foreign governments. In  that report, we also recommended that EPA improve and validate its  models for assessing and predicting the risks of chemicals and revise its  regulations to require chemical companies to reassert confidentiality  claims within a certain period. EPA implemented our 2005  recommendation to improve its models. EPA did not disagree with our  2005 recommendations regarding obtaining health and safety studies and  other information that companies submit to foreign governments and  requiring companies to reassert confidentiality claims, but it provided  substantive comments and has not fully implemented these  recommendations.", "In this testimony, exposure represents the magnitude, frequency, and duration of contact  with a chemical. Toxicity represents the degree to which a chemical is harmful. In this  testimony, the terms toxicity and hazard are used synonymously. authorities under TSCA to ensure chemical safety. In February 2012,  EPA summarized many of the activities it had initiated under its new  approach in the agency\u2019s Existing Chemicals Program Strategy.  Collectively, these activities address the following four areas: (1)  collecting toxicity and exposure data, (2) conducting risk assessments, (3)  discouraging the use of some chemicals, and (4) expanding public access  to some chemical data.", "In our most recent report in March 2013, we reported on the extent to  which EPA had made progress implementing its new approach. We  recommended, among other things, that EPA consider promulgating a  rule requiring chemical companies to report exposure-related data from  processors to EPA. EPA stated in its comments that downstream  chemical processors have little exposure-relevant data\u2014which suggests  that it does not intend to implement that recommendation. Because EPA  has not developed sufficient chemical assessment information to limit  exposure to many chemicals that may pose substantial health risks,  among other reasons, in 2009, we added EPA\u2019s processes for assessing  and controlling toxic chemicals to our list of programs at high risk of  waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.", "My testimony today is based on our prior work on EPA\u2019s processes for  assessing and controlling toxic chemicals.

Even with the existence of media-specific  environmental laws enacted in the early 1970s, such as the Clean Air Act  and the Clean Water Act, problems with toxic chemicals continued to  occur. In addition, Congress became increasingly concerned about the  long-term effects of substantial amounts of chemicals entering the  environment.", "TSCA was enacted to authorize EPA to collect information about the  hazards posed by chemical substances and to take action to control  unreasonable risks by either preventing dangerous chemicals from  making their way into use or placing restrictions on those already in  commerce. Under the act, EPA can control the entire life cycle of  chemicals from their production, distribution in commerce, and use to  their disposal. Other environmental and occupational health laws  generally control only disposal or release to the environment, or  exposures in the workplace. The scope of TSCA includes those  chemicals manufactured, imported, processed, distributed in commerce,  used, or disposed of in the United States but excludes certain substances  regulated under other laws. TSCA also specifies when EPA may  publicly disclose chemical information it obtains from chemical companies  and provides that chemical companies can claim certain information, such  as data disclosing chemical processes, as confidential business  information.", "EPA\u2019s authority to ensure that chemicals in commerce do not present an  unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment is established in  five major sections of TSCA. The purpose and application of these  sections are shown in table 1 and described in further detail below.", "Under the provisions for chemical testing in section 4 of TSCA, EPA can  promulgate rules to require chemical companies to test potentially harmful  chemicals for their health and environmental effects. However, EPA must  first determine that testing is warranted based on some toxicity or  exposure information. Specifically, to require such testing, EPA must find  that a chemical (1) may present an unreasonable risk of injury to human  health or the environment or (2) is or will be produced in substantial  quantities and that either (a) there is or may be significant or substantial  human exposure to the chemical or (b) the chemical enters or may  reasonably be anticipated to enter the environment in substantial  quantities. EPA must also determine that there are insufficient data to  reasonably determine or predict the effects of the chemical on health or  the environment and that testing is necessary to develop such data.", "Under the provisions for new chemical review and significant new use  rules in section 5 of TSCA, chemical companies are to notify EPA at least  90 days before beginning to manufacture a new chemical  (premanufacture notice review). Section 5 also allows EPA to promulgate  significant new use rules, which require companies to notify EPA at least  90 days before beginning to manufacture a chemical for certain new uses  or in certain new ways (significant new use notice review). Such rules  require existing chemicals to undergo the same type of review that new  chemicals undergo. For example, EPA may issue a significant new use  rule if it learns that a chemical that has previously been processed as a  liquid is now being processed as a powder, which may change how  workers are exposed to the chemical. Section 5 of the act also authorizes  EPA to maintain a list of chemicals\u2014called the chemicals of concern  list\u2014that present or may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health  or the environment.", "Under the provisions for chemical regulation in section 6 of TSCA, EPA is  to apply regulatory requirements to chemicals for which EPA finds a  reasonable basis exists to conclude that the chemical presents or will  present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. To  adequately protect against a chemical\u2019s risk, EPA can promulgate a rule  that bans or restricts the chemical\u2019s production, processing, distribution in  commerce, disposal, or use or requires warning labels be placed on the  chemical. Under TSCA, EPA must choose the least burdensome  requirement that will adequately protect against the risk.", "Under the provisions for industry reporting of chemical data in section  8(a), EPA is to promulgate rules under which chemical companies must  maintain records and submit such information as the EPA Administrator  reasonably requires. This information can include, among other things,  chemical identity, categories of use, production levels, by-products,  existing data on adverse human health and environmental effects, and  the number of workers exposed to the chemical, to the extent such  information is known or reasonably ascertainable. Under section 8(a),  EPA issues rules to update the TSCA inventory. For example, in August  2011, EPA finalized its TSCA Chemical Data Reporting rule (previously  referred to as the Inventory Update Reporting Modifications Rule); the  rule requires companies to report, among other things, exposure-related  information, such as production volume and use data, on chemicals  manufactured or imported over a certain volume per year. In addition,  section 8(d) provides EPA with the authority to promulgate rules under  which chemical companies are required to submit lists or copies of  existing health and safety studies to EPA. Section 8(e) generally requires  chemical companies to report any information to EPA that reasonably  supports a conclusion that a chemical presents a substantial risk of injury  to health or the environment.", "Under the provisions for disclosure of chemical data in section 14, EPA  may disclose chemical information it obtains under TSCA under certain  conditions. Chemical companies can claim certain information, such as  data disclosing chemical processes, as confidential business information.  EPA generally must protect confidential business information against  public disclosure unless necessary to protect against an unreasonable  risk of injury to health or the environment. Other federal agencies and  federal contractors can obtain access to this confidential business  information to carry out their responsibilities. EPA may also disclose  certain data from health and safety studies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Historical Challenges EPA Has Faced Regulating Chemicals under TSCA", "paragraphs": ["We have previously reported that EPA has historically faced challenges  implementing many of the provisions of TSCA, in particular (1) obtaining  adequate information on chemical toxicity and exposure through testing  provisions; (2) banning or limiting chemicals; and (3) disclosing chemical  data and managing company assertions of confidentiality."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Obtaining Adequate Information on Chemical Toxicity and Exposure", "paragraphs": ["EPA has found it difficult to obtain adequate information on chemical  toxicity and exposure because TSCA does not require companies to  provide this information and, instead, requires EPA to demonstrate that  chemicals pose certain risks before it can ask for such information.", "Specifically, we reported in 2005 that under section 4\u2014provisions for  chemical testing\u2014EPA has found its authority to be difficult, time- consuming, and costly to use. The structure of this section places the  burden on EPA to demonstrate certain health or environmental risks  before it can require companies to further test their chemicals. While  TSCA authorizes EPA to review existing chemicals, it generally provides  no specific requirement, time frame, or methodology for doing so. Instead,  EPA conducts initial reviews after it receives information from the public  or chemical companies that a chemical may pose a risk. As a result, EPA  has only limited information on the health and environmental risks posed  by these chemicals. In our June 2005 report, we suggested that Congress  consider amending TSCA to provide explicit authority for EPA to enter  into enforceable consent agreements under which chemical companies  are required to conduct testing, and give EPA, in addition to its current  authorities under section 4 of TSCA, the authority to require chemical  substance manufacturers and processors to develop test data based on  substantial production volume and the necessity for testing.", "In addition, we reported in June 2005 that under section 5\u2014provisions for  new chemical review\u2014TSCA generally requires chemical companies to  submit a notice to EPA (known as a \u201cpremanufacture notice\u201d) before they  manufacture or import new chemicals and to provide any available test  data. EPA estimated that most notices do not include any test data and  that about 15 percent of them included health or safety test data. These  tests may take over a year to complete and cost hundreds of thousands  of dollars, and chemical companies usually do not perform them  voluntarily. However, chemical companies are not generally required  under TSCA to limit the production of a chemical or its uses to those  specified in the premanufacture notice or to submit another  premanufacture notice if changes occur. For example, companies may  increase production levels or expand the uses of a chemical, potentially  increasing the risk of injury to human health or the environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Banning or Limiting Chemicals", "paragraphs": ["EPA has had difficulty demonstrating that chemicals should be banned or  have limits placed on their production or use under section 6\u2014provisions  for controlling chemicals.

In 1979, EPA started  considering rulemaking on asbestos. After concluding that asbestos was  a potential carcinogen at all levels of exposure, EPA promulgated a rule in 1989 prohibiting the future manufacture, importation, processing, and  distribution of asbestos in almost all products. Some manufacturers of  asbestos products filed suit against EPA, arguing, in part, that the rule  was not promulgated on the basis of substantial evidence regarding  unreasonable risk. In 1991, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for the  manufacturers and returned parts of the rule to EPA for reconsideration.  In reaching this conclusion, the court found that EPA did not consider all  necessary evidence and failed to show that the control action it chose  was the least burdensome reasonable regulation required to adequately  protect human health or the environment. Since the court\u2019s 1989 decision,  EPA has only exercised its authority to ban or limit the production or use  of an existing chemical once\u2014for hexavalent chromium, a known human  carcinogen widely used in industrial cooling towers\u2014in 1990."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disclosure of Chemical Data", "paragraphs": ["EPA has limited ability to publicly share the information it receives from  chemical companies under TSCA.

In  addition, the toxicity data eventually obtained on the 57 chemicals  may not be sufficient for EPA to conduct a risk assessment (i.e.,  characterize risk by determining the probability that populations or  individuals so exposed to a chemical will be harmed and to what  degree). Specifically, EPA may obtain data that are considered to be  \u201cscreening level\u201d information.

However, the agency\u2019s  strategy does not discuss how EPA would execute these plans or how  the data obtained would be used to inform the agency\u2019s ongoing or  future risk assessment activities, if at all.", "Banning or limiting the use of chemicals. EPA\u2019s strategy does not  articulate how the agency would overcome the regulatory challenges  it experienced in the past. In particular, EPA officials told us that, even  if EPA has substantial toxicity and exposure data, the agency is  challenged in meeting the statutory requirement under section 6 of  TSCA to limit or ban chemicals.", "Further, EPA\u2019s strategy does not identify the resources needed to meet  its goal of ensuring chemical safety. For example, EPA\u2019s strategy does  not identify the resources needed to carry out risk assessment activities,  even though risk assessment is a central part of EPA\u2019s effort to manage  chemicals under its new approach. Specifically, EPA does not identify  roles and responsibilities of key staff or offices\u2014for example which office  within EPA will develop the toxicity assessments needed to support its  planned risk assessments\u2014or identify staffing levels or cost associated  with conducting its risk assessment activities. Without a clear  understanding of the resources needed to complete risk assessments  and other activities identified in its strategy, EPA cannot be certain that its  current funding and staffing levels are sufficient to execute its new  approach to managing chemicals under existing TSCA authorities.", "When developing new initiatives, agencies can benefit from following  leading practices for federal strategic planning. Of these leading  practices, it is particularly important for agencies to define strategies that  address management challenges that threaten their ability to meet long- term goals. In our March 2013 report, we stated that without a plan that  incorporates leading strategic planning practices\u2014particularly a plan that  clearly articulates how EPA will address management challenges\u2014EPA  cannot be assured that it its new approach to managing chemicals, as  described in its Existing Chemicals Program Strategy, will provide a  framework to effectively guide its efforts. Consequently, EPA could be  investing valuable resources, time, and effort without being certain that its  efforts will bring the agency closer to achieving its goal of ensuring the  safety of chemicals. As a result, we recommended that the EPA  Administrator direct the appropriate offices to develop strategies for  addressing challenges that impede the agency\u2019s ability to meet its goal of  ensuring chemical safety to better position EPA to ensure chemical safety  under its existing TSCA authority. In its written response to our March  2013 report, EPA\u2019s Acting Assistant Administrator stated that change is  needed in every significant aspect of the program, and, while strategic  planning is a useful exercise it cannot substitute for the basic authorities  needed for a modern, effective chemicals program. Moreover, the Acting  Assistant Administrator stated that it is EPA\u2019s position that, absent  statutory changes to TSCA, the agency will not be able to successfully  meet the goal of ensuring chemical safety now and into the future.", "Chairman Shimkus, Ranking Member Tonko, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
