Before cosponsored activities take place, SBA field and program offices decide on the type and subject of the activity, solicit potential cosponsors, draft an agreement, agenda and budget, and designate a cosponsor as fiscal agent to collect, manage, and disburse any funds received. SBA's General Counsel or designee is responsible for reviewing draft cosponsorship agreements for legal sufficiency and determining whether any conflicts of interest exist with potential cosponsors. GAO's analysis of the official files for 132 cosponsored agreements SBA executed in fiscal year 2012 and other related materials showed that the activities were intended to provide training on a variety of topics, such as business planning and marketing, social media, and government contracting. SBA and cosponsors are both responsible for conducting the activity in accordance with the agreement. Following cosponsored activities, SBA field and program offices must submit a final cosponsorship report to SBA's Office of Strategic Alliances, which is responsible for maintaining the official files on these activities.", "SBA does not consistently collect feedback related to the benefits that cosponsored activities provide to small businesses. Participants in focus groups that GAO held commented positively on the quality of the presentations and opportunities to network, among other things, offered by cosponsored activities. Participants also noted that they obtained information on topics useful to their small businesses, including financial management and the federal contracting process. SBA officials and representatives of cosponsors told GAO that the events provided attendees with access to services and resources from multiple organizations in a single venue and often included counseling and referrals to other resources. Although the Small Business Act specifies that SBA cosponsored activities provide benefits to small businesses, it does not specify how SBA should identify and measure benefits. Some SBA district office staff told GAO that they solicited participant feedback on cosponsored events through a survey, evaluation, or questionnaire. GAO also found that obtaining periodic participant feedback is an integral part of a 7-month training initiative, called the Emerging Leaders Initiative, conducted using cosponsorship authority. However, SBA officials told us that obtaining formal feedback was not required and that the agency did not have a policy on soliciting and using it. Cosponsors GAO met with noted the importance of obtaining participant feedback and entrepreneurs GAO spoke to also identified ways in which the cosponsored activities could have been improved. Federal internal control standards state that federal agencies should have appropriate policies, procedures, techniques, and mechanisms for each of their activities, including those to ensure compliance with key requirements. Obtaining feedback on cosponsored events would provide SBA with direct information from small business participants that could be used to help ensure that events are providing benefits to small businesses. Such information could also provide another way for SBA to evaluate the use of its cosponsorship authority."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that SBA develop a mechanism to consistently obtain participant feedback on cosponsored activities.

SBA utilizes its network of field offices and partnerships with public and  private organizations to provide assistance to small businesses. SBA  enters into cosponsorship agreements when the agency seeks to provide  assistance (generally training, education, or dissemination of information)  to small businesses in partnership with for-profit and nonprofit entities and  other governmental entities or officials (federal, state, or local). According  to SBA, cosponsored activities allow the agency to leverage public and  private resources in order to provide a benefit to small businesses.  Section 4(h) of the Small Business Act (the act) provides SBA with the  authority to provide assistance for the benefit of small businesses through  cosponsored activities with eligible entities. Our analysis of the  information SBA maintains on cosponsorship agreements showed that  the agency executed 132 agreements in fiscal year 2012. The budgeted  direct costs of the activities conducted under these agreements totaled  $3.8 million, of which approximately $967,000 was to be funded by SBA.  SBA expected that the activities conducted under these agreements  would provide assistance to almost 50,000 small businesses. Examples  of activities SBA has conducted under cosponsorship agreements include  the annual National Small Business Week, which recognizes the  contributions and accomplishments of small business owners and those  that support small businesses, and the Emerging Leaders Initiative, which  provides executives from small businesses with resources and support to  build and sustain their businesses.", "You requested that we study SBA\u2019s use of its cosponsorship authority.

We also interviewed officials and staff from SBA\u2019s Office of  Strategic Alliances and Office of General Counsel, officials from six  district offices and staff from five of those district offices, and  representatives from 10 entities that cosponsored activities during  calendar years 2012 or 2013 to gain an understanding of the roles and  responsibilities of SBA and cosponsors related to planning, funding, and  conducting cosponsored activities. We requested the official file for each  cosponsorship agreement SBA executed in fiscal year 2012 as listed in a  spreadsheet the agency maintains on the status of these agreements.  Based on our independent review of the information in the official file and  other materials, we identified the type of activity, subject matter, and  amount and type of budgeted direct costs of the activities for each  agreement, as well as whether each agreement included a responsibility  for SBA or a cosponsor to obtain participant feedback. In addition, we  identified the specific roles and responsibilities of SBA and cosponsors for  a nonprobability sample of cosponsorship agreements SBA executed in  fiscal year 2012. The selected agreements represented a variety of  eligible entities, allowable activities, expected number of businesses  assisted, and direct costs. We assessed the reliability of the spreadsheet  data SBA maintains on the status of cosponsorship agreements by  reviewing it for obvious errors and comparing the data for selected  agreements to SBA\u2019s official files.

The results  of these focus groups are not generalizable, but do provide insights on  participants\u2019 perceptions of the benefits received by attending a  cosponsored activity. In addition, we interviewed key officials at SBA  headquarters in Washington, D.C., and six SBA district offices and staff  from five of those district offices to obtain their perspectives on the  benefits small businesses receive from attending cosponsored events  and information on how the offices evaluate the results of these.

Cosponsors may provide cash or an in-kind contribution,  a cosponsor may charge a participant fee to cover the direct costs of  providing the cosponsored activity, or SBA may accept a gift under its gift  acceptance authority to support cosponsored activities. SBA also may  use appropriated funds to support a cosponsored activity. However SBA  must purchase the product or service directly (following the appropriate  procurement process) and provide that product or service to the  cosponsored activity as an in-kind contribution. Additionally, SBA\u2019s  procedures note that funds to support a cosponsored activity may be  used for nearly any expense so long as that type of expense is approved  as part of the proposed cosponsorship budget, is a direct cost of the  activity, and is necessary and integral to the activity.", "SBA district office officials and staff we spoke to said that they consider  various factors when making a decision to provide assistance to small  businesses under a cosponsorship agreement, including whether a  potential cosponsor has expertise in a particular area such as lending or  exporting, has resources necessary to conduct an event such as space,  or could provide funding to cover these and other event costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBA and Cosponsors Jointly Plan, Fund, and Conduct Cosponsored Activities", "paragraphs": ["SBA and cosponsors share responsibilities for planning, funding, and  conducting cosponsored activities.

Vetting is the process of gathering  information to determine whether potential cosponsors have an  actual or apparent conflict of interest with SBA that would preclude  them from cosponsoring an activity. The information gathered  during the vetting process is submitted to SBA\u2019s General Counsel  or designee to determine whether any conflicts of interest exist.

Initially,  SBA will prepare a draft cosponsorship agreement and, with the  assistance of potential cosponsors as necessary, drafts an  agenda and budget.

Some SBA district office officials told us that,  beyond available human resources and the district office\u2019s own  space, they do not have an abundance of discretionary funds to  spend on cosponsored activities and they leverage the resources  of cosponsors because of this. SBA is responsible for designating  a cosponsor as fiscal agent when the cosponsored activity  expects to receive cash contributions from cosponsors or fees  from participants.

We selected four of the district  offices based primarily on the frequency with which the office conducted  cosponsored activities in fiscal years 2010 to 2012 and interviewed  officials and staff from the remaining two district offices that originated the  cosponsored activities we selected for our focus groups. The district  offices were located in California, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North  Dakota, and New York. We also interviewed representatives from 10  entities that cosponsored an activity with SBA during calendar years 2012  or 2013 to understand their roles and responsibilities for the activities they  cosponsored and how and why they cosponsored them. Seven of these  entities had cosponsored the activities selected for our focus groups and  the other three entities had cosponsored National Small Business Week  activities in 2012 and 2013. Further, we attended two cosponsored events  and observed how information was delivered to and received by  participants. We also reviewed SBA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG)  report on its audit of SBA\u2019s controls over cosponsored activities, which  assessed the adequacy of those controls, and discussed the audit with  the OIG. In addition, we requested the official file for the more than 132  cosponsorship agreements SBA executed in fiscal year 2012 as listed in  a spreadsheet the agency maintains on the status of these agreements.  Two analysts reviewed the cosponsorship documentation contained in the  files and other materials, including cosponsorship agreements, draft and  final agendas, marketing materials and final cosponsorship reports (SBA  form 2299).

We considered a  number of factors in selecting the three activities. For example, we  selected the Emerging Leaders Initiative because of the large amount of  direct costs SBA funded for the initiative. We selected the Doing Business  with Federal Procuring Agencies and Small Business Talk series because  the activities (1) took place in the same or nearby location where an  Emerging Leaders Initiative was taking place (2) included a significant  training component, (3) had a sizable number of expected attendees from  which to solicit 8 to12 people for a focus group, (4) had lists of  preregistered participants or attendee lists with contact information, and  (5) occurred within 12 months preceding the focus groups. We also  considered geographic diversity for the three activities we selected to  conduct focus groups. We sought to ensure that the activities we selected  to conduct focus groups took place in different regions of the country with  differing economic profiles.

We limited our focus group participation to entrepreneurs with  recent experience attending a cosponsored activity to minimize recall bias  and to ensure that the most accurate account of participants\u2019 experiences  could be obtained. To recruit volunteers to our focus groups, we obtained  from SBA a list of persons who attended the three activities in locations  we selected. We contacted each person by email, soliciting them to  participate in our focus groups and took the first volunteers for up to 12  persons per focus group. Our focus groups ranged in size from 3 to 11.  Attendees at our focus groups included women-owned and veteran- owned small businesses in a variety of industries including construction,  janitorial services, and health care (see app. IV, figs. 5 through 8, for  additional information about participant characteristics and focus group  responses on various themes).", "The focus groups were structured small group discussions designed to  generate information on the participants\u2019 experiences with SBA  cosponsored training, education, and counseling events.  Methodologically, information gathered from focus groups cannot be used  to make generalizations about a population or to demonstrate the extent  of an issue. Thus, while the information we gathered is not generalizable  to all participants in SBA cosponsored activities, it provides valuable  context regarding their perceptions of the benefits and challenges they  experienced when attending these events and this information is more in- depth than is possible using numerous individual interviews. Small  business owners and other participants who did not attend our focus  groups may have had different experiences.", "A GAO facilitator guided the focus group participants using a structured  set of questions. In addition to the GAO facilitator, another team member  recorded notes of the proceedings. At the start of each discussion  session, ground rules were established encouraging participants to limit  their comments to their own personal experiences with the SBA  cosponsored event attended unless explicitly asked to respond more  broadly. The facilitator encouraged all participants to share their views  and react to the views of others. Using a GAO-developed discussion  guide, the facilitator asked the participants to give their perspectives on  (1) their decision to attend the SBA cosponsored event, (2) the perceived  benefits, (3) the challenges associated with their experience or  suggestions for improvements, (4) expectations about future uses of what  they learned, and (5) events they attended within 12 months preceding  the focus groups. We conducted the analysis of the focus group results in  three steps. First, two analysts developed a codebook to identify common  themes in the focus group notes and worked together to ensure  agreement. Second, two GAO analysts independently coded the  transcripts and then resolved any coding discrepancies. Third, the coders  noted how often a theme was expressed across each focus group and  focused on those that were mentioned frequently across the majority of  focus groups. The focus group results discussed in this report reflect the  range of views and perceptions expressed in a larger number of the focus  groups.", "We also interviewed key officials at SBA headquarters in Washington,  D.C., including representatives from the agency\u2019s Office of Strategic  Alliances and Office of General Counsel and six SBA district offices and  staff from five of those district offices to obtain testimonial information  about district office involvement and experiences with their use of SBA\u2019s  cosponsorship authority, including how they evaluate the results of the  events. Finally, we interviewed representatives from 10 entities that  cosponsored an activity with SBA during calendar years 2012 or 2013 to  obtain their perspectives on benefits to small business arising from  cosponsored events. We analyzed the information obtained from the  interviews to determine what perceived benefits small businesses  received from attending or were expected to gain from the cosponsored  events, what would have improved the cosponsored event experience,  whether cosponsors sought feedback about a cosponsored event, and  whether SBA had any consistent practices for obtaining participant  feedback on cosponsored events.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2012 to May 2014  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Factors SBA Considers in Deciding Whether to Utilize Cosponsorship Authority", "paragraphs": ["SBA district office officials and staff we spoke to identified the following  factors that they consider in deciding whether to utilize cosponsorship  authority to conduct outreach activities:  1.  Whether a proposed activity would better meet the needs of small  businesses, and more of them, if conducted with other entities under a  cosponsorship agreement.  2.  Whether a potential cosponsor has expertise in a particular area, such  as lending or exporting, or has resources necessary to conduct an  event, such as space, or could provide funding to cover these and  other event costs.  3.  How much control SBA wants to have over the various aspects of an  event\u2019s planning, content, and delivery, including setting the agenda,  identifying speakers, and selecting a suitable location, or whether it  would be helpful to share these responsibilities.  4.  Whether potential cosponsors could provide SBA with access to  groups that it does not have a well-established relationship with or  that might not be familiar with SBA or its programs and services.  5.  Whether cosponsorship authority provides SBA with an opportunity to  develop and strengthen long-term relationships with groups that  represent minority small businesses or those in particular geographic  areas that could help identify and target those businesses that might  benefit most from a particular event.  6.  Whether co-branding of a cosponsored activity\u2014displaying SBA and  cosponsor logos on all marketing and event material\u2014could attract  greater small business attendance, in part because of the appeal of  having multiple small business resources at a single event.  7.  What the costs would be in terms of time and SBA\u2019s own resources.  8.  Whether potential cosponsors would be able to fulfill their  responsibilities under an agreement, including handling  cosponsorship funds while serving as a fiscal agent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Summary of SBA Office of Inspector General Findings and Recommendations and SBA Required Procedures", "paragraphs": ["The SBA Office of Inspector General issued Advisory Memorandum  Report No. 13-21, SBA Enterprise-wide Controls over Cosponsored  Activities, dated September 26, 2013, which presented the results of its  work on the adequacy of controls over SBA\u2019s cosponsored activities. The  table below summarizes the findings and recommendations from that  report and the required procedures that the Office of Inspector General  found SBA had not complied with.", "SBA agreed with some but not all of the OIG\u2019s findings and  recommendations. SBA stated that the OIG\u2019s findings about the failings of  SBA\u2019s cosponsorship program as a whole are too broadly stated,  considering that the five agreements the OIG tested represent less than 1  percent of all the cosponsored activities that took place during the fiscal  years covered by their audit. SBA also responded to each specific  recommendation. For example, SBA agreed that vetting is important, but  disagreed with the recommendation because it believed that the OIG\u2019s  audit did not demonstrate a deficiency with the vetting process, adding  that only one cosponsorship file did not contain the requisite vetting  information. Also, SBA agreed with the intent of the OIG\u2019s  recommendation to modify the cosponsorship agreement template to  include the specific roles and responsibilities of fiscal agents but did not  agree with the recommendation itself, as SBA believes that providing staff  with supplemental guidance and more instruction would be a better  approach."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Additional Focus Group Characteristics and Information", "paragraphs": ["As discussed in this report, we conducted eight focus groups with 48  participants and obtained a variety of information about their experience  at certain cosponsored events.
