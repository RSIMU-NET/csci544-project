All three of the independent public accountants (IPA) contracted to audit these fiscal year 2015 Budgetary Schedules issued disclaimers, meaning that the IPAs were unable to express an opinion because of a lack of sufficient evidence to support the amounts presented. The IPAs for all three military services also identified material weaknesses in internal control and collectively issued a total of over 700 findings and recommendations. These weaknesses included, among other things, the military services' inability to reasonably assure that the Budgetary Schedules reflected all of the relevant financial transactions that occurred and that documentation was available to support such transactions. Army, Navy, and Air Force management generally concurred with these findings and stated that they would develop and implement corrective actions to address the IPAs' recommendations.", "Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance and the Department of Defense's (DOD) Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Guidance include the following steps for addressing these and other financial management-related findings and recommendations reported by external auditors: (1) identify and track them, (2) prioritize them, (3) develop corrective action plans (CAP) to remediate them, and (4) monitor the implementation status of the CAPs. GAO found that the remediation processes designed by each military service had deficiencies in one or more of these areas. For example, each military service's policies and procedures lacked sufficient controls to reasonably assure that they identified and tracked the complete universe of open findings and recommendations related to financial management. Without identifying and tracking the complete universe of unresolved deficiencies, the military services cannot provide reasonable assurance that the deficiencies will be addressed in a timely manner, which can ultimately affect the reliability of financial information and the auditability of their financial statements.", "The DOD Comptroller has established several elements of a department-wide audit readiness remediation process, but it does not have comprehensive information on the status of CAPs throughout the department needed to fully monitor and report on the progress being made to resolve financial management-related deficiencies. Specifically, (1) the DOD Comptroller does not obtain complete, detailed information on all CAPs from the military services related to the department's critical capabilities to be able to fully assess progress and (2) reports to external stakeholders such as the Congress on the status of audit readiness do not provide comprehensive information. A lack of comprehensive information on the CAPs limits the ability of DOD and Congress to evaluate DOD's progress toward achieving audit readiness, especially given the short amount of time remaining before the statutory deadline to submit to Congress the results of an audit of the department-wide financial statements for fiscal year 2018."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making a total of eight recommendations to the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and DOD to improve processes for tracking and monitoring financial management-related audit findings and recommendations.

However,  because of difficulties encountered in preparing for an audit of the SBR,  DOD decided to limit the scope of the initial SBR audits for all DOD  components. Specifically, the scope of initial SBR audits beginning in  fiscal year 2015 was limited to current-year budget activity, to be reported  on a Schedule of Budgetary Activity (Budgetary Schedule).

The Implementation  Guide for OMB Circular A-123 also states that an agency\u2019s senior  assessment team will work with the responsible officials and  personnel to determine which deficiencies are cost beneficial to  correct.   3.  Developing CAPs. The Implementation Guide for OMB Circular A- 123 states that a CAP, including targeted milestones and completion  dates, will be drafted and progress will be monitored. The elements of  a CAP include a summary description of the deficiency;   the year the deficiency was first identified;   the target corrective action date (the date of management follow- up);  the agency official responsible for monitoring progress;  the indicators, statistics, or metrics used to gauge resolution  progress (in advance of audit follow-up) in order to validate the  resolution of the deficiency (referred to as outcome measures for  assessing the effectiveness of the corrective actions for purposes  of this report); and  the quantifiable target or otherwise qualitative characteristic that  reports how resolution activities are progressing (referred to as  interim milestones for monitoring progress on interim actions for  purposes of this report).", "DOD\u2019s FIAR Guidance states that CAPs should be developed for all  material weaknesses and that progress in implementing these plans  should be periodically assessed and reported to management, which  should track progress to ensure timely and effective results. For  significant deficiencies, as well as nonsignificant deficiencies that  were not externally reported, CAPs should be developed and tracked  internally at the appropriate level.  4.  Monitoring the status of CAP implementation. Federal internal  control standards state that the resolution process begins when audit  or other review results are reported to management, and is completed  only after action has been taken that (1) corrects identified  deficiencies, (2) produces improvements, or (3) demonstrates that the  findings and recommendations do not warrant management action.  The Implementation Guide for OMB Circular A-123 states that an  entity\u2019s senior management council, or similar forum(s), has  ownership and accountability for resolving deficiencies. These forums  should use CAPs as a guide or road map for discussion as well as in  determining when sufficient action has been taken to declare that a  deficiency has been corrected.", "According to DOD\u2019s FIAR Guidance, management\u2019s process for  resolution and corrective action of identified material weaknesses in  internal control must do the following:", "Provide for appointment of an overall corrective action  accountability official from senior agency management. The  official should report to the agency\u2019s senior management council,  if applicable.", "Maintain accurate records of the status of the identified material  weaknesses through the entire process of resolution.", "Assure that CAPs are consistent with laws, regulations, and DOD  policy.", "Assure that performance appraisals of appropriate officials reflect  effectiveness in resolving or implementing corrective actions for  identified material weaknesses.", "The FIAR Guidance further states that a determination that a  deficiency has been corrected should be made only when sufficient  corrective actions have been taken and the desired results achieved.  This determination should be in writing and, along with other  appropriate documentation supporting the determination, should be  available for review by appropriate officials.", "After comparing the criteria under the four elements above with the  design of the Army, Navy, and Air Force policies and procedures for  tracking and resolving audit findings, we found that while Navy had  sufficiently drafted policies and procedures to address three out of the  four elements, the Army\u2019s and Air Force\u2019s policies and procedures did not  sufficiently address any of the four elements, as detailed below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Army\u2019s Process for Addressing Financial Management-Related Audit Findings and Recommendations Was Not Comprehensive", "paragraphs": ["The Army\u2019s process for managing the remediation of financial  management deficiencies was not comprehensive, and portions of it were  evolving as it began to address the financial management-related findings  and recommendations from the fiscal year 2015 Budgetary Schedule  audit.

However, the SOP does not identify which of  the criteria might be a higher priority than others. Consequently, if the  Audit Readiness Directorate followed the SOP criteria for prioritization,  most of the over 200 Budgetary Schedule audit findings would be  considered a priority, which would defeat the intent of identifying priorities.  To avoid this, Army officials said that based on input from the IPA they  decided to narrow the criteria for prioritizing the Budgetary Schedule  findings and recommendations to those related to the critical areas of  completeness, documentation, Fund Balance with Treasury, and information systems. Using these criteria, Army officials said they  identified specific findings and recommendations, and the related CAPs,  as high priority.

Because the critical capabilities are the DOD Comptroller\u2019s  highest priorities for corrective actions, it is important that they are  updated to reflect the audit findings that result from DOD\u2019s audit  readiness efforts. For example, one of the seven critical capabilities  currently addresses the need for supporting documentation for  adjustments to financial records. However, as stated previously, the IPAs  for all three military services noted the lack of adequate supporting  documentation for transactions, not just adjustments, as a reportable  finding on their Budgetary Schedule audits, which also contributed to  each IPA\u2019s disclaimer of opinion. Appropriate documentation for financial  transactions allows the military services to support financial statement line  items and allows auditors to test the line items.

In addition, DOD Comptroller  officials attend other, more frequent meetings (e.g., audit committee) with  the military services regarding their audit readiness efforts. During these  meetings, DOD officials receive briefing slides that provide high-level  summaries of the military services\u2019 audit readiness, including some  information on the status of the CAPs relating to the Budgetary Schedule  audits that each service, using its respective criteria, has determined to  be high priority.", "DOD Comptroller officials told us that they compile some of this  summary-level information, such as the percentages of completion for  critical capabilities by various DOD components, based on more detailed  information that they receive from the components. However, even this  more detailed information is based on some summarization of tasks that  are part of the critical capabilities, as well as the percentages of  completion for these tasks. Except for certain findings and  recommendations related to DOD-wide issues, DOD Comptroller officials  said that they do not receive detailed information on individual findings,  recommendations, and CAPs from the military services. Although the  DOD Comptroller developed a Notice of Findings and Recommendations  Tracking Tool, it is used primarily to track the audit readiness findings and  recommendations for the other defense organizations and findings and  recommendations for the military services that pertain to DOD-wide  issues that require action at the department level. DOD Comptroller  officials said that because of resource constraints, they do not plan to  obtain or track the detailed status of most of the military services\u2019 findings,  recommendations, and CAPs, but instead will rely on the information  provided for various oversight meetings to monitor the status of audit  readiness efforts. The officials also explained that they have obtained  some detailed findings and recommendations related to DOD-wide issues  that they are using to help develop policies to address these issues.

Federal internal control standards also require that an  entity\u2019s management communicate with and obtain quality information  from external parties through established reporting lines. In these  communications, management should include information relating to the  entity\u2019s activities that affect the internal control system. DOD\u2019s FIAR Plan  Status Reports are the department\u2019s primary mechanism for reporting the  status of its audit readiness, including audit remediation efforts, to  Congress and other external parties. The reports include narratives on  each military service\u2019s audit readiness efforts, focusing on material  weaknesses and the seven critical capabilities necessary to achieve audit  readiness, and estimated completion dates for each of these areas. Over  the years, as the military services have set target dates for asserting audit  readiness, the target dates have been delayed, which we have reported  increases the risk that DOD may not complete its audit readiness efforts  within planned time frames, thereby affecting DOD\u2019s ability to meet the  statutory requirements. For example, we recently reported that the  military services\u2019 target dates for asserting audit readiness for real  property were delayed by at least 2 years.

The  Implementation Guide for OMB Circular A-123 recommends that such  detailed information about CAPs be provided to external stakeholders  upon request.

For example, the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) was able to overcome its numerous material  weaknesses that had prevented its financial statements from being  auditable. Since its creation in fiscal year 2003 when 22 separate  agencies were brought together to form the new department, DHS was  able to move from receiving disclaimers of opinion on its financial  statements to first achieving an unqualified or \u201cclean\u201d opinion on all of its  financial statements for fiscal year 2013, which has continued through  fiscal year 2016. DHS policy on corrective action plans, issued in fiscal  year 2012, indicates that its process included maintaining a department- wide accumulation of significant CAPs from all of its components; using  standard data elements; and providing monthly updates on the status of  CAPs to the CFO, and updates on an as-needed basis to the OIG and the  Secretary.", "As we have previously reported, many of the planned audit readiness  actions and milestones reported by DOD and its components in FIAR  Plan Status Reports have not been realized.

However, it does not provide any further details about what information  will be summarized, and as we note in the report, the Comptroller\u2019s  tracking does not include CAPs for the military services. Without  developing a consolidated department-wide summary of CAPs, DOD will  continue to lack a department-wide view of all CAPs pertaining to each  critical capability. Therefore, we continue to believe that DOD needs to  take actions to fully implement this recommendation.", "DOD also partially concurred with our recommendation for the DOD  Comptroller to develop and implement a centralized monitoring and  reporting process that captures and maintains up-to-date information,  including the standard data elements recommended in the  Implementation Guide for OMB Circular A-123, for all CAPs department- wide that pertain to critical capabilities. In its response, DOD said that as  outlined in the military services\u2019 responses to our recommendations  directed to them, the Army, Navy, and Air Force have agreed to take the  responsibility for developing, maintaining, and monitoring all CAPs at the  level recommended by the Implementation Guide for OMB Circular A- 123. Further, DOD stated that the information reported at FIAR  Governance Board meetings, along with the CAP information maintained  by the DOD Comptroller, provides the department the ability to efficiently  respond to stakeholder requests for CAPs related to critical capabilities.  As noted above, we acknowledge the important steps the military  services have planned or taken to address our recommendations and  improve their CAP monitoring processes. However, DOD\u2019s actions do not  address our recommendation to develop a centralized reporting process  to capture department-wide information on the military services\u2019 and other  defense organizations\u2019 CAPs related to critical capabilities.", "As stated in our report, DOD does not routinely obtain consistent and  detailed information from the military services on the status of their CAPs,  and without such it cannot readily provide this type of information to  stakeholders when requested and must rely on inefficient methods, such  as data calls to collect the detailed information. In addition, many of the  planned audit readiness actions and milestones reported by DOD and its  components in the FIAR Plan Status Reports have not been realized.  Given the short amount of time remaining before the statutory date of  March 31, 2019, for submitting to Congress the results of an audit of  DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2018 financial statements, having complete and  reliable, detailed information on the department-wide status of CAPs  related to critical capabilities is essential for DOD and its stakeholders so  that they can (1) measure and communicate DOD\u2019s progress in  addressing the financial management deficiencies and (2) determine if  additional actions are necessary to expedite the remediation process.  This type of detailed information is critical for DOD management and its  external stakeholders to evaluate the military services\u2019 progress in  correcting the deficiencies that are preventing the department from  obtaining an audit opinion on its financial statements. Moreover, the lack  of comprehensive information on the status of CAPs increases DOD\u2019s risk  that it will not be able to fully, timely, and efficiently correct its long- standing deficiencies.

The Budgetary Schedule, like the SBR, is designed to  provide information on budgeted spending authority as outlined in the  President\u2019s Budget, including budgetary resources, availability of  budgetary resources, and how obligated resources have been used.  However, instead of covering the full range of SBR activity on current and  expired appropriations that have not been canceled, the first-year  Budgetary Schedule covers only activity for current fiscal year  appropriations. Subsequent fiscal year Budgetary Schedules would  include activity for subsequent years\u2019 appropriations, building toward an  SBR.
