GAO's analysis of DOD budget data shows that average PCS per-move costs, after accounting for inflation, increased by 28 percent from fiscal years 2001 to 2014. However, GAO's review of the services' annual budget materials found that the services have not reported complete and consistent PCS data, thereby limiting the extent to which DOD can identify and evaluate changes occurring within the PCS program. For example, the services did not completely or consistently report budget data on non-temporary storage costs, temporary lodging expenses, or tour extension payments. Program changes and factors outside the program can affect PCS costs. The specific factors driving the growth in per-move costs are unclear, however, because DOD does not periodically evaluate whether the PCS program is efficiently supporting requirements to relocate personnel. DOD therefore is not in a position to identify and evaluate changes that may be occurring over time in PCS per-move costs, or to take steps to manage and control cost growth.", "DOD does not have information for determining whether personnel are meeting time-on-station requirements. DOD guidance specifies time-on-station lengths for U.S. and overseas locations and also allows for personnel to move prior to reaching these lengths if they qualify for an exception or obtain a waiver. However, DOD does not have complete or consistent data on the reasons why PCS moves occur prior to reaching specified lengths, because the services (1) do not maintain required data on their usage of exceptions and (2) do not have a requirement to maintain data on their usage of waivers. Moreover, availability of service data on time-on-station lengths is limited and varies by service. For example, each service has different years of available data. In addition, one service provided time-on-station data for officers and enlisted personnel separately, and these data covered different time periods.", "In its September 2014 report to Congress on increasing time-on-station, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) addressed the elements that were specifically identified in congressional direction. OSD also used approaches consistent with generally accepted research standards in preparing its report. Nonetheless, OSD could have included additional information, such as more explicitly discussing constraints and information about the model used to develop cost savings estimates, and thereby improved the utility of the report for decision makers. The report stated that DOD plans to take actions aimed at extending servicemembers' time-on-station, which OSD believes could reduce PCS costs. However, without more complete and consistent data on both PCS costs and the use of exceptions and waivers, DOD does not have the information it needs for evaluating whether the implementation of its planned actions will be effective in extending time-on-station lengths and reducing PCS costs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD, in coordination with the services, take actions to report complete and consistent PCS budget data; conduct periodic evaluations of the PCS program; and address limitations on the availability of data on exceptions and waivers for PCS moves that occur prior to reaching minimum time-on-station lengths.

As a  result of our assessment and these discussions, we determined that  DOD-wide summary data on PCS moves and costs were sufficiently  reliable for our purpose of reporting on the changes in PCS costs over  time. We also obtained more detailed PCS cost data from service budget  documents. We identified limitations in these detailed data for fiscal years  2001 through 2009. Specifically, we were unable to analyze detailed data  on specific types of costs (such as commercial air travel and household  goods shipments) by traveler type (such as officers and enlisted  personnel) because these data were generated using methods that the  services subsequently revised and because DOD\u2019s process for recording  obligations changed in fiscal year 2009 to require that obligations be  recorded at the time PCS orders were issued, rather than at the time PCS  moves occurred. These data issues are discussed further in the report.  As a result, we focused our analysis of detailed PCS data on fiscal years  2010 through 2014, and we determined that these data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our analysis to report on trends for specific  types of costs by traveler type. We assessed the information we collected  against DOD guidance that prescribes a budget and accounting  classification that is to be used for preparing budget estimates, including  the budget justification materials we reviewed. We also discussed with  military officials the factors that may have contributed to changes in PCS  moves and costs over time, and we identified any efforts the department  has made to evaluate those factors. We assessed these efforts against  criteria that outline how organizations should use data to evaluate the  success of their human capital approaches and use information to make  decisions and monitor programs.", "For our second objective, we reviewed DOD and service guidance  establishing time-on-station requirements. We obtained and analyzed  available data from the military services on time-on-station lengths and  associated waivers and exceptions.

Training and organized unit travel  together constituted 8 percent of moves and costs (see fig. 5.).", "As stated above, annual PCS per-move costs for operational and  rotational moves were higher, on average, than for accession and  separation moves. For example, an accession move over this time period  cost $2,296 on average, and a rotational move cost $13,238. Per-move  costs for training and organized unit moves were lower than per-move  costs for rotational and operational moves and higher than per-move  costs for accession and separation moves (see table 4).", "Service officials stated that rotational travel is the most costly type of  move because it involves transoceanic travel, with personnel and cargo  moving longer distances than for other types of moves. In contrast,  accession moves\u2014when personnel are moved to their first duty station\u2014 generally involve travel within the continental United States. Also,  servicemembers making an accession move are lower ranked and  typically younger, and therefore less likely to be accompanied by  dependents, than are servicemembers making other types of moves.  While servicemembers making separation moves are generally more  senior and older than servicemembers making accession moves, DOD  and service officials stated that the per-move costs for these moves are  similar to those for accession moves because many servicemembers  making a separation move choose to remain in the same geographic area  as their final duty station, and thus these moves incur minimal costs. DOD  officials stated that the post-9/11 build-up of the military forces and the  subsequent drawdown in recent years led to a large number of  accessions and separations, as servicemembers were recruited for and  subsequently separated from the military."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Per-Move Costs in Specific Cost Categories", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of detailed Permanent Change of Station (PCS) data for  fiscal years 2010 through 2014 shows differences in per-move costs for  officers as compared with enlisted personnel in specific cost categories  (see table 5).
