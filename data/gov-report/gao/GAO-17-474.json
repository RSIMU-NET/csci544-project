These methods include cross-border tunnels, ultralight aircraft, panga boats, and recreational maritime vessels. While these methods account for a small proportion of known smuggling, they can be used to transport significant quantities of drugs or for terrorist activity. GAO was asked to review DHS's efforts to address subterranean, aerial, and maritime smuggling. This report addresses, among other things, (1) the known prevalence of the aforementioned smuggling methods, (2) efforts to address them, and (3) efforts to assess the results of activities to counter them. GAO analyzed relevant procedures, reports, and data for fiscal years 2011 through 2016. GAO also interviewed DHS officials and conducted site visits to locations in California, Arizona, and Florida, chosen based upon past detection of smuggling by the selected methods, among other things. The information from the site visits is not generalizable, but provided valuable insights."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's analysis of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) data showed that there were 67 discovered cross-border tunnels, 534 detected ultralight aircraft incursions, and 309 detected drug smuggling incidents involving panga boats (a fishing vessel) and recreational vessels along U.S. mainland borders from fiscal years 2011 through 2016. The number of known smuggling events involving these methods generally declined over this period, but they remain threats.", "DHS has established various coordination mechanisms and invested in technology to address select smuggling methods in the subterranean, aerial, and maritime domains. For example, DHS established interagency task forces to investigate cross-border tunnels. However, DHS has not established comprehensive standard operating procedures for addressing cross-border tunnels, and we found that relevant officials were not aware of all DHS systems or offices with tunnel information. By establishing procedures for addressing cross-border tunnels, DHS could provide strategic guidance and facilitate information sharing departmentwide, consistent with standards for internal control. DHS has also invested or plans to invest in at least five technology projects to help detect and track ultralight aircraft. However, DHS has not assessed and documented how all of the alternative ultralight aircraft technical solutions it is considering will fully address operational requirements or the costs and benefits associated with these different solutions. This type of analysis could help better position DHS to use its resources effectively and ensure that operational needs are met, consistent with risk management best practices.", "DHS has established high-level smuggling performance measures and collects data on smuggling by tunnels, ultralight aircraft, panga boats, and recreational vessels; however, DHS has not assessed its efforts specific to addressing these smuggling methods to, for example, compare the percent of detected panga boat and recreational smuggling events that are interdicted against targeted performance levels. By establishing measures and regularly monitoring performance against targets, managers could obtain valuable information on successful approaches and areas that could be improved to help ensure that technology investments and operational responses to address these smuggling methods are effective, consistent with standards for internal control.

To enhance security along the southwest border, the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS)\u2014the agency responsible for securing the  nation\u2019s borders\u2014has made significant investments in personnel,  technology, and tactical infrastructure, such as fencing. In recent years,  DHS reports that it has interdicted millions of pounds of drugs and  hundreds of thousands of individuals attempting to illegally enter the  United States, mostly along the southwest border. In fiscal year 2015,  DHS reported that it seized or prevented the delivery of more than 3.3  million pounds of narcotics, of which about 2.1 million pounds were  seized at the southwest border. In addition, DHS reported that it  apprehended more than 337,000 illegal entrants between ports of entry,  of which about 331,000 were apprehended along the southwest border.", "As DHS has increased the security of overland smuggling routes,  transnational criminal organizations have adapted their techniques to  smuggle drugs and humans through other methods to try to evade  detection and interdiction. These adapted smuggling methods include but  are not limited to illicit cross-border tunnels, ultralight aircraft, panga boats  (a type of fishing vessel), recreational maritime vessels, and self- propelled semi-submersible and fully submersible vessels. While the  selected smuggling methods listed above generally account for a small  proportion of drug seizures between ports of entry\u2014DHS data indicate  there were 49 seizures from tunnels, ultralight aircraft, and the selected  maritime conveyances in fiscal year 2015 compared to almost 12,900  total drug seizures\u2014the actual number of smuggling events is unknown  and thus seizure data may not reflect the true prevalence. Further, these  selected smuggling methods can be used to transport significant  quantities of drugs. For example, U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s  (CBP) U.S. Border Patrol (Border Patrol) and U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement\u2019s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI)\u2014 the components within DHS responsible for securing the border between  land ports of entry and investigating cross-border and immigration-related  crimes, respectively\u2014and other federal and local law enforcement  partners seized over 17,000 pounds of marijuana and 300 pounds of  cocaine from a cross-border tunnel discovered in 2013. In addition, the  U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard) and CBP Air and Marine Operations  (AMO)\u2014the DHS components that share maritime law enforcement  responsibilities\u2014seized 5,700 pounds of marijuana from one panga boat  in March 2015. Human smugglers and migrants have also used panga  boats and recreational maritime vessels on occasion. In addition to  posing drug and human smuggling threats, transnational criminal  organizations\u2019 utilization of these methods also raises concerns that they  could be used to smuggle terrorists and their weapons into the United  States.", "You asked us to review DHS\u2019s efforts to address threats posed by  smuggling in the subterranean, aerial, and maritime environments. This  report addresses the following questions:  1.  What do DHS data show about the prevalence of smuggling by cross- border tunnel, ultralight aircraft, and selected maritime methods from  fiscal years 2011 through 2016?  2.  To what extent has DHS assessed the risks from smuggling by these  methods?  3.  How has DHS addressed smuggling by these methods?  4.

We selected these smuggling  methods to include only those that would occur between ports of entry  through means other than overland (given our focus on subterranean,  aerial, and maritime smuggling); have been identified in strategy  documents or by senior DHS officials and DHS officials with whom we  met as a challenge or risk; and were of a magnitude that DHS had taken  steps to address them. We analyzed DHS policies, procedures, and  reports. We also conducted site visits to San Diego, El Centro, and  Riverside, California; Nogales and Yuma, Arizona; and Miami and Key  West, Florida. During these visits, we observed DHS approaches to  addressing the selected smuggling methods and interviewed cognizant  officials from Coast Guard; ICE HSI; and CBP\u2019s Border Patrol and AMO  about their efforts. We selected these locations based upon a  combination of factors, including the past detected use of the selected smuggling methods and the presence of coordinated DHS efforts to  counter them in these areas. The information gathered from our site visits  is not generalizable to other locations but provides insights into DHS\u2019s  responses to these incursions and efforts to use risk and performance  information to stop future smuggling incidents using these methods.

We assessed the reliability of these data  by performing electronic testing, among other things, and found the data  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of reporting trends in the selected  smuggling methods from fiscal years 2011 through 2016. To address the  second question, we analyzed DHS risk, threat, intelligence, and  capability assessments against GAO\u2019s risk management framework and  leading practices for interagency collaboration. To address the third  question, we analyzed DHS policies, procedures, and documentation on  developing and acquiring new technology. We also interviewed officials  from Border Patrol, AMO, ICE HSI, Coast Guard, and relevant  Department of Defense (DOD) offices and organizations to determine the  extent to which they have established mechanisms to coordinate assets,  operations, and share technology to address the selected smuggling  methods. We assessed these efforts against GAO\u2019s leading practices for  interagency collaboration and risk management framework. To address  the fourth question, we analyzed DHS and component performance  reports, among other things, and interviewed DHS officials to determine  how they use performance information.

To assess the risk from cross-border tunnels,  CBP commissioned a 2010 assessment that identified areas along the  southern borders of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas  as having a high risk from tunneling activity, based on factors such as soil  composition, water table, and known tunneling activity. However, this  assessment did not analyze the risk from rudimentary tunnels,  interconnecting tunnels, or mechanically bored tunnels. CBP is currently  in the process of obtaining a tunnel risk assessment tool that is to  compute an estimated statistical likelihood for each of the four types of  illicit tunnels along the southwest border. Further, unlike the 2010  assessment, this tool is to use a web-based platform that can be updated  to allow risk to be re-assessed on an ongoing basis. CBP officials expect  this tool to be completed in June 2017.", "ICE HSI and Border Patrol have also conducted intelligence assessments  to identify areas that are at a higher risk from tunneling based on factors  such as transnational criminal organization smuggling tactics and past  tunneling activity. For example, a 2014 ICE HSI intelligence report states  that transnational criminal organizations primarily use tunnels to transport  narcotics, particularly marijuana, which is an important source of profit.  Marijuana is also relatively bulky, and tunnels have the advantage of  being able to accommodate large drug loads, according to the  assessment.", "CBP has also identified capability gaps that affect its ability to address  cross-border tunnels. As part of the process to acquire tunnel detection  technology, CBP sought an independent examination of factors that affect  counter tunnel capabilities using a framework that assesses the state of  doctrine; organization; training; materiel; leadership; personnel; facilities;  and regulations, grants, and standards. The analysis was issued in June  2013 and identified some gaps in tunnel technology as well as non- technological capability gaps in doctrine, among other things.

To keep relevant Border Patrol agents  informed of trends and recent ultralight aircraft activity, AMO and Border  Patrol officials stationed at AMO\u2019s AMOC, which monitors the airspace on  the border, send each Border Patrol sector along the southwest border a  monthly briefing as well as provide real-time coordination at the time of  the incursions, as discussed later in this report.", "AMO has also analyzed ultralight aircraft smuggling tactics and found that  ultralight aircraft smugglers generally will not land in the United States  and instead will airdrop the narcotics load in order to quickly return to  Mexico. AMO officials explained that pilots use this method hoping to  avoid arrest. According to AMO analysis, the narcotics are generally  dropped within a couple of miles of a main road so that the smugglers can  quickly collect the narcotics and blend in with other vehicle traffic on the  road. Additionally, AMO reports that ultralight aircraft smugglers operate  like sub-contractors for transnational criminal organizations, and are  financially responsible for the narcotics they transport. As a result,  ultralight aircraft primarily transport low- to mid-grade marijuana, with an  average load size around 200 pounds, because the cost of higher value  narcotics is prohibitive and the risk from destroying a load during the air  drop is too great.", "CBP has identified gaps in its air domain awareness and made finding a  technical solution a priority in 2009. CBP has efforts underway to address  these capability gaps, which we discuss later in this report. According to  CBP analysis, CBP has sufficient capabilities to respond to and resolve  detected ultralight aircraft incursions and changes in non-technical  capabilities, such as increased manpower, will not significantly enhance  its ability to address the threat posed by ultralight aircraft.", "Maritime vessels. To assess the risk from maritime smuggling through  noncommercial vessels such as panga boats and recreational vessels,  Coast Guard has produced annual cross-border drug smuggling  intelligence assessments since 2014. These assessments have  consistently identified Coast Guard Districts 11, 8, and 7, which cover the  coastal borders of California and the Southeast United States from Texas  through the east coasts of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, as well  as Puerto Rico, as the primary threat area for cross-border drug  smuggling by noncommercial vessels. Further, the Coast Guard  intelligence assessments identified marijuana smuggling from Mexico to  California by panga boats as a primary threat to the U.S. mainland. In the  fiscal year 2015 assessment, the most recent available, Coast Guard  found that as with previous years, panga boat smuggling routes tended to  be hundreds of miles off shore, with intended destinations north of Los  Angeles\u2014most often between Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo,  California\u2014to avoid U.S. maritime law enforcement.", "Coast Guard has also assessed the risk from maritime migration through  its biennial National Maritime Strategic Risk Assessment. Coast Guard\u2019s  2014 risk assessment, the most recent available, found that illegal  maritime immigration was associated with societal costs and threats to  the safety of the migrants at sea, and was ranked 16 among the 27  incident types assessed in terms of the impact and severity of risks.  Specifically, Coast Guard found that the risk from maritime migration was  lower than the risks from drug smuggling, natural disasters, and over- fishing, among others, and greater than the risks from events such as an  accidental hazardous material release or a debris or sewage discharge,  among others.", "The National Maritime Strategic Risk Assessment is designed to analyze  risk at a national level to help inform resource allocation decisions and  does not provide assessments at the local level or by vessel type;  however, Coast Guard and its DHS partners have also conducted  regional assessments. DHS\u2019s Southern Border and Approaches  Campaign Plan identified maritime migration from Cuba, Hispaniola, and  the Bahamas as the primary illegal maritime migration threat, and Florida- based Coast Guard, AMO, ICE HSI, and Border Patrol have analyzed  maritime migration from these areas. For example, intelligence  assessments issued from 2015 through spring 2016 found that there has  been an increase in Cuban maritime migration that will likely continue due  to perceptions that U.S. immigration policies for Cubans will change.  Coast Guard assessments show that most Cuban migrants use  homemade vessels known as rustics, rafts, or chugs to travel to the  Florida Keys; however, transnational criminal organizations commonly  use stolen or personally owned recreational vessels to transport migrants,  according to a fiscal year 2016 AMO assessment. Coast Guard, ICE HSI,  AMO, and Border Patrol reported that another key maritime migrant  smuggling route is from the Bahamas to Southeast Florida, a trip that can  be as short as 45 nautical miles.", "Coast Guard data show that maritime migrant smuggling occurs less  frequently along the California coast, but California-based Coast Guard,  AMO, ICE HSI, and Border Patrol officials we met with have also  assessed this threat. Personal watercraft, such as jet skis, were the most  commonly used vessel to smuggle migrants in the region, according to a  joint fiscal year 2015 California Coastal Region assessment, though  recreational vessels and panga boats were also used.

For example, as  shown in table 1, the definition of a panga is different in the interagency  California coastal region intelligence assessment and data system than it  is in Coast Guard\u2019s intelligence assessments, with the former specifying  that a panga would have \u201cmultiple\u201d outboard motors while the latter states  that a panga would have \u201cone or two\u201d outboard motors. Furthermore, both  definitions of pangas overlap with other categories of vessels, including  \u201clanchas,\u201d which Coast Guard has defined as open-hulled vessels with  one outboard motor used in the Gulf Coast region, and \u201cgo-fasts,\u201d which  Coast Guard has defined as an open-hulled vessel with one or more  outboard motors that can operate at 25 knots in shallow water. The panga  boats that have been used to smuggle drugs in the California coastal  region are classified as \u201clanchas\u201d and \u201cgo-fast\u201d vessels in the  government-wide CCDB and \u201cgo-fasts\u201d in a Coast Guard report and a  national counternarcotic strategy.", "Additionally, the term \u201cgo-fast\u201d is used by Coast Guard, AMO, Border  Patrol, and ICE HSI in various assessments to describe maritime  smuggling methods in Florida. However, the go-fast smuggling in Florida  includes vessels that can blend in with the recreational boating traffic in  the area\u2014or what the California coastal region DHS partners would term  a \u201cpleasure craft.\u201d", "AMO officials stated that differences in terminology do not impact  operations at the local level, as officials are familiar with smuggling  methods in their area and local vernacular; however, these differences  make it difficult to synthesize information across components and regions  to get a full picture of the threats posed by panga boat and recreational  vessel smuggling nationwide. Facilitating this type of comprehensive  assessment could help better inform management resource allocation  decisions. For example, Coast Guard and AMO officials we met with in  California and Florida stated that vessel types are associated with  different smuggling tactics that require different operational response;  recreational vessels used for smuggling narcotics that blend into  legitimate recreational maritime traffic may require additional tools, such  as human intelligence and training, canines, and non-intrusive inspection  equipment to identify suspect vessels and hidden compartments. In  comparison, the officials told us that more \u201covert\u201d forms of smuggling,  such as panga boats with large unconcealed, or minimally concealed  drug loads, and recreational vessels overcrowded with migrants, are  relatively easier to address since they can be detected and identified as  suspect by maritime patrol aircraft.", "Differences in regional parlance and varying options in different  databases have contributed to the lack of standardized definitions and  categories of vessels, according to Coast Guard, AMO, and ICE HSI  officials. Managers of the interagency CCDB recognized the issue of  overlapping vessel definitions and are planning to revise the vessel  options to eliminate overlapping categories such as \u201clancha\u201d and \u201cpanga\u201d  under the category of \u201cgo-fast.\u201d However, these changes will not affect  the other databases or threat assessments used by DHS. Key  considerations for implementing interagency collaborative mechanisms  state that developing a common terminology can help bridge  organizational cultures to enhance and sustain interagency efforts. DHS  has also recognized the importance of common definitions and produces  an annual DHS Lexicon to define terms and reduce the possibility of  misunderstanding when communicating across the department and help  DHS develop and manage knowledge, information, and data. Coast  Guard, AMO, Border Patrol, and ICE HSI officials agreed that it would be  beneficial to have standard vessel definitions DHS-wide to enhance the  quality of data and intelligence assessments and facilitate information  sharing across agencies.", "However, Coast Guard and ICE HSI officials noted that it could be  challenging to identify all relevant data systems that use vessel types and  determine how to reconcile older data with new categories. While we  recognize that this could be challenging, there are upcoming opportunities  DHS could leverage to efficiently develop and promulgate common vessel  definitions and categories. For example, once changes to CCDB vessel  categories are finalized, relevant DHS components could consider  whether these vessel categories will meet their needs. Additionally, in the  next year DHS plans to draft a new Small Vessel Security Strategy to  address the risks that terrorists will use small vessels for transportation or  an attack, which could be used as a forum for developing standard  definitions for the various types of small vessels for inclusion in the DHS  Lexicon and use in future threat assessments. If updating all databases  proves to be difficult or costly, components could, for example, create  common terminology by documenting a crosswalk that demonstrates the  relationship between their vessel categories and established DHS-wide  vessel definitions. By standardizing definitions of panga boats and  recreational vessels in the DHS Lexicon for use in future threat  assessments, DHS would be better able to leverage its threat  assessments to develop a clearer and more comprehensive picture of the  threats posed by these maritime smuggling methods across the nation.

In addition, DHS has established coordination mechanisms that  specifically target the selected smuggling methods.", "Cross-border tunnels. DHS has established two interagency Border  Enforcement Security Task Force (BEST) Tunnel Task Forces to conduct  investigations into cross-border tunnel incursions.

Participants in the task forces include Border  Patrol, ICE HSI, and the Department of Justice\u2019s Drug Enforcement  Administration, among others. State and local law enforcement officials  sometimes provide additional support during a tunnel investigation. For  instance, state and local police will, at times, help provide personnel to  surveil or search a warehouse suspected of housing a tunnel exit. In  addition to participating in the interagency Tunnel Task Force, Border  Patrol established a Western Corridor Tunnel Interdiction Group in  California to patrol the subterranean drainage infrastructure to locate,  map, and monitor interconnected tunnels. Also, Border Patrol and ICE  officials in other sectors where tunnels pose threats have established  informal task forces and partnerships to facilitate information sharing and  leverage intelligence and resources on counter tunnel efforts.

AMOC officials stated they can manually monitor  movement patterns on border airspace radar feeds and look for indicators  of ultralight activity. When AMOC officials detect a possible ultralight  incursion, they then call the relevant Border Patrol and ICE HSI stations.  Conversely, if Border Patrol agents or another federal law enforcement  partner suspects a possible ultralight aircraft incursion, they call AMOC in  order to confirm detection on radar. Border Patrol and ICE HSI  representatives stationed at AMOC stated that their co-location further  facilitates interagency coordination. AMO and Border Patrol officials noted  transnational criminal organizations have employed counter-measures to  thwart their efforts. For example, transnational criminal organizations use  drones and scouts to conduct counter-surveillance. In order to help  mitigate the challenges, select Border Patrol sectors and ICE HSI field  offices created ad hoc coordination mechanisms and operations to  partner and better focus resources when the threat posed by ultralight  aircraft is high in their areas of responsibility. These sectors and offices  also established tip lines for the general public to report suspicious air  activity and instruct their agents on ultralight detection methods.", "DHS also coordinates with DOD to share information related to aerial  incursions, identify technical solutions, and coordinate assets to support  interdiction efforts. For example, DHS leverages DOD as well as Federal  Aviation Administration radars to feed into Air and Marine Operations  Surveillance System.

To address maritime  smuggling, RECOM partners host joint teleconferences to create  interagency interdiction plans, coordinate asset deployment and  schedules to de-conflict missions, and discuss post-interdiction  prosecution of migrant cases. RECOMs also serve to share information  and intelligence on the threats posed by maritime smuggling and trends  among partners. While DHS component officials identified some  challenges in addressing maritime smuggling, component officials also  reported that the RECOMs help mitigate challenges.

As previously discussed, ICE is the primary  agency responsible for tunnel investigations, and CBP is responsible for  tunnel interdiction and remediation. Both ICE and CBP have designated  an authority within their agency for counter-tunnel responsibilities.  Specifically, ICE HSI has designated a Unit Chief in its Contraband  Smuggling Unit as responsible for oversight and coordination of ICE  tunnel investigations at the headquarters-level, among other things. CBP  designated Border Patrol as the primary point of contact for tunnels within  CBP in 2010, and tasked it with establishing standardized detection and  reporting procedures for CBP entities. CBP later formed the Tunnel  Program Management Office (TPMO) in 2013 to serve as CBP\u2019s  centralized coordination point for addressing tunnels. However, as of  November 2016, neither of these ICE or CBP authorities had established  standard operating procedures guiding how agencies should individually  or collectively address tunnels used for smuggling. A tunnel capability gap  assessment commissioned by CBP in 2013 found that while standard  operating procedures existed in some sectors, CBP did not have an  accepted set of tactics, techniques, and procedures, such as best  practices and tunnel activity indicators. The ICE-led BEST Tunnel Task  Forces also do not have documented standard operating procedures for  addressing tunnels.", "In studies, CBP and ICE have identified the absence of standard  operating procedures as a challenge. For example, the CBP capability  gap assessment found that DHS personnel located in different areas had  inconsistent knowledge of the primary methods for addressing tunnels  and that selected Border Patrol personnel conducting tunnel prediction  operations may not have access to all pertinent information.", "During the course of our audit work, we further found that establishing  standard operating procedures could strengthen DHS\u2019s counter-tunnel  efforts. Specifically, we found that not all officials addressing cross-border  tunnels were aware of\u2014and thus not accessing\u2014all relevant DHS  systems or offices with tunnel information. For example, ICE HSI officials  we met with at one location were unaware of the existing TPMO or any  national tunnel office. Further, TPMO, ICE HSI, and Border Patrol officials  told us that standard operating procedures for tunnels could be beneficial.  For example, ICE HSI and Border Patrol officials from three different  sectors indicated a national-level office could help support counter-tunnel  efforts by providing guidance, training, and strategic-level insight on  tunnels. For instance, ICE HSI officials from one sector said it would be  helpful to have guidance on detecting different types of tunnels and  different investigative techniques for detecting tunnels used across  sectors.", "In recognition of these issues, both the CBP and ICE assessments  recommended that DHS establish standard operating procedures for  addressing tunnels in order to formalize methods and enhance  information sharing for operational coordination. CBP accepted the CBP  capability gap assessment\u2019s recommendation and tasked the TPMO with  leading the effort to provide strategic-level guidance and direction for CBP  counter-tunnel efforts. However, according to the Assistant Chief who  leads the TPMO, it has not yet developed standard operating procedures  due to lack of personnel and resources. According to the ICE HSI Unit  Chief responsible for oversight and coordination of ICE tunnel  investigations, no standard operating procedures could be drafted that  would address the needs of specific locales due to the different  operational areas. Additionally, both the TPMO and ICE HSI officials at  the headquarters-level stated that establishing standard operating  procedures is unnecessary because current coordination is effective and  CBP and ICE have general memoranda of understanding from 2004 and  2006 that govern their coordination. While we recognize there are  different types of tunnel threats in varying geographic environments and  that CBP and ICE coordinate to address tunnels, counter-tunnel standard  operating procedures could include best practices and procedures  applicable to all sectors\u2014such as procedures for reporting and accessing  information on tunnels\u2014as well as key differentiated information to  account for the distinct operational areas. Further, CBP and ICE  assessments have recommended establishing standard operating  procedures for counter-tunnel efforts and the general CBP-ICE  memoranda of understanding do not speak specifically to counter-tunnel  coordination procedures.", "Additionally, the DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG)  recommended in a 2012 report that DHS designate an authority to  provide leadership, strategy and coordination of DHS counter-tunnel  efforts across DHS components. The OIG identified the lack of a  department-level focal point for tunnels as a concern and stated that it  increased the risk of DHS not achieving its goal of disrupting criminal  organizations that engage in cross-border smuggling. As an example, the  DHS OIG reported that there were not sufficient policies or procedures in  place to ensure that when acquiring tunnel detection technology, CBP  would take into account ICE HSI investigative requirements, such as the  need for covert use so as to not alert criminals to the presence of law  enforcement. At the time, CBP and ICE stated they would designate a co- chaired committee to satisfy the recommendation. DHS approved this  decision in February 2013. However, according to the TPMO, the co- chaired committee has never convened, nor has it had the need to take  action. The ICE HSI Unit Chief responsible for tunnel coordination and  oversight was unaware of the existence of the committee.", "Convening this CBP-ICE committee to establish standard operating  procedures could help provide strategic guidance that addresses the  complexity of the threats posed by cross-border tunnels and ensure  information is shared among the range of agencies involved. Once  convened, this committee could also take the lead on other strategic  counter-tunnel efforts, such as developing training. Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government calls for agencies to implement control  activities, such as policies, to help achieve objectives and ensure  accountability for stewardship of government resources. Additionally,  these standards state that control activities should be documented in, for  example, management directives, administrative policies, or operating  manuals. Leadership is a key feature for successful interagency  collaboration, and we have previously reported that it is often beneficial to  designate one lead in order to centralize accountability and expedite  decision making. We have also previously reported that establishing a  focal point with sufficient time, responsibility, authority, and resources can  help ensure successful implementation of complex interagency and  intergovernmental undertakings. While developing standard operating  procedures for detecting, identifying, and addressing cross-border tunnels  may require some investment of resources, having such standardized  procedures could reduce resource requirements over time by increasing  the efficiency of counter-tunnel efforts by formalizing and enhancing  information sharing and establishing protocols.

In response, CBP initiated the Ultralight  Aircraft Detection acquisition program to acquire a technological solution.  In 2011, CBP formalized the operational need for an Ultralight Aircraft  Detection program in an Operational Needs Statement, in which it  justified its need for the technology by referring the reader to capability  gaps it had documented in a Mission Needs Statement for Small Dark  Aircraft-Low Flying Aircraft Detection, an ongoing research and  development project for technology to address the threats posed by  ultralight aircraft and other low-flying aircraft. CBP deployed a limited  number of Ultralight Aircraft Detection systems to detect ultralight aircraft  along both the southern and northern borders. In June 2015, CBP, in  accordance with recommendations from AMO and Border Patrol, ceased  operational use of the Ultralight Aircraft Detection systems.

Furthermore, DHS S&T plans to extend the Small Dark Aircraft-Low  Flying Aircraft Detection project to the southern border to help detect and  track low-flying aircraft. Additionally, CBP intends to replace or modernize  the Tethered Aerostat Radar System and states in its acquisition  documentation that it is seeking alternative capabilities to improve target  detection of low flying aircraft, among other things.

Furthermore, ICE HSI and CBP AMO officials reported that performance  measures which focus on a particular smuggling method or conveyance  would not be the best measure of their efforts to combat smuggling. For  example, AMO officials reported that higher-level measures linked to  AMO\u2019s goals and objectives can better address the full range of  smuggling methods. Additionally, CBP and ICE officials told us that jointly  establishing and monitoring performance measures and targets is difficult  due to the component\u2019s different missions. For example, a performance  measure relevant to CBP, such as the number of miles of border under  surveillance for tunnels, would not be relevant to ICE.", "We recognize the challenges associated with resource constraints and  establishing performance measures, as well as the value of higher level  performance measures; however, agency resources are being invested to  address cross-border tunnel, ultralight aircraft, and selected maritime  smuggling methods and without some type of performance measurement,  DHS does not have reasonable assurance that efforts to address these  selected smuggling methods are effective. DHS already collects data on  these selected smuggling threats that could be leveraged to mitigate the  resources needed to measure performance. Additionally, DHS could  leverage other DHS efforts as avenues to establish performance  measures. For example, DHS could utilize the planned Maritime Security  Coordination Working Group to establish performance measures and  targets related to assessing the effectiveness of efforts to address panga  boats and recreational vessels. Further, even if it is not possible to  collect certain data, such as the full universe of cross-border tunnels,  GAO, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Performance  Improvement Council\u2019s Law Enforcement Measures Working Group\u2014an  interagency effort to address issues related to law enforcement  performance measures chaired by the Office of Management and  Budget\u2014have previously reported that agencies can use proxy measures  to determine how well a program is functioning. These proxy measures  should be closely tied to the desired outcome\u2014preventing smuggling  through cross-border tunnels\u2014and could include measures such as the  percent of tunnels discovered prior to completion or the percent of tunnels  discovered prior to being operational. In addition, by assessing the  performance for each selected smuggling method, DHS could obtain  valuable information on the relative risks posed by these smuggling  methods as compared to other methods to capture the overall smuggling  threat picture and better inform resource allocation decisions for  addressing smuggling. Moreover, assessing performance information  across components could help components determine cost-effective  means for improving performance. For example, if CBP established and  monitored performance measures related to subterranean domain  awareness, both ICE HSI and Border Patrol could use this information to  inform investigations and patrol operations.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  regular monitoring is needed to assess the quality of performance over  time, and information should be communicated to management to  achieve its objectives and ensure any issues are resolved. We have  previously reported that performance measures are important  management tools that can be used by individual programs or initiatives  and that performance measures should have quantifiable, numerical  targets or other measurable values to allow for easier comparison with  actual performance. Furthermore, interagency collaboration best  practices call for federal agencies engaged in collaborative efforts to create the means to monitor and evaluate their efforts to enable them to  identify areas for improvement. By working together to establish  performance measures and regularly monitor performance against  targets, managers could obtain valuable information on successful  approaches and areas that could be improved to help ensure that both  technology investments and operational responses to address cross- border tunnel, ultralight aircraft, and selected maritime smuggling are  effective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As transnational criminal organizations have adapted their techniques to  smuggle drugs and humans through cross-border tunnels, ultralight  aircraft, panga boats, and recreational vessels to evade detection, it is  vital that DHS respond accordingly in its border security enforcement  efforts. DHS has taken steps to assess and address the risk posed by  these smuggling methods, but opportunities exist to ensure these efforts  are effective and that managers and stakeholders have information  needed to make decisions. In particular, DHS would be better able to  develop a more comprehensive picture of the threats posed by panga  boats and recreational vessels across the nation and leverage its  maritime threat assessments to make decisions by standardizing vessel  definitions departmentwide in the DHS Lexicon for use in future threat  assessments. Additionally, convening the CBP-ICE committee to  establish standard operating procedures for addressing cross-border  tunnels could help provide strategic guidance that addresses the  complexity of the threats posed by cross-border tunnels and ensure  information is shared among the range of agencies involved.", "DHS has also invested in technology to help detect and track  subterranean, aerial, and maritime smuggling, including various  technologies to help detect and track ultralight aircraft; however, CBP has  not assessed and documented how all of the alternative ultralight aircraft  technical solutions being considered will fully address operational  requirements or the costs and benefits associated with different  approaches. This type of analysis could help better position CBP to use  its resources more effectively and ensure that technology solutions  selected will fully meet operational needs prior to making investment  decisions. Furthermore, DHS has not assessed its performance in  addressing any of the selected smuggling methods.

DHS provided written comments, which are summarized below  and reproduced in full in appendix III, and DOD did not provide written  comments. DHS concurred with four of the six recommendations in the  report and described actions underway or planned to address them. DHS  did not concur with two recommendations in the report. DHS also  provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "With regard to the first recommendation, that DHS develop definitions for  maritime vessels used for smuggling in the DHS Lexicon, DHS concurred  and described planned actions to address the recommendation.  According to DHS, in March 2017, the DHS Lexicon Program created a  terminology working group composed of Coast Guard, CBP, ICE, and  other DHS maritime subject matter experts to address terminology and  definition issues identified in our report. The terminology and definitions  would then be published for use across the department. If implemented  effectively, these actions should address the intent of the  recommendation.", "With regard to the second recommendation, that the CBP-ICE tunnel  committee convene and establish standard operating procedures for  addressing cross-border tunnels, DHS did not concur. DHS noted that  there are memoranda of understanding between CBP and ICE outlining  how they work together and share information as well as component- specific procedures in place at the local sector level that DHS believes  constitute the procedures we recommended. In addition, DHS cited the  establishment of multi-agency BEST Tunnel Task Forces in the areas at  the highest risk for cross-border tunnel activity as helping to ensure  collaboration and information sharing. However, CBP and ICE agreed  that there may be benefits from strengthening existing operating  procedures and stated that they plan to review, revise, and potentially  consolidate procedures as they deem appropriate.", "We continue to believe that establishing national-level, joint CBP-ICE  standard operating procedures for addressing cross-border tunnels could  help ensure that information is shared by CBP and ICE across all  locations and minimize the likelihood that information and partnerships  are lost during personnel changes. As discussed in this report, the  memoranda of understanding between CBP and ICE do not speak  specifically to counter-tunnel coordination procedures. Additionally, as we  reported, both CBP and ICE have completed studies that identified the  absence of standard operating procedures as a challenge and  recommended the establishment of departmental standard operating  procedures. During the course of our audit work, we further found that not  all officials addressing cross-border tunnels were aware of relevant  information systems or the TPMO, and ICE HSI and Border Patrol  officials from three different sectors indicated additional guidance,  training, and strategic-level insights would be helpful. While we agree that  strengthening existing operating procedures could be helpful, not all  sectors or relevant officials may benefit without the establishment of  standard operating procedures that apply nationwide. For example, as  noted in our report, the BEST Tunnel Task Forces do not currently have  documented standard operating procedures for addressing tunnels.", "Establishing departmental standard operating procedures for tunnels  could help ensure that all relevant ICE and CBP officials have guidance  on how to address tunnels.", "With regard to the third recommendation, that CBP assess and document  how alternative technological solutions being considered will fully meet  operational needs related to ultralight aircraft, DHS concurred. DHS  stated that AMO is developing a Capability Analysis Report, a Mission  Need Statement, and a Concept of Operations for air domain awareness  that will result in validated requirements for ultralight aircraft, among other  threats. In addition, DHS stated that subsequent to these efforts, it will  prepare operational requirements documents that will specify how  technological solutions will meet the requirements. If implemented  effectively, these actions should address the intent of the  recommendation.", "With regard to the fourth recommendation, that CBP and ICE jointly  establish and monitor performance measures and targets related to  cross-border tunnels, DHS concurred and stated that CBP and ICE will  work together to harmonize performance data collection efforts and  develop performance measures and targets. However, DHS stated that it  would be premature to establish measures and targets prior to making  tunnel detection technology acquisition and deployment decisions, and  therefore will wait to develop them until it has addressed its technology  challenges. We believe that DHS could benefit from establishing some  performance measures and targets prior to making technology decisions.  As discussed in this report, DHS initiated a program to acquire tunnel  detection technology in 2012 and has an analysis of alternatives to  evaluate different technology options underway, but this analysis has  been delayed and CBP has not yet determined new time frames. Given  that CBP has been working to acquire additional tunnel detection  technology for several years and time frames for its acquisition have not  been determined, we believe that establishing some measures and  targets in the interim could help inform DHS\u2019s current efforts to address  cross-border tunnels and provide insights relevant to its tunnel detection  technology acquisition decisions. Once fully implemented, DHS\u2019s planned  actions should address the intent of the recommendation.", "With regard to the fifth recommendation, that CBP establish and monitor  performance targets related to ultralight aircraft, DHS concurred and  stated that CBP\u2019s AMO and Border Patrol are developing a joint  performance measure and targets for interdicting ultralight aircraft.  According to DHS, AMO and Border Patrol plan to document how the  measure will be defined and validate the data reporting process. If  implemented effectively, these actions should address the intent of the  recommendation.", "With regard to the sixth recommendation, that Coast Guard, CBP, and  ICE establish and monitor RECOM performance measures and targets  related to panga boat and recreational vessel smuggling, DHS did not  concur. DHS stated that it believes that by establishing common  terminology to address our first recommendation, the RECOMs will have  more reliable, usable analyses to inform their maritime interdiction efforts.  However, it did not believe that performance measures and targets  related to smuggling by panga boats would provide the most useful  strategic assessment of operations to prevent all illicit trafficking,  regardless of area of operations or mode of transportation. DHS also  cited the recent creation of the DHS Office of Policy, Strategy, and Plans  that is to work with Coast Guard, CBP, ICE, and other components and  offices to better evaluate the effectiveness of all operations that work to  prevent the illegal entry of goods and people into the country, as  appropriate. Additionally, DHS stated that it will continue to work with the  Office of National Drug Control Policy to create a set of enterprise-wide,  strategic-level measures of performance for drug supply reduction  activities. DHS requested that we consider this recommendation resolved  and closed.", "We continue to believe that by jointly establishing performance measures  and targets related to panga boat and recreational vessel smuggling,  Coast Guard, CBP, and ICE could track valuable performance  information, such as how panga boat and recreational vessel smuggling  events are identified and detected, or the percent of these detected  smuggling events that result in interdictions, to help inform their  collaborative efforts to address maritime smuggling. We agree that  creating common terminology is a positive step; however, without  performance measures or targets, DHS does not have reasonable  assurance that its collaborative efforts and investments to counter cross- border smuggling by panga boats and recreational vessels are effective.  Similarly, we recognize the value of high level strategic performance  measures; however, these types of measures may not provide sufficiently  detailed performance information to allow DHS to identify successful  approaches to addressing smuggling by panga boats and recreational  vessels and areas for improvement. Further, performance measures and  targets related to panga boat and recreational vessel smuggling could, in  turn, better position DHS to understand the overall smuggling threat  picture and better inform resource allocation decisions for addressing  smuggling and drug supply reduction activities.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of the  Defense, and other interested parties.

What do Department of Homeland Security (DHS) data show about  the prevalence of smuggling by cross-border tunnel, ultralight aircraft,  and selected maritime methods from fiscal years 2011 through 2016?  2.  To what extent has DHS assessed the risks from smuggling by these  methods?  3.  How has DHS addressed smuggling by these methods?  4.  To what extent has DHS assessed the results of its efforts to address  smuggling by these methods?", "To address these questions, we focused our review on smuggling across  U.S. mainland borders, including coastal borders, and we selected the  following smuggling methods: cross-border tunnels, ultralight aircraft,  panga boats, recreational maritime vessels, and self-propelled semi- submersible and fully submersible vessels. We selected these smuggling  methods to include only those that would occur between ports of entry  through means other than overland (given our focus on subterranean,  aerial, and maritime smuggling); have been identified in strategy  documents or by senior DHS officials and DHS officials with whom we  met as a challenge or risk; and were of a magnitude that DHS had taken  steps to address them. We analyzed DHS policies, procedures, reports,  and data regarding the selected smuggling methods from fiscal years  2011 through 2016. We also conducted site visits to San Diego, El  Centro, and Riverside, California; Nogales and Yuma, Arizona; and Miami  and Key West, Florida. During these visits, we observed DHS approaches  to addressing the selected smuggling methods and interviewed cognizant  officials from U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard); U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI); and  U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s (CBP) U.S. Border Patrol (Border  Patrol) and Air and Marine Operations (AMO) about their efforts. We  selected these locations based upon a combination of factors, including  the past detected use of the selected smuggling methods and the  presence of coordinated DHS efforts to counter them in these areas. The  information gathered from our site visits is not generalizable to other  locations but provides insights into DHS\u2019s responses to these incursions  and efforts to use risk and performance information to stop future  smuggling incidents using these methods. Additionally, we interviewed  headquarters officials from the Coast Guard; CBP\u2019s Border Patrol, AMO,  and Office of Acquisition, the office responsible for CBP\u2019s acquisition of  products and services; ICE HSI; and DHS\u2019s Science and Technology  Directorate (S&T), the office responsible for leading research and  development efforts across the department, to obtain information and  perspectives on their efforts to assess and address threats posed by the  selected smuggling methods.", "To determine what DHS data show about the prevalence of smuggling by  cross-border tunnel, ultralight aircraft, and the selected maritime methods,  we obtained and analyzed DHS data from fiscal years 2011 through  2016. Due to the illicit nature of smuggling, there are limitations to  identifying the total number of smuggling events. Therefore, in this report  we discuss the number of known smuggling events such as the numbers  of discovered cross-border tunnels and detected ultralight aircraft and  maritime drug and migrant smuggling events. We assessed the reliability  of these data by (1) performing electronic testing for obvious errors in  accuracy and completeness, (2) reviewing existing information about the  data and the systems that produced them, and (3) interviewing agency  officials knowledgeable about the data. Additionally, where possible, we  compared the data to similar data DHS previously reported in such  products as a Congressional report on cross-border tunnels and an AMO  management report that included data on aerial incursions. We found the  data sufficiently reliable for the purposes of reporting trends in the  selected smuggling methods from fiscal years 2011 through 2016.", "To determine the extent to which DHS has assessed the risk from  smuggling by cross-border tunnel, ultralight aircraft, and the selected  maritime methods we analyzed Coast Guard, AMO, Border Patrol, and  ICE HSI risk, threat, and intelligence assessments.

We  evaluated these efforts against GAO\u2019s risk management framework and  leading practices for interagency collaboration.", "To determine how DHS has addressed smuggling by the selected  methods, we analyzed DHS policies, procedures, training documents,  and documentation on developing and acquiring new technology, such as  project plans, mission needs statements, and concepts of operations. We  also interviewed officials from Border Patrol, AMO, ICE HSI and Coast  Guard to determine the extent to which they have established  mechanisms to coordinate assets and operations related to smuggling by  cross-border tunnels, ultralight aircraft, and the selected maritime  conveyances, and associated challenges. Further, we met with  Department of Defense (DOD) officials from the offices and organizations  that have been involved in DHS efforts to address the selected smuggling  methods to determine the extent to which DHS has coordinated with DOD  to leverage any efforts or technologies. We assessed these efforts  against GAO\u2019s leading practices for interagency collaboration and risk  management framework.", "To examine the extent to which DHS has assessed the results of its  efforts to address the selected smuggling methods, we analyzed DHS  and component performance reports, threat assessments, and strategic  planning documents to determine what measures are in place to track the  effectiveness of DHS\u2019s counter cross-border tunnel, ultralight aircraft, and  maritime smuggling efforts.
