The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) is responsible for ensuring that motor carriers comply with these regulations. Recent reports have raised concerns that some drivers may not be tested, some may be tested but avoid detection, and some may test positive but continue to drive. GAO was asked to look at these challenges. This report reviews (1) the factors that contribute to challenges related to drug testing and (2) the various options that exist to address these challenges. GAO obtained information from a wide variety of stakeholders in the drug testing industry, and analyzed data from FMCSA and others to determine the potential effectiveness of various options."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Many factors contribute to the challenges of detecting drivers who are using illegal drugs and keeping them off the road until they complete the required return-to-duty (treatment) process. Factors contributing to drivers not being in a drug testing program include FMCSA's limited oversight resources for all carriers and limited enforcement options for safety audits of new carriers. Although FMCSA and its state partners review thousands of carriers each year, these reviews touch about 2 percent of the industry. As a result, carriers have limited incentives to follow the regulations. Factors contributing to failures to detect drug use include the ease of subverting the urine test, either because collection sites are not following protocols or because drivers are using products that are widely available to adulterate or substitute urine specimens. For example, GAO investigators, posing as commercial truck drivers needing drug tests, found that employees at 10 of 24 collection sites tested did not ask the investigator to empty his pants pockets, as they are required to do, to ensure he was not carrying adulterants or substitutes. Factors contributing to drivers testing positive yet continuing to drive include drivers not divulging past drug test history, carriers' failure to conduct thorough background checks on a driver's past drug testing history, and self-employed owner-operators' failure to remove themselves from service. GAO's analysis identified the following options as having the greatest potential for addressing these challenges: (1) For increasing the number of drivers tested: strengthen the enforcement of safety audits for new carriers. Stiffer requirements for having a testing program will likely result in more new entrants having effective drug testing programs. DOT has begun this improvement. (2) For reducing opportunities to subvert the test: additional authority to levy fines when collection sites do not follow federal protocols. This could decrease the opportunity to subvert the test. Also, congressional action to ban subversion products at the federal level could make these products more difficult to obtain. (3) For reducing the number of drivers who test positive and continue to drive: a national database of drug testing information. This would allow for more thorough checking of applicants' past test results. FMCSA has begun to lay the groundwork for a database, but FMCSA may need additional authority to ensure accurate reporting of information. Also, using the database to encourage states to suspend a driver's commercial driver's license after a positive drug test or refusal to test would be a more direct way to compel drivers to complete the return-to-duty process. Any of these options would require either additional resources or a transfer of resources that fund other safety-related initiatives, and some of the options require federal or state legislation and rule making. A national database would have to consider driver protections and a process by which information can be corrected or removed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Every year, approximately 5,500 fatalities and 160,000 injuries result from  crashes involving large trucks and buses. While vehicle problems and  driver behaviors such as speeding or fatigue are the most frequently cited  factors involved in these crashes, studies indicate that operating a motor  vehicle while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or both, can increase  crash risk anywhere from two- to six-fold. Since 1988, federal regulations  have required commercial drivers to be tested for drugs and alcohol in  order to reduce the number of crashes that occur as a result of illegal drug  use and alcohol misuse. This is a sizable undertaking since more than  700,000 commercial motor carrier companies are registered with the  federal government and thousands of new, often small, carriers enter the  industry each year. The Department of Transportation (DOT) and one of  its administrations, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration  (FMCSA), publish regulations that govern the drug and alcohol testing  process for truck and motor coach drivers. FMCSA is responsible for  ensuring that motor carriers comply with these regulations and does so  through safety audits of carriers that have recently started operations and  compliance reviews of carriers already in the industry. FMCSA officials  and some stakeholders we met with agreed that FMCSA\u2019s drug testing  requirements have been successful in deterring and reducing illegal drug  use among those employed in transportation safety-sensitive positions.", "Drug testing results indicate that some drivers are using illegal drugs.  FMCSA data show that each year from 1994 through 2005, between 1.3  percent and 2.8 percent of drivers tested positive for the presence of illegal  drugs under random testing. However, these statistics do not indicate the  full extent of drug use among truck drivers, and the current drug testing  program does not guarantee that drivers who do test positive or refuse to  be tested are disqualified from driving until they complete the required  return-to-duty process. In particular, the following issues have been  identified that suggest there is reason for concern regarding the potential  extent of drug use among truck drivers:    An unknown number of commercial drivers who use illegal drugs are not  part of a drug testing program. Statistics from compliance reviews indicate  that over 9 percent of these reviews conducted between 2001 and 2007  found that carriers have no drug testing program at all, meaning that many  drivers are not subject to a drug testing program. While most of those who  are not tested would likely test negative for drugs, it is likely that some  drivers who would test positive for drugs are not being tested.", "An unknown number of drug users manage to avoid detection even when  they go through the testing process. For example, some drivers are  successfully adulterating or substituting their urine specimens with  products that are widely available and marketed as allowing drivers to  \u201cbeat\u201d the test.", "Among the drivers who test positive, an unknown number continue to  drive\u2014primarily by \u201cjob-hopping\u201d\u2014without completing a required return- to-duty process guided by a substance abuse professional. There is little  data on the number of drivers who complete the return-to-duty process. A  Director of the Substance Abuse Program Administrators Association  conservatively estimates that less than half of commercial driver\u2019s license  (CDL) holders who test positive or refuse to test successfully complete the  return-to-duty process before returning to their jobs. Those who do not go  through the return-to-duty process and continue to drive are called job- hoppers\u2014job-hoppers test positive for one carrier; are fired, quit, or are  not hired; do not go through the return-to-duty process; abstain from drug  use for a short period; test negative on a pre-employment test for another  carrier; go to work for another carrier; and could continue to use drugs.  Furthermore, self-employed owner-operators are also unlikely to remove  themselves from safety-sensitive duty in the event of a positive test,  though it is not known how many truly self-employed owner-operators  exist.", "In light of these issues, this report examines (1) the factors that contribute  to the main challenges of ensuring all drivers are in a drug testing  program, limiting drivers\u2019 ability to avoid detection by a drug test, and  keeping drivers off the road once they have tested positive; and (2) the  options that exist for addressing these challenges, the potential effect of  these options, and the challenges that would be faced in implementing  them.", "To address these issues, we reviewed DOT and FMCSA regulations,  policies, and reports, and interviewed officials from FMCSA and DOT\u2019s  Office of Drug and Alcohol Policy and Compliance (ODAPC) and the  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Substance Abuse and  Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). This review focuses on  the controlled-substance portion of the drug and alcohol testing  regulations and does not address alcohol testing. We analyzed FMCSA  data on the results of compliance reviews and safety audits, as well as data  on enforcement activities. We interviewed motor carrier industry  associations representing many segments of the motor coach and trucking  industry, such as the American Trucking Association, the Owner-Operator  Independent Drivers Association, the American Bus Association, and the  National Association of Small Trucking Companies. We also interviewed  officials from unions representing truck and bus drivers and from a variety  of associations representing urine specimen collectors, medical review  officers, substance abuse professionals, consortiums/third-party  administrators, and others involved in the drug testing industry. We also  interviewed representatives from a company that manages several HHS- certified laboratories that analyze DOT drug test specimens. We observed  FMCSA oversight activities, including four compliance reviews and two  new-entrant safety audits in several states. We selected states in which to  observe compliance reviews and new-entrant safety audits on the basis of  the availability of ongoing FMCSA oversight activities. We interviewed  representatives from the motor carriers being audited. In total, we  interviewed 10 motor carriers, including both large and small carriers, and  one owner-operator. We interviewed officials from motor vehicle licensing  departments in states that had passed laws to require reporting of positive  drug test results. We interviewed the state attorney general\u2019s office of a  state that passed a law banning adulterants and substances to subvert a  drug test. We also interviewed officials involved in the drug testing  programs at other DOT modal administrations, including the Federal  Aviation Administration, the Federal Transit Administration, and the  Federal Railroad Administration, to gather information on whether these  problems are common across the administrations, how problems are  addressed by the other administrations, and how issues and circumstances  in the other modal administrations can or cannot be compared with  FMCSA\u2019s experience.", "In the course of our interviews and analyses, we identified many options  that have been suggested as possible ways to address problems or weak  points in FMCSA\u2019s current drug testing program. We assessed the various  options for their likely effectiveness in addressing the particular problem  they were designed to address and their feasibility from the standpoint of  cost, support, and amount of effort involved in implementation. Our  assessments were based on (1) analyzing and synthesizing the views of the  various government officials and industry stakeholders we interviewed  with regard to their estimations of the potential effectiveness and  feasibility of pursuing various options; (2) reviewing studies that have  been conducted regarding the feasibility of certain options; (3) analyzing  cost and other data; and (4) analyzing the experience of other modal  administrations or entities in implementing various options, where  applicable. Inherently there are certain limitations and variances in the  quality of data and information available about certain options. Therefore,  we used a certain amount of professional judgment in comparing options  relative to one another. We determined that the data used in this report are  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We conducted this performance  audit from June 2007 to May 2008 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Federal drug testing regulations require commercial motor carriers to have  a drug testing program that covers transportation safety-sensitive  employees who operate commercial motor vehicles with a gross vehicle  rating of 26,001 pounds or more; are designed to transport 16 or more  passengers, including the driver; or are of any size and are used in the  transportation of placarded quantities of hazardous materials. While the  largest motor carriers operate upward of 50,000 vehicles, most carriers are  small, with approximately 80 percent operating between one and six  vehicles. Carriers continually enter and exit the industry, and turnover  among small carriers is high, thereby making them harder to track. Since  1998, the industry has increased in size by an average of about 29,000  interstate carriers per year.", "The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 required DOT  to implement drug testing using urine specimens. According to DOT, in  2006, there were approximately 7.32 million DOT-regulated tests  conducted. DOT\u2019s drug testing both identifies and deters illegal drug use,  with the objective of improving road safety by preventing crashes in which  the driver\u2019s use of illegal drugs may be a contributing factor. According to  the Substance Abuse Program Administrators Association, illegal drug use  impacts driver safety in more ways than simply \u201cimpairment.\u201d Risk-taking  behavior, cognitive degradation, and inattention are all correlated with  illegal drug use, even when the individual is not \u201cimpaired\u201d from a  toxicological perspective. As implemented by DOT, testing covers five  drug categories: marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines (including  methamphetamine), opiates (including codeine, morphine, and heroin),  and phencyclidine (PCP). Motor carriers are required to obtain a negative  test result prior to employing drivers and allowing them to engage in  safety-sensitive duties. Carriers also must conduct random testing,  postaccident testing, and reasonable suspicion testing. If employees test  positive, refuse to test, or otherwise violate the regulations, they are  required to complete a return-to-duty process before re-engaging in safety- sensitive duties. The return-to-duty process is guided by a substance abuse  professional and must include education or treatment, return-to-duty  testing, follow-up testing, and possible aftercare.", "Motor carriers must implement a drug testing program and may use  service agents to perform some or the majority of the tasks needed to  comply with DOT drug testing requirements. At a minimum, a motor  carrier must designate one of its employees to act as an employer  representative. A designated employer representative is authorized by the  carrier to take immediate action to remove a driver from safety-sensitive  duties after being notified of a positive or refusal-to-test result. Service  agents cannot act as designated employer representatives. Service agents  must meet qualification requirements and are responsible for  implementing the required protocols. Figure 1 provides information about  DOT\u2019s drug testing process and the role of service agents.", "Service agents include the following:    A collector instructs drivers during the urine collection process, makes an  initial inspection of the specimen provided, divides the specimen into  primary and split specimens, and sends it to the laboratory for analysis. A  collection site can be any toilet in a clinic, hospital, or office building; a  toilet on site at a carrier\u2019s place of business; or a portable toilet.", "A laboratory analyzes the specimen. DOT is required to adhere to testing  protocols developed by HHS and to use laboratories certified by HHS; as  of April 2008, there were 42 such laboratories.", "A medical review officer, who is a licensed physician, is responsible for  receiving and reviewing laboratory results for a carrier\u2019s drug testing  program and evaluating medical explanations for certain drug test results.  In cases of confirmed positive, adulterated, substituted, or invalid test  results the officer must verify the laboratory results by speaking with  drivers and informing them of their right to have the split specimen tested.", "A substance abuse professional evaluates drivers who have tested  positive or refused to take a test and makes recommendations about the  return-to-duty process, which could include education, treatment, return- to-duty testing, follow-up testing, and aftercare. Drivers are required to  complete the recommended steps before they re-engage in safety-sensitive  functions.", "A consortium/third-party administrator is a company that can provide  or coordinate either a variety of or all of the above services for carriers  and owner-operators.", "The enormity and fluidity of the motor carrier industry and its service  agents, and FMCSA\u2019s limited resources, do not allow for firm control over  motor carriers or service agents in following drug testing requirements. As  of September 2007, there were approximately 724,000 commercial motor  carriers registered in FMCSA\u2019s Motor Carrier Management Information  System. FMCSA partners with states to provide oversight for safety  requirements, including drug testing. In addition to FMCSA, other DOT  administrations such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),  Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Federal Transit Administration  (FTA), and Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration  oversee safety requirements, including drug testing, in the aviation,  railroad, transit, and pipeline industries respectively. According to the  Substance Abuse Program Administrators Association, of these  administrations, FMCSA has the largest number of entities to oversee and  the fewest personnel, per company, to do so. See appendix II for more  detailed information on DOT administration oversight of drug testing  programs.", "FMCSA has responsibility for ensuring compliance by trucking and motor  coach companies with all types of safety requirements, such as vehicle  inspections and hours of service, as well as drug and alcohol testing  requirements. FMCSA and its state partners ensure compliance through  several oversight activities, including safety audits of new entrants and  compliance reviews of existing companies\u2014both of which cover  compliance with all types of safety requirements, including drug testing.  Safety audits are required for all new entrants to the trucking industry and  are opportunities for FMCSA and states to provide educational and  technical assistance to new carriers, explain carriers\u2019 responsibilities  under the federal requirements, and check for operational deficiencies.  Nearly 37,000 safety audits were conducted in 2007. FMCSA uses a risk- based approach in addressing safety priorities with compliance and  enforcement resources. For example, FMCSA targets carriers for  compliance reviews based primarily on a poor carrier safety record in  SafeStat, which assigns each carrier a priority to receive a compliance  review. FMCSA also targets carriers for compliance reviews based on a  fatal accident, a complaint against the carrier or driver, or a follow-up  investigation after violations. In 2007, FMCSA and state investigators  conducted 16,000 compliance reviews. In addition to the audits and  compliance reviews, FMCSA also makes educational materials about drug  testing available on its Web site.", "Data from FMCSA\u2019s oversight activities show that noncompliance and  poor compliance with the drug testing requirements is widespread. The  most frequently cited drug testing violation found in new-entrant safety  audits, which was found in 30 percent of safety audits conducted since  2003, was that carriers had no drug testing program at all. The two most  frequently cited drug testing violations in compliance reviews in 2007 were  that carriers have failed to adequately implement random drug testing or  pre-employment testing (see fig. 2). Over half of the 3,075 random testing  violations and 2,761 pre-employment testing violations resulted in fines,  with an average fine of $1,908 for random testing and $1,605 for pre- employment testing. Of the 190 cases in which a carrier failed to remove  a driver with a positive drug test from service, almost 80 percent resulted  in a fine, averaging $3,141.", "While FMCSA conducts oversight of motor carriers to ensure compliance  with drug testing requirements, FMCSA only conducts oversight of service  agents employed by the carrier in cases of specific allegations or  complaints. Few carriers conduct regular oversight of the service agents  they employ, and smaller carriers are less likely to conduct such oversight,  given their more limited resources. Other DOT administrations, including  FAA, FRA, and FTA, oversee service agents in various ways by conducting  regular compliance reviews, drug testing-specific audits, service agent- specific audits, and follow-up after complaints. These administrations can  also use public interest exclusions to enforce service agent compliance. A  recent GAO report found that there is a lack of compliance with protocols  among service agents that collect specimens for testing. Posing as  commercial truck drivers needing DOT drug tests, GAO investigators  determined that 22 of the 24 collection sites they tested were not in  compliance with some of the protocols that guide the process of collecting  a urine specimen."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Factors Contribute to the Challenges in FMCSA\u2019s Current Drug Testing Program", "paragraphs": ["A number of factors create challenges for FMCSA to ensure that all drivers  are in a drug testing program, drivers\u2019 ability to avoid detection by a drug  test is limited, and drivers who test positive are removed from safety- sensitive duties until they have completed return-to-duty requirements.  First, the factors that contribute to drivers not being subject to testing  include limitations in FMCSA\u2019s oversight resources. Limited resources  mean many carriers have little likelihood of ever being reviewed, which  may reduce the incentive for carriers to follow the regulations. Some  carriers also report confusion about how to implement effective drug  testing programs. Second, factors that contribute to drivers\u2019 ability to  avoid detection include the ease with which the urine specimen can be  subverted because of noncompliant collection sites and the wide  availability of products for adulterating or replacing the urine sample. In  addition, drivers could be using drugs for which DOT does not test. Third,  factors that lead to potentially thousands of drivers who test positive to  continue to drive without completing the required return-to-duty process  include the nonreporting of past positive drug tests by drivers to  prospective employers and self-employed owner-operators who fail to  remove themselves from service."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Limited Incentive for Carrier Compliance and Poor Understanding of Regulations by Some Carriers Can Result in Drivers Not Being Subject to Drug Testing", "paragraphs": ["Due to the large number of motor carriers regulated, FMCSA reviews only  a small percentage of the total number of carriers. Although those  reviewed typically have been identified as having significant safety  problems, the limited number of reviews lessens the incentive for existing  carriers to comply with drug testing requirements. FMCSA and its state  partners conducted an average of over 13,000 compliance reviews  annually on carriers from 2001 through 2007, but the majority of carriers  were not visited and have little likelihood of ever being visited. Existing  owner-operators and small carriers are less likely than larger companies to  be selected for a compliance review, since they are less likely to have a  safety record. Several associations told us that small carriers may have  less incentive to comply with drug testing regulations since visits by  FMCSA or state investigators are rare.", "New-entrant safety audits provide essential educational information to  new carriers. An FMCSA official told us the majority of new entrants are  typically visited 8 to 9 months after beginning operations. However, before  the safety audit occurs, new entrants may operate without adequately  implementing safety management regulations, including drug testing\u2014 FMCSA data indicate 30 percent of new entrants lack a drug testing  program. The purpose of the audit is to educate and encourage  compliance; under the current rules, absence of a drug testing program  does not result in a failure of the audit. An FMCSA official estimated that  less than 1 percent of new entrants fail safety audits. After an audit, the  carrier is given a list of recommendations for corrective actions, but  follow-up to ensure these actions were taken does not always occur.  However, if certain violations are discovered during a safety audit, such as  if a carrier is found to have used a driver who had a positive drug test, the  safety audit would end and the carrier would be immediately referred for a  compliance review. FMCSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to  strengthen the safety audit pass/fail criteria to give more significance to  basic safety management requirements, including drug testing, in  December 2006. A Final Rule is expected before the end of 2008.", "Several stakeholders we met with told us that for some carriers,  particularly small carriers, a poor understanding of their responsibilities to  implement drug testing regulations can also lead to carriers failing to  implement a drug testing program, or considerable noncompliance with  drug testing regulations. For example, one of the carriers we met with is in  the event industry and uses trucks to haul equipment. Since trucking is not  the company\u2019s core business, the company was not aware of the  requirement to drug test its drivers. In another example, a representative  from one carrier we visited explained that the company was not sure how  to test drivers who work only periodically.", "Compliance with drug testing regulations is particularly problematic for  self-employed owner-operators. Like other drivers employed by motor  carrier companies, self-employed owner-operators must follow drug  testing regulations and participate in a drug testing program. A pre- employment drug test must be performed, and FMCSA requires that the  owner-operator must enroll in a consortium for random drug testing  purposes. However, it is not clear how an individual who is both the  employer and the employee would comply with drug testing reporting  requirements. If a self-employed owner-operator tests positive, there is no  one to remove the individual from safety-sensitive duties. Furthermore,  self-employed owner-operators probably have the smallest chance of  being selected for a compliance review because FMCSA will most likely  not have sufficient data available to create SafeStat ratings, unless they are  in a crash with a fatality."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Factors Lead to Subversion of the Test and Result in Drug Users Avoiding Detection", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lack of Compliance by Collection Sites and Other Service Agents", "paragraphs": ["Collection sites that are out of compliance with DOT protocols for  specimen collection make it easier for drivers to subvert a test.

One  employee who did ask the investigator to empty his pockets did not verify  that all of his pockets were empty, and the investigator had hidden an  adulterant in his back pocket. At other collection sites, investigators found  substances available at the collection site that could have been used to  dilute or otherwise tamper with their specimen. At some sites, the  investigators found they were given ample opportunity to have a different  individual come in and provide a sample for them.", "While compliance with the regulations and collection protocols certainly  helps to reduce the opportunity for a driver to adulterate, dilute, or  substitute a specimen, as evidenced by our investigators\u2019 findings, full  compliance with all protocols does not ensure that no cheating will occur.  In fact, our investigators were able to substitute a specimen at one site  that followed all protocols. In addition, the investigators concluded that at  any collection site they visited, they would have been able to tamper with  their specimen despite DOT protocols.", "Carriers can mitigate the opportunity to cheat on a drug test by having on- site collections and limiting the opportunity drivers have to retrieve  adulterants or substitutes or to dilute their sample. One large carrier we  interviewed conducts on-site collections with its own personnel and has a  policy and protocol aimed at minimizing any opportunity a driver would  have to retrieve an adulterant or substitute. At this company, drivers are  notified in person of a random drug test and are immediately taken to have  a specimen collected, without the ability to go to a locker, a car, or  anywhere else before providing the specimen. In order to subvert the  specimen in this environment, drivers would need to carry an adulterant at  all times when in the facility. In addition to the DOT-mandated tests, this  carrier conducts more frequent drug testing. Specifically, the company  conducts unannounced tests of all drivers at least once each year. Also,  new drivers, in addition to taking a pre-employment test, are tested again,  at an unannounced time, within the first 90 days of employment. On-site  collections may not be practical for smaller companies due to their more  limited resources and the impracticality of having drivers come into the  facility without being alerted to the possibility that they are being called in  for a drug test.", "In addition, other service agents, including consortiums/third-party  administrators, medical review officers, and substance abuse  professionals, may be out of compliance.

Oversight by carriers\u2014who are ultimately responsible for compliance of  their service agents\u2014or by other entities that employ the services of  collection sites, such as third-party administrators, is also limited. One  large carrier with whom we spoke tests and verifies that the collection  sites it uses are in compliance, but none of the small carriers we  interviewed that had a drug testing program in place conducted any  oversight. Smaller carriers are less likely to conduct such oversight, given  their more limited resources. Representatives from a consortium/third- party administrator with whom we spoke told us that it observes some of  the collection sites it uses, but it is not clear that this is a common  practice.

FMCSA, ODAPC, and other DOT administrations can  initiate and have initiated a process known as a public interest exclusion  to disqualify noncompliant service agents. While no public interest  exclusion has been formally issued, the process has resulted in service  agents either correcting noncompliance or going out of business.

To our knowledge, few individuals  have been cited or convicted for violating these laws. The interstate nature of  the manufacture and sale of products intended to subvert a drug test lessens  the impact of state-based laws. In most instances, DOT drug testing protocols  do not require directly observed collection or a thorough search for hidden  subversion products.

SAMHSA officials with whom we met noted that the potential exists for  adulterated specimens to go undetected.

Drivers who do not complete a return-to-duty process may  either leave the industry or seek employment elsewhere in the industry.  Such drivers can remain drug free for a period of time to pass a pre- employment test and be hired by another carrier. The number of drivers  who engage in such job-hopping is unknown but could be substantial. Of  the approximately 85,000 drivers that FMCSA data suggest test positive  each year on random drug tests, the Substance Abuse Program  Administrators Association estimates that less than half successfully  complete the return-to-duty process.", "Noncompliance by carriers can also lead to the possibility of hiring a job- hopper. One of the top violations found in compliance reviews is a failure to  conduct required background checks, which includes checking for past  positive drug tests.

In some cases, previous employers may have gone out of business.

In  each case, we identified one option\u2014delineated with a check mark\u2014that  we believe represents the best combination of effectiveness and feasibility.", "Of the three options for improving compliance by existing carriers,  increasing the number of carrier compliance reviews provides the best  combination of effectiveness and feasibility. Conducting more reviews  would improve overall compliance with safety requirements. The increase  in reviews by FMCSA would provide an incentive for carriers to implement  sound drug testing programs in order to avoid fines for noncompliance.", "FMCSA is planning some changes to the way it targets carriers for  compliance reviews, which will include additional information on illegal  drug use and alcohol misuse. The effectiveness of this option, however, is  dependent on how many more compliance reviews would be conducted.  Compliance reviews are conducted for only a small percentage of carriers  each year. Providing a more meaningful incentive for carrier compliance  would likely require a substantial increase in this percentage, which  reduces the feasibility of this option. FMCSA and its state partners  currently conduct an average of over 13,000 compliance reviews each  year. Increasing the number of reviews to cover a more substantial portion  of the approximately 724,000 carriers in the industry would require hiring,  training, and paying additional investigators or diverting them from other  existing safety-related tasks.", "Conducting audits specific to drug testing regulations is a second option,  and while it may be less costly than substantially increasing compliance  reviews, its potential effectiveness is not as great and depends on  effectively targeting carriers. Targeting of carriers that have already been  found to be out of compliance with drug testing regulations could be done  based on findings of existing compliance reviews, but targeting additional  carriers may be difficult because of a lack of data on drug testing  programs outside of compliance reviews. Conducting audits specific to  drug testing requirements would take less time than traditional oversight  methods but would require additional resources, although not to the same  degree as substantially increasing carrier compliance reviews. However,  this option would dedicate resources to drug testing only at the expense of  using those resources in other ways that could improve overall safety,  such as in a full compliance review. The audit protocol to be used could be  similar to the other DOT administrations that conduct drug testing audits,  with minor changes to reflect FMCSA-specific requirements.", "A third option for improving compliance with drug testing requirements  among existing carriers is through better education. This would be the  easiest option to implement, would be effective for carriers and facilities  that want to comply with regulations, but would likely yield fewest results  for those deliberately trying to circumvent the regulations. Some carriers  with whom we spoke, including one whose primary business was not  transportation, told us that they either were not aware of the requirement  to drug test their drivers or were confused about their responsibilities  under the requirements. These carriers implied that if they could have  more easily understood the guidelines, they would have complied. FMCSA  already sends some information to carriers and provides information on  its Web site, and officials told us they have plans to send additional  materials on the drug testing program to carriers and to make the drug  testing portion of the Web site more user friendly. In dealing with specific  situational questions, FMCSA also responds to hundreds of drug and  alcohol telephone inquires and e-mails every week that deal with company  specific situations.

In December 2006,  FMCSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to strengthen the  safety audit pass/fail criteria to give more significance to basic safety  management requirements, including drug testing. The proposed changes  would require a new carrier to implement a drug testing program or risk  failing the safety audit. Under the proposed changes, a motor coach or  hazardous materials carrier who fails an audit will have 45 days to correct  the deficiencies. All other carriers will have 60 days. If the new entrant  fails to respond to the notice or fails to correct the deficiencies within the  45- or 60-day grace period, FMCSA will issue an out-of-service order and  revoke the new entrant\u2019s registration. Strengthening the audit in this way  helps ensure new carriers will rectify noncompliance, as opposed to the  current approach in which the carrier receives a list of requirements to  implement but may not be subject to any follow-up. DOT expects a final  rule to be published before the end of 2008. Strengthening safety audits  requires some additional resources to follow up if a carrier fails the audit.", "A second option to improve compliance by new entrants is to require them  to pass the safety audit before they begin operations. According to an  FMCSA official, safety audits generally do not occur until 8 to 9 months  after a new entrant has begun operations; this option would make passing  the safety audit a precondition to operating. Conducting the audit before  carriers begin operations would help FMCSA ensure that all new motor  carriers in operation understand their responsibility to comply with all  safety requirements, including drug testing, but includes feasibility  challenges. FMCSA officials told us that visiting a carrier before it begins  operating would not provide an opportunity to determine how well that  carrier is implementing safety requirements. For example, the applicant  may not yet have hired drivers, and there would be no logs to review.  Officials told us that FMCSA waits at least 90 days after a carrier has  entered the industry to get an accurate impression of its operations. The  increased requirements to obtain a DOT number and begin operations  would initially require more FMCSA resources, so that it could complete  its existing backlog of safety audits for carriers currently in their first 9 or  18 months of operations. The change to entry requirements would also be  time consuming since a rule-making process would be required.

However, improving  compliance by collection sites in particular is central to reducing  opportunities to undermine a drug test. Recently, in recognition of the  importance of improving adherence to DOT protocols at collections sites,  ODAPC developed a checklist of critical DOT protocols that was sent to  collection sites for posting in their facilities. GAO investigators found that  collection sites that had checklists of DOT protocols were in better  compliance that those that did not. While this is a positive step that will  help collection sites better follow protocols, the following options focus  on providing a greater oversight presence at collection sites to ensure  better compliance. As discussed previously, however, adhering to  protocols will only minimize, not eliminate, the opportunity for  subversion.", "The option to conduct service agent-only audits and clandestine  inspections appears to hold the most promise since these audits and  surprise inspections, according to stakeholders and our own analysis,  would provide an incentive for service agents to follow proper protocols  and comply with DOT requirements. Currently, FMCSA is testing a service  agent-only audit. Service agent-only audits would create an oversight  presence that previously has not existed and would identify  noncompliance and provide corrective action. Furthermore, these types of  audits would likely send a message to the service agent industry that  noncompliance can be discovered and will have consequences. The costs  associated with this option, however, affect its feasibility. The service  agent industry is large and diverse, and covering it would require a large  number of audits, with attendant costs for hiring, training, and paying new  staff or transferring resources from other current safety-related duties.  However, FMCSA officials indicated that their goal in testing a new service  agent-only audit is to improve the effectiveness of their service agent  compliance activities, regardless of how many reviews they conduct.  ODAPC provides inspector and auditor training on issues related to drug  testing requirements for service agents. For example, ODAPC is working  with DOT\u2019s Research and Innovative Technology Administration to  develop a video on collection-site security and integrity for use by  inspectors, auditors, and collection personnel.", "While the service agent industry is large and diverse, a number of  stakeholders suggested that even a small number of audits or clandestine  inspections would send an initial message that noncompliance by service  agents is serious enough to warrant FMCSA\u2019s attention. This option may  result in increased costs for collection sites in particular, which might  need to conduct additional training for collectors, and for carriers, which  might have to absorb these costs in the form of higher fees for conducting  tests. DOT is in the early stages of implementing efforts to address this  issue. ODAPC officials told us they are developing a database that  centralizes the results of all of the other DOT administrations\u2019 oversight of  service agents, starting with collection sites and ultimately including  medical review officers and others. Officials told us that all DOT  administrations can use the database to determine whether collection sites  have been visited and access the findings of the visits. The database could  serve as a method to target service agents with a history of poor  compliance. FMCSA officials stated that some of its investigators in the  field have been trained on how to conduct audits of collection sites and  that they hope to expand oversight activities with regard to service agents.", "A second option for ensuring compliance by service agents is visiting  service agents or conducting clandestine inspections as part of carriers\u2019  compliance reviews, but this option would be less effective for two  reasons. First, such visits would not be as thorough as a service agent-only  audit. Second, including service agents as part of compliance reviews may  not be practical because some carriers use service agents in different  cities or states. FMCSA targets carrier compliance reviews on the basis of  highway safety risk, but there currently are no corresponding data  indicating that the service agents used by such carriers also carry greater  risk. However, when the database of service agents is operational, an  ODAPC official said that an FMCSA inspector could query the database to  find out whether a carrier was using a service agent that had been visited  by a DOT administration and what the findings were from such visits. This  option would be less expensive than the first because the investigator  would be adding a step to an existing process rather than conducting a  wholly different audit."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Options for Increasing FMCSA\u2019s Enforcement Authority", "paragraphs": ["Expanding FMCSA\u2019s enforcement authority to include service agents may  result in greater compliance by service agents. Currently, FMCSA can only  fine the carrier that uses the service agent\u2014not the service agent itself.  Stakeholders told us that the ability for FMCSA to fine service agents  would provide an effective incentive to follow protocols. The effectiveness  of this option depends on FMCSA\u2019s ability to expand its oversight  activities, yet stakeholders said merely having the authority to fine service  agents would likely send a message to the service agent industry that there  are consequences for failing to comply with protocols. For example, FRA  officials indicated they had successfully warned service agents that their  continued noncompliance could lead to civil penalty action. These  warnings produced the desired resolution of noncompliance matters.  Representatives from one of the drug testing industry associations that  represent service agents told us that if FMCSA were to actually fine a  service agent, many service agents would come into compliance. Giving  FMCSA the authority to fine service agents would require legislation.  Officials from ODAPC told us they have created a committee to review  existing authorities of all DOT administrations to determine the current  authority of each administration. Consistency in authority to impose civil  penalties against service agents across the department may be important  given that service agents may be used and audited by more than one DOT  administration.", "A second but less promising option for increasing FMCSA\u2019s enforcement  authority is to encourage greater use of the public interest exclusion  process. Our discussions with stakeholders indicated that in instances  where the process has been initiated, it has been an effective tool in  addressing noncompliance. However, officials in FMCSA and elsewhere  within DOT indicated the process is ineffective because a public interest  exclusion has never been issued. ODAPC officials told us they are  exploring changes to the process, such as getting an interim administrative  injunction against service agents pending the execution of a public interest  exclusion process, for instances when egregious noncompliance is  found\u2014which FMCSA officials believe would increase the number  initiated. To make more use of the public interest exclusion process,  FMCSA would also need to find better ways to identify noncompliance by  service agents\u2014either by visiting service agents during compliance  reviews or by conducting service agent-only audits.

SAMHSA  has stated that it is critical to make the production and knowing use of  adulterant and substitution products illegal under federal law. This option  is also generally supported by representatives of the trucking and service  agent industries. The adoption of a federal prohibition may have a  deterrent effect on some sellers and buyers of the banned products. Sellers  of these products may reduce marketing, and some may decide to exit the  industry rather than face potential prosecution. Further, a federal law  would allow for prosecution in any state, if an individual were found to be  manufacturing, selling, or possessing such products.", "However, the deterrent effect of such a law on drivers who buy these  products may be limited since the individuals who would purchase them  also presumably bought and used the illegal drugs they are trying to mask.  Some other limitations on the effectiveness and feasibility of this option  include the following:    Gathering sufficient evidence to successfully prosecute makers, sellers,  and users of these products may be difficult, and the costs in time and  resources of enforcing the prohibition and investigating and prosecuting  violations may be significant. Web sites, for example, may try to  circumvent the law by posting disclaimers that their products are not  intended to subvert federal drug tests.", "Determining which law enforcement agencies would be responsible for  investigating and prosecuting cases may be difficult.", "Implementing a law to prohibit the purchase of adulterants and substitutes  does not address other subversion methods, such as diluting urine by  drinking large amounts of water or having someone else take a test in  place of the applicant or driver.", "Limiting the ability to subvert drug tests might be facilitated if the methods  used to identify adulterants are not published. This option has two  primary limitations. First, while it might help detect adulterated  specimens, it would not help detect substituted specimens. Drivers intent  on not being detected by drug tests may use a substituted specimen  instead of adulterating their own specimen. Second, SAMHSA officials said  restricting the publication of protocols would at best be a short-term  advantage because if validity testing protocols become the subject of a  litigation, they will become public.", "Another option for minimizing subversion tactics is to test hair or oral  fluids. One benefit would be that collections of these specimens would be  directly observed, thus reducing (but not eliminating) the opportunity to  adulterate or substitute specimens. Further, while products are available  for subversion of such tests, it is not clear whether these products are  effective in masking drug use. Some transportation companies already  conduct hair tests in addition to urine tests, and the result has been a  higher detection rate of illegal drug use. For example, one large carrier  conducted both hair and urine tests on over 15,000 employees in safety- sensitive positions from May 2006 to January 2008. The positive rate for  the hair tests was approximately 9 percent, compared with approximately  1.6 percent for the urine tests. The higher positive rate for the hair tests  may be a result of the fact that hair specimens generally retain evidence of  drug use for a longer period of time than urine specimens.", "These alternative testing methods hold promise for certain testing  purposes but are not suitable for others. Evidence of drug use becomes  apparent in oral fluids almost immediately but can only be detected for a  short time, making oral fluids suitable for postaccident tests and  unsuitable for pre-employment tests. On the other hand, evidence of drug  use does not become apparent in hair for several days after drug use but  has a long detection window, making hair more suitable for pre- employment tests and unsuitable for postaccident tests. In 2004, SAMHSA  published proposed revisions to mandatory guidelines for federal  workplace drug testing programs that included proposals to establish  scientific and technical guidelines for the testing of hair, sweat, and oral  fluid specimens. According to SAMHSA officials and some stakeholders in  the drug testing industry, the scientific issues related to hair testing\u2014 including differing detection based on hair length, color, and  contamination of hair from the environment rather than from direct use of  drugs\u2014will require further exploration before protocols can be  established. For example, SAMHSA officials told us that at least two  scientific studies show that a drug will bond into hair when the hair is  exposed to environmental drug use.", "Other unresolved issues related to adopting hair testing include  establishing collection protocols for hair specimens, establishing  appropriate criteria for a positive test result, and determining how drivers  might challenge results via a specimen tested at a second laboratory.  SAMHSA officials, who currently are studying hair testing, said that  because of these and other issues, they cannot predict when a final rule on  hair testing will be issued. Also, since DOT is obligated by statute to use  SAMHSA guidelines on drug testing protocols, considerable work remains  before hair testing can supplement urine testing.", "Finally, another option that can limit the ability of drivers to substitute  their specimen by having someone else provide it would be to change DOT  protocols at collection sites to require verification of the drivers\u2019  identification. However, it is not clear how verification could be effectively  accomplished. For example, carriers could be required to fax a copy of an  individual\u2019s CDL to the collection site prior to a pre-employment or  random test, but there is no guarantee that the fax would be clear enough  to reliably authenticate identification."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Testing for Drugs Not Currently Included in DOT Testing", "paragraphs": ["Testing for additional drugs, such as abused prescription drugs and other  illegal drugs, may be worthwhile.

However, a CDL  suspension could build on a national database. That is, if an accurate  national database were created first, state licensing agencies could use the  information in the database to trigger action to suspend a driver\u2019s CDL.", "A national database that carriers must query in screening a prospective  employee would provide information about whether the applicant had  previously tested positive for drugs or refused to take a DOT drug test, and  whether the applicant had completed the required return-to-duty process.  Applicants can easily omit previous employers for whom they tested  positive or refused to test, and easily not disclose an incomplete return-to- duty process. FMCSA reported to Congress on the feasibility of such a  database in 2004 and, as part of its Comprehensive Safety Analysis 2010  initiative, is working toward initiating a rule-making process for the  creation and implementation of a database comprising positive test results  and refusals-to-test for both drugs and alcohol. According to FMCSA  officials, current plans call for medical review officers to report positive  drug test results and refusals-to-test, but FMCSA would also solicit  comments on obtaining the information directly from carriers and for  carriers to report positive alcohol test results and refusals-to-test. While  the rule-making process is being initiated, FMCSA officials told us that  additional authority over service agents would be necessary to require the  reporting of drug testing information. Carriers would be required to query  the database prior to using drivers, which could supplement or possibly  replace the current requirement to check with previous employers  regarding past positive tests. FMCSA also plans to allow roadside  inspectors to query the national database to determine whether a carrier is  illegally using a driver who has failed a drug test. Four states already have  some form of database of drivers\u2019 past positive drug tests, though  implementation varies by state (see app. III).", "A national database would enhance FMCSA\u2019s ability to identify drivers  who engage in job-hopping, and ensure compliance with return-to duty  requirements. Since there is currently no effective way to identify job- hoppers, a national database would make positive test information more  readily available to carriers and to FMCSA for use in its initiative targeted  at carriers that employ job-hoppers and job-hoppers themselves. A  national database would also likely encourage drivers to go through the  return-to-duty process in order to continue working in the trucking  industry. However, a database would not be effective at stopping all job- hopping because not all carriers will report to or query the database,  particularly if they are not complying with drug testing regulations or do  not have a drug testing program in place. In addition, a database would not  necessarily address the problem of self-employed owner-operators who  test positive and fail to remove themselves from service, and fail to  complete the return-to-duty process.", "Stakeholders generally support a national database, which FMCSA is  considering, but several challenges would need to be addressed. Many  stakeholders, including carriers, industry associations, and one union with  whom we spoke are supportive of a database, particularly if privacy  concerns and drivers\u2019 rights are adequately addressed. Some of these  stakeholders said a national database could affect drivers\u2019 rights if results  are reported by unauthorized entities, if unauthorized persons gain access  to the information, if drivers are unable to clear inaccurate reports from  their records, or if drivers are unable to have return-to-duty completion  information posted to their records.", "Other challenges to implementing this option include the following:    The time and technological resources required to receive, process, and  respond to potentially thousands of queries each day could be significant,  even though the database would only maintain records on the drivers who  test positive or refuse to test. A 2004 FMCSA report estimates the number  of national database users at up to 750,000 or more. This report also  estimates the one-time cost of developing and implementing a national  database at approximately $1.2 million and ongoing annual costs,  including project and FMCSA staffing, at $994,000. FMCSA and ODAPC  officials noted that the costs in this report were likely underestimated.  FMCSA officials are estimating the initial cost of the database to be nearly  $9 million. FMCSA plans to refine its cost estimate as part of its rule- making process. Funding for this project would come at the expense of  FMCSA\u2019s other safety-related activities, absent additional funding from  Congress.", "Processes for authenticating and registering the enormous number of  entities that submit to and query the database, and protecting database  information, could be challenging. A DOT Inspector General report on the  National Driver Register notes privacy concerns that would also need to  be addressed in the creation of a national database of drug test results,  including sufficient encryption of personal information during  transmission between entities, background checks on personnel  responsible for maintaining the database, and security of hard copy  records storage and computer access. Procedures would need to be  developed to ensure that only those authorized gain access to the  database.

In order to transfer drug test information to state  licensing agencies, medical review officers and possibly carriers could  report drug test information to FMCSA, or they could be required to report  directly to the state of licensing. If a national database is in place, FMCSA  could potentially disseminate this information to the state licensing agency  of the CDL holder through the Commercial Driver\u2019s License Information  System (CDLIS). Carriers would then check drivers\u2019 motor vehicle  records, as they are required to do, during the hiring process and annually  thereafter.

Many stakeholders with whom we spoke said this option would  better address job-hopper and owner-operator issues than a national  database. Carriers would know whether drivers are eligible to drive based  on drug test history when making inquiries into driving records, already  required by regulations. Also, owner-operators whose CDL is suspended  following a positive or refusal-to-test could lose their insurance. The CDL  suspension would provide incentive for drivers to go through the return- to-duty process in order to have their CDL reinstated.", "Using a national database to send information on positive drug tests to  state licensing agencies would have some advantages over having medical  review officers or carriers report directly to each state licensing agency.  For example, using a national database would ensure that the legitimacy  of those who report information on positive drug tests is verified, such as  ensuring that medical review officers reporting information are actually  licensed physicians. If the option were to be implemented through direct  reporting to each state, ensuring consistent verification efforts would be  difficult. Furthermore, a single database would make reporting  information easier for medical review officers or carriers compared with  having to report to each state licensing agency.", "Implementing the CDL-suspension option presents a number of  challenges. This option would require congressional action to either  require or encourage states to suspend CDLs based on DOT drug test  results, as well as adoption and implementation by each state, which could  take several years. Stakeholders cited the following challenges and issues:    Obtaining the funding necessary for state licensing agencies and FMCSA to  implement the requirement could be a concern. For example, North  Carolina\u2019s initial costs for its current system included $50,000 in one-time  costs plus personnel costs for a half-time employee. Complying with a  broader federal requirement would clearly require more resources from  every state, potentially at the expense of other initiatives that can also  impact safety. States could utilize their existing systems for recording  information on motor vehicle records, although states would need to have  personnel in place to handle the drug test submissions. FMCSA may also  face additional costs with this option.", "As with the national database, implementing processes for authenticating  and registering entities that submit drug test information to FMCSA for the  CDL suspension in order to avoid inaccurate information, or malicious  intent, could be challenging. A CDL suspension could affect drivers\u2019 rights  if results are reported by unauthorized entities, if drivers are unable to  clear inaccurate suspensions from their records, or if drivers are unable to  have return-to-duty completion information posted to their records.", "States would have to create or change their licensing procedures through  legislation in order to suspend CDLs based on the results of DOT-regulated  drug tests. Enacting legislation could be difficult and time-consuming and  would occur at different times in different states, resulting in some states  beginning to suspend CDLs later than others.", "Issues that affect the potential effectiveness and feasibility of the CDL  suspension are similar to those for a national database in terms of  reporting, the length of time information is maintained, and how  inaccurate information is corrected, but also include determining how  drivers\u2019 CDLs would be reinstated. See appendix IV for a detailed  description of these issues."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While drug testing in the motor carrier industry has been successful at  identifying many drug users for nearly 20 years, the problems described in  this report suggest that the potential exists for many drug users to avoid  detection and continue to operate a commercial motor vehicle. Given the  enormity and fluidity of the motor carrier industry and the extent of  FMCSA\u2019s oversight resources, establishing a drug testing program that  approaches 100 percent reliability in testing all drivers and identifying  drivers who have been using illegal drugs\u2014and keeping them off the road  until they have complied with return-to-duty requirements\u2014are unrealistic  expectations. However, this report has described a wide range of options  that can be considered to make incremental improvements in the ability of  FMCSA\u2019s drug testing program to keep drivers using drugs off the road. In  our view, a comprehensive approach that encompasses several of the  identified options is needed to effectively address the problems we  identified, to re-establish the importance of the program throughout the  industry, and to reassert the federal government\u2019s interest in ensuring  compliance with drug testing programs.", "ODAPC and FMCSA have both recently initiated a number of actions that are  intended to address challenges to the drug testing program in the motor  carrier industry. These actions, such as sharing information on compliance of  service agents across modal administrations, taking steps to strengthen the  new-entrant safety audit and the public interest exclusion process, and  beginning a rule-making process to establish a national database, among  others, all hold promise to improve the effectiveness of drug testing  programs. However, several of these actions are only just beginning, and  FMCSA may not have the authority it needs to pursue some of the options we  identified as potentially having the most impact and the greatest feasibility.  For example, while FMCSA has a rule-making process under way to improve  the enforcement of safety audits for new entrants and has plans to initiate a  rule-making process to implement a national database, these actions have yet  to come to fruition, and FMCSA may have to seek additional authority to  ensure service agents report to a database. FMCSA\u2019s rule-making process will  also need to consider driver protections and a process by which information  can be corrected or removed. Furthermore, the national database could serve  as the information foundation for enforcing suspension of a CDL\u2014a direct  way to address issues surrounding poor compliance by carriers, as well as  inherent problems with self-employed drivers who test positive but continue  to drive\u2014but requiring CDL suspension is beyond FMCSA\u2019s authority.  Moreover, while ODAPC and FMCSA are working on ways to improve  identification of service agent noncompliance, FMCSA does not have  authority to levy fines against service agents for noncompliance with DOT  requirements.", "While actions that improve compliance with DOT protocols by carriers  and service agents would have some impact on ensuring that more drivers  are in drug testing programs and reducing the opportunities individuals  have to defraud a drug test, cheating on a drug test will still be possible.  All options to reduce opportunities to cheat face feasibility issues. For  example, while the testing of hair or oral fluid specimens, which can be  collected by direct observation, may reduce the ability to subvert drug  tests, additional scientific study and a rule-making process by SAMHSA  are required; even then, products designed to mask the presence of drugs  in specimens already exist and are likely to proliferate. A federal ban on  subversion products also faces challenges in that it would be difficult to  enforce and may not have a significant deterrent effect. However, a federal  ban on subversion products would have advantages. Not only would a ban  have wide support within the industry, but it also would reassert the  federal government\u2019s interest in ensuring compliance with its drug testing  programs and allow for prosecution in any state.", "Any of these options for improving FMCSA\u2019s drug testing program would  require either additional resources or a transfer of resources funding other  initiatives that also work to improve road safety. Taking steps to improve  the program needs to be considered in the context of other programs that  also work to achieve safety advancement, such as ensuring drivers are  complying with hours of service regulations and that vehicles are  maintained and inspected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["Taking action to address the challenges FMCSA faces to ensure that its  drug testing program detects drivers who are using illegal drugs, and to  keep drivers who have tested positive off the road until they have  completed the return-to-duty process, provides an opportunity to improve  safety on the roads.

We structured  the interviews to elicit the types of challenges that carriers face in  complying with the drug testing requirements and in ensuring that service  agents they use are also in compliance. In addition, two of the carriers we  met with conducted on-site collections of urine specimens. We  interviewed motor carrier industry associations representing many  segments of the motor coach and trucking industry, such as the American  Trucking Association, the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers  Association, the American Bus Association, and the National Association  of Small Trucking Companies. We also interviewed officials from unions  representing truck and bus drivers and from a variety of associations  representing urine specimen collectors, medical review officers, substance  abuse professionals, consortiums/third-party administrators, and others  involved in the drug testing industry. We also interviewed representatives  from one of the largest laboratories involved in the DOT drug testing  industry. During these meetings, we discussed the factors that contribute  to the difficulties of implementing an effective drug testing program.

For example, we reviewed  FMCSA\u2019s 2004 Report to Congress on the feasibility of creating a national  database of drug test information. We also interviewed officials from DOT  and FMCSA, industry experts, representatives from motor carriers,  industry associations, and other stakeholders to identify options and  understand the issues associated with each option.

Each of these administrations, except FMCSA,  conducts oversight of the majority of its industry either through reviews  that cover all safety requirements or reviews that specifically cover the  drug and alcohol testing requirements. By contrast, FMCSA has the largest  and most fluid industry to oversee and is not able to visit the majority of  its industry. In addition, each of these administrations, except FMCSA,  conducts consistent oversight of service agents, including collection sites,  medical review officers, third-party administrators, and substance abuse  professionals. While the oversight of service agents is intended to cover  service agents used by the employers and operators each administration  regulates, these service agents may also be used by FMCSA-regulated  carriers. For example, FAA, FRA, and FTA conduct oversight of collection  sites by checking qualification documentation for collectors and  conducting mock collections to determine whether collections are done  according to protocols. In addition, if significant noncompliance is  discovered at a collection site through these methods, FTA covertly audits  collection sites.

No single entity involved in the drug  testing process has access to all of this information in all cases, and,  therefore, a number of entities may need to be involved in reporting  information to the database for it to be comprehensive.", "For positive drug tests and some refusals-to-test, medical review officers  appear to be in the best position to report, for several reasons. First, they  are responsible for medically verifying positive drug test results and the  refusals-to-test that have been confirmed by a laboratory as adulterated or  substituted and, therefore, are closest to drug test results and would have  information on positive drug test results for all drivers, including self- employed owner-operators. While designated employer representatives  would also have this information for drivers employed by their carriers,  self-employed owner-operators would not be likely to report their own  positive drug test results. Furthermore, potential underreporting problems  exist with carriers resulting from noncompliance issues. In some states  that have required carriers to report, state officials reported  underreporting from carriers, and as previously discussed in this report,  carriers are often out of compliance in conducting background checks and  with drug testing regulations in general. There is little indication that  medical review officers have the same issues regarding compliance with  DOT regulations as carriers, and, therefore, reporting is likely to be more  complete with medical review officers as opposed to designated employer  representatives. FMCSA currently has little or no civil penalty authority  over medical review officers and does not conduct regular oversight over  them. This will impact its ability to enforce database reporting by these  service agents.", "While medical review officers have knowledge about some refusals-to-test,  they do not have knowledge of others, such as when an employee fails to  show up at a collection site for a random test. These types of refusals  would be known only to the designated employer representative, or in the  case of self-employed owner-operators, these refusals would only be  known to the consortia/third-party administrators. Furthermore, medical  review officers do not verify positive alcohol tests, and, similarly, this  information would only be known to designated employer representatives  or third-party administrators. Therefore, for these refusals-to-test for drug  tests, and alcohol positives and refusals, the designated employer  representatives would need to report this information for drivers  employed by their carriers, and third-party administrators would need to  report for self-employed owner-operators. Including both positives and  refusals is an important component to the database since refusals-to-test  are treated the same as positive tests in the drug testing regulations.", "Once a driver has tested positive or refused to test, a substance abuse  professional is required to guide the driver through the return-to-duty  process. As such, substance abuse professionals would have information  regarding when a driver has completed the recommended course of  education or treatment the substance abuse professional prescribed,  which indicates that the driver is eligible to drive following a negative  return-to-duty/pre-employment drug test. Similar to medical review  officers in reporting testing information, FMCSA currently has little or no  civil penalty authority over substance abuse professionals and does not  conduct regular oversight over them. This will impact its ability to enforce  database reporting by these service agents.", "Carriers often terminate an employee after a positive drug test result. If  another carrier wishes to hire that employee after a negative return-to-duty  test, that employer would be responsible for ensuring that all follow-up  tests required by the substance abuse professional are completed. The  new employer could be required to report a negative return-to-duty test in  order for that notation to be made in the database, so that the database  indicates the driver is eligible to drive. While medical review officers are  required to review all laboratory drug test results, including positives,  negatives, and other nonnegatives, requiring medical review officers to  report information on the results of the return-to-duty process may not be  a viable option because they may not be aware that a return-to-duty test is  being taken and would not be aware of the number of follow-up tests  prescribed. Current regulations do not require substance abuse  professionals to verify and report successful completion of a negative  return-to-duty test or completion of all required follow-up tests.", "Another issue that would need to be carefully considered is whether non- DOT tests would be appropriate to report to the database. For example,  some carriers conduct hair testing in addition to DOT-mandated urine  tests, which results in a higher number of positive drug tests. Moreover,  drug tests may be required by courts for other purposes, but carriers may  not be privy to that information. Some have argued that any positive drug  test is an indication that a driver should not be allowed to operate in  safety-sensitive duties and that carriers should have access to this  information. However, under current regulations, this would not appear to  be appropriate for several reasons. For results of hair or other types of  tests, there are no SAMHSA guidelines on testing protocols or on cutoff  levels for what constitutes a positive test, as there are for urine tests, and  therefore these tests are not a valid basis for removing a driver from  service under federal regulations. Drug tests required by courts or for  other purposes may not include procedures comparable to DOT\u2019s  collection, laboratory analysis, and medical review procedures and,  therefore, would also not be valid under the regulations for removing a  driver from service.", "As with any database, consideration would need to be given to how the  information would be reported, what type of documentation would be  required, and how entities reporting information to the database would be  verified as legitimate.", "Reporting of drug test information could occur through a Web portal  directly from reporters but could also be entered manually from fax and  mail submissions.

FMCSA could review documentation for all submitted  information before it is released into the database or could conduct  regular audits of entities reporting information to the database to ensure  compliance with documentation requirements.", "Prior to gaining access to the database, entities would need to be verified  as legitimate submitters of drug test results. To do so, basic identification  information would need to be required from all potential reporting entities,  which could include practitioner license numbers for medical review  officers and substance abuse professionals, DOT numbers for carriers, and  affirmations that reporting entities meet the requirements of the drug  testing regulations.", "In order for drivers to be fully aware that their drug test results are in a  database and what measures are available to them to challenge  information or be removed, consideration may need to be given to  whether reporters should be required to (1) notify drivers that their  information is being reported to the database and (2) provide drivers with  information on how they can challenge the accuracy of the information or  specific steps they need to take to have their status in the database  changed or their name removed from the database."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accessing Information from a National Database", "paragraphs": ["The primary purpose of the database is for carriers to query to find out  whether an applicant had previously tested positive for drugs or refused to  take a DOT drug test and whether the applicant is eligible to participate in  safety-sensitive duties, given the difficulties in getting this information  through current background-check requirements and driver disclosure. To  accomplish this, carriers would need to be required to query the database  prior to hiring a new driver, which would require a rule-making process to  change the regulations. This would then obviate the requirement for  carriers to conduct background checks related to drug testing through  inquiries to previous employers; however, the database would need to be  in place for a minimum of 3 years before the change could be made, in  order for the same extent of information to be made available to carriers.  Since some carriers outsource their background checks, some third-party  administrators may potentially also need access to query the database to  fulfill this requirement. Similar to verifying and registering the reporters of  drug test information, carriers and third-party administrators would also  need to register with FMCSA to verify their legitimacy to access the  database and affirm legitimate use of the database. Carriers and third- party administrators would then query the database before hiring a new  employee, using identifying information, such as a driver\u2019s CDL number  and state of licensure. The automated query response to the carrier would  include information such as past positive and refusal test information,  information on completion of prescribed treatment, and information on  completion of return-to-duty and follow-up testing, if that information is  maintained in the database.", "To ensure that drivers have given their permission to search the database  for their drug test history, carriers would need to obtain permission from a  driver to query the database for a driver\u2019s drug test history, similar to  current background-check requirements. Since it is not practical for  FMCSA to review documentation on release of information prior to every  query, with each query, carriers and third-party administrators would need  to affirm they have obtained permission from the driver and would need to  retain a signed, written release of information in their files. This release  could be subject to audit during compliance reviews or as part of specific  audits of database usage.", "Careful consideration may also need to be given to whether any additional  entities should have access to the database, either now or in the future.  Some have proposed that drivers have access to their own records, in  order to be aware of information that may be used against them in hiring  decisions. However, verification and registration of potentially millions of  individual drivers, and ensuring that their access is restricted to their own  records, may be difficult to achieve. In order to address concerns about  drivers\u2019 access to their own information in the database, when a driver is  reported to the database, the reporter could be required to inform the  driver, and when a driver is denied employment because of information in  the database, the carrier could be required to inform the driver.", "Other access issues that may need consideration include whether law  enforcement officials should be able to query the database and how they  may use the information in the database. FMCSA plans to make the  database available to law enforcement officials during roadside  inspections in order to target carriers that may employ drivers that have  tested positive and have not gone through the return-to-duty process.  However, it is not clear what actions an officer can take during a roadside  inspection against a driver who is in the database and has not gone  through a return-to-duty process\u2014for example, whether an officer can or  should take the driver out of service for not complying with DOT  regulations, even if the driver is not currently impaired."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Length of Time Drivers Remain in the Database", "paragraphs": ["The length of time a driver\u2019s record is in the database merits  consideration.

At least one large  carrier we interviewed indicated that this is their policy. Therefore, while a  driver\u2019s name is in the database, obtaining employment will be more  difficult, regardless of whether the driver has completed the return-to-duty  process.", "A number of options exist for how long records may be retained in the  database:    Records could remain in the database for a period of 3 years,  corresponding to the length of employment history that carriers are  required to check for prospective drivers.", "Records could remain in the database for up to 5 years, corresponding to  the length of time required for record retention of positive drug tests.", "Records could remain indefinitely for drivers who do not complete the  return-to-duty process, since regulations prohibit those drivers from  returning to safety-sensitive positions until that process is complete.", "Records could also remain indefinitely for drivers that complete treatment,  and return-to-duty and follow-up tests, with a notation in the database that  they have completed the return-to-duty process. However, this option may  impede future hiring for drivers who have completed the return-to-duty  process since some carriers may still be unwilling to hire them.", "How a driver may be removed from the database prior to the expiration of  a retention period also warrants consideration. One option would be for  potential removal from the database once a substance abuse professional  reports that a driver has completed prescribed treatment and is eligible for  a return-to-duty test. However, because the driver\u2019s next employers are  responsible for conducting return-to-duty and follow-up tests in  accordance with the substance abuse professional\u2019s recommendations, it  may not be appropriate to remove a driver from the database at this point  and rely on the driver to convey this information to prospective  employers. Another option would be to remove a driver from the database  once all follow-up tests prescribed by the substance abuse professional  are completed (specifically, a minimum of six follow-up tests in a 12- month period, according to DOT regulations). This information, under  current regulations, would need to be reported by a driver\u2019s current  employer. However, consideration could be given to whether substance  abuse professionals should conduct an additional evaluation to determine  that their follow-up testing plan and any other prescribed education or  treatment program have been successfully completed before the driver  may be removed from the database; this would require changes to the  regulations, since currently only a driver\u2019s current employer would be  aware of completion of the substance abuse professional\u2019s follow-up  testing plan and any other prescribed education or treatment program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Refuting Inaccurate Information in the Database", "paragraphs": ["In order to ensure that drivers\u2019 rights are protected, consideration would  need to be given to a process for drivers to refute inaccurate information  in the database regarding names and CDL numbers.

In Washington state, a substance abuse  professional must present information that drivers have begun treatment  or education for drivers to have their license reinstated. Reinstatement of  the CDL does not indicate that drivers are necessarily eligible to return to  duty. Washington sends a reinstatement letter to drivers stating that  reinstatement does not release the drivers to return to duty and that the  drivers must check with their employer. After licenses are reinstated in  Washington, the motor vehicle record retains the license suspension  information and the reason for the suspension for as long as information is  retained by the licensing agency. In North Carolina, as part of getting their  license reinstated, drivers need to present a letter from a substance abuse  professional stating that initial treatment is complete and they are eligible  for a return-to-duty test. After the licensing agency receives the letter in  North Carolina, the motor vehicle record retains the information that the  license was disqualified and the reason for its disqualification for 2 years.", "Consideration may be warranted for whether there should be a single  standard for how a CDL is reinstated and the length of time a driver\u2019s  motor vehicle record retains information of a positive drug test. The issues  are similar to those discussed previously regarding record retention and  removal from a national database. However, although CDLs should not be  reinstated prior to completion of the prescribed education or treatment  program when a driver is eligible to take a return-to-duty or pre- employment test, drivers will need a valid CDL to seek new employment if  they have been fired. CDLs should therefore be able to be reinstated prior  to completion of return-to-duty and follow-up tests with notations in the  motor vehicle record that inform employers of the need to consult with  the driver\u2019s substance abuse professional for further information on  follow-up testing. If a driver does not go through a return-to-duty process,  suspension could remain in effect and on the motor vehicle record for a  period of 3 years, 5 years, or indefinitely."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Refuting Inaccurate Information Leading to a CDL Suspension", "paragraphs": ["Considerations for a process to refute inaccurate information are similar  to those for a national database.
