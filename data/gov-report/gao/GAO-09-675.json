However, these controls have not been fully implemented either in accordance with a statutory requirement, federal guidance, or related best practices. Specifically, HUD has (1) developed an IT strategic plan, with strategic goals and related activities and performance targets, but it has not assessed its IT performance since fiscal year 2007, and its assessment at that time showed performance shortfalls. For example, it reported that it was behind schedule or not making progress on about one-half of the activities needed to achieve its IT strategic goals. (2) established policies and procedures for creating portfolios of IT investments, but it lacks related practices to effectively control them. For example, criteria to evaluate the performance of its portfolio do not exist. (3) analyzed gaps in its IT workforce and developed a strategy for addressing them, but the analysis was based on an incomplete and outdated inventory of human capital skill levels, thus rendering its strategy unreliable. (4) established an enterprise architecture program--to connect strategic plans with individual programs and system solutions--that meets key aspects of related best practices, but its efforts to extend its architecture by adding the level of detail needed to implement modernization projects, referred to as segment architectures, are not sufficient. For example, while HUD has identified and prioritized segments to be modernized, it has not adhered to these priorities, and the segments developed do not reflect important elements of federal guidance, and most are out of date. (5) identified the need for a modernization program office with the responsibility for managing its modernization efforts but has not established this office. Department officials acknowledged these shortcomings and stated that efforts to address them have been constrained by such factors as turnover in IT leadership and, until recently, limited modernization resources and initiatives.

As noted earlier, our EA Management Maturity Framework provides a  five-stage approach to managing the development, maintenance, and  implementation of an architecture and understanding the extent to which  effective architecture management practices are being performed and  where an organization is progressing toward having a well-managed  architecture program. In short, the framework consists of 31 core  elements that relate to architecture governance, content, use, and  measurement. These elements reflect research by us and others showing  that architecture programs should be founded upon institutional  architecture commitment and capabilities, and on measured and verified  products and results. Satisfying the framework\u2019s core elements helps  organizations reduce the risk of investing in IT assets that are duplicative,  are not well-integrated, and do not optimally support mission operations.", "To HUD\u2019s credit, it had satisfied the vast majority of the core elements  described in our framework as of August 2006, as the following examples  illustrate:    HUD established a committee or group representing the enterprise and  responsible for directing, overseeing, and approving the EA, and thereby  demonstrating the organization\u2019s commitment to obtaining buy-in for the  EA from across the organization, and providing vested ownership and  accountability for the EA and its use as a transformational tool at the most  senior levels of the organization.", "The department developed EA plans that called for describing the  enterprise in terms of business, performance, information/data,  application/service, technology, and security.

First, HUD had yet to adequately incorporate information  security into its EA. Since that time, HUD issued an Enterprise Security  Architecture in April 2007 that provides a target conceptual framework for  information protection. For example, it contains the architecture\u2019s goals  and objectives and generally (1) discusses security drivers (e.g., external  threats such as hackers and cyber terrorists); (2) describes security  governance (e.g., roles and responsibilities of key players with references  to HUD security policy, standards, and guidelines); (3) identifies the  purpose of the HUD security concept of operations, planning, and risk  management, noting that each is resident in other HUD procedural and  process guidance; and (4) describes a target security environment (e.g.,  types of security services and the security impact levels for categories of  data).", "In addition, HUD\u2019s Enterprise Security Architecture states that segment  architectures are to be the primary means of implementing its security  architecture, and thus the details surrounding how target concepts will be  implemented and achieved will be specified in these segment  architectures. Of the 8 HUD segment architectures developed to date, each  of which are discussed later in this report, only its single-family housing  segment architecture addresses information security, while the others do  not. According to HUD\u2019s Director of EA, security will be addressed in the  remaining segment architectures, as new ones are developed and existing  ones are updated. However, no schedule exists defining when this will  occur. Adequately incorporating security into the EA and related segment  architectures is important because security is an integral aspect of an  architecture\u2019s performance, business, information/data,  application/service, and technical models, and needs to be reflected  thoroughly and consistently across each of them to ensure that new and  existing investments meet the department\u2019s information assurance needs.", "Second, we also reported that HUD had yet to submit its EA products and  management processes to independent verification and validation. Since  that time, HUD developed an independent verification and validation plan,  and a HUD OCIO organization has reviewed three EA products, including  the Enterprise Security Architecture document. However, OCIO officials  told us independent verification and validation activities were  discontinued in 2007 because of resource limitations.
