The initial response to an outbreak of infectious disease  would occur at the local level, with support from the state, whether the  outbreak was naturally occurring or due to the intentional release of a  harmful biological agent by a terrorist. Just as in a bioterrorist attack, a  naturally occurring outbreak could involve public health officials in  disease surveillance, epidemiologic investigation, health care delivery,  and quarantine management. Because of prior worldwide influenza  outbreaks\u2014known as pandemics\u2014federal and state agencies have  focused special attention on planning how to address such events, and  these efforts are useful for understanding public health preparedness for  other large-scale outbreaks. The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory  Syndrome (SARS) has not infected large numbers of individuals in the  United States, but it has raised concerns about the nation\u2019s preparedness  should it, or other infections, reach pandemic proportions.", "Following the bioterrorist events of the fall of 2001, Congress expressed  concern that the nation may not be prepared to respond to a major public  health threat such as a large-scale outbreak of an infectious disease. State  and local response agencies and organizations have recognized the need to  strengthen their infrastructure and capacity to respond to a bioterrorist  attack. The improvements they are making will also strengthen their  ability to identify and respond to other major public health threats,  including naturally occurring large-scale infectious disease outbreaks.", "Planning for a response to bioterrorism and influenza pandemics targets  the public health resources essential for a response to other infectious  diseases.", "To assist the Committee in its consideration of our nation\u2019s capacity to  respond to a major public health threat, my remarks today will focus on  (1) the preparedness of state and local public health agencies for  responding to a large-scale infectious disease outbreak, (2) the  preparedness of hospitals for responding to a large-scale infectious  disease outbreak, and (3) federal and state efforts to prepare for an  influenza pandemic.", "My testimony today is based largely on our recently released report on  state and local preparedness for a bioterrorist attack. For that report, we  conducted site visits to seven cities and their respective state  governments. We also reviewed each state\u2019s spring 2002 applications for  bioterrorism preparedness funding distributed by the Department of  Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) and Health Resources and Services Administration  (HRSA), and each state\u2019s fall 2002 progress report on the use of that  funding. In addition, I will present some initial findings from a survey we  conducted of hospitals to assess their level of emergency preparedness,  which we will more fully report later, and from information updating our  2000 report on federal and state planning for an influenza pandemic.", "In summary, while the efforts of public health agencies and health care  organizations to prepare for a bioterrorist attack have improved the  nation\u2019s capacity to respond to infectious disease outbreaks and other  major public health threats, gaps in preparedness remain. More  specifically, we found that there are gaps in disease surveillance systems  and laboratory facilities, and that there are workforce shortages. The level  of preparedness varied across cities we visited, with jurisdictions that  have had multiple prior experiences with public health emergencies being  generally more prepared than others. We found that regional planning was  lacking between states, but states were developing their own plans for  receiving and distributing medical supplies for emergencies, and for mass  vaccinations in the event of a public health emergency. We found that  many hospitals lack the capacity to respond to large-scale infectious  disease outbreaks. Although most hospitals across the country report  participating in basic planning activities for such outbreaks, few have  adequate medical equipment, such as ventilators, needed to handle the  large increases in the number of patients that may result. Federal and state  influenza pandemic response plans, another component of public health  preparedness, are in various stages of completion and do not consistently  address the problems related to the purchase, distribution, and  administration of supplies of vaccines and antiviral drugs during a  pandemic."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In order to be adequately prepared for a major public health threat, state  and local public health agencies need to have several basic capabilities,  whether they possess them directly or have access to them through  regional agreements. Public health departments need to have disease  surveillance systems and epidemiologists to detect clusters of suspicious  symptoms or diseases in order to facilitate early detection of disease and  treatment of victims. Laboratories need to have adequate capacity and  necessary staff to test clinical and environmental samples in order to  identify an agent promptly so that proper treatment can be started and  infectious diseases prevented from spreading. All organizations involved in  the response must be able to communicate easily with one another as  events unfold and critical information is acquired, especially in a large- scale infectious disease outbreak. In addition, plans that describe how  state and local officials would manage and coordinate an emergency  response need to be in place and to have been tested in an exercise, both  at the state and local levels as well as at the regional level.", "Local health care organizations, including hospitals, are generally  responsible for the initial response to a public health emergency, be it a  bioterrorist attack or a naturally occurring infectious disease outbreak. In  the event of a large-scale infectious disease outbreak, hospitals and their  emergency departments would be on the front line, and their personnel  would take on the role of first responders. Because hospital emergency  departments are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, exposed individuals  would be likely to seek treatment from the medical staff on duty. Staff  would need to be able to recognize and report any illness patterns or  diagnostic clues that might indicate an unusual infectious disease  outbreak to their state or local health department. Hospitals would need to  have the capacity and staff necessary to treat severely ill patients and limit  the spread of infectious disease. In addition, hospitals would need  adequate stores of equipment and supplies, including medications,  personal protective equipment, quarantine and isolation facilities, and air  handling and filtration equipment.", "The federal government also has a role in preparedness for and response  to major public health threats. It becomes involved in investigating the  cause of the disease, as it is doing with SARS. In addition, the federal  government provides funding and resources to state and local entities to  support preparedness and response efforts. CDC\u2019s Public Health  Preparedness and Response for Bioterrorism program provided funding  through cooperative agreements in fiscal year 2002 totaling $918 million to  states and municipalities to improve bioterrorism preparedness and  response, as well as other public health emergency preparedness  activities. HRSA\u2019s Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Program provided  funding through cooperative agreements in fiscal year 2002 of  approximately $125 million to states and municipalities to enhance the  capacity of hospitals and associated health care entities to respond to  bioterrorist attacks. Among the other public health emergency response  resources that the federal government provides is the Strategic National  Stockpile, which contains pharmaceuticals, antidotes, and medical  supplies that can be delivered anywhere in the United States within 12  hours of the decision to deploy.", "Officials view influenza vaccine as the cornerstone of efforts to prevent  and control annual influenza outbreaks as well as pandemic influenza.  Deciding which viral strains to include in the annual influenza vaccine  depends on data collected from domestic and international surveillance  systems that identify prevalent strains and characterize their effect on  human health. Antiviral drugs and vaccines against influenza are expected  to be in short supply if a pandemic occurs. Antiviral drugs, which can be  used against all forms of viral diseases, have been as effective as vaccines  in preventing illness from influenza and have the advantage of being  available now. HHS assumes shortages will occur in a pandemic because  demand is expected to exceed current rates of production and increasing  production capacity of antiviral drugs can take at least 6 to 9 months,  according to manufacturers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and Local Officials Reported Varying Levels of Public Health Preparedness for Infectious Diseases Outbreaks", "paragraphs": ["In the cities we visited, state and local officials reported varying levels of  public health preparedness to respond to an infectious disease outbreak.  They recognized gaps in preparedness elements such as communication  and were beginning to address them. Gaps also remained in other  preparedness elements that have been more difficult to address, including  the response capacity of the workforce and the disease surveillance and  laboratory systems. In addition, we found that the level of preparedness  varied across the cities. Jurisdictions that had multiple prior experiences  with public health emergencies were generally more prepared than those  with little or no such experience prior to our site visits. We found that  regional planning was lacking between states. States were working on  their own plans for receiving and distributing the Strategic National  Stockpile and for administering mass vaccinations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Progress Has Been Made in Elements of Public Health Preparedness, But Gaps Remain", "paragraphs": ["States and local areas were addressing gaps in public health preparedness  elements, such as communication, but weaknesses remained in other  preparedness elements, including the response capacity of the workforce  and the disease surveillance and laboratory systems.

For example, six of the seven cities we visited were examining  how communication would take place in a public health emergency. Many  cities had purchased communication systems that allow officials from  different organizations to communicate with one another in real time. In  addition, state and local health agencies were working with CDC to build  the Health Alert Network (HAN), an information and communication  system. The nationwide HAN program has provided funding to establish  infrastructure at the local level to improve the collection and transmission  of information related to public health preparedness, including  preparedness for a bioterrorism incident. Goals of the HAN program  include providing high-speed Internet connectivity, broadcast capacity for  emergency communication, and distance-learning infrastructure for  training."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Surveillance Systems and Laboratory Facilities", "paragraphs": ["State and local officials for the cities we visited recognized and were  attempting to address inadequacies in their surveillance systems and  laboratory facilities. Local officials were concerned that their surveillance  systems were inadequate to detect a bioterrorist event and all of the states  we visited were making efforts to improve their disease surveillance  systems. Six of the cities we visited used a passive surveillance system to  detect infectious disease outbreaks. However, passive systems may be  inadequate to identify a rapidly spreading outbreak in its earliest and most  manageable stage because, as officials in three states noted, there is  chronic underreporting and a time lag between diagnosis of a condition  and the health department\u2019s receipt of the report. To improve disease  surveillance, six of the states and two of the cities we visited were  developing surveillance systems using electronic databases. Several cities  were also evaluating the use of nontraditional data sources, such as  pharmacy sales, to conduct surveillance. Three of the cities we visited  were attempting to improve their surveillance capabilities by  incorporating active surveillance components into their systems.", "However, work to improve surveillance systems has proved challenging.  For example, despite initiatives to develop active surveillance systems, the  officials in one city considered event detection to be a weakness in their  system, in part because they did not have authority to access hospital  information systems. In addition, various local public health officials in  other cities reported that they lacked the resources to sustain active  surveillance.", "Officials from all of the states we visited reported problems with their  public health laboratory systems and said that they needed to be  upgraded. All states were planning to purchase the equipment necessary  for rapidly identifying a biological agent. State and local officials in most  of the areas that we visited told us that the public health laboratory  systems in their states were stressed, in some cases severely, by the  sudden and significant increases in workload during the anthrax incidents  in the fall 2001. During these incidents, the demand for laboratory testing  was significant even in states where no anthrax was found and affected  the ability of the laboratories to perform their routine public health  functions. Following the incidents, over 70,000 suspected anthrax samples  were tested in laboratories across the country.", "Officials in the states we visited were working on other solutions to their  laboratory problems. States were examining various ways to manage peak  loads, including entering into agreements with other states to provide  surge capacity, incorporating clinical laboratories into cooperative  laboratory systems, and purchasing new equipment. One state was  working to alleviate its laboratory problems by upgrading two local public  health laboratories to enable them to process samples of more dangerous  pathogens, and establishing agreements with other states to provide  backup capacity. Another state reported that it was using the funding from  CDC to increase the number of pathogens the state laboratory could  diagnose. The state also reported that it has worked to identify  laboratories in adjacent states that are capable of being reached within 3  hours over surface roads. In addition, all of the states reported that their  laboratory response plans were revised to cover reporting and sharing  laboratory results with local public health and law enforcement agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Workforce", "paragraphs": ["At the time of our site visits, shortages in personnel existed in state and  local public health departments and laboratories and were difficult to  remedy. Officials from state and local health departments told us that  staffing shortages were a major concern. Two of the states and cities that  we visited were particularly concerned that they did not have enough  epidemiologists to do the appropriate investigations in an emergency. One  state department of public health we visited had lost approximately one- third of its staff because of budget cuts over the past decade. This  department had been attempting to hire more epidemiologists. Barriers to  finding and hiring epidemiologists included noncompetitive salaries and a  general shortage of people with the necessary skills.", "Shortages in laboratory personnel were also cited. Officials in one city  noted that they had difficulty filling and maintaining laboratory positions.  People that accepted the positions often left the health department for  better-paying positions. Increased funding for hiring staff cannot  necessarily solve these shortages in the near term because for many types  of laboratory positions there are not enough trained individuals in the  workforce.

In the cities we visited, we observed that those cities that had  recurring experience with public health emergencies, including those  resulting from natural disasters, or with preparation for National Security  Special Events, such as political conventions, were generally more  prepared than cities with little or no such experience. Cities that had dealt  with multiple public health emergencies in the past might have been  further along because they had learned which organizations and officials  need to be involved in preparedness and response efforts and moved to  include all pertinent parties in the efforts. Experience with natural  disasters raised the awareness of local officials regarding the level of  public health emergency preparedness in their cities and the kinds of  preparedness problems they needed to address.", "Even the cities that were better prepared were not strong in all elements.  For example, one city reported that communications had been effective  during public health emergencies and that the city had an active disease  surveillance system. However, officials reported gaps in laboratory  capacity.
