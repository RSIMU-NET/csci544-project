GAO assessed DOD's 2012 conference policy and 2013 update against OMB requirements and reviewed components' implementation of the policy. GAO analyzed responses to a questionnaire completed by officials from 72 components and military commands and reviewed 563 requests for conferences planned for the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2013.", "GAO is not making recommendations in this report.

The key elements of OMB's May 2012 requirements for agencies are the prohibition of conferences with costs in excess of $500,000 unless the agency head signs a waiver, establishment of a Deputy Secretary-level review process for conferences with estimated costs in excess of $100,000, and public reporting annually on the costs of these conferences. DOD adopted a tiered approval structure for the senior-level approval of waivers and all conference-related costs. DOD's policy, which cites the department's size and complexity, places the approval authority for conference waivers and for conferences costing less than $500,000 at lower levels than called for by OMB. For example, OMB requires that waivers approving conferences with costs in excess of $500,000 be signed by the head of an agency, while DOD's policy delegates this authority to 23 senior leaders throughout the department. DOD's policy is more expansive as it requires senior-level review and pre-approval of all conference-related costs, compared to OMB's requirement for senior-level review of conferences only when the estimated costs exceed $100,000. DOD's policy also fully addresses OMB's requirement to publicly report conference costs annually and adds a requirement for quarterly internal reporting of conference costs.", "In implementing DOD's September 2012 policy (the existing policy when GAO conducted the majority of its review), DOD components--including the military departments--have taken various approaches to reviewing and approving conference requests, all of which are consistent with the policy. For example, DOD's policy allows senior officials within each component to delegate certain approval authority to lower-level officials for DOD-hosted conferences costing $500,000 or less and non-DOD hosted conferences costing $100,000 or less, but the components have delegated approval authority to different degrees. A majority of the 563 conference requests that GAO reviewed addressed and documented key elements consistent with DOD and component-level guidance. In requests that were missing documentation of one or more key elements, GAO found that a specific element was not missing from a significant number of requests. While the components' implementation of the conference review and approval process has generally been consistent with DOD's policy, some officials within the components and military service commands have identified concerns, particularly with the lengthy approval process. The officials explained that requests to attend conferences have to pass through multiple offices and individuals, sometimes taking several months to be approved. In particular, officials raised questions about the efficiency of reviews for requests to attend conferences that incurred no cost or a low cost (under $20,000) to DOD, which at the time of GAO's review went through the same process as higher-cost conferences. Almost 94 percent of the 405 requests to attend non-DOD hosted conferences that GAO reviewed were for conferences with no cost or a low cost to DOD. DOD in November 2013 updated its policy to state that approval is not required for conferences incurring no cost for DOD. However, a DOD official involved in writing DOD's conference policy stated that components still have the option to review conferences with no cost to DOD to facilitate senior leaders' visibility over conference attendance by personnel within their component."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD), like other executive agencies, hosts  conferences and allows personnel to attend non-DOD conferences to  help personnel be more effective in their jobs.

DOD  personnel attend conferences on a range of topics, such as antiterrorism  activities, force requirements, and religious ministry. However, Inspectors  General have reported excessive costs for conferences hosted by other  federal agencies. In November 2011, the President signed an executive  order that cited the need for federal agencies to ensure efficient  spending on conferences and other activities. To this end, the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memorandum in May 2012  directing executive agencies to establish an approval process to review  all future conference expenses in excess of $100,000 and to report  agency-sponsored conferences with costs in excess of $100,000  annually.", "In response to OMB\u2019s May 2012 memorandum, DOD issued interim  guidance in June 2012 and a policy in September 2012 to improve the  oversight of conference costs across DOD.

Further, OMB\u2019s memorandum required that all  conference-related activities and costs be approved by the Deputy  Secretary until he or she could certify that the appropriate policies and  controls were in place for mitigating the risk of inappropriate spending  practices regarding conferences. Then in May 2012, OMB issued a  second memorandum to executive agencies and departments, outlining  new policies for conference sponsorship, hosting, and attendance. This  memorandum states that conference costs should be appropriate,  necessary, and managed in a manner that minimizes costs to taxpayers.", "OMB\u2019s May 2012 memorandum, among other requirements, outlines a  series of new policies and practices to ensure that federal funds are used  appropriately on conference-related activities and that agencies reduce  spending on conferences when practicable. These policies include the  initiation of Deputy Secretary-level review of all planned conferences  costing more than $100,000 each and of all future conferences estimated  to cost more than $100,000 each. During these reviews, agencies also  should ensure that conference attendance and costs are limited to the  levels required to carry out the mission of the conference. The  memorandum further prohibited costs in excess of $500,000 on a single  conference without a signed waiver from the head of the respective  agency. Finally, the memorandum requires each executive agency to  report annually on its official website the expenses for any agency- sponsored conference exceeding $100,000. Specific reporting  requirements include: the location, date, and total conference costs  incurred by the agency for the conference; a brief explanation of how the  conference advanced the mission of the agency; and the total number of  individuals whose travel costs or other conference costs were paid by the  agency.", "Subsequent to OMB\u2019s conference reporting requirements, the  Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013  established a requirement for executive agencies to notify their respective  Inspector General of any agency-hosted conference costing more than  $20,000, and to provide the notice within 15 days of the conference. The  notice must include the date and location of the conference, and the  number of employees attending.

DOD also noted  that after the issuance of OMB\u2019s May 2012 memorandum, the Deputy  Secretary of Defense signed waivers approving four conferences that  each cost in excess of $500,000 during fiscal year 2012. Waivers were  approved for a suicide prevention conference, a symposium on education  for military service members, a military health system research  symposium, and a conference on DOD\u2019s information assurance mission.  DOD reported that these four conferences ranged in cost from around  $550,000 to over $2 million, with a collective cost of almost $6 million.", "Additionally, DOD took actions that expanded on OMB\u2019s annual reporting  requirement by issuing policy in September 2012 and updating its policy  in November 2013 to establish that the DCMO will submit internal, non- publicly available quarterly reports to the Deputy Secretary of Defense on  conferences hosted or attended by DOD personnel.DCMO compiled DOD\u2019s first report on quarterly conference costs and  submitted it in March 2013 to the Deputy Secretary of Defense.

A senior DCMO official  noted that it is acceptable for the military departments to implement the  conference policy differently as long as they stay within the bounds of  DOD\u2019s policy. DOD\u2019s policy permits specified senior leaders within the  military departments to delegate their approval authority for DOD-hosted  conferences costing less than $500,000 and for attendance at non-DOD  hosted conferences costing less than $100,000. The DOD components\u2014 including the military departments\u2014have varied in their delegation of  approval authority. For example:", "The Department of the Army has delegated approval authority for  Army-hosted conferences with costs less than $100,000 to  appropriate principal officials and commanders. The Army has  restricted approval authority for attendance at all non-DOD hosted  conferences at the level of the Secretary or Under Secretary of the  Army, or to the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army.", "The Department of the Navy has extended approval authority to its  Assistant for Administration for Navy-hosted conferences costing  $500,000 or less and for non-DOD hosted conferences for which  attendance costs do not exceed $100,000.", "The Department of the Air Force initially delegated approval authority  for Air Force-hosted conferences costing less than $500,000 and for  non-DOD hosted conferences costing less than $20,000 to its major  commands and certain other subordinate commands. However, since  March 2013, the Air Force has retained authority for all conference  approvals, regardless of cost, at the level of the Secretary or Under  Secretary of the Air Force as part of its broader sequestration  guidance.", "Military department officials explained that one reason they decided to  maintain approval authority at a high level was to ensure close scrutiny  and management of conference costs during the current environment of  reduced budgets. Also, these officials noted that it is difficult to maintain  visibility over the total attendance costs when personnel from multiple  military service commands plan to attend the same conference. Further,  the Department of the Navy oversees personnel from the Navy and  Marine Corps, and could have personnel from both services attending the  same conference. If the approval authority is delegated, there would be a  risk that the total estimated costs would not be aggregated across military  service commands and that requests would not receive the appropriate  level of review.", "In addition, officials from the Office of the DCMO and the military  departments told us that maintaining high levels for approval authority  helps mitigate risks to DOD other than the financial risk of unnecessary  spending on conferences. Specifically, these officials said that military  department leaders did not want to risk sending personnel to conferences  that could be perceived as inappropriate for representatives of DOD,  regardless of the financial cost of the conference. By maintaining  approval authority at a high level within the military departments, senior  DOD leaders are aware of the types of conferences that their civilian and  military personnel are attending and can reject requests for conferences  that they perceive as potentially damaging to DOD\u2019s reputation. A DCMO  official commented that although DOD\u2019s conference policy allows for  more latitude with regard to delegating approval authority than is currently  being exercised, the decision thus far to ensure minimum risk by keeping  approval levels high is an acceptable implementation of DOD\u2019s policy.", "Additionally, DOD components have, in some cases, developed  supplemental guidance to implement a conference approval process that  is consistent with DOD\u2019s policy. Components\u2019 guidance generally  specifies procedures for preparing and submitting requests to host or  attend conferences, including how to obtain pre-approval by the  appropriate approval authority and what information to include so that the  approval authority can determine if the conference is necessary and cost  effective. For example, several DOD components have issued templates  that standardize the required elements for senior-level reviews, such as  including the purpose of a conference, how it fulfills a DOD mission, and  specifying estimated costs.", "We found that the DOD components generally were consistent with DOD  and component-level guidance in processing requests to host or attend  conferences. DOD\u2019s September 2012 policy and some of the  implementing guidance issued by the components\u2014including the military  departments\u2014reference the following four key elements that help  approval authorities determine the merit of a particular conference: (1) a  statement by the requester that the conference is necessary or fulfills a  DOD mission; (2) a cost estimate; (3) an assessment of the conference  request by a legal counsel; and (4) for DOD-hosted conferences,  consideration of alternative means of delivering the information. In our  review of 563 approved requests for conferences in the second and third  quarters of fiscal year 2013, we found that a majority (311) of the  requests addressed and documented all four key elements. While the  remaining 252 requests we reviewed did not contain documentation of all  four key elements, we did not find circumstances where a specific  element was consistently missing from a significant number of requests.  Specifically, for the 563 approved conference requests we reviewed:", "98 percent of all requests included a statement by the requester that  the conference is necessary or fulfills a DOD mission;", "92 percent of all requests included a cost estimate;", "66 percent of all requests included an assessment of the conference  request by legal counsel; and", "65 percent of requests for DOD-hosted conferences included  evidence that the requester considered alternative means of  delivering the information, such as video teleconferencing, and  deemed those means infeasible.", "We also found that many conference requests included additional  information for approving officials to review that was not among the  required elements, such as a description of how the requesting  organizations were reducing costs to host or attend the conference. Some  examples of cost-saving efforts were using public transportation instead  of a rental car, not approving travel costs for conference attendees unless  they were speaking or making a presentation at the conference, and  hosting conferences at government facilities instead of a hotel or  convention center. Further, where evidence of a key element was  missing, we found that in some cases, a record of the key element was  maintained somewhere other than with the conference request  documentation we reviewed. For example, officials from the three military  service commands with whom we followed up about missing evidence of  a legal review in their conference requests told us that legal reviews were  documented in a document management system or were documented at  the service headquarters level.", "Each DOD component also has implemented DOD\u2019s requirement for  quarterly reporting to the Deputy Secretary of Defense. Our review found  that the DOD components varied in how and when they obtained the data  for reporting conference costs. For example, some military service  commands and DOD components required the original conference  requester to complete a report after the conference with updated cost  information and used this data for reporting purposes. Officials from other  military service commands and DOD components told us that they  reviewed travel vouchers within DOD\u2019s travel system or used other  financial management systems to obtain updated cost data for each  conference. DOD\u2019s November 2013 update requires the DOD  components to enter reportable cost data into the new DOD Conference  Tool within 30 days of a conference\u2019s completion if the conference costs  more than $20,000. According to a DCMO official, the components began  using the DOD Conference Tool in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Officials Expressed Concern over DOD\u2019s Lengthy Approval Process, Especially for Conferences with Low or No Cost to DOD", "paragraphs": ["While we found that the components\u2019 implementation of the conference  review and approval process has generally been consistent with DOD\u2019s  policy, some officials within the components and military service  commands have identified concerns about the approval process. During  our interviews and in response to our questionnaire, officials cited  common concerns related to the time and resources spent on conference  approval, and the approval levels required by components for  conferences with a low or no cost to DOD.", "In response to our question regarding what concerns, if any, DOD  components and military service commands had with DOD\u2019s conference  policy, the most common concern was the amount of time and resources  spent to complete the review and approval process. Specifically, officials  from 33 percent of the 18 DOD components and 22 percent of the 54  military service commands reported concerns with time and resources.", "Several military service commands noted in their responses that  individuals requesting to host or attend a conference must wait months  before requests are approved or rejected. For example, officials from one  military service command reported that the process sometimes required a  60-day period to obtain conference approval. In addition, we found that  some conference requests took several months to receive final approval.  In one instance, the initial request was submitted almost five months in  advance of when the conference was scheduled to begin, but final  approval was not granted until two weeks prior to the beginning of the  conference. Officials from the military departments told us that they have  prioritized conference requests from individuals in certain career  specialties\u2014such as chaplains and medical professionals\u2014to ensure that  they receive the necessary training in time to maintain their professional  licensures or certifications. In addition, personnel sometimes are eligible  to receive price discounts by completing early registration for certain non- DOD hosted conferences. One non-DOD hosted conference that we  reviewed offered a $300 discount if attendees registered before a certain  date.", "Some officials raised specific concerns about the number of personnel  required for conference reviews. Based on responses that we received  from 18 DOD components and 54 military service commands, we found  that conference requests often are reviewed by personnel from at least  four offices. The multiple reviews can include financial management,  administrative, and legal personnel, plus subsequent review by the  general officer, flag officer, or senior executive at that organization.  Officials from one military service command noted that there is often a  bottleneck effect created at the higher approving levels. Officials from  another command noted that the approval process for attending  conferences is cumbersome and involves significant personnel resources.  According to component and command officials, reviewing offices also  vary in how many individuals are available for part-time or full-time duty to  review conference requests. These individuals typically have other duties,  and their assignment to review conference requests is a part-time or  collateral duty. Therefore, individuals who review conference requests as  a collateral duty may sometimes have to defer their reviews if they need  to address higher priorities among their job responsibilities.", "Officials from several DOD components and military service commands  reported difficulty identifying and implementing procedures to mitigate the  amount of time spent on the review process. For example, officials from  one DOD academic institution acknowledged the problem of missing  deadlines for early registration and not benefitting from a discounted rate.", "However, in response to our questionnaire, these officials said that they  had difficulty instituting procedures for timely decisions on requests to  attend non-DOD hosted conferences because the requester may not  know about the conference in time to complete the approval process  before the early registration date expires. Additionally, several of the DOD  components have developed guidance to initiate conference reviews as  early as possible, such as 90 days prior to the start of the conference.  However, officials from multiple components noted the difficulty of this  requirement in that the need for conference attendance may not be  known that far in advance. According to officials from some of the military  services, many of the non-DOD entities hosting conferences frequently  attended by DOD personnel recognize DOD\u2019s constrained budget  environment and are willing to work to minimize the costs to DOD.  Officials said that in many cases conference hosts have waived  registration fees and other conference costs for DOD personnel. For  example, Army officials told us they were able to achieve a significant  cost avoidance by accepting a professional nonprofit association\u2019s offer to  waive registration fees and cover travel expenses for key attendees to  ensure the Army\u2019s participation at the association\u2019s annual conference  despite fiscal constraints. As a result, the Army saved about $1 million  over previous years\u2019 attendance costs.", "In addition, some officials raised specific concerns that the approval  process requires the same amount of time and resources regardless of  the estimated cost of the conference. Officials noted that the approval  process involves the same resources for a conference with low or no cost  to DOD as it does for a conference costing $20,000 or more. Our  questionnaire to DOD components and military service commands found  that officials at 28 percent of the 18 DOD components that responded and  14 percent of the 54 military service commands that responded  expressed concern over the approval tiers required by their component\u2019s  conference guidance. In their responses, some officials specified that the  required tier of review was excessive for conferences for which DOD  incurred low or no cost. Because DOD invests a relatively small amount  of resources on conferences with low or no cost to DOD, some officials  felt that such conferences represented a low risk to DOD and did not  require the same scrutiny as more expensive conferences. In our review,  we found that a few conference requests that resulted in a low or no cost  to DOD took several months between the initial request and the approval.  For example, we reviewed a request for one individual to attend a three- day, non-DOD hosted conference with a total estimated cost below  $1,000, and the request was not approved for almost three months.", "Most of the requests to attend non-DOD hosted conferences, according  to our review, were for conferences with low or no cost to DOD. As shown  in figure 2, in nearly 94 percent of the 405 requests for personnel to  attend non-DOD hosted conferences, the estimated cost of attendance  was less than $20,000 for each conference.", "Similarly, for the 556 DOD-hosted and non-DOD hosted conference  requests that we reviewed for which cost information was available,found that the aggregate cost to DOD for all low-cost conferences was  significantly lower than the aggregate cost to DOD for more expensive  conferences, even though the number of individual requests to attend  conferences with low or no cost to DOD was much higher. Specifically,  the total estimated cost for 424 DOD-hosted and non-DOD hosted  conferences costing $20,000 or less was around $2 million, while the total  estimated cost for 132 DOD-hosted and non-DOD hosted conferences  costing over $20,000 was approximately $13.8 million.   we  Conferences with no cost to DOD often occur when a non-DOD  organization that is sponsoring DOD research in a specific field covers all  the costs for DOD officials to present the research at a conference.  Further, a low cost for a conference can occur when only one or two DOD  officials are attending a conference. According to DOD officials,  individuals may also strive to keep conference costs below $20,000 to  avoid having to report conference costs for DOD\u2019s quarterly and annual  reports. For example, DOD components and military service commands  may limit the number of people who are allowed to attend a conference to  keep the cost below $20,000.", "DOD\u2019s November 2013 policy update was issued after we received the  responses to our questionnaires and reviewed conference requests. This  update specified that there is no requirement for review and approval of  requests for conferences that have no cost to DOD, including  conferences where all costs are paid by non-DOD entities and the  payments are in accordance with DOD gift acceptance rules. According to  one DCMO official involved in writing the policy, even with the November  2013 update, the components still have the option to review conferences  that incur no cost to DOD in accordance with their conference approval  process to facilitate senior leaders\u2019 visibility over conference attendance  by personnel within their component. Further, the official stated that  components are free to institute additional conference processes and  procedures as long as they are consistent with the minimum requirements  in DOD\u2019s November 2013 updated policy."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comments.

Also, DOD noted that the balance can be difficult to  achieve, and officials understand the concerns that the approval process  for conferences is too long, especially for conferences with only a small  cost. DOD stated that it will continue to monitor the situation to determine  if additional steps are necessary. DOD also provided technical comments,  which were incorporated into this report as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense; the  Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; the Director of the Office of  Management and Budget; and appropriate congressional committees.

In  particular, we reviewed OMB\u2019s May 2012 memorandum, Promoting  Efficient Spending to Support Agency Operations, which includes three  key elements for conference sponsorship, hosting, and attendance.  These elements are the prohibition of conferences with costs in excess of  $500,000 unless the head of the agency signs a waiver, Deputy  Secretary-level review of conference expenses in excess of $100,000,  and public reporting annually of agency-sponsored conferences with  costs in excess of $100,000. We assessed the extent to which DOD was  consistent with the OMB memorandum in issuing DOD\u2019s September 29,  2012, memorandum, Implementation of Conference Oversight  Requirements and Delegation of Conference Approval Authority, and its  November 6, 2013, memorandum, Implementation of Updated  Conference Oversight Requirements. In reviewing DOD\u2019s conference  policy, we interviewed officials from the Office of the Deputy Chief  Management Officer (DCMO) and OMB staff. We also interviewed  officials from the Office of the DCMO and obtained relevant documents to  review DOD\u2019s planned approach for meeting reporting requirements in  the Consolidated and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013. Specifically,  we reviewed training materials and spoke to officials about the web-based  tool planned to help facilitate reporting beginning in the fourth quarter of  fiscal year 2013.", "To determine how DOD components have implemented DOD\u2019s  conference policy, we identified the DOD components\u2019 processes and  procedures for approving conference requests and reporting conference  costs. To that end, we developed, administered, and analyzed responses  to a combination of structured interviews and questionnaires that referred  to DOD\u2019s September 2012 conference policy, which was the existing  policy when we conducted the majority of our review. The structured  interviews and questionnaires were completed by officials at the offices of  the Under Secretaries of Defense, Joint Staff, National Guard Bureau,  and combatant commands and all four military services (Army, Navy, Air  Force, and Marine Corps). To cover as much of the population as  possible within the services, we asked each service to provide a list of  \u201cmajor subordinate commands.\u201d Both the DOD component and military  service command questionnaires consisted of open-ended questions on  conference policies, procedures, and costs within the component or  command being questioned, a subset of which requested quantitative  responses. We pre-tested the questionnaire with one Army command,  one Navy command, one Marine Corps command, and one DOD  component. After the pre-test, we administered the final questionnaires  using a combination of phone interviews and emails. We received oral  and written responses from 100 percent of the18 DOD components and  54 military commands that we selected for interviews or emailed  questionnaires. All components and commands that provided responses  are listed at the end of this appendix.", "The responses that we received to quantitative questions (e.g., the  number of conferences hosted in fiscal year 2013) were summarized as  standard descriptive statistics. To analyze the content in open-ended  responses, one GAO analyst reviewed each open-ended response from  each DOD component and military service command to identify recurring  themes. Using the identified themes, the analyst then developed  categories for coding the responses. A second GAO analyst reviewed  each response from each DOD component and military service command  and reviewed the first analyst\u2019s themes and categories to reach  concurrence on the themes and categories. Both GAO analysts then  independently reviewed the answers to each open-ended question and  placed them into one or more of the coding categories. A third analyst  then reconciled the first and second analysts\u2019 coding and, through  discussion, made a final decision whenever there was disagreement. The  key categories we identified and analyzed were (1) steps taken to  respond to and verify the accuracy of data provided for the annual and  quarterly reporting requirements and (2) concerns about DOD or  component conference policy. Because DOD\u2019s September 2012 policy  was the existing policy when DOD officials responded to our structured  interviews and questionnaire, any concerns they raised about DOD\u2019s  conference policy were in reference to the September 2012 policy.", "We interviewed officials from each of the military services who were  involved in the implementation of DOD\u2019s conference policy, and we  reviewed service guidance\u2014including instructions, templates, and  checklists\u2014to determine whether it was consistent with DOD\u2019s  conference policy. Further, in evaluating how DOD collects, maintains,  and reports conference costs, we reviewed DOD\u2019s publicly reported  annual conference report for fiscal year 2012 and assessed the extent to  which it contained all elements required by OMB\u2019s May 2012  memorandum. We also reviewed DOD\u2019s internal quarterly reports on  conference costs for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2013. We  compared the information included in the quarterly reports to DOD\u2019s fiscal  year 2012 annual report to identify differences between the annual and  quarterly reporting requirements.", "We also obtained and evaluated requests for conferences planned for the  second and third quarters of fiscal year 2013. We obtained requests for  this time period because the approval process established by DOD\u2019s  September 2012 policy was not fully implemented until the second  quarter of 2013. Further, conference requests for the fourth quarter of  2013 were not widely available during our review. To obtain conference  requests, in our structured interviews and emailed questionnaires we  asked officials from each DOD component and military service command  to provide us all documents associated with requests for conferences  planned to date in fiscal year 2013, including DOD-hosted and non-DOD  hosted conferences. For the DOD components, Army, and Air Force, we  received documentation directly from the organizations we interviewed or  to which we emailed questionnaires. According to Navy and Marine Corps  officials, the necessary documentation was centrally maintained in those  services\u2019 document management systems instead of at the major  commands or other subordinate commands; therefore, we received  conference request documentation for those two services\u2019 major  commands from a central office within Navy and Marine Corps  headquarters, respectively. For the Navy, we were provided access to a  document management system and manually reviewed documents  associated with conference requests. For the Marine Corps, we were  emailed documents associated with conference requests from a similar  document management system.", "Further, to evaluate conference requests we developed a standardized  checklist of key elements needed by approval authorities for their  determination of whether a conference should be approved or rejected.  We developed a checklist with the following four key elements based on  DOD guidance and component-level guidance: (1) an explanation of why  the conference was necessary or mission essential; (2) evidence of a  legal review of the conference request; (3) evidence of a cost estimate;  and, (4) for DOD-hosted conferences, evidence that alternative means of  delivering the information, such as video teleconferencing, was  considered and deemed infeasible. We assessed the documentation for  each conference request against the four key elements to determine if  these elements were included. Using our checklist, we reviewed and  assessed 563 approved requests for conferences hosted by DOD or  attended by DOD personnel in the second and third quarters of fiscal year  2013.", "We interviewed officials and, where appropriate, obtained documentation  from the following DOD organizations:", "Office of the Secretary of Defense, Office of the Deputy Chief", "Department of the Army", "Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army", "Office of the Army General Counsel", "Department of the Navy", "Office of the Assistant for Administration", "Office of the Director, Navy Staff", "Bureau of Naval Personnel", "Office of the Director, Marine Corps Staff", "Department of the Air Force", "Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air", "Office of the General Counsel  The following 72 offices responded to our questionnaire.
