Costs associated with such lawsuits are comprised of (1) the Department of Justice's (Justice) costs for defending the lawsuits on behalf of agencies, (2) the agencies' respective costs for the lawsuits, and (3) any attorneys' fees and costs as assessed by a court or based on settlement agreements awarded to the plaintiffs' attorneys.", "Of the 112 lawsuits, Justice provided information on its costs for defending 8 lawsuits totaling about $97,000. Justice officials stated that the department does not specifically track costs for lawsuits in which the plaintiffs substantially prevailed and that its attorneys are not required to track such costs for individual lawsuits. Regarding individual agencies, 17 of the 28 in GAO's study had a system or process in place that enabled them to provide cost information on 57 of the 112 selected lawsuits. According to this information, the agencies incurred approximately $1.3 million in FOIA litigation-related costs for these lawsuits during fiscal years 2009 through 2014. The remaining agencies did not have a mechanism in place to track FOIA litigation-related costs where the plaintiffs prevailed. These agencies said costs were not tracked because Justice's guidance does not require agencies to collect and report costs related to specific lawsuits, or if the plaintiff prevailed as a result of a lawsuit.", "As required by FOIA, Justice has reported annually on the results of all lawsuits, including any awards of attorneys' fees and costs to the plaintiffs. However, for 11 of the 112 selected lawsuits, Justice reported an amount of attorneys' fees and costs awarded that differed from the amounts reported by the defending agencies. According to Justice, the differences in the award of attorney's fees and costs were due to the appeals process and settlement agreements between the respective agencies and the plaintiffs.", "Although requiring Justice and agencies to report actual cost information could lead to better transparency regarding federal operations, costs would be associated with such reporting.

For this reason, the act  allows requesters to challenge an agency\u2019s final decision in federal court  through a lawsuit if the agency does not respond to a request for  information within the statutory time frames or if the requesters believe  they are entitled to information that is being withheld by the agency.", "In addition, the act states that the court may assess against the  government reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and other litigation costs incurred  in a FOIA lawsuit if the requester has obtained relief through either a  judicial order, or an enforceable written agreement or consent decree; or  a voluntary or unilateral change in position by the agency, if the plaintiff\u2019s  claim is not insubstantial. The Department of Justice (Justice) reported  that, in fiscal year 2015, federal agencies received 713,168 FOIA  requests.

Our review led to the identification of 1,672 lawsuits for that  time period. Of this total number of lawsuits, we identified those lawsuits  in which information indicated that the courts or a stipulation had awarded  attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to the plaintiffs. (For this study, we established  that if a plaintiff was awarded attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, then the plaintiff  had substantially prevailed in the lawsuit).This resulted in our  identification of 112 lawsuits across 28 federal agencies where the courts  had awarded attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.", "We then developed and administered a data collection instrument to  obtain information on the 28 agencies\u2019 respective litigation costs for the  identified lawsuits and the attorneys\u2019 fees and costs paid to the plaintiffs.  We gathered information on the process used by each agency to collect  and report information on the lawsuits to determine the reliability of the  data provided in the responses.

Before its enactment in 1966, an individual seeking access to federal  records faced the burden of establishing a \u201cneed to know\u201d before being  granted the right to examine a federal record. FOIA established a \u201cright to  know\u201d standard, under which an organization or person could receive  access to information held by a federal agency without demonstrating a  need or reason. The \u201cright to know\u201d standard shifted the burden of proof  from the individual to a government agency and required the agency to  provide proper justification when denying a request for access to a  record.", "Any person, defined broadly to include attorneys filing on behalf of an  individual, corporations, and organizations, can file a FOIA request. For  example, an attorney can request labor-related work compensation files  on behalf of his or her client, and a commercial requester, such as a data  broker that files a request on behalf of another person, may request a  copy of a government contract. In response, an agency is required to  provide the relevant record(s) in any readily producible form or format  specified by the requester unless the record falls within a permitted  exemption. Nine specific exemptions can be applied to withhold, for  example, classified, confidential commercial, privileged, privacy, and  several types of law enforcement information.

As the overseer of  agencies\u2019 FOIA implementation, in October and November 2008, Justice  issued guidance to assist federal agencies in implementing the FOIA  amendments of the 2007 OPEN Government Act. In September 2013,  Justice incorporated in the procedural requirements chapter of the  Department of Justice Guide to the Freedom of Information Act  procedures for agencies to follow when responding to FOIA requests.  Specifically, the guidance discusses how requests are to be processed\u2014 from the point of determining whether an entity in receipt of a request is  subject to FOIA, to responding to the review of an agency\u2019s decision  regarding a request on an administrative appeal.", "Agencies are generally required to make a determination on a FOIA  request within 20 working days of receiving a request. A request may be  received in writing or by electronic means. Once received, the request  goes through multiple phases, which include assigning a tracking number,  searching for responsive records, processing records, and releasing  records.", "FOIA allows a requester to challenge an agency\u2019s final decision on a  request through an administrative appeal or a lawsuit. Specifically, a  requester has the right to file an administrative appeal if he or she  disagrees with the agency\u2019s decision on their request. Agencies generally  have 20 working days to respond to requesters regarding administrative  appeals. A requester should generally exhaust their administrative  remedies, such as filing an administrative appeal, before a lawsuit can be  filed. If a request is denied on appeal, the requester then has 6 years to  file a lawsuit pertaining to the request. Further, if a requester  substantially prevails in a FOIA lawsuit, the court may assess against the  government reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation costs.", "Figure 1 provides a simplified depiction of the federal government\u2019s FOIA  administrative appeal and litigation process."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Justice Oversees Federal Agencies\u2019 Implementation of FOIA Requirements and Defends Agencies When Lawsuits Arise", "paragraphs": ["FOIA assigns Justice the responsibility to develop guidance for federal  agencies on the implementation of the law and to oversee the agencies\u2019  compliance with FOIA requirements.

Our review led to the  identification of 1,672 lawsuits for that time period. Of this total number of  lawsuits, we identified those lawsuits in which information indicated that  the courts or a stipulation had awarded attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to the  plaintiffs. (For this study, we established that if a plaintiff was awarded  attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, then the plaintiff had substantially prevailed in  the lawsuit). We did not include lawsuits where the plaintiffs may have  substantially prevailed in the lawsuits but were not awarded attorneys\u2019  fees and costs. This resulted in our selection of 112 lawsuits across 28  federal agencies where the courts had awarded attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.", "For the 28 agencies, we developed and administered a data collection  instrument to obtain information on the agencies\u2019 respective litigation  costs for the identified lawsuits and the attorneys\u2019 fees and costs paid to  the plaintiffs. We requested the following for each lawsuit: (1) the number  of hours spent by each employee (e.g., attorney, administrative assistant,  and FOIA staff) that worked on the lawsuit; (2) the annual salary for each  employee that worked on the lawsuit; (3) an explanation as to whether the  lawsuit was or was not exclusively related to FOIA; (4) the amount of  litigation overhead and any other FOIA litigation-related expenses  associated with the lawsuit; and (5) the total amount of judgment paid,  including date paid, if applicable. We administered the data collection  instrument in February 2016 and received responses from all 28  agencies.", "To test the accuracy and completeness of data provided to us by  agencies we performed the following procedures: compared cost data  against available court records; interviewed FOIA staff and legal counsels  in the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Housing and Urban  Development, and State, and the Environmental Protection Agency and  the Office of Management and Budget to determine what cost data are  collected and reported; and determined agencies\u2019 processes in reporting  estimated hours spent on litigating FOIA-related lawsuits. Based on the  results of our testing, we believe the data were reliable enough for the  purposes used in this report. For agencies that had an established  process for collecting and reporting lawsuit information, we calculated the  total cost for the agency by multiplying time spent by staff on a case with  the employee\u2019s hourly salary rate and added any applicable overhead  costs reported by the agency.", "To determine the costs incurred by Justice on these lawsuits, we first  determined how Justice tracks lawsuit information and attorney time  spent on each lawsuit. We then requested and received documentation  on case management systems used across Justice\u2019s divisions and  reviewed this documentation to determine if these systems had  capabilities to track the amounts of time attorneys and other staff spent  working on FOIA litigation lawsuits. We reviewed system documentation  for the following Justice case management systems: United States  Attorneys\u2019 Resource Summary Reporting System (USA-5), Legal  Information Office Network System (LIONS), Civil Division\u2019s Case  Management System (CASES), and Tax Division\u2019s Case Management  System (TaxDoc). We then requested information from these systems on  the amounts of time recorded by Justice staff for the 112 lawsuits  included in our study. We supplemented this information by interviewing  Justice officials in the Office of Information Policy, the Executive Office for  United States Attorneys, and the Civil Division.", "To determine the details of selected lawsuits, we reviewed case  information and court documentation for each of the 112 lawsuits  obtained from www.foiaproject.org, CourtLink, and Public Access to Court  Electronic Records (PACER) and selected a variety of types of lawsuits to  illustrate in our report.", "To determine attorney fees and costs for the 112 lawsuits, we reviewed  Justice\u2019s annual litigation and compliance reports, where information on  attorney fees and costs awarded by the court to the plaintiff is reported.  We then compared these amounts to the totals reported by agencies on  what they paid to plaintiffs to identify any differences. In lawsuits where  there was a difference, we asked Justice and the agencies for information  on why the differences could have occurred.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2015 through  September 2016 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Freedom of Information Act Exemptions", "paragraphs": ["The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) prescribes nine specific  categories of information that are exempt from disclosure, which are  described below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Examples of FOIA Litigation Lawsuits", "paragraphs": ["Of the 112 lawsuits selected where the plaintiff substantially prevailed, a  lawsuit was filed either because (1) the agency failed to respond within  the statutory time frame (58 lawsuits); (2) the agency failed to provide all  of the documentation in the FOIA request (46 lawsuits); or (3) for other  reasons, such as denial of a fee waiver or appealing a dismissal of a  claim (8 lawsuits). The following examples illustrate the reasons lawsuits  were filed and the corresponding decisions rendered that resulted in  payments of attorneys\u2019 fees and court costs to the plaintiffs.", "Failure to Respond Within the Statutory Time Frame  In May 2011, a requestor sought records from the Federal Election  Commission related to correspondence pertaining to agency business  between three commissioners and any outside entities. The Federal  Election Commission acknowledged receipt of the request by e-mail  the next day and granted the requestor a fee waiver. Two months  after the initial request was submitted, the Federal Election  Commission informed the requestor that it had received the first set of  potentially responsive documents from its searches, was still  performing more searches, and was reviewing thousands of  potentially relevant documents. The requestor claimed the agency  had said it could release the first batch of responsive documents  within 2 weeks and filed suit when the agency failed to do so. The  Federal Election Commission responded with the first set of records  about 3 weeks later and completed its response 10 days after that by  releasing two more batches of records. At that time, the agency  provided an explanation of its exemption claims and told the requestor  that it could file an appeal. The court ultimately found that the agency  acted unreasonably in withholding documents in response to the FOIA  request and ordered it to pay the requester $153,759 in attorneys\u2019  fees.", "In March 2013, a requestor asked the Office of Management and  Budget to provide documents relating to communications to or from  Congressional staff which contained information on federal  expenditures. After 4 months with no response, the requestor filed a  lawsuit. The Office of Management and Budget and the requester  entered into a settlement agreement resulting in the lawsuit being  dismissed and the agency paying $4,182 in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.", "In March 2012, a requestor sought documentation related to a warrant  search. The Federal Bureau of Investigation produced more than  1,000 pages of responsive records and withheld approximately 600  under the Privacy Act and various FOIA exemptions. The requester  filed a lawsuit after not receiving a response to the administrative  appeal. The court ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation to  release the information that was withheld and to pay $7,500 in  attorneys\u2019 fees and costs arising from the lawsuit.", "In March 2014, a requester asked the Office of Personnel  Management to provide documents relating to understanding the  basis of the agency\u2019s annuity computations.

The lawsuit was filed  after a year of correspondence concerning fees and the scope of the  request. Over the course of several months after the suit was filed, the  department provided 347 documents in full or in part to the requester  but attempted to withhold other sensitive records and information  regarding how the audits are conducted. In November 2013, the court  ruled against the department\u2019s FOIA exemption assertions and  ordered an additional search. As a result, the original 347 documents  were all released in full in addition to approximately 1,045 additional  documents. In October of 2014, the Department of Labor and the  requester entered into a settlement where it agreed to pay the  requester $51,000 to cover attorneys\u2019 fees, expenses, and costs in  exchange for the plaintiff withdrawing any remaining claims.", "In July 2013, a requestor sought documentation related to the  renovation of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau headquarters.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau told the requester it had  located 257 pages of documents and was withholding 254 pages of  documents under exemptions 5 and 6. The requester filed an  administrative appeal. After 3 months, the bureau upheld its decision  to withhold the 254 pages and agreed to the request for a further  search. The bureau located 93 additional pages and withheld 81  pages under exemptions 5 and 6. The requester then filed a lawsuit.  The bureau and the requester entered into a mutual decision resulting  in the lawsuit being dismissed and Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau paying $800 in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.", "In December 2011, a requestor sought documentation concerning the  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s social media monitoring  initiatives. The department did not provide documentation or a  determination regarding the request, so the requestor filed an  administrative appeal. After the initial request, the requester filed a  lawsuit after not receiving a response to the administrative appeal or  any documentation. The Department of Homeland Security released  286 pages in full, 173 with redactions, and withheld 286 pages. The  court ruled for the jointly for the requester and the department. The  court also ordered the department to pay $30,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees  and costs.", "In 2012, a plaintiff filed a FOIA lawsuit seeking non-tax return  information related to his deceased father from the Social Security  Administration. Since Privacy Act rights end with death and no other  federal regulation prohibited the records disclosure, the agency  provided the records sought.
