For example, during this time period, the number of aliens enrolled in the Full-service component, which is run by a contractor that maintains in-person contact with the alien and monitors the alien with either Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment or a telephonic reporting system, increased by 60 percent. In addition, the average length of time aliens spent in the Technology-only program component, which offers a lower level of supervision at a lower contract cost than the Full-service program component and involves ICE monitoring of aliens using either telephonic reporting or GPS equipment provided by a contractor, increased by 80 percent\u2014from about 10 months to about 18 months. In 2011, ICE recommended practices in guidance to its Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) field offices to better ensure cost-effective implementation of the program. For example, ICE recommended that field officers move aliens who have demonstrated compliance under the Full-service component to the less costly Technology-only component. GAO's work showed differences in ERO field offices' implementation of the guidance. However, ICE headquarters officials said that because of limitations in how they collect and maintain program data, they do not know the extent to which field officers have consistently implemented this guidance. ICE plans to institute new data collection requirements to address these limitations and use these data for a variety of purposes; however, ICE has not considered how to analyze these data to monitor the extent to which ERO field offices are implementing the guidance.

However, ICE  field officials managing the ATD program may not have seen the cases  that resulted in detention or release and accordingly, are limited in their  ability to estimate to what extent ATD program capacity could be  expanded or changed in their location. To help increase the number of  cases referred for ATD program consideration, ICE has issued guidance  to its ERO field offices emphasizing that all nondetained criminal aliens  should be given priority consideration for ATD program enrollment.  Accordingly, this guidance directs the Criminal Alien Program and  Fugitive Operations teams that generate case referrals in the field to  coordinate with their local ATD component for enrollment consideration,  including aliens released on a bond. ICE reported that field offices  coupling a bond with ATD as a condition of release have shown an  increased rate of success in alien removals from the United States.", "Other factors that ICE officials identified as affecting their ability to identify  capacity and expand the ATD program are federal and state statutes and  agency guidance.

ICE maintain a minimum of 34,000 detention beds each day,part of its fiscal year 2015 budget justification, ICE reported that a  decrease in the number of detention beds required to be maintained  would result in an increase in the number of aliens who could be enrolled  in the ATD program. In regard to state statute, one state, for example,  passed a law whereby law enforcement officials have the discretion to   and as  cooperate with federal immigration officials by detaining an individual on  the basis of an immigration hold after that individual becomes eligible for  release from custody, only where certain criteria are met. In regard to  agency guidance, ICE has instructed ERO field offices generally not to  enroll aliens who are not likely removable, as well as aliens who were  brought to the United States as children and may be eligible for the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.", "ICE officials stated that they did not plan to expand use of the ATD  program to additional ERO field office locations until after the new  contract was in place; however, officials reported that several factors  could affect whether a field office could be or is willing to implement the  program. For example, ICE reported in May 2014 that five field offices  had requested to implement the Full-service component in their office but  ICE did not approve the requests because the field offices did not have  the necessary resources to implement the program. Such resources  include officers\u2019 time to respond to instances of alien noncompliance with  the terms of the program and review ATD cases and make supervision  and termination decisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "ICE Has Established Program Performance Measures for the ATD Program, but Has Not Collected Complete Data for Assessing Progress against All of These Measures", "paragraphs": ["ICE established two program performance measures to assess the ATD  program\u2019s effectiveness in (1) ensuring alien compliance with court  appearance requirements and (2) ensuring removals from the United  States, as well as performance rates to evaluate the program\u2019s  performance, but limitations in data collection hinder ICE\u2019s ability to  assess overall program performance.", "Compliance with court appearances. ICE established a program  performance measure in 2004 to monitor alien compliance with  requirements to appear at their immigration hearings. Data collected by  ICE\u2019s ATD contractor for the Full-service component of the ATD program  from fiscal years 2011 through 2013 showed that over 99 percent of  aliens with a scheduled court hearing appeared at their scheduled court  hearings while participating in this component of the ATD program, with  the appearance rate dropping slightly to over 95 percent of aliens with a  scheduled final hearing appearing at their final removal hearing, as shown  in figure 6.", "However, ICE does not collect similar performance data or report results  on the court appearance rate for aliens enrolled in the Technology-only  component of the ATD program\u2014which constituted 39 percent of the  overall ATD program in fiscal year 2013. According to ICE officials, the  agency did not require the contractor to capture similar data for the  Technology-only component because when the ATD program was  created, it was envisioned that most aliens would be in the Full-service  component for the duration of the immigration process, and data for  aliens in the Full-service component are collected by the contractor.officials stated that they did not have sufficient resources to collect such  data for the Technology-only component, given other priorities.", "ICE has taken steps to address the lack of data collection for the  Technology-only component. Specifically, during the course of our review,  ICE initiated a pilot program with its contractor in May 2014 to establish  improved data collection efforts, as well as expanded supervision options.  The pilot, which is being tested in eight cities, increases the role the ATD  contractor has in collecting and tracking data on aliens in the Technology- only component. Specifically, the contractor tracks compliance with  release requirements, including court appearance requirements, for aliens  enrolled in the Technology-only component, as it already does for aliens  enrolled in the Full-service component. Under the new contract, ICE plans  to implement key aspects of the pilot across all program locations,  including giving ICE officers the ability to require the contractor to track  data on aliens in the Technology-only component\u2014including data on  court appearances\u2014to the contractor, according to the request for  proposal for the new ATD program contract. However, ICE officials will  not be required to have the contractor collect these data under the  contract. While ICE\u2019s plan to expand data collection for the Technology- only component under the new contract is a positive step that will help  provide more information for assessing the performance of that program  component, ICE may not have complete data for assessing program  performance without requirements that ICE or contractor field staff collect  these data. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  states that agencies should employ control activities to monitor their   More specifically, agencies should develop mechanisms  performance.to reliably collect data that can be used to compare and assess program  outcomes related to entire program populations. Requiring ERO field  offices to collect, or have the contractor collect, court appearance data on  the Technology-only component of the ATD program would help ensure  that ICE has complete data for assessing the performance of that  program component as well as the overall ATD program, particularly in  light of ICE\u2019s guidance issued in fiscal year 2011 directing field offices to  transition more aliens to the Technology-only component.", "Removals from the United States. ICE established a new program  performance measure in fiscal year 2011 to assess the number of aliens  removed from the country who had participated in the ATD program.  ICE officials said the decision to replace the court appearance goal with  the removal goal was based on the fact that the court appearance rate  had consistently surpassed 99 percent and the program needed to  establish another goal to demonstrate improvement over time. For this  program performance measure, a removal attributed to the ATD program  counts if the alien (1) was enrolled in ATD for at least 1 day, and (2) was  removed or had departed voluntarily from the United States in the same  fiscal year, regardless of whether the alien was enrolled in ATD at the  time the alien left the country. As shown in table 5, ATD met its goal for  removals in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. In fiscal year 2012, their goal  was to have a 3 percent increase from their fiscal year 2011 total, and in  fiscal year 2013, a 3 percent increase from their 2012 removal goal.", "Performance rates. ICE also uses four performance rates to evaluate  how well the ATD program is operating while aliens are participating in  the program. These four performance rates (success rate, failure rate,  absconder rate, and removal rate)\u2014though not measures of how well  aliens in the ATD program comply with court appearances or removal  orders\u2014assess the status of an alien\u2019s case at the time the alien is  terminated from the ATD program. These performance rates are based  on outcomes defined as favorable, neutral, and unfavorable.", "Favorable outcomes reflect cases where the final outcome of an  alien\u2019s immigration proceeding resulted in either a verified departure  from the United States or a grant of relief and benefits to remain in the  country while the alien was an active participant in the ATD program.", "Neutral outcomes do not reflect final outcomes of immigration  proceedings, but rather include aliens who are terminated from the  ATD program while awaiting departure, after being arrested, or  because ICE determined the alien no longer needed to participate in  the program\u2014which could be because the case was administratively  closed, the alien moved to a jurisdiction that did not have the ATD  program, or ICE determined to lower or raise the alien\u2019s level of  supervision by moving him or her to a detention facility or another  release option.", "Unfavorable outcomes include aliens who were terminated from the  ATD program after absconding or violating program requirements.", "Specifically, the success rate reflects the percentage of aliens whose  cases resulted in either favorable outcomes or neutral outcomes. This  rate essentially measures the ATD program\u2019s effectiveness in being able  to track and monitor an alien while in the program, according to ICE  officials. The failure rate is the converse of the success rate, measuring  the percentage of unfavorable outcomes, including noncompliance with  program terms or absconding from the program. The absconder rate  measures the percentage of aliens whom ICE terminated from the  program as a result of aliens absconding from the program. The removal  rate approximates the percentage of aliens in ATD who will be removed  or depart after the completion of their immigration proceedings. ICE  calculates these rates for both its Full-service and Technology-only  components.", "Using these performance rates, ICE reported that for the Full-service  component over the last 3 years, ICE, along with its contractor, was able  to track and monitor 90 percent or more of aliens until they were  terminated from the Full-service component of the ATD program, with  variance in the rate of aliens who had absconded from the program or  who were projected to be removed from the country. During that same  time, ICE reported improved ability to track and monitor aliens in the  Technology-only component from nearly 80 percent in fiscal year 2011 to  nearly 90 percent in fiscal year 2013. See table 6 for Full-service and  Technology-only performance rates over these last 3 years.", "However, ATD program performance measures and rates provide limited  information about the aliens who are terminated from the ATD program  prior to receiving the final disposition of their immigration proceedings or  were removed or voluntarily departed from the country. Specifically, with  respect to program performance measures, ICE counts an alien who was  terminated from the program and was subsequently removed from the  United States toward his or her removal performance measure as long as  the alien was in the program during the same fiscal year he or she was  removed from the country. However, aliens who were terminated from  the program do not count toward court appearance rates if they  subsequently do not appear for court. Further, performance rates, for  example, did not reflect whether the 87 percent of the aliens whom ICE  terminated from the ATD program in fiscal year 2013 were removed,  voluntarily departed from the United States, or were granted relief. ICE  officials reported that it would be challenging to determine an alien\u2019s  compliance with the terms of his or her release after termination from the  ATD program given insufficient resources and the size of the nondetained  alien population.

ICE has altered its implementation of the ATD program to  address the cost associated with keeping aliens in the program in light of  lengthy immigration proceedings. However, by analyzing data that ICE  plans to collect on supervision levels and specific reasons aliens are  terminated from the program, ICE could be better positioned to monitor  ERO field offices\u2019 implementation of guidance intended to ensure cost- effective management of the ATD program.
