However, GAO found gaps in efforts to document and monitor physical security of some U.S. equipment transferred to Lebanese security forces that may weaken efforts to safeguard physical security of some equipment. First, while DOD annually inventories sensitive equipment by serial number, as required by its policy, U.S embassy officials in Beirut have not always used DOD's required checklists to document compliance with physical security safeguards. Second, State did not fully document 4 of the 10 end-use monitoring checks it conducted in fiscal years 2011 and 2012 for defense equipment the Lebanese government purchased commercially. State end-use monitoring guidance requires that specific information be documented and maintained for all such checks.

With regard to these two articles, we found the  following:  INL consulted with the directorate only one of the two times it sought  to transfer defense articles to Lebanon during the period covered by  our review. While INL did not have formal procedures for identifying  defense articles, INL officials stated that their practice is to contact  State\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, which licenses direct  commercial sales of defense articles, when providing equipment  pursuant to a certain license exception.

According to embassy officials in Beirut, there are  no INL requirements for inspecting the ISF facilities where U.S.- provided equipment is stored. However, when INL consulted the  Directorate of Defense Trade Controls about the transfer of night  vision devices to the ISF, the directorate recommended that INL place  10 conditions on the transfer. These conditions included 5 technical  parameters setting limitations on the performance of key components  of the night vision devices, such as the brightness and resolution of  their image intensifier tubes, and 5 physical security safeguards that  the ISF should implement, such as storing the devices in a secured,  locked facility. State officials in Washington, D.C., said that, although  the conditions communicated by the directorate to the INL were not  requirements, embassy officials would, in the future, inspect ISF  facilities to see that the recommended physical security safeguards  were being implemented. Nonetheless, in the absence of written  procedures, it is unclear what procedures INL would follow for future  transfers of defense articles. Moreover, INL communicated the  conditions of the transfer of night vision devices to the ISF only in  September 2013, after transferring the equipment in August 2013.  Communicating conditions for physical security safeguards to the ISF  after delivery of the equipment could lessen INL\u2019s ability to determine  whether the ISF implements those safeguards.", "In response to our inquiries on its plans to address potential gaps in  physical security safeguards for defense articles, INL stated in January  2014 that it would update its Acquisition Handbook to document new  policies. State anticipates that changes to the handbook would require  INL to inform the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls of INL\u2019s decision  to procure and provide equipment without an export license, as allowed  under Section 38(b)(2) of the Arms Export Control Act. However, it is  unclear whether these revisions would establish procedures to (1) identify  when items are defense articles and (2) determine if physical security  safeguards are recommended."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Government Has Vetted Lebanese Recipients for Human Rights Violations Prior to Providing Assistance", "paragraphs": ["State\u2019s 2012 Guide to Vetting Policy and Process\u2014a primary source of  guidance for U.S. personnel responsible for implementing the Leahy  laws\u2014requires State officials in Washington, D.C., and overseas to vet  for potential human rights violations all individuals or units nominated to  receive training or equipment by checking their names against files,  databases, and other sources of information. In detailing the steps for  vetting, the guidance specifies that relevant data are to be entered into  the International Vetting and Security Tracking (INVEST) database.  INVEST is State\u2019s official system of record for conducting Leahy vetting  and recording compliance with the Leahy laws. State requires human  rights vetting through INVEST unless the individual or unit has already  been vetted within the prior year, according to a State official. State  approves, suspends, or denies the requests for training as a result of its  vetting efforts.  Our review of State\u2019s INVEST database showed that  State vetted almost 10,000 individuals and units in Lebanon that applied  for U.S. training from October 10, 2010, through April 30, 2013. The  majority (77 percent), applied for INCLE training (see figure 6). By cross- checking a random sample of names from six rosters for U.S. training  delivered to Lebanese security force individuals or units against State\u2019s  designated vetting database, we found that all the names in the sample  had been vetted for human rights violations before the individuals  received the training, as required.", "State approved training for approximately 93 percent of the candidates  and disallowed training for the remaining 7 percent for whom the vetting  process produced a suspension. While administrative reasons accounted  for most of the suspensions, such as a name submitted with insufficient  time for vetting clearance prior to the class start date, potential human  rights violations accounted for a few suspensions. U.S. officials in Beirut  communicated suspensions based on human rights violations to  Lebanese government officials.  Administrative reasons for some  suspensions were not communicated to the Lebanese government  because the U.S. officials did not think they were required to do so. In  September 2013, we reported that State guidance to embassies on the  human rights vetting process did not specify whether the requirement to  inform foreign governments applies when a unit or individual is  suspended from receiving assistance. Hence, we recommended that  State provide clarifying guidance for implementing the duty-to-inform  requirement of the State Leahy law, such as guidance on whether U.S.  embassies should or should not notify a foreign government in cases of  suspensions. On the basis of evidence presented in a June 2013  Human Rights Watch report on Lebanon, in August 2013, State issued its  first denial for training to individuals from the Drugs Repression Bureau of  the ISF and informed ISF about this denial. As a result of the denial,  three Lebanese counternarcotics officials were not approved for a  September 2013 training course. Officials of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut  communicated the reasons for the denial to the ISF during the course of  our review.", "On the basis of our cross-check analysis of a sample of names from six  training rosters against INVEST data, we estimated that State vetted for  potential human rights violations all Lebanese students who attended  security forces training from October 10, 2010, through April 30, 2013.  We selected a random sample of 118 names from training rosters from  the Lebanese Armed Forces; INCLE; Antiterrorism Assistance and other  Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining, and Related programs; and  International Military Education and Training. We cross-checked those  names with the names of all Lebanese candidates vetted for human rights  violations through INVEST from October 10, 2010, through April 30, 2013.  Results of our analysis show that all 118 names on the training rosters  were also found in INVEST. Therefore, we estimate that 100 percent of  the 7,104 Lebanese students that attended U.S. training during that  period were vetted for human rights violations through INVEST before  they received training (see table 3).", "The U.S. Embassy in Beirut also conducts human rights vetting for units  that are to receive equipment. In November 2011, State agreed with our  recommendation that it implement individual- and unit-level human rights  vetting for all recipients of equipment. As of July 2013, Bureau of  Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor officials said that vetting of units  that receive equipment is increasing worldwide and that the bureau hopes  to achieve State-wide concurrence implementing the recommendation.", "State guidance also requires embassies to develop standard operating  procedures for human rights vetting. The U.S. Embassy in Beirut  developed standard operating procedures to implement State guidance  during the course of our review. In September 2013, we found that State  does not monitor whether all U.S. embassies have developed standard  operating procedures that address the Leahy laws\u2019 requirements.  Therefore, we recommended, and State agreed, to ensure that all U.S.  embassies have standard operating procedures that address human  rights vetting requirements in the Leahy laws."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["U.S. agencies have allocated hundreds of millions of dollars for  equipment and training to the government of Lebanon as part of U.S.  efforts to build partner capacity and address threats to U.S. interests.  Such efforts remain a U.S. priority. Just as important to the interests of  the United States and its partners are efforts to ensure that any provided  security-related equipment or training assistance does not help those who  wish to do harm to the United States or its partners. Hence, end-use  monitoring and human rights vetting are two critical activities that the U.S.  government employs in Lebanon and worldwide to prevent misuse of its  security-related equipment and training assistance. However, existing  implementation gaps may weaken efforts to safeguard some equipment  from misuse. These gaps involve embassy officials not utilizing required  checklists to verify Lebanese facilities\u2019 safeguards for sensitive defense  equipment and not documenting details of State\u2019s end-use checks.  Closing these gaps could help mitigate the impact of security-related  travel restrictions on U.S. officials\u2019 access to some locations and could  also help raise the level of confidence that Lebanese security forces are  complying with security requirements. Because end-use monitoring in  Lebanon is intended to provide U.S. officials with visibility over the  implementation of required safeguards, the above-mentioned gaps  reduce the U.S. government\u2019s confidence that safeguards are being  properly implemented to prevent equipment from falling into the wrong  hands. Furthermore, the absence of INL procedures for identifying  defense articles erodes confidence that State officials are applying  recommended end-use monitoring and security safeguards on defense  equipment. On a more positive note, our analysis did confirm that 100  percent of the Lebanese recipients of U.S. training were vetted for human  rights violations and that this system appears to be working as intended in  Lebanon."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that U.S. agencies are in a better position to ensure  adequate safeguards for and monitoring of sensitive equipment, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense take additional steps to ensure  that Office of Defense Cooperation officials in Beirut use the checklists  required during the physical security checks.", "In addition, we recommend that the Secretary of State take the following  three actions:", "Direct the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and U.S. officials  overseas to maintain cables or e-mails as required by State guidance  to document each Blue Lantern end-use check.", "Direct State bureaus transferring equipment to foreign security forces  under security-related assistance programs to establish formal written  procedures to identify whether items are defense articles.", "Direct State bureaus transferring equipment to foreign security forces  under security-related assistance programs to establish formal written  procedures to consult with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls  to determine if there are additional safeguards recommended for the  transfer of the defense articles."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD and State for comment.

To address these objectives, we obtained  funding data from the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department  of State (State) on programs that provide security-related assistance to  Lebanon. We also analyzed documents from DOD and State, such as  cables, manuals, handbooks, compliance and inventory reports, and data  on U.S.-provided equipment, training, and end-use checks, among  others. We interviewed U.S. officials in Washington, D.C.; at the U.S.  Central Command in Tampa, Florida; and at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut,  Lebanon, as well as officials of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and  Internal Security Forces (ISF) in Beirut, Lebanon.", "To assess the extent to which the U.S. government has disbursed or  committed security-related assistance funding for Lebanon\u2019s security  forces since fiscal year 2009, we requested data from State and DOD.  The funding data we report represent the balances as of September 30,  2013. State provided data on the status of allocations, obligations,  unobligated balances, and disbursements for all of the funding accounts  that support security-related assistance in Lebanon: Foreign Military  Financing; International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement;  International Military Education and Training; and Nonproliferation,  Antiterrorism, Demining and Related Programs; and Section 1206 and  1207 authorities. State collected the data directly from each bureau for  State-implemented accounts and from DOD for Foreign Military Financing  and International Military Education and Training. However, because  Foreign Military Financing funds are budgeted and tracked in a different  way than other foreign assistance accounts, DOD provided us with data  on commitments. Recognizing that different agencies and bureaus may  use slightly different accounting terms, we provided each agency with the  definitions from GAO\u2019s A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget  Process and requested that each agency provide the relevant data  according to those definitions. We also discussed the types of assistance  provided with various officials of the LAF and the ISF. To assess the  reliability of the data provided, we requested and reviewed information  from officials from each agency regarding the agency\u2019s underlying  financial data system(s) and the checks, controls, and reviews used to  ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data provided.

We also obtained  and analyzed the 2012 Compliance Assessment Visit to Lebanon report,  U.S. Central Command Inspector General Report for the Office of  Defense Cooperation-Beirut, annual end-use monitoring reports for  Lebanon, reports of lost or destroyed U.S. equipment provided to  Lebanon, Lebanese compliance plans for safeguarding U.S. equipment,  and security checklists required for enhanced end-use equipment in  Lebanon. In addition, we reviewed and analyzed data and management  reports on the equipment provided to Lebanon and end-use checks.  Specifically, we reviewed management reports from DOD\u2019s Security  Cooperation Information Portal database, including delinquent,  reconciliation, ad-hoc, and trend reports. We used the portal database to  identify defense articles provided to Lebanon that require routine and  enhanced end-use monitoring and the compliance actions taken for the  items. We compared the data on defense articles and end-use monitoring  to the various management reports and found the data to be sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. Using the data provided by DOD, we drew a  nongeneralizable random sample of 30 items for physical inspection out  of 184 items that required enhanced end-use monitoring at two locations  in Beirut, Lebanon. During our fieldwork at one of the locations, we  observed DOD officials conducting enhanced end-use monitoring checks.

We limited our analysis to checks during  these years to increase the likelihood that the embassy officials who  conducted these checks would still be in their current positions, thereby  enabling further discussion about the specific details of the checks. We  requested both outgoing and responding cables for each of the 10  checks; State was unable to provide cables or email communication for 4  of the 10 Blue Lantern checks. Based on summary information provided  for each check and cables and e-mail correspondence on 7 of the 10  checks, we analyzed and recorded information about each case,  including the subject of the check, the commodity checked, license  conditions, evidence that site visits were or were not requested and  conducted, inventories requested and conducted, and any follow-up that  post indicated was necessary.
