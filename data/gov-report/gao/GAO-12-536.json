This report is an unclassified version of a classified report issued in February 2012. GAO was asked to address (1) global trends in the use of UAV technology, (2) U.S. national security considerations concerning UAV proliferation, (3) multilateral and bilateral tools to control UAV proliferation, and (4) coordination of U.S. efforts to limit the spread of UAV technology. To conduct this review, GAO analyzed intelligence, licensing, and end-use monitoring data, and interviewed U.S. and foreign officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since 2005, the number of countries that acquired an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system nearly doubled from about 40 to more than 75. In addition, countries of proliferation concern developed and fielded increasingly more sophisticated systems. Recent trends in new UAV capabilities, including armed and miniature UAVs, increased the number of military applications for this technology. A number of new civilian and commercial applications, such as law enforcement and environmental monitoring, are available for UAVs, but these applications are limited by regulatory restrictions on civilian airspace.", "The United States likely faces increasing risks as countries of concern and terrorist organizations seek to acquire UAV technology. Foreign countries\u0092 and terrorists\u0092 acquisition of UAVs could provide them with increased abilities to gather intelligence on and conduct attacks against U.S. interests. For instance, some foreign countries likely have already used UAVs to gather information on U.S. military activities overseas. Alternatively, the U.S. government has determined that selected transfers of UAV technology support its national security interests by providing allies with key capabilities and by helping retain a strong industrial base for UAV production. For instance, the United Kingdom and Italy have used UAVs purchased from the United States to collect data on Taliban activity in Afghanistan.", "The United States has engaged in multilateral and bilateral diplomacy to address UAV proliferation concerns. The United States principally engaged the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) to address multilateral UAV proliferation concerns. Since 2005, the United States proposed certain significant changes to address how MTCR controls UAVs, but members could not reach a consensus for these changes. Also, while the Wassenaar Arrangement (Wassenaar) controls the export of some key dual-use UAV components, it does not control other dual-use technologies that are commonly used in UAVs. The Department of State (State) has also used diplomatic cables to address the proliferation of UAV-related technologies bilaterally. State provided to GAO about 70 cables that it sent from January 2005 to September 2011 addressing UAV-related concerns to about 20 governments and the MTCR. Over 75 percent of these cables focused on efforts by a small number of countries of concern to obtain UAV technology.", "U.S. agencies coordinate in several ways to control the spread of UAV technology, but could improve their UAV-related information sharing. For instance, an interagency group reviews many license applications to export UAV technology. However, there is not a formal mechanism to ensure that licensing agencies have relevant and timely intelligence information when making licensing decisions. Also, State\u0092s licensing database cannot provide aggregate data on military UAV exports State has authorized, which may impair the U.S. government\u0092s ability to oversee the release of sensitive UAV technology. The Department of Defense (DOD) and State each conduct end-use monitoring of some UAV exports, but differences in the agencies\u0092 programs may result in similar types of items being subject to different levels of oversight."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that State improve its export licensing database to better identify authorized UAV exports, that relevant agencies improve mechanisms for sharing information relevant to the export licensing process, and that State and DOD harmonize their UAV end-use monitoring approaches.

UAVs are also increasingly being  used for civilian purposes such as border security, environmental  monitoring, and disaster relief. For example, the United States used  UAVs to help the Japanese government survey the damage to the  Fukushima nuclear power plant resulting from the March 2011  earthquake. The growing sophistication and availability of UAVs poses  risks for U.S. interests. Consequently, the United States has sought to  limit the spread of UAV technology through bilateral diplomacy and by  working with like-minded supplier countries through multilateral regimes  such as the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) and the   In addition, the United States  Wassenaar Arrangement (Wassenaar).and other countries control some UAV exports through national export  control licensing and enforcement efforts.", "In response to your request, we have updated our 2004 report on cruise  missile and UAV proliferation, focusing solely on UAVs.

For instance, in  one case, the MTEC and the Missile Annex Review Committeewith a U.S. UAV producer to determine what modifications the company  needed to make to one of its existing UAV systems to ensure that it was  not inherently capable of delivering at least a 500 kilogram payload to a  range of at least 300 kilometers. The resulting design ensured that the  UAV was classified as an MTCR Category II system and thus not subject  to the \u201cstrong presumption of denial,\u201d if the company sought to export the  system.", "State and DOD also coordinate decisions regarding the transfer of military  UAV technology through the FMS program. For instance, DOD  procedures in its Security Assistance Management Manual specify that  DSCA or State may initiate coordination to approve or disapprove a  transfer within 5 days of receiving the information copy of the Letter of  Request, which is a formal request from a country to purchase an item  through FMS. DSCA consults with State on these requests in order to  determine if there are any immediate objections to the proposed sale  within the U.S. government. Further, State must approve any arms  transfer through FMS.", "The U.S. government has authorized the export of a range of UAV  technology, but database limitations impair its ability to oversee the  release of such technology. The U.S. government approved the export or  transfer of a range of complete military and dual-use UAV systems, as  well as key UAV components, from fiscal years 2005 through 2010, but it  has no comprehensive view of the volume of UAV technology it  authorized for export. Specifically, State\u2019s licensing database was not  designed to produce complete data on the number, types, and value of  UAV technology that State has licensed for export. Since State\u2019s  database organizes items by U.S. Munitions List category and  subcategory, and the list has no dedicated category or subcategory for  UAV technology, State lacks an effective means of querying the database  to identify UAV-related licenses. In July 2009, State issued a request that  exporters list in the \u201cpurpose\u201d field of their export license application if an  item was a \u201cUAV-related license,\u201d covered under certain subcategories  within Category VIII of the U.S. Munitions List. State issued this request to  assist it in routing license applications to the appropriate internal unit for  review, rather than to facilitate monitoring of the volume of UAV  technology authorized for export, according to State officials. Although  State has issued the request to exporters, it does not have procedures to  ensure that exporters comply with this request and the request does not  apply to UAV-related licenses involving items not covered by Category  VIII. In announcing the request, State noted its intention to automate this  process, but had not done so as of February 2012.", "In contrast, Commerce\u2019s database does allow for identification of UAV- related items falling under the Commerce Control List\u2019s three UAV- specific ECCNs. However, it has limitations in determining the extent to  which certain UAV components have been authorized for export. The  Commerce Control List contains at least 29 other ECCNs that control  items that are used in UAVs, but can also be used for other purposes. For  items controlled under these 29 ECCNs, Commerce\u2019s database does not  provide a means for easily determining which items authorized for export  are to be used in UAVs and which are to be used for other purposes,  such as in manned aircraft. DOD\u2019s system for recording FMS cases is  better able to provide a complete picture of UAV technology that has  been transferred overseas via FMS.", "These limitations in the U.S. government\u2019s licensing data impair the ability  of U.S. agencies and Congress to oversee the release of sensitive UAV  technology. As a result, U.S. agencies may face additional challenges in  working to effectively counter UAV proliferation. For instance, U.S.  officials may lack complete information on relevant, past licensing  decisions, when determining whether or not to grant an export license for  a particular UAV item. Additionally, these data issues reduce U.S.  agencies\u2019 ability to conduct analysis of denied UAV-related license  applications to determine if there are particular trends in questionable  parties\u2019 attempts to acquire UAV technology, according to U.S.  government officials.", "Despite these limitations, we analyzed State and Commerce licensing  data, as well as FMS data, to estimate the extent to which the U.S.  government authorized the export of UAV technology in fiscal years 2005  through 2010. In total, the U.S. government approved FMS transfers of  complete UAV systems in 15 cases over the period. Additionally, we  identified 1,278 UAV-related licenses that State processed over the  period. Of these, State approved 90 percent, denied 3 percent, and  returned to the applicant without action 7 percent. We could not  accurately determine the number of approved licenses that were for  complete UAV systems, given limitations in State\u2019s database, but the data  indicate that State authorized the export of several complete UAV  systems including the Desert Hawk, the ScanEagle, and the Raven. From  fiscal years 2005 through 2010, we identified 134 licenses to export dual- use UAV technology that Commerce processed. It approved 74 percent  of these applications, denied 2 percent and returned without action   24 percent. Of the 99 licenses that Commerce approved, we identified at  least 55 that appeared to involve complete dual-use UAV systems based  upon the descriptions in Commerce\u2019s data. In addition to complete UAV  systems, the U.S. government authorized the export of an array of UAV  components and subsystems. Table 1 shows a breakdown of the  estimated number of UAV-related licenses for fiscal years 2005 through  2010.", "The U.S. government authorized the transfer of UAV systems to a variety  of countries over fiscal years 2005 through 2010. For instance, it  authorized the transfer of military UAVs to NATO allies such as Denmark,  Italy, Lithuania, and the United Kingdom, as well as other countries such  as Australia, Colombia, Israel, and Singapore.", "In addition to the U.S. government\u2019s limited ability to determine the  volume of authorized UAV exports, U.S. licensing agencies have limited  information sharing mechanisms with the intelligence community. Both  State and Commerce officials stated that the intelligence community does  not have a formal process in place to directly provide them timely and  relevant intelligence to assist in the licensing process. For instance,  intelligence agencies may be consulted by the MTEC on occasion, but  they are not routinely represented at weekly meetings. Some intelligence  agencies participate in the interagency Missile Trade Analysis Group,  which is a State-chaired interagency working group responsible for  stopping specific shipments of missile and UAV proliferation concern  worldwide. Although the group is not directly involved in licensing  issues, State officials noted that representatives from State\u2019s DDTC and  Commerce\u2019s BIS attend the group\u2019s meetings to help ensure a strong  working relationship with licensing agencies. Moreover, State officials  stated that because both the MTEC and the Missile Trade Analysis Group  are chaired by State\u2019s Bureau of International Security and  Nonproliferation it helps ensure coordination and information-sharing on  issues affecting both groups.", "According to State and Commerce officials, certain intelligence agencies  previously had a more formalized role in the licensing process, but chose  to remove themselves from it in 2008. For instance, State officials stated  that certain intelligence agencies had previously participated in the MTEC  and helped validate the bona fides of foreign parties in license  transactions. Additionally, Commerce officials reported one intelligence  agency had previously hired contactors to screen foreign parties in  Commerce export license applications against intelligence reporting.  According to Commerce officials, this agency decided to end its  formalized support for the licensing process due to budget cuts and other  priorities. State officials said that, since 2008, State has struggled to get  timely and relevant intelligence information to assist in licensing  decisions. Additionally, Commerce officials stated that they did not  believe they were getting access to all pertinent intelligence information  as part of their license review process. Some DOD officials also  expressed concern with the lack of official mechanisms for the  intelligence and licensing agencies to coordinate and noted that some  derogatory information available to them on parties listed on license  applications may not be getting factored into licensing decisions.", "According to U.S. government officials, the administration is currently  discussing how the intelligence community can provide better support to  the licensing agencies. Additionally, Commerce noted that it has received  funding to establish its own intelligence center, known as the Strategic  Intelligence Liaison Center, within BIS, to fill the gaps caused when the  intelligence community stopped reviewing Commerce export licenses.  The center will, among other things, check the names of parties in license  applications against intelligence systems, as was previously done by the  intelligence community. While the focus of the center will be on  Commerce export licenses, Commerce officials stated that they are  working with other relevant agencies to ensure that the information the  center generates is available to them, as appropriate. Commerce stated  that the center was established as of the end of 2011."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Three Agencies Conduct End-Use Monitoring of UAVs, but Procedures Are Different for Similar Items", "paragraphs": ["State, Commerce, and DOD each conducts end-use monitoring on some  UAV-related exports and transfers. Since our previous report on UAV  proliferation, all three agencies have taken some steps to increase their  end-use monitoring of UAVs and related items.", "In 2004, the director of the Office of Enforcement Analysis within  Commerce\u2019s BIS issued a memo to his staff that highlighted the need to  focus greater attention on conducting end-use monitoring of UAV exports.  The memo identified certain types of items that should have priority for  end-use monitoring, given their utility in developing UAVs. Unlike  Commerce, State issued no specific guidance on how to target its end- use monitoring of military UAV technology. Although State has not issued  UAV-specific end-use monitoring guidance, State has identified UAVs as  an example of a sensitive commodity that might trigger a Blue Lantern  check, given the negative impact on national security if the item were to  be diverted or illicitly retransferred. State officials said that they consider  a variety of factors when making a determination as to whether end-use  checks on sensitive items, including UAV technology, are warranted. For  instance, State may be more likely to do a Blue Lantern check if the end- user has no established history with controlled items, if the number of  items ordered by the end-user is more than would reasonably be needed,  if the shipment involves an illogical routing, or if the purchaser is paying in  cash or at above market rates.", "Shortly after our 2004 report, DOD took steps to strengthen its end-use  monitoring of UAV technology transferred via FMS. In March 2004, DOD  announced that MTCR Category I UAVs would be among those items  subject to enhanced end-use monitoring under the Golden Sentry  program. For those items subject to enhanced end-use monitoring,  DOD officials stationed in the host country are required to conduct  inventories of transferred items following delivery and at regular intervals  thereafter to verify that the items are accounted for and being used in  accordance with the terms and conditions of the transfer. DOD can also  require enhanced end-use monitoring on non-Category I UAVs, if the  transfer is deemed to be of significant risk to warrant such a step. DOD  officials reported that, as of February 2012, there had only been one  instance where DOD required enhanced end-use monitoring for a non- Category I UAV. Items not requiring enhanced end-use monitoring are  subject to routine end-use monitoring under the Golden Sentry program.  Routine end-use monitoring is conducted in conjunction with other  required security-related duties. For example, U.S. officials might observe  how a host country\u2019s military is using U.S. equipment when visiting a  military installation on other business. Given the large volume of defense  articles transferred through FMS, DSCA officials have instructed DOD  personnel to concentrate routine end-use monitoring efforts on a \u201cwatch  list\u201d of specific categories of items. DOD has included UAVs among the  items on the watch list. However, some DOD officials that we interviewed,  as well as officials interviewed by other GAO teams in 2011, noted that  there was not clear guidance on the activities that constitute routine end- use monitoring and how to document these efforts.", "The majority of end-use monitoring done for UAV-related items has had  favorable results, but agencies found problems in some cases. From  fiscal years 2005 through 2010, State identified 45 UAV-related Blue  Lantern checks that it conducted and Commerce identified 201 UAV- related end-use checks that it conducted. Of the checks State identified as being UAV-related, 66 percent resulted in favorable findings,   16 percent in unfavorable findings, and another 18 percent were  inconclusive. Of the checks Commerce identified as being UAV-related,  58 percent were favorable, 6 percent were unfavorable, and the  remaining 36 percent had limited or inconclusive results. Of the checks  that were unfavorable, some identified significant concerns related to  unauthorized end-users or end-uses. For instance, State conducted a  Blue Lantern check as part of a request to amend a license application to  allow for the provision of additional services to one country in support of a  U.S. UAV it had already purchased. State found that the country was  basing and operating the UAV in a manner that violated the U.S.  government\u2019s prohibition against using U.S. Munitions List items in  internationally disputed territory. Thus, the check was deemed  unfavorable.", "All three agencies have conducted end-use monitoring on UAV  technology, but differences in their respective end-use monitoring  programs may result in similar types of items being subject to different  levels of oversight. Further details of these differences in U.S. agencies\u2019  end-use monitoring programs for UAVs are addressed in the classified  version of the report.", "U.S. agencies may also have differing levels of access to facilities and  equipment when conducting end-use monitoring, contributing to  differences in the level of oversight of exported items. Although DOD  requires that countries agree to permit inventories and physical  inspections as a condition of FMS transfers, State sometimes lacks this  type of agreement from countries for items exported through DCS. In fact,  U.S. government officials noted that some bilateral agreements prohibit  U.S. officials from directly conducting end-use monitoring on State- licensed items. Even when State does have such authority, it  inconsistently visits end-users to verify compliance with license  conditions, in at least some countries. For instance, we reported in  November 2011 that State infrequently visited end-users in Persian Gulf  countries when conducting Blue Lantern post-shipment checks on night  vision devices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Coordinated Efforts to Enforce UAV Export Controls, but the Nature of UAV Technology Creates Enforcement Challenges", "paragraphs": ["U.S. agencies coordinated their UAV enforcement actions through  several mechanisms, including the National Export Enforcement  Coordination Network, and the Exodus Command Center, but officials  acknowledged limitations with each. We have previously reported on  challenges in enforcing export control laws and regulations more  generally. Among other things, we found enforcement agencies have had  difficulty coordinating cases and agreeing on how to proceed on  investigations.", "The National Export Enforcement Coordination Network (NEECN) was  designed to be a hub for coordination on export control investigations.  Among other things, NEECN assisted law enforcement agencies in  apprising each other of investigative leads, disseminating investigative  leads to law enforcement field offices, providing support to ongoing  investigations, and identifying proliferation trends. As of November 2011,  NEECN was replaced by the new Export Enforcement Coordination  Center, as part of the administration\u2019s export control reform initiative. To  help ensure greater coordination, the administration has required key  agencies to partner in this effort in contrast with NEECN, which was a  voluntary effort and at times suffered from a lack of agency participation,  according to some law enforcement officials.", "Another key coordination mechanism is the ICE-led Exodus Command  Center. Enforcement agencies, including ICE and CBP, submit license  determination requests through the center to confirm with State or  Commerce whether a particular item requires a license, and if so, whether  the required license has been obtained. During fiscal years 2005 through  2010, law enforcement officials used the Exodus Command Center for  license determination requests involving UAV-related technology;  however, details of these requests are designated as sensitive but  unclassified and are not reported here. Law enforcement officials noted  that while the Exodus Command Center is a key tool, license  determination requests can take a significant amount of time, thus  impacting their ability to move forward on investigations or other  enforcement actions. In March 2012, we issued a report that explores in  more detail the challenges that law enforcement agencies face in  investigating illicit transshipments, including license determination  delays.", "U.S. agencies have worked together to take certain enforcement actions  against violators of export control laws and regulations on UAV  technology. Based on our analysis of DOJ reporting on export control  enforcement prosecutions from October 2006 through June 2011, we  identified at least seven prosecutions involving attempts to illegally export  UAV-related technology. For instance, in 2009, a District of Columbia  couple pleaded guilty to making false statements regarding the export of  autopilots for mini UAVs to China.", "According to U.S. enforcement officials, they encountered certain  difficulties enforcing export laws and regulations on UAVs that are  common across all export control investigations. For instance, of the   34 closed investigations that ICE identified for us as being UAV-related in  fiscal years 2005 through 2010, none of the cases resulted in a criminal  prosecution. In the majority of the 34 cases, the investigations were  closed as a result of investigators losing touch with the suspects outside  of the country. We previously reported that many suspects in export  control violation cases are located outside of the country and foreign  governments may not always choose to cooperate with U.S. law  enforcement officials.", "Law enforcement officials also identified two issues that make UAV cases  particularly difficult to pursue. DOJ officials noted that it can be difficult to  prosecute a case involving an export control violation, particularly those  involving dual-use technologies, because proving the violation took place  typically involves showing that the commodity in question was specifically  designed for use in a technology or application requiring an export control  license. For instance, in the 2009 case discussed previously, DOJ  ultimately prosecuted the District of Columbia couple for making false  statements and not for illegally exporting the autopilots to China. DOJ did  this because prosecutors could not prove that the autopilots were  specially designed for use in military UAVs, despite evidence that this  was their intended use, according to DOJ officials. As part of the  administration\u2019s efforts to move items on the U.S. Munitions List to the  Commerce Control List, Commerce issued a proposed rule in the Federal  Register in July 2011 defining what is meant by specially designed and  requesting public comment on the proposed definition. The comment  period for this proposed rule closed on September 13, 2011. After  reviewing the comments submitted and further review of the issue,  Commerce issued another proposed rule further revising the definition of  \u201cspecially designed\u201d in the Federal Register in June 2012. The comment  period for this proposed rule will close on August 3, 2012. In addition,  ICE, CBP, and Commerce officials noted that it is often difficult for law  enforcement officials to determine whether violations are occurring  because many law enforcement officials lack the technical skills to  differentiate controlled UAV components from similar components used in  model aircraft or ultralights, which are not subject to export control  restrictions. Commerce officials also noted that the rapidly evolving nature  of the technologies for use in UAVs could make it more difficult for law  enforcement to readily identify these technologies in the future. According  to ICE officials, to provide law enforcement officials with the technical  skills to identify UAV-related technologies, ICE has provided UAV training  to its agents in multiple locations throughout the country. Commerce  has also provided technical training to law enforcement officials; however,  this training did not specifically focus on UAV technologies, according to  Commerce officials."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Multiple factors highlight past and likely persistent limitations of U.S.  efforts to control the proliferation of UAV technology through the export  control process. First, the key trends in the acquisition, development, and  applications of UAV technology globally show enormous growth in  demand for military uses of UAVs, including for lethal applications, and an  increasing ability of countries to acquire or develop their own systems.  While only a few countries will have a near-term ability to develop and  field the most sophisticated systems, many are expected to have  sufficiently useful UAVs. These could threaten U.S. forces and interests.  Second, the U.S. government recognizes the risks related to the  proliferation of UAV technology, but faces difficulties setting controls on  systems and components that countries of concern are interested in  obtaining. Third, the U.S. government used multilateral and bilateral  mechanisms to restrict the proliferation of UAV technology to a great  extent, but as we reported in 2004, the nonbinding and consensual nature  of multilateral export control regimes can challenge the U.S.  government\u2019s ability to achieve its objectives in these forums.", "While technological advances and the consensual nature of the  multilateral export control regimes complicate the task of avoiding  widespread proliferation to U.S. adversaries, the U.S. government can  take steps to better coordinate its efforts to address national security  considerations through its controls on the transfer and export of UAV  technology. For instance, some agencies have routine and formal roles in  reviewing licenses, but others have no formal mechanism to share  significant information with each other. In fact, the role of some agencies  with potentially important information to provide has diminished in recent  years. Furthermore, U.S. government efforts to provide reasonable  assurance that UAV exports and transfers are used as intended are  marked by differing levels of protection through State and DOD end-use  monitoring activities. As we previously reported on a similar situation  involving night vision devices for Persian Gulf countries, major differences  in the two agencies\u2019 monitoring programs need to be harmonized. Finally,  certain information that would be useful to executive branch and  congressional decision-making is unavailable because State\u2019s licensing  database cannot readily identify all licenses authorizing military UAV  exports.

State  noted that these changes to the U.S. Munitions List, along with the  introduction of USXports as the U.S. government\u2019s export control  licensing case management system, will provide an opportunity to  improve database collection and facilitate the identification of UAV  licenses.", "State, DOD, and Commerce agreed with our recommendation to take  additional steps to establish better interagency information sharing.  According to State, the administration is currently trying to address such  concerns as part of its export control reform initiative. Both DOD and  Commerce noted that as part of the administration\u2019s export control reform  initiative, a new unit, known as the Information Triage Unit, is being  established to facilitate information sharing among various U.S. agencies.

Private sector associations we met with included the Association for  Unmanned Vehicle Systems International and the Aerospace Industries  Association. We also interviewed representatives of UAV manufacturers  in the United States, as well as various analysts within the U.S.  government who track UAV issues. We also obtained copies of their  briefs as well as some of their reports. In addition, to get a better  understanding of the regulatory and technological limitations that affect  UAV development, we met with officials from the Federal Aviation  Administration. As our trend assessment dealt with global trends, we also  met with industry, trade association, and foreign government officials in  three countries\u2014Israel, Italy, and the United Kingdom\u2014and obtained  reports on their UAV programs. We selected these countries based on  analyses of open source reporting and Department of Defense (DOD)  and Department of State (State) data showing that these countries either  have extensive experience operating U.S.-made UAV systems or are  important producers of UAVs and related components. We traveled to  Patuxent Naval Air Station in Patuxent, Maryland, to gain a firsthand  understanding of the current state of UAV technology, observing the U.S.  Navy\u2019s Broad Area Maritime Surveillance-Demonstrator system and the  Shadow 200. The Broad Area Maritime Surveillance-Demonstrator UAV  is based on the Global Hawk platform\u2014a strategic UAV\u2014while the  Shadow 200 is a tactical UAV in use by the U.S. Army that is currently  undergoing modification for use by the U.S. Marine Corps.", "To assess the national security considerations associated with the  proliferation of UAV technology, we met with private sector and U.S.  government analysts knowledgeable about UAVs.

Additionally, we interviewed officials from  State, the Department of Commerce (Commerce), and DOD to gather  information on the key risks and benefits associated with the spread of  UAV technology. To better understand the security considerations  associated with transfers of U.S. UAV technology to U.S. allies, we met  with foreign government and U.S. embassy officials in Italy to document  the Italian Ministry of Defense\u2019s experience purchasing and operating  U.S.-made systems. While in London, we were unable to meet with  United Kingdom military officials knowledgeable about their experience  purchasing and operating U.S. systems, but we obtained written  responses to questions from the United Kingdom\u2019s Ministry of Defense  and met with U.S. embassy officials familiar with the United Kingdom\u2019s  experience.", "To assess the extent to which the U.S. government used the multilateral  regimes and bilateral demarches to foreign countries to address UAV  technology proliferation, we obtained and analyzed classified State  reporting cables documenting the results of the 2005 through 2009  Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) plenaries and other  meetings.

To identify these ECCNs, we first  conducted a search of the Commerce Control List to determine which  ECCNs contained the terms: \u201cunmanned aerial vehicle,\u201d \u201cUAV,\u201d  \u201cunmanned aerial system,\u201d and \u201cUAS.\u201d We also reviewed Commerce  documentation discussing UAV-related ECCNs. Finally, we validated the  choice of these ECCNs with officials from Commerce and the Defense  Technology Security Administration and made modifications to our list  based upon their input. We validated our list of ECCNs with Commerce  and the Defense Technology Security Administration because Commerce  manages the database used to track dual-use license applications and  the Defense Technology Security Administration is the main agency that  Commerce uses for technical assistance in conducting license reviews.  We then analyzed Commerce export licensing data and quantified the  number of license applications associated with each of these ECCNs  during fiscal years 2005 through 2010. However, in the final report, we  chose to limit our discussion to only those licenses involving the three  ECCNS that are UAV-specific. We chose to do so because, through our  own analysis and interviews with Commerce and Defense Technology  Security Administration officials, we determined there was not a reliable  way of identifying which of the more than 7,000 license applications  involving the other 29 ECCNs included items that were to be used in  UAVs, versus those licenses that included items to be used for other  purposes, such as in manned aircraft. Because our final analysis does not  include any license applications involving these 29 ECCNs, our results  may not have captured some UAV-related licenses; however, we believe  the results are sufficiently reliable to provide a reasonable estimate of the  number of UAV-related licenses submitted to Commerce in fiscal years  2005 through 2010.", "State\u2019s licensing database is organized according to U.S. Munitions List  category and subcategory and there is no specific category or  subcategory for UAVs and related technology. Thus, to analyze State\u2019s  UAV-related licensing data, we obtained data for more than 7,000 license  applications that State had submitted to the Missile Technology Export  Control Group (MTEC) during fiscal years 2005 through 2010. While the  majority of UAV licenses go before the MTEC, certain UAV-related  licenses may not be captured within the data State provided, according to  State officials. For instance, certain sensors or other types of payloads  used in UAVs, but also used in other types of aircraft, might not be  reviewed by the MTEC because they are not considered missile  technology controlled by the MTCR, according to State officials.  Additionally, the data provided by State included a significant number of  licenses that were not UAV-related and instead pertained to other types  of missile technology. To better identify the UAV-related licenses, we  identified 34 key terms to use in filtering the data. These terms included  both general terms that are commonly used to describe UAVs, such as  \u201cunmanned aerial system\u201d and \u201cUAS,\u201d and also specific terms that are the  names of key UAV systems that are produced in the United States and  abroad, such as \u201cPredator\u201d and \u201cScanEagle.\u201d We validated these terms  with State and the Defense Technology Security Administration. We  validated the choice of these terms with State and the Defense  Technology Security Administration because State manages the  database used to track U.S. Munitions List-related license applications  and the Defense Technology Security Administration is the main agency  that State uses for technical assistance in conducting license reviews. We  used these terms to assist in separating out those licenses that were  UAV-related from those that were not. Nonetheless, we found that Direct  Commercial Sales (DCS) data could not identify with certainty all licenses  authorizing UAVs and related components without a manual review of  tens of thousands of licenses. As a consequence, we could not accurately  report the magnitude of DCS arms transfer authorizations for UAVs;  however, we believe the results are sufficiently reliable to provide a  general estimate of the number of UAV-related licenses submitted to  State in fiscal years 2005 through 2010.", "To analyze State and Commerce end-use monitoring of UAV-related  exports, we obtained end-use monitoring data from both agencies  identifying the number, location, and type of UAV-related end-use  monitoring checks conducted in fiscal years 2005 through 2010. Both  State\u2019s and Commerce\u2019s end-use data have limitations because the  agencies\u2019 databases are not designed to provide a means of  automatically identifying end-use checks that are UAV-related. As a  result, both agencies developed queries using terms such as \u201cUAV\u201d and  \u201cunmanned aerial vehicle.\u201d Based upon our discussions with agency  officials, we believe that these queries identified the majority of relevant  end-use check records, but some UAV-related checks may not have been  captured in the queries. However, we determined that the agencies\u2019 end- use monitoring data is sufficiently reliable to provide a reasonable  estimate of the number and types of checks performed by the two  agencies.", "To analyze DOD\u2019s transfers of UAV technology via the Foreign Military  Sales (FMS) program, we obtained from the Defense Security  Cooperation Agency (DSCA) a breakdown of the number, country, and  type of UAV technology transferred during fiscal years 2005 through  2010. To produce this data, DSCA developed a query of its 1200 system  to identify relevant FMS transfers involving UAV technology. We also  obtained Golden Sentry UAV-related end-use monitoring data from DSCA  for the same period.", "To ensure the accuracy of the information contained in appendix III, we  provided a copy of this appendix to Israeli government officials, who  provided technical comments. We have incorporated their comments as  appropriate.", "DOD, State, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of  Investigation, and the Central Intelligence Agency deemed some of the  information in our February 2012 report as classified, which must be  protected from public disclosure. Therefore, this report omits sensitive  information about efforts by countries of concern and terrorists to obtain  and use sensitive UAV technology, as well as details about the U.S.  proposals that the multilateral regimes did not adopt.

For this reason,  this appendix provides additional information about these changes.  According to Israeli officials we spoke with, in general, the changes are  designed to encourage more interagency coordination and to facilitate  enhanced enforcement of export control laws.", "In July 2006, Israel established a single export control agency within the  Ministry of Defense, named the Defense Export Control Agency (DECA).  DECA is responsible for reviewing and consequently approving or  denying applications for licenses that involve items, technologies, know- how, and services which are considered under the definition of defense  exports.", "According to Israeli officials and documents, in cases where a license  application involves purely military items or dual-use items that are  destined for a military end-user, DECA bears full responsibility, although it  is required to consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In these  instances, the licensing process is a two-stage process with a marketing  license preceding the export license. In cases of applications involving  dual-use items destined for a civilian end-user, the Israeli Ministry of  Industry, Trade, and Labor bears the responsibility, while consulting with  DECA. In these cases, the licensing mechanism is a one-stage process,  as it includes the issuance and granting of the export license alone.", "According to Israeli officials and documents, for license applications in  which DECA bears full responsibility, a mechanism was established  within the Ministry of Defense to coordinate the review of these licenses.  This includes the establishment of advisory committees. In addition, a  technical committee called the \u201cMTCR Committee\u201d reviews license  applications involving possible technologies controlled by MTCR. That  committee\u2019s task is to determine whether an item is contained within an  MTCR control list and if so, what category.", "According to Israeli officials and documents, by law, DECA is solely  responsible for enforcing export control directives and regulations. Within  the framework of that responsibility, DECA is often assisted by Israeli  Customs, which in practice, enforces most of the directives and  regulations. In addition, DECA is responsible for conducting outreach to  companies that export military and dual-use items, technologies, know- how, or services.", "According to Israeli officials that we spoke with, Israel also adopted export  control legislation to control the export of both military and dual-use items,  technologies, know-how, and services. According to Israeli documents, in  July 2007, the Israeli Parliament enacted a new Defense Export Control  Law, which entered into force in December of that year. This law elevated  the importance of export controls in several ways, according to Israeli  officials. For instance, Israeli officials stated that the law established a  requirement for Israeli exporters to register before applying for any export  control license and to create a new position within the company\u2014director  of export control. According to Israeli officials, the law also established  periodic reporting, record-keeping, and inspection requirements; provided  for new administrative penalties such as fines, suspensions, and  revocations of licenses; and strengthened criminal penalties for those  found violating the law. Moreover, according to Israeli documents, the  Defense Export Control Law led the Ministry of Defense to establish  separate lists of controlled technologies\u2014one based on the MTCR  Annex, two based on the Wassenaar munitions and dual-use lists, and a  third dual-use list for transfers to the Palestinian Authority.", "The lists of controlled technologies are updated annually in two ways,  according to Israeli officials. First, DECA meets with MTCR and  Wassenaar Arrangement officials in outreach sessions conducted by the  two regimes. The outreach sessions are designed in part to inform key  countries that are not MTCR or Wassenaar Arrangement members about  control list changes agreed to by member countries, according to  Wassenaar Arrangement officials. In addition, DECA meets with export  control counterparts from the United States, United Kingdom, Germany,  and other countries, according to Israeli officials.", "With respect to license application approvals, the Israeli government  typically imposes certain conditions, according to Israeli government and  industry officials. For instance, DECA requires manufacturers to obtain re- export approval for all controlled components not made in Israel from the  country of origin as a pre-condition for considering a license application.  In addition, DECA typically imposes certain license conditions, for  instance, requiring end-users to sign an end-use or end-user certificate.  According to Israeli government officials, approved licenses often state  that technology cannot be transferred to a third party without authorization  from DECA.", "According to Israeli government officials and documents, with respect to  license applications involving UAV technology, the Israeli government  typically imposes additional licensing conditions as well. For instance,  license applications must specify under which MTCR category the UAV  falls, if any. According to Israeli government and industry officials, for  MTCR Category I UAVs such as the Heron TP, the Israeli government  has adopted a \u201cpresumption of denial\u201d standard. In instances where  authorization is eventually given to export a Category I UAV, it is limited  to MTCR member countries only. In cases where authorization is granted  to export an MTCR Category II UAV, these may be marketed or sold to  MTCR nonmember countries only as long as they provide a declaration  that they fully adhere to MTCR controls."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, the following staff made key  contributions to this the report: Joseph A.
