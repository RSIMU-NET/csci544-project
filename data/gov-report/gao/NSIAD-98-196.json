The President also has the authority to remove or revise those controls as U.S. concerns and interests change. In doing so, the President is not required under U.S. law to conduct a foreign availability analysis.", "In 1995, as a continuation of changes begun in the 1980s, the executive branch reviewed export controls on computer exports to determine how changes in computer technology and its military applications should affect U.S. export control regulations. In announcing its January 1996 change to HPC controls, the executive branch stated that one goal of the revised export controls was to permit the government to tailor control levels and licensing conditions to the national security or proliferation risk posed at a specific destination.", "A key element of the executive branch review of HPC export controls was a Stanford University study, jointly commissioned by the Commerce and Defense Departments. Among other things, the study was tasked to provide an assessment of the availability of HPCs in selected countries and the capabilities of those countries to use HPCs for military and other national security applications. The study concluded that (1) U.S.-manufactured computer technology between 4,000 and 5,000 millions of theoretical operations per second (MTOPS) was widely available and uncontrollable worldwide, (2) U.S.-manufactured computer technology up to 7,000 MTOPS would become widely available and uncontrollable worldwide by 1997, and (3) many HPC applications used in U.S. national security programs occur at about 7,000 MTOPS and at or above 10,000 MTOPS. The study also concluded that it would be too expensive for government and industry to effectively control the international diffusion of computing systems with performance below 7,000 MTOPS, and that attempts to control computer exports below this level would become increasingly ineffectual, would harm the credibility of export controls, and would unreasonably burden a vital sector of the computer industry. The study also raised concerns about the ability to control HPC exports in the future in light of advances in computing technology.", "The export control policy implemented in January 1996 removed license requirements for most HPC exports with performance levels up to  2,000 MTOPS\u2014an increase from the previous level of 1,500 MTOPS. The policy also organized countries into four \u201ccomputer tiers,\u201d with each tier after tier 1 representing a successively higher level of concern to U.S. security interests. The policy placed no license requirements on tier 1 countries, primarily those in Western Europe and Japan. Exports of HPCs above 10,000 MTOPS to tier 2 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Central and Eastern Europe would continue to require licenses. A dual-control system was established for tier 3 countries, such as Russia and China. For these countries, HPCs up to 7,000 MTOPS could be exported to civilian end users without a license, while exports at and above 2,000 MTOPS to end users of concern for military or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction reasons required a license. Exports of HPCs above 7,000 MTOPS to civilian end users also required a license. HPC exports to terrorist countries in tier 4 were essentially prohibited. (See appendix II for details on the four-tier system of export controls.)", "The January 1996 regulation also made other changes. It specified that exporters would be responsible for (1) determining whether an export license is required, based on the MTOPS level of the computer; (2) screening end users and end uses for military or proliferation concerns; and (3) keeping records and reporting on exports of computers with performance levels of 2,000 MTOPS. In addition to the standard record-keeping requirements, the regulation added requirements for the date of the shipment, the name and address of the end user and of each intermediate consignee, and the end use of each exported computer. The Fiscal Year 1998 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 105-85) modified the policy for determining whether an individual license is required and now requires exporters to notify the Commerce Department of any planned sales of computers with performance levels greater than 2,000 MTOPS to tier 3 countries. The government has 10 days to assess and object to a proposed HPC sale. The law also now requires Commerce to perform post-shipment verifications (PSV) on all HPC exports with performance levels over 2,000 MTOPS to tier 3 countries.

The study itself identified as a major limitation, its inability to assess capabilities of countries of concern to use HPCs for their military programs or national security applications, on the basis that such information was not available, and recommended that such an assessment be done. The study noted that trends in HPC technology development could affect U.S. security and the ability to control HPC exports in the future and need to be further studied.

However, these officials could not explain nor provide documentation as to how the executive branch arrived at the decision to set the license requirements for exports of HPCs to tier 3 countries for military or proliferation end users at 2,000 MTOPS, even though the study concluded that computing power below 4,000 or 5,000 MTOPS was already \u201cuncontrollable.\u201d", "The study identified the following six factors as affecting controllability of HPCs: computer power, ease of upgrading, physical size, numbers of units manufactured and sold, sources of sales (direct sales or through resellers), and the cost of entry level systems. It described uncontrollability as the relationship between the difficulty of controlling computers and the willingness of government and industry to meet the costs of tracking and controlling them. The study asserted that as U.S. HPCs were sold openly for 2 years, their export would become uncontrollable. Part of the study\u2019s rationale was that, as older HPCs are replaced by newer models 2 years after product introduction, original vendors may no longer have information on where replaced HPCs are relocated. The study also presumed a level of \u201cleakage\u201d of computers to countries of concern from U.S. HPC sources and asserted that costs of controlling such leakage were no longer tolerable. However, the study did not attempt to calculate or specify those costs. In addition, the study suggested only vague thresholds for these six factors to determine \u201cuncontrollability.\u201d For example, it noted that the threshold at which it becomes difficult to track numbers of units could vary from 200 to several thousand.

According to the study\u2019s principal author, data on other countries\u2019 use of HPCs for military and other national security purposes was insufficient to make such assessments because the U.S. government does not gather such data in a systematic fashion. The report recommended that such an analysis be done.", "Despite the study\u2019s limitations and recommendations to gather better data in the future on other countries\u2019 use of HPCs for military and other national security purposes, the executive branch raised the MTOPS thresholds for HPC export controls and established the four-tier export control structure. The former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Counterproliferation Policy explained that because DOD was not tasked to conduct a threat assessment, it did not do so. Instead, the executive branch assessed countries on the basis of six criteria and assigned them to a particular tier. The six criteria were (1) evidence of on-going programs of national security concern, including proliferation of weapons of mass destruction with associated delivery systems and regional stability and conventional threats; (2) membership in or adherence to non-proliferation and export control regimes; (3) an effective export control system, including enforcement and compliance programs and an associated assessment of diversion risks; (4) overall relations with the United States; (5) whether U.N. sanctions had been imposed; and (6) prior licensing history.", "Prior to the executive branch\u2019s decision to change computer thresholds, scientists at Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratories and other U.S. government officials had accumulated information to show how countries of concern could use HPCs to facilitate the design of nuclear weapons and to improve advanced nuclear weapons in the absence of tests of nuclear explosives. However, this information was not used as part of the decisionmaking process for revising HPC export controls, according to the Commerce Department. In December 1997 the House Committee on National Security directed the DOE and DOD to assess the national security impacts of exporting HPCs with performance levels between 2,000 and 7,000 MTOPS to tier 3 countries. In June 1998, 2 and 1/2 years after the executive branch revised HPC export controls, DOE concluded its study on how countries like China, India, and Pakistan can use HPCs to improve their nuclear programs.", "According to the DOE study, the impact of HPC acquisition depends on the complexity of the weapon being developed and, even more importantly, on the availability of high-quality, relevant test data. The study concluded that \u201cthe acquisition and application of HPCs to nuclear weapons development would have the greatest potential impact on the Chinese nuclear program\u2014particularly in the event of a ban on all nuclear weapons testing.\u201d Also, the study indicated that India and Pakistan may now be able to make better use of HPCs in the 1,000 to 4,000 MTOPS range for their nuclear weapons programs because of the testing data they acquired in May 1998 from underground detonations of nuclear devices. The potential contribution to the Russian nuclear program is less significant because of its robust nuclear testing experience, but HPCs can make a contribution to Russia\u2019s confidence in the reliability of its nuclear stockpile. An emerging nuclear state is likely to be able to produce only rudimentary nuclear weapons of comparatively simple designs, for which personal computers are adequate. We were told that DOD\u2019s study of national security impacts had not been completed as of September 1, 1998, in part because the Department had not received requested information from the Commerce Department until after July 1."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Advances in Computing Technology May Pose Long-Term Security Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The Stanford study noted that trends in HPC technology development may pose security and export control challenges and recommended further study to determine their implications for national security and export controls.", "The technology trends of concern include other countries\u2019 ability (1) to upgrade the performance of individual computers and (2) to link individual computers to achieve higher performance levels. The Stanford study team reviewed the computer industry\u2019s technological advances in parallel processing and concluded that such advances as \u201cscalability\u201d and \u201cclustering\u201d contributed to the uncontrollability of high performance computing worldwide and are inevitably reducing the effectiveness of U.S. export controls. \u201cScalability\u201d refers to the capability to increase computer performance levels of a system by adding processor boards or by acquiring increasingly powerful microprocessors. \u201cClustering\u201d refers to connecting many personal computers or workstations to achieve higher computing performance in a network of interconnected systems, working cooperatively and concurrently on one or several tasks.", "Scalability and clustering offer opportunities to increase computer power without the need to develop custom-built single processors traditionally used in HPCs. Some types of HPCs are designed today to allow scalability without the need for vendor support or even knowledge. As a result, some HPCs could be exported below MTOPS thresholds without an individual license, and, in theory, later covertly scaled up to levels that exceed the threshold. We asked government agencies for information about diversions and violations of U.S. HPC export controls, but they provided no evidence that countries of concern have increased the computing power of U.S. exported machines in violation of export restrictions.", "We found no U.S. government reviews of alternatives to address these security concerns, although authors of the Stanford study and others with whom we spoke identified various options that could be assessed.

In fiscal year 1997, Commerce approved 42 license applications for HPC exports, and denied 6. The remainder of the applications in each year were withdrawn without action. Changes in the numbers of both licensed and unlicensed exports might not be attributed entirely to the change in export controls. However, we did note some characteristics of U.S. HPC exports since the revision. For example, while HPC exports increased to each tier from January 1996 through September 1997, 72 percent of machines were sold to tier 1 countries. Also during this period, 77 HPCs were exported to China and 19 were exported to India, all without individual licenses.

Under current law, Commerce is required to conduct PSVs for all HPC exports over 2,000 MTOPS to tier 3 countries. While PSVs are important for detecting and deterring physical diversions of HPCs, PSVs, as traditionally conducted, do not verify computer end use. Also, some countries do not allow the United States to conduct them. China, for example, had not allowed PSVs, but in June 1998, it reportedly agreed to do so.", "U.S. government officials agreed that the way PSVs of computers have been traditionally conducted have reduced their value because such PSVs establish only the physical presence of an HPC. However, this step assures the U.S. government that the computer has not been physically diverted. According to DOE laboratory officials, it is easy to conceal how a computer is being used. They believed that the U.S. government officials performing the verifications cannot make such a determination, partly because they have received no computer-specific training. Although it is possible to verify how an HPC is being used through such actions as reviewing internal computer data, this would be costly and intrusive, and require experts\u2019 sophisticated computer analysis.", "Another limitation of PSVs concerns sovereignty issues. Host governments in some countries of greatest concern, notably China, have precluded or restricted the U.S. government\u2019s ability to conduct PSVs.

It relies largely on HPC exporters for end use monitoring and may require them or the end users to safeguard the exports by limiting access to the computers or inspecting computer logs and outputs. The end user may also be required to agree to on-site inspections, even on short notice, by U.S. government or exporting company officials, who would review programs and software used on the computer, or to remote electronic monitoring of the computer. Commerce officials stated that they may have reviewed computer logs in the past, but do not do so anymore, and said that they have not conducted any short notice visits, and that they do not do remote monitoring.

Using the EAA\u2019s general description of foreign availability as our criteria, our analysis showed that subsidiaries of U.S. companies dominate the overseas sales of HPCs. These companies primarily compete against one another with limited competition from foreign suppliers in Japan and Germany. We also obtained information on the capability of certain tier 3 countries to build their own HPCs and found it to be limited in the capability to produce machines in comparable quantity, quality, and power as the major HPC-supplier countries.", "The EAA describes foreign availability as goods or technology available without restriction to controlled destinations from sources outside the United States in sufficient quantities and comparable quality to those produced in the United States so as to render the controls ineffective in achieving their purposes. We found that the only global competitors for general computer technology are three Japanese companies, two of which compete primarily for sales of high-end computers\u2014systems sold in small volumes and performing at advanced levels. Two of the companies reported no HPC exports to tier 3 countries, while the third company reported some exports on a regional, rather than country, basis. One German company sells HPCs primarily in Europe and has reported several sales of its HPCs over 2,000 MTOPS to tier 3 countries. One British company said it is capable of producing HPCs above 2,000 MTOPS, but company officials said it has never sold a system outside the European Union.", "A 1995 Commerce Department study of the HPC global market showed that American dominance had prevailed at that time, as well. The study observed that American HPC manufacturers controlled the market worldwide, followed by Japanese companies. It also found that European companies controlled about 30 percent of the European market and were not competitive outside Europe.", "The other countries that are HPC suppliers to countries outside Europe also restrict their exports. The United States and Japan since 1984 have been parties to a bilateral arrangement, referred to as the \u201cSupercomputer Regime,\u201d to coordinate their export controls on HPCs. Also, both Japanand Germany, like the United States, are signatories to the Wassenaar Arrangement, which has membership criteria of adherence to non-proliferation regimes and effective export controls. Each country also has national regulations that generally appear to afford levels of protection similar to U.S. regulations for their own and for U.S.-licensed HPCs. For example, both countries place export controls on sales of computers over 2,000 MTOPS to specified destinations, according to German and Japanese government officials. However, foreign government officials said that they do not enforce U.S. reexport controls on unlicensed U.S. HPCs. In fact, a study of German export controls noted that regulatory provisions specify that Germany has no special provisions on reexport of U.S.-origin goods. According to German government officials, the exporter is responsible for knowing the reexport requirements of the HPC\u2019s country of origin. We could not ascertain whether improper reexports of HPCs occurred from tier 1 countries.", "Because some U.S. government and HPC industry officials consider indigenous capability to build HPCs a form of foreign availability, we examined such capabilities for tier 3 countries. Available information indicates that the capabilities of China, India, and Russia to build their own HPCs still lag well behind that of the United States, Japan, and European countries. Although details are not well-known about HPC developments in each of these tier 3 countries, most officials and studies showed that each country still produces machines in small quantities and of lower quality and power compared to U.S., Japanese, and European computers. For example,", "China has produced at least two different types of HPCs, called the Galaxy and Dawning series, based on U.S. technology and they are believed to have a performance level of about 2,500 MTOPS. Although China has announced its latest Galaxy at 13,000 MTOPS, U.S. government officials have no confirmation of this report. India has produced a series of computers called Param, which are based on U.S. microprocessors and are believed by U.S. DOE officials to be rated at about 2,000 MTOPS. These officials were denied access to test the computer\u2019s performance.", "Russia\u2019s efforts over the past three decades to develop commercially viable HPCs have used both indigenously-developed and U.S. microprocessors, but have suffered from economic problems and a lack of customers.

Moreover, the study did not analyze the capabilities of countries of concern to use HPCs to further their military programs or engage in nuclear proliferation, but rather recommended that such data be gathered and such analysis be made. Despite the limitations of the study, the executive branch revised the HPC export controls. Since the executive branch\u2019s stated goals for the revised HPC export controls included tailoring control levels to security and proliferation risks of specific destinations, it becomes a vital factor to determine how and at what performance levels specific countries would use HPCs for military and other national security applications and how such uses would threaten U.S. national security interests in specific areas.

Our report agreed with the study\u2019s treatment of technological changes in the computing industry and that advances in computing technology may pose long-term security and controllability challenges.", "Commerce commented that our analysis of foreign availability as an element of the controllability of HPCs was too narrow, stating that foreign availability is not an adequate measure of the problem. Commerce stated that this \u201cCold War concept\u201d makes little sense today, given the permeability and increased globalization of markets. We agree that rapid technological advancements in the computer industry have made the controllability of HPC exports a more difficult problem; however, we disagree that foreign availability is an outdated Cold War concept that has no relevance in today\u2019s environment. While threats to U.S. security may have changed, they have not been eliminated. Commerce itself recognized this in its March 1998 annual report to the Congress which stated that \u201cthe key to effective export controls is setting control levels above foreign availability.\u201d Moreover, the concept of foreign availability, as opposed to Commerce\u2019s notion of \u201cworldwide\u201d availability, is still described in EAA and the Export Administration Regulations as a factor to be considered in export control policy.", "Commerce also commented that the need to control the export of HPCs because of their importance for national security applications is limited. It stated that many national security applications can be performed satisfactorily on uncontrollable low-level technology, and that computers are not a \u201cchoke point\u201d for military production. Commerce said that having access to HPCs alone will not improve a country\u2019s military-industrial capabilities. Commerce asserted that the 1995 decision was based on research leading to the conclusion that computing power is a secondary consideration for many applications of national security concern. We asked Commerce for its research evidence, but none was forthcoming. The only evidence that Commerce cited was contained in the Stanford study.", "Moreover, Commerce\u2019s position on this matter is not consistent with that of DOD. DOD, in its Militarily Critical Technologies List, has determined that high performance computing is an enabling technology for modern tactical and strategic warfare and is also important in the development, deployment, and use of weapons of mass destruction. High performance computing has also played a major role in the ability of the United States to maintain and increase the technological superiority of its war-fighting support systems. DOD has noted in its High Performance Computing Modernization Program annual plan that the use of HPC technology has led to lower costs for system deployment and improved the effectiveness of complex weapons systems. DOD further stated that as it transitions its weapons system design and test process to rely more heavily on modeling and simulation, the nation can expect many more examples of the profound effects that the HPC capability has on both military and civilian applications. Furthermore, we note that the concept of \u201cchoke point\u201d is not a standard established in U.S. law or regulation for reviewing dual-use exports to sensitive end users for proliferation reasons.", "In its comments, DOD said that the Stanford study was just one of many sources of information and analysis used in the 1996 executive branch decision. We reviewed all of the four sources of information identified to us by DOD, DOE, State, Commerce, and Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) officials as contributing to their assessment of computer export controls. However, the Stanford study was a key analytical study used in the decision-making process and the only source whose findings were consistently and repeatedly cited by the executive branch in official announcements, briefings, congressional testimony, and discussions with us in support of the HPC export control revision.", "In its comments, DOD stated that our report inaccurately characterized DOD as not considering the threats associated with HPC exports. DOD said that in 1995 it \u201cconsidered\u201d the security risks associated with the export of HPCs to countries of national security and proliferation concern. What our report actually states is that (1) the Stanford study did not assess the capabilities of countries of concern to use HPCs for military and other national security applications, as required by its tasking and (2) the executive branch did not undertake a threat analysis of providing HPCs to countries of concern. DOD provided no new documentation to demonstrate how it \u201cconsidered\u201d these risks. As the principal author of the Stanford study and DOD officials stated during our review, no threat assessment or assessment of the national security impact of allowing HPCs to go to particular countries of concern and of what military advantages such countries could achieve had been done in 1995. In fact, the April 1998 Stanford study on HPC export controls by the same principal author also noted that identifying which countries could use HPCs to pursue which military applications remained a critical issue on which the executive branch provided little information.", "In its comments, the Department of State disagreed with our presenting combined data on HPC exports to China and Hong Kong in appendix III because the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 calls for the U.S. government to treat Hong Kong as a separate territory regarding economic and trade matters. While, in principle, we do not disagree with State, it should be noted that we reported in May 1997 that given the decision to continue current U.S. policy toward Hong Kong, monitoring various indicators of Hong Kong\u2019s continued autonomy in export controls becomes critical to assessing the risk to U.S. nonproliferation interests.Our presentation of the combined HPC export data for China and Hong Kong is intended to help illustrate a potential risk to U.S. nonproliferation interests regarding HPCs should Hong Kong\u2019s continued autonomy in export controls be weakened. We believe that monitoring data on HPC exports to Hong Kong becomes all the more important since Hong Kong is treated as a tier 2 country, whereas China is a tier 3 country.", "Commerce also provided technical comments which we have incorporated as appropriate. Commerce and DOD written comments are reprinted in appendixes IV and V, respectively, along with our evaluation of them.", "ACDA provided oral comments on this report and generally agreed with it. However, it disagreed with the statement that \u201caccording to the Commerce Department, the key to effective export controls is setting control levels above the level of foreign availability of materials of concern.\u201d ACDA stressed that this is Commerce\u2019s position only and not the view of the entire executive branch. ACDA said that in its view (1) it is difficult to determine the foreign availability of HPCs and (2) the United States helps create foreign availability through the transfer of computers and computer parts.", "Our scope and methodology are in appendix I.

We also visited representatives of these companies\u2019 foreign subsidiary offices from China, Germany, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, and the United Kingdom to review end use screening procedures and documentation for selected exports. In addition, we visited selected HPC sites in China and Russia. However, the Chinese government refused us permission to visit one of three requested sites in Beijing.

We met with major U.S. HPC companies in the United States, as well as with their overseas subsidiaries in a number of countries we visited in 1998, to discuss foreign HPC manufacturers that the U.S. companies considered as providing foreign availability and competition. We found few. Throughout Europe and Asia, U.S. computer subsidiary officials stated that their competition is primarily other U.S. computer subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, Japanese companies. Our information does not support Commerce\u2019s position on all of these manufacturers. For example, our visit to government and commercial sources in Singapore indicated that the country does not now have the capabilities to produce HPCs. We asked Commerce to provide data to support its assertion on foreign manufacturers, but we received no documentary support. In addition, although requested, Commerce did not provide documentary evidence to confirm its asserted capabilities of India\u2019s HPCs and uses. 3. Commerce stated that policy makers did not receive DOE information prior to the revision of the HPC controls in 1995 and, further, there is current disagreement within DOE over the contribution that HPCs make to nuclear programs in countries of concern. We agree that Commerce did not obtain available information on this issue from DOE laboratories, although such information was available and provided to us upon request. In addition, we found no dissent or qualification of views identified in DOE\u2019s official study on this matter. 4. Commerce stated that worldwide availability of computers indicates that there is a large installed base of systems in the tens of thousands or even millions. Commerce further stated that license requirements will not prevent diversion of HPCs unless realistic control levels are set that can be enforced effectively. While we agree, in principle, that increasing numbers of HPCs makes controllability more difficult, a realistic assessment of when an item is \u201cuncontrollable\u201d would require an analysis of (1) actual data, (2) estimated costs of enforcing controls, and (3) pros and cons of alternatives\u2014such as revised regulatory procedures\u2014that might be considered to extend controls. Such an analysis was not done by the executive branch before its 1995 decision. In addition, Commerce provided no documentary evidence for its statement that there is a large installed base of HPCs in the millions. 5.
