About 8,800 of these payees had received $421 million in payments, yet had failed to file a tax return for these years. In addition, about $20 billion in payments that were reported to IRS on 170,000 information returns for 2000 and 2001 included invalid vendor TINs. This was due in part to the fact that few federal agencies use IRS's TIN-matching program, as use of this program is optional. IRS has acted to aid federal agencies in complying with annual information return filing requirements. In August 2003, IRS notified federal agencies about information returns filed for 2001 that included invalid vendor TINs and the need for agencies to withhold a portion of future payments if the vendors fail to provide a valid TIN. IRS is also in the process of making the TIN-matching program available online. IRS does not currently have a program to identify and follow up with federal agencies that fail to file required annual information returns for vendor payments. Improvements to IRS's Payer Master File, which contains general information on all payers who file information returns, would be necessary for such a program. In addition, although the Central Contractor Registration is intended for use as a central source of valid vendor information by all federal agencies, it contains some invalid TINs. Due to statutory restrictions, all vendor TINs in this database cannot currently be validated through the IRS TIN-matching program, but options exist to address this problem."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies pay billions of dollars each year to vendors for services,  such as compensation paid to individuals that are not employees and  medical and health care payments.

This enables IRS to  determine whether the vendor has reported all of the income on the tax  return.  Alternatively, if there is no corresponding return with the same TIN  and name control as that entered in the IRMF, IRS can determine that the  vendor is a potential nonfiler.  However, if the TIN entered in the IRMF is  invalid, IRS is unable to use the information to detect either underreporting  or nonfiling on the part of a vendor.", "Since 1997, IRS has had a TIN-matching program that federal agencies can  use to verify the accuracy of TIN/name combinations furnished by federal  payees.  This program was intended to reduce the number of notices of  incorrect TIN/name combinations issued for backup withholding by  allowing agencies the opportunity to identify TIN and name discrepancies  and to contact payees for corrected information before issuing an annual  information return, such as a Form 1099 MISC.  Monthly, federal agencies  can submit a batch of TIN/name combinations to IRS for verification.

In addition, the CCR could become, as OMB intends, a  central source for valid vendor information, including TINs.  Currently,  CCR TIN data are not always accurate.  Except for current statutory  restrictions on the use of IRS\u2019s TIN-matching program, the CCR\u2019s  administrator, DOD, could use IRS\u2019s new online TIN-matching program to  routinely verify the TINs of all vendors as they are added to the CCR and  then periodically thereafter.  This would carry out OMB\u2019s desire for the  CCR to be a central source of valid vendor information and would thereby  avoid each agency independently verifying TINs for some of the same  vendors.  Asking vendors to permit DOD to routinely verify their TINs  when they register to do business with the federal government would be  one option to enable DOD to verify TINs in the CCR against IRS\u2019s records.   Alternatively, OMB and IRS could determine whether an exception to  section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code should be requested.", "In the absence of the CCR as a valid source of TINs, agencies must  individually and voluntarily use IRS\u2019s TIN-matching program to validate  vendor TINs.

IRS\u2019s new  online TIN-matching program and publicity IRS plans as it launches the  new system later this year may make officials more aware of the program  and increase their use of it.  However, until OMB is able to realize its intent  of having the CCR be a valid source of information for federal vendors,  additional assurance could be gained that agencies would use the matching  program if OMB required them to do so.  Because IRS has made the system  available online, fulfilling such a requirement should now be easier than in  the past."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that federal agencies file Forms 1099 MISC for payments to  vendors for services provided, we recommend that the Commissioner of  Internal Revenue   ensure the accuracy of identification information concerning federal  payers in IRS\u2019s Payer Master File and   develop a program to periodically identify federal agencies that fail to  file Forms 1099 MISC and follow up to determine why the forms were  not filed.", "To minimize duplicate agency effort in validating vendors\u2019 TINs and to  reinforce the anticipated role of the Central Contractor Registration as the  single validated source of vendors doing business with the federal  government, we also recommend that the Commissioner of Internal  Revenue and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget  consider options to routinely validate all vendor TINs in the CCR and to  then require all agencies to use vendor and TIN information from the CCR  for their Forms 1099 MISC.  If this proves to be infeasible, OMB should  require each agency to validate TINs for vendors who provide services  through IRS\u2019s TIN-matching program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received written comments on a draft of this report from the  Commissioner of Internal Revenue (see app. IV) and the Under Secretary of  Defense (Comptroller) (see app. V).", "The Commissioner agreed with our recommendations.  However, he also  emphasized that agencies may not wish to spend the resources to  effectively use IRS\u2019s TIN-matching program and that IRS cannot compel  agencies to meet their Form 1099 MISC reporting responsibilities.", "To ensure the accuracy of identification information concerning federal  payers included in IRS\u2019s Payer Master File, the Commissioner agreed to  perform periodic reviews of the database to ensure its accuracy.  In  addition, as part of an education-compliance program geared to federal  agencies that IRS is in the process of developing, the Commissioner stated  that IRS plans to contact federal agencies to identify and verify that all TINs  used by each agency have been properly identified, thus compiling an  accurate list of all federal agency payer TINs.", "To identify federal agencies that fail to file Forms 1099 MISC and the  reasons why the forms were not filed, the Commissioner agreed to  compare the above mentioned list of federal agency payer TINs to the  Payer Master File to identify agencies that did not file Forms 1099 MISC  and to then contact the agencies to determine if Forms 1099 MISC were  required.", "To minimize duplicate agency effort in validating vendors\u2019 TINs and to  reinforce the role of the CCR as the single validated source of vendors  doing business with the federal government, the Commissioner agreed that  IRS will work with DOD to ensure that vendor TINs on the CCR are  accurate, to include exploring the expanded use of the TIN-matching  program to validate all TINs included in the CCR.", "In addition to commenting on the report recommendations, the  Commissioner pointed out that IRS Policy Statement P-2-4, which provides  that federal agencies are not subject to penalties and interest for failure to  comply with Form 1099 MISC filing requirements, is based on a 1978 GAO  Comptroller General Decision (B-161457).  This decision states that agency  appropriations are not available for payment of interest and penalties.  The  Commissioner noted that if an agency does not wish or is unable to comply  with its Form 1099 MISC reporting responsibilities, there is nothing that  IRS can do but rely on voluntary compliance on the part of the agency.", "Although we agree that IRS cannot compel agencies to meet their Form  1099 MISC reporting responsibilities, we believe implementing our  recommendations will better ensure that agencies do so.  For instance, by  bringing to agencies\u2019 attention that they are not filing the required  information returns, IRS can help educate agencies about their reporting  responsibilities.  Further, by improving the validity of TINs in the CCR, IRS,  working with OMB, can make it easier for agencies to comply.", "The Commissioner also stated that a number of federal agencies indicated  that they have been unable to use IRS\u2019s TIN-matching program because  their financial reporting systems were incompatible with the TIN-matching  program and that the cost to make agency systems compatible would be  prohibitive.  If IRS and DOD are able to arrange validation of TINs included  in the CCR via the TIN-matching program as we recommend, this would  eliminate the need for individual agencies to use the TIN-matching  program.  In the event that IRS and DOD are unable to work out such an  arrangement, IRS\u2019s online TIN-matching program, which can be accessed  via the Internet using a desk-top workstation, may be an effective  alternative to agencies making substantial changes to their financial  accounting systems.", "The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) did not directly say he  agreed with our recommendation, but indicated that efforts currently  underway to improve the accuracy of TINs in the CCR for both DOD and all  other federal agencies mirror our recommendation for IRS and OMB to  consider options to routinely validate all vendor TINs in the CCR and to  require all agencies to use vendor and TIN information from the CCR for  their Forms 1099.  The Under Secretary pointed out that the mandated use  of the CCR throughout the federal government coupled with IRS\u2019s online  TIN-matching program should enable DOD to establish a basic level of  validation in the near term, perhaps as soon as the second quarter of fiscal  year 2004.", "The Under Secretary also pointed out that the Defense Finance and  Accounting Service has been working with payment card companies, such  as VISA and Master Card, to improve the process for reporting payments  made via payment cards.  As a result, DFAS expects a significant increase  in the number and dollars reported for the card programs on Forms 1099  for calendar year 2003.  We commend these efforts to address the long- standing problem of obtaining necessary vendor information from payment  card companies.  Coupled with IRS\u2019s proposal to enable payment card  companies to act on behalf of cardholder/payers in soliciting, collecting,  and validating vendor information, including TINs, these efforts should go a  long way in addressing this problem.", "On November 26, 2003, we also received oral comments from  representatives of OMB's Offices of Federal Procurement Policy and  Federal Financial Management.  OMB generally agreed with our  recommendation.  Accordingly, OMB agreed to develop and issue a  memorandum to federal agencies directing them to validate TINs by using  the TIN-matching program or the CCR.  In addition, OMB agreed to work  with IRS and the CCR to ensure agencies are provided the necessary  information to use either of the methods recommended.  Although we  believe that either using IRS\u2019s TIN-matching program or validating TINs in  the CCR can be effective means for ensuring that agencies include valid  TINs on their Forms 1099 MISC, using the CCR as the primary source of  valid TINs would reinforce OMB\u2019s intention that the CCR become the  government\u2019s central source of contractor data and would minimize  duplicate effort among agencies in validating TINs.  Therefore, we  encourage OMB to pursue use of the CCR as the primary option for  agencies to obtain valid TINs.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Ranking Minority Member,  House Committee on Ways and Means; Ranking Minority Member,  Subcommittee on Oversight, House Committee on Ways and Means; and  the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, Senate Committee on  Finance.

Of these, we further identified the number and dollar value  associated with invalid TINs that IRS was able to correct via its TIN  validation program, as well as those that remained invalid because IRS was  unsuccessful in correcting them.", "To determine whether federal agencies take steps to ensure that  information on the returns, particularly TINs, is valid, by using IRS\u2019s TIN- matching program to validate vendor TINs or initiate backup withholding  on future payments to vendors that have submitted invalid TINs, we sent a  survey to the 14 federal departments about their policies and practices for  obtaining vendor TINs and filing Forms 1099 MISC.  We asked whether they  validate vendor TINs through IRS\u2019s TIN-matching program and if not, why  not.
