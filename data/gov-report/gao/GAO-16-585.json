At Los Alamos, NNSA reversed its prior decision to build a nuclear facility as part of the CMRR project after spending $450 million. The facility was to provide analysis equipment needed to support the production of pits as part of nuclear weapons life extension programs. Instead, NNSA approved a revised CMRR project to install plutonium analysis equipment in existing facilities.", "Senate report 113-44 includes a provision for GAO to review NNSA's revised CMRR project. GAO's report assesses (1) the extent to which the revised CMRR project is expected to meet plutonium analysis needs, (2) how its cost and scope compare to the previously approved project, and (3) the extent to which its schedule and cost estimates reflect best practices, among other objectives. GAO reviewed project documentation, assessed cost and schedule estimates against GAO-identified best practices, and interviewed NNSA and DOE officials and CMRR contractor representatives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Energy's (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) defined requirements for the revised Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement (CMRR) project to provide plutonium analysis equipment at its Los Alamos site but did not specify the capacity for analyzing plutonium that the project should provide, making it possible that the project would not meet plutonium analysis needs. NNSA policy states that project requirements should include key performance parameters, which describe how well a project will perform its functions, expressed in terms such as processing rate or capacity. However, NNSA did not identify a key parameter that addresses a primary function of the project's analysis equipment\u2014to analyze plutonium in support of producing an essential part of a nuclear weapon, known as a pit. NNSA has determined that it needs sufficient analysis capacity to support producing pits, including at planned rates of 10 pits per year in 2024 and 50 to 80 pits per year by 2030, but an NNSA analysis shows that the revised CMRR project may not support these rates. NNSA officials said the project's requirements do not include a pit production-related parameter because NNSA only tasked the CMRR project with replacing analysis equipment used in an aging facility, regardless of analysis capacity. Not identifying this parameter likely contributed to the project potentially not providing sufficient analysis capacity to support planned pit production and may have contributed to different understandings among senior agency officials about how well the project will support pit production. By identifying a pit production-related parameter that describes the analysis capacity that the revised CMRR project is to provide, NNSA could clarify the extent to which the project will support such pit production.", "NNSA's total estimated cost for the revised CMRR project is lower than the cost of the previously approved CMRR project, which included a large nuclear facility, but NNSA may have overstated its cost savings. NNSA's estimated savings from cancelling the previously approved nuclear facility did not account for work that the agency deferred to future projects, including a storage vault and tunnel. NNSA's approach for the revised CMRR project allows costs to be spread out over time, improving NNSA's ability to concurrently fund other work. However, the revised CMRR project includes less scope and is likely to provide less plutonium analysis capacity than the previously approved nuclear facility.", "The revised CMRR project schedule and cost estimates only partially met best practices. For example, the schedule did not include most of the work needed to complete the project. According to best practices, agencies should develop and maintain a schedule that contains all necessary work activities, but the revised project's schedule was limited to near-term work ending in 2017. When NNSA created the revised CMRR schedule, DOE did not specifically require projects to maintain complete schedules after project approval. Since then, DOE has issued a memorandum directing that all schedules contain the entire scope of work, but NNSA does not plan to develop a complete schedule for the entire CMRR project until mid-2017. Continuing to rely on a partial schedule limits managers' insight into how current activities might affect future completion dates, including NNSA's goal to end plutonium work in an aging facility at Los Alamos."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making seven recommendations to NNSA, including that it identify a pit production-related parameter for the revised CMRR project and develop a CMRR project schedule that includes all necessary work activities.

In recent years, NNSA has spent billions of dollars designing  and partially constructing several one-of-a-kind major capital asset  projects (i.e., facilities with an estimated cost of $750 million or more),  only to later reassess alternatives for each project in the wake of  significant cost increases and schedule delays. In some cases, the  reassessments led to NNSA\u2019s cancellation of an entire project or major  portions thereof, as we found in the case of the Chemistry and Metallurgy  Research Replacement (CMRR) project at NNSA\u2019s Los Alamos National  Laboratory in New Mexico.", "In 2005, NNSA approved the CMRR project to replace the aging  Chemistry and Metallurgy Research facility that had supported Los  Alamos\u2019s plutonium work since the 1950s. Plutonium work at Los  Alamos contributes to multiple DOE and NNSA program missions,  including NNSA\u2019s mission to maintain the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons  stockpile. Meeting NNSA\u2019s stockpile mission includes certifying the safety  of existing nuclear weapons\u2019 plutonium pits and producing new pits to  extend the life of nuclear weapons in the stockpile, and NNSA conducts  plutonium analysis in the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research facility to  support these efforts. NNSA\u2019s Fiscal Year 2016 Stockpile Stewardship  and Management Plan stated that the agency will increase its capability  to produce new pits over time, from 10 pits per year in fiscal year 2024 to  30 pits per year in fiscal year 2026 and as many as 50 to 80 pits per year  by 2030.", "A set of aging facilities provides the backbone of NNSA\u2019s plutonium work  at Los Alamos. The 64-year-old Chemistry and Metallurgy Research  facility at Los Alamos houses unique equipment for analyzing plutonium  through various techniques, including analytical chemistry and materials  characterization. NNSA uses plutonium analysis to run tests on existing  nuclear weapon pits to ensure their reliability and safety and to support  other activities, including efforts to dismantle surplus nuclear weapons.  Analytical chemistry, in particular, supports nuclear weapon pit  production, because it allows scientists to assess the plutonium used in  new pits to identify any defects. However, the Chemistry and Metallurgy  Research facility, which was built in 1952, is not sustainable in the long  term, because of its aging infrastructure and because it sits on a seismic  fault line, which raises concerns about the safety and security of the  public and those who work with plutonium at the facility in the event of an  earthquake. NNSA produces pits in a separate facility at Los Alamos\u2014 Plutonium Facility 4\u2014the only high-hazard, high-security, fully operational  plutonium facility in the country for producing pits. Plutonium Facility 4  has been in operation for 38 years and also supports other DOE and  NNSA programs\u2019 work with plutonium, such as producing heat sources for  space exploration used by the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA).", "When NNSA approved the CMRR project in 2005, the project included  the design and construction of two new facilities at Los Alamos\u2014a large  nuclear facility and a combination radiological laboratory and office  building (radiological lab)\u2014to house plutonium analysis equipment that  would replace the analysis equipment that remained in the Chemistry and  Metallurgy Research facility. NNSA planned to install most of the  plutonium analysis equipment in the CMRR nuclear facility. In 2005  NNSA estimated that the two facilities would be completed by 2017, with  a cost ranging from $745 million to $975 million. NNSA constructed the  radiological lab and within it installed a set of plutonium analysis  equipment in 2013, for a total cost of about $400 million. In March 2012,  we found that NNSA\u2019s cost estimate for the CMRR nuclear facility, which  remained in the preliminary design phase after nearly 7 years, had  increased to as much as $5.8 billion, and included an operational date as  late as 2022. Also in 2012, after spending more than $450 million, NNSA  deferred the remaining design and construction of the CMRR nuclear  facility for at least 5 years, stating that the deferral was intended to free  up funds for other higher priority projects, including the Uranium  Processing Facility in Tennessee. In a March 2013 memorandum, the  NNSA Administrator directed the agency to conduct an analysis to  compare the deferred CMRR nuclear facility with other options to meet  near- and long-term plutonium requirements, including a modular facility  concept that could be built in phases to meet additional capacity needs or  new mission requirements. NNSA also committed to ending plutonium  operations in the aging Chemistry and Metallurgy Research facility by the  end of 2019, given the safety concerns. In September 2013, we found  that deferring construction of the CMRR nuclear facility could create a  gap in the nation\u2019s plutonium analysis capabilities if NNSA ended  operations in the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research facility before it  established them elsewhere. In particular, we found that the delay in  establishing new plutonium analysis capabilities could affect Los  Alamos\u2019s ability to produce nuclear weapon pits.", "In January 2014, NNSA\u2019s Office of Defense Programs, responsible for  implementing NNSA\u2019s stockpile mission, adopted a new strategy for  maintaining the ability to perform plutonium analysis and providing  plutonium infrastructure without constructing the CMRR nuclear facility.  The strategy included two parts: (1) maximizing the use of existing space  in two facilities at Los Alamos\u2014the radiological lab and Plutonium  Facility 4\u2014by purchasing and installing plutonium analysis equipment in  them to support ending plutonium operations in the Chemistry and  Metallurgy Research facility and (2) evaluating options to build an  undetermined number of modular nuclear facilities to add more high- hazard, high-security laboratory space at Los Alamos.", "In August 2014, DOE formally cancelled plans to construct the CMRR  nuclear facility and approved the implementation of the first part of  NNSA\u2019s new plutonium strategy\u2014the revised CMRR project. The revised  CMRR project contained two subprojects: (1) the Radiological Laboratory  Utility Office Building Equipment Installation Phase 2 subproject, which  would involve purchasing and installing more plutonium analysis  equipment in the radiological lab than NNSA originally planned, and  (2) the Plutonium Facility 4 Equipment Installation subproject, which  would involve removing contaminated equipment that was no longer in  use in Plutonium Facility 4 and installing new plutonium analysis  equipment. NNSA estimated that the revised CMRR project would cost  from $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion and be completed by 2024. In addition, in  November 2015, DOE approved the mission need for the implementation  of the second part of the strategy: to build modular nuclear facilities to  add more high-hazard, high-security laboratory space at Los Alamos (the  Plutonium Modular Approach). NNSA estimated that the Plutonium  Modular Approach could cost from $1.5 billion to $3.0 billion and be  completed by the end of 2027.", "In light of concerns about NNSA\u2019s long-term plutonium plans given the  decision not to construct the CMRR nuclear facility at Los Alamos, the  Senate Armed Services Committee report accompanying S. 1197, the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, includes a  provision for us to review the cost estimate for NNSA\u2019s modular building  strategy.

In 2015, NNSA\u2019s contractor at Los Alamos conducted an analysis,  calculating the pit production rate that the revised CMRR project\u2019s  analysis equipment was expected to support, based on the amount of  equipment, location, and the amount of plutonium allowed in the  radiological lab and Plutonium Facility 4. The contractor\u2019s analysis  showed that the revised CMRR project, as approved at CD-1 in  August 2014, may not provide sufficient analysis capacity to support a  10-pits-per-year production rate. Although NNSA previously  demonstrated that it could produce up to 10 war reserve pits per year at  Los Alamos, the pits were produced in Plutonium Facility 4 with support  from the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research facility. However, according  to contractor representatives, the radiological lab has stricter limits on the  amount of plutonium allowed in it than the Chemistry and Metallurgy  Research facility does, so supporting pit production in Plutonium Facility 4  with the radiological lab limits analysis capacity to support pit production.", "Not identifying a key performance parameter related to pit production in  the requirements document may have also contributed to different  understandings of how the project will meet critical mission requirements.  For example, NNSA and DOE management officials we interviewed have  drawn their own, widely different conclusions about the extent to which  the revised CMRR project will support pit production. One NNSA official  involved in overseeing the project told us that the analysis equipment that  will be installed under the revised CMRR project would provide the  analysis capacity to support a production rate of 30 pits per year. A senior  NNSA official said the project would provide the same capabilities as the  previously approved CMRR project that included the nuclear facility but  said that he was not aware of the revised CMRR project\u2019s expected  analysis capacity. A senior DOE official said that, when he reviewed the  CD-1 documentation and participated in meetings regarding the  August 2014 CD-1 approval for the revised CMRR project, he was not  aware that the project was needed to support pit production, and another  DOE official responsible for reviewing the project said the revised project  would support a production rate of about 10 pits per year.", "We have previously found that poorly defined, incomplete, or missing  requirements make it difficult to hold projects accountable, result in  programs or projects that do not meet user needs, and can result in cost  and schedule growth. Notably, the memorandum approving CD-1 for the  revised CMRR project states that one of the main reasons that the CMRR  nuclear facility experienced significant cost and schedule growth was  because of poorly defined requirements for the facility. By updating the  program requirements document for the revised CMRR project to identify  a key performance parameter that describes the plutonium analysis  capacity that the revised CMRR project is required to provide to support  specific pit production rates, NNSA could clarify the extent to which the  project will support planned pit production, better enabling the agency to  identify whether it will need to acquire additional plutonium analysis  equipment or space by other methods."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NNSA Is Pursuing Actions to Increase Analysis Capacity", "paragraphs": ["Even though NNSA did not identify pit production rates in a key  performance parameter in the program requirements document for the  revised CMRR project to support, the agency has taken steps since the  August 2014 CD-1 approval that may increase the plutonium analysis  capacity that the project will provide. For example, although the 2015  contractor analysis determined that the revised CMRR project as  approved in August 2014 may not support a 10 pits-per-year production  rate, the analysis also found that the project could support such a  production rate at project completion in 2024 if the contractor successfully  implements efforts to increase the efficiency of working in the radiological  lab. These efforts involve potentially increasing the project\u2019s analysis  capacity by reducing the amount of plutonium used in each analysis, in  turn allowing scientists to conduct more analyses at a time. According to  contractor representatives we interviewed, they have not determined if  these efforts will be successful.", "NNSA has initiated another action that could increase the plutonium  analysis capacity that the revised CMRR project will provide, according to  contractor documents. In November 2015, DOE approved a restructuring  of the revised CMRR project by splitting the Plutonium Facility 4  Equipment Installation subproject, one of the two subprojects that  comprised the revised CMRR project when it was approved in  August 2014, and adding a new subproject that would upgrade the  radiological lab from a radiological facility to a Hazard Category 3 nuclear  facility. Upgrading the radiological lab, according to NNSA and  contractor documents, would involve (1) renovating the radiological lab to  accommodate higher levels of plutonium, and (2) installing and operating  a set of plutonium analysis equipment in the radiological lab that was  otherwise slated to go into Plutonium Facility 4 as part of the revised  CMRR project. In May 2015, NNSA and its contractor conducted a  business case analysis of the upgrade that stated that the benefits of  increasing work performed in the radiological lab instead of in Plutonium  Facility 4 include increased operational efficiency and therefore increased  analysis capacity. In addition, the business case analysis stated that the  proposal offers the benefit of avoiding using the high-hazard, high- security space in Plutonium Facility 4 for analysis operations that do not  need that level of safeguarding. According to the separate 2015  contractor analysis, conducting more plutonium analysis in the  radiological lab instead of in Plutonium Facility 4\u2014if combined with  successful efforts to reduce the amount of plutonium used in each  analysis\u2014would likely increase the project\u2019s plutonium analysis capacity  enough to support a 30-pits-per-year production rate. In a best case  scenario, the analysis found the project might be able to support  production at 80 pits per year.", "NNSA\u2019s efforts to increase the plutonium analysis capacity of the revised  CMRR project, however, may create risks for meeting the project\u2019s  estimated cost and schedule. NNSA and DOE officials told us that the  agency has not increased an existing facility\u2019s hazard category before  and that NNSA is working to identify all of the steps that will be involved in  upgrading the radiological lab to a Hazard Category 3 nuclear facility.  Also, the May 2015 business case analysis described some of the risks  associated with the upgrade, some of which carry potentially significant  cost and schedule effects if realized. For example, the business case  analysis stated that it is possible that a forthcoming nuclear safety  analysis could require modifying the building\u2019s ventilation system or  increasing the safety rating of the gloveboxes used in the radiological lab  for handling plutonium. The business case analysis found that requiring  such modifications could negatively affect the upgrade\u2019s schedule  because, for example, the contractor has already started procuring  gloveboxes for the radiological lab and changing their safety rating would  require modifying the procurement or the gloveboxes themselves. Also,  project costs could increase to the point where NNSA might decide it is  not affordable to pursue the upgrade. If NNSA does not pursue the  upgrade or the upgrade does not result in increasing the revised project\u2019s  analysis capacity enough to support pit production rates of 50 to 80 pits  per year by 2030 to support life extension programs, NNSA officials told  us they do not currently have an alternate plan for acquiring and locating  the remaining analysis equipment needed to support those production  rates. Given the uncertainty surrounding the revised CMRR project\u2019s  ability to support pit production rates of 50 to 80 pits per year, having a  plan for providing sufficient analysis capacity may better enable NNSA to  meet its pit production plans and support planned life extension programs  critical to the agency\u2019s modernization efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA Is Not Designing the Revised CMRR Project to Directly Meet Plutonium Analysis Needs of All DOE and NNSA Programs at Los Alamos", "paragraphs": ["Even considering the actions that NNSA is pursuing to increase analysis  capacity, the agency is designing the revised CMRR project to meet the  Office of Defense Programs\u2019 plutonium analysis needs for its stockpile  management mission and not the analysis needs of other NNSA and  DOE programs that conduct plutonium analysis work at Los Alamos. This  is counter to the revised CMRR project\u2019s requirements document for  CD-1. More specifically, the first project requirement states that the  revised CMRR project must provide infrastructure and equipment needed  to support program offices with missions assigned to Los Alamos that  involve plutonium analysis operations, including stockpile support and  national security and science stewardship. As stated, this requirement  appears to include all DOE and NNSA program offices with plutonium  analysis needs assigned to Los Alamos, including but not limited to the  needs of the program sponsor\u2014the Office of Defense Programs\u2014and  also other program offices, including the NNSA Office of Defense Nuclear  Nonproliferation\u2019s ARIES and the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy\u2019s Office  of Space and Defense Power Systems.

They said that, as the project sponsor, it is Defense  Programs\u2019 requirements that will dictate the specific analysis equipment  to include in the project\u2019s scope of work. Officials we interviewed with  ARIES and the Office of Space and Defense Power Systems said they  are not customers of the revised CMRR project and that they did not  provide input about their plutonium analysis requirements to inform the  revised CMRR project\u2019s program requirements document. The Space and  Defense Power Systems officials said that they have acquired dedicated  plutonium analysis equipment to meet their plutonium analysis needs  separately at Los Alamos, and the ARIES officials said they have moved  most of their plutonium analysis work to another site but that they may  seek to increase their analysis work at Los Alamos in the future if their  mission changes.", "Contractor representatives explained that they included programs outside  of Defense Programs in the revised CMRR project\u2019s program  requirements document to be comprehensive and show that the project  may support customers beyond Defense Programs.

In commenting on a draft of this report,  contractor representatives stated that the justification for the Plutonium  Modular Approach is \u201csomewhat nebulous\u201d because the mission need is  based on the need to extend the life of Plutonium Facility 4 rather than on  meeting specific program needs. Extending the life of Plutonium Facility 4  may be worthwhile, but by defining key performance parameters and  program-specific requirements before conducting the analysis of  alternatives, NNSA would have better information about program-specific  requirements to inform its analysis and to provide a clearer basis for  selecting a project alternative at CD-1.", "Conducting the analysis of alternatives for the Plutonium Modular  Approach without considering program-specific requirements may  negatively affect programs that currently use space in Plutonium  Facility 4.

NNSA officials and contractor representatives told us  that plutonium-238 activities is a top candidate to move into a modular  facility if the goal is to extend the life of Plutonium Facility 4.

These  officials told us that they were not involved in discussions regarding the  mission need for the project and that they had not heard about NNSA\u2019s  potential plan to move plutonium-238 equipment out of Plutonium  Facility 4. They said that NNSA\u2019s projected 2027 operational date for new  modular facilities could directly impede the office\u2019s ability to meet NASA\u2019s  future needs. They also said that if NNSA determines it needs to move  the plutonium-238 equipment out of Plutonium Facility 4 to reduce risks,  the Office of Space and Defense Power Systems may seek options for  housing their equipment at another site rather than move into a new  modular facility at Los Alamos."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mission Need Prematurely Identified a Specific Solution", "paragraphs": ["NNSA\u2019s mission need statement for the Plutonium Modular Approach  may not provide NNSA with the flexibility to explore a variety of  alternatives without limiting potential solutions because it prematurely  identified a specific solution for the project, contrary to DOE Order  413.3B. According to the order, at CD-0 NNSA must develop statements  of mission need that do not identify a particular solution such as  equipment, facility, or technology. However, NNSA\u2019s mission need  statement identifies a specific type of facility\u2014high-hazard, high-security  laboratory space.

We recommended that NNSA incorporate  best practices into its analysis of alternatives requirements to minimize  the risk of developing unreliable analyses of alternatives and incurring  major cost increases and schedule delays on projects. DOE agreed with  our recommendation and in May 2016, the agency included language in  an update to Order 413.3B directing that analyses of alternatives be  conducted consistent with our published best practices.

In internal  documents used to present information to senior decision makers as they  considered approving CD-1 for the revised CMRR project, DOE and  NNSA stated that cancelling the nuclear facility portion of the previously  approved CMRR project and approving the revised CMRR project would  save billions of dollars. For example, in an August 2014 slide presentation  to DOE\u2019s acquisition advisory board, NNSA reported that the total cost of  its previously approved CMRR project\u2014consisting of designing and  constructing both the radiological lab and the nuclear facility, and  installing equipment in both\u2014would have reached up to approximately  $7 billion.

More specifically:", "The revised CMRR project will likely provide less analysis  capacity than the previously approved CMRR project. Before  NNSA deferred construction of the CMRR nuclear facility, NNSA\u2019s  contractor at Los Alamos estimated that the nuclear facility could  support production of 40 pits per year in Plutonium Facility 4, and  found that supporting 80 pits per year would require additional  equipment and staff. NNSA reported that it expected the nuclear  facility to support the production of up to 80 pits per year. In contrast,  as discussed earlier, the 2015 contractor analysis determined that the  revised project, as approved at CD-1 in August 2014, may not support  the production of 10 pits per year and that the agency needs to  successfully implement efforts to increase the project\u2019s analysis  capacity to support production rates of 10 pits per year and 30 pits per  year. In a best case scenario, the project might be able to support an  80-pits-per-year rate, according to the contractor\u2019s analysis. NNSA\u2019s  statement that the revised CMRR project replaces the CMRR nuclear  facility is based on the revised project providing the same analysis  \u201ccapabilities\u201d as the planned nuclear facility but not the same analysis  capacity. NNSA uses the term capability to refer to specific types of  analysis techniques, such as radiochemistry. For example, according  to NNSA\u2019s contractor at Los Alamos, the revised project will install a  set of plutonium analysis capabilities that is roughly comparable to the  set of capabilities that was planned for the nuclear facility. However,  contractor representatives added that, although the set of analysis  capabilities is comparable, the analysis capacity is likely to be less  because it is less efficient to conduct plutonium analysis in Plutonium  Facility 4 and the radiological lab than it would have been in the  CMRR nuclear facility.", "The revised CMRR project includes less work scope than the  previously approved CMRR project. The CMRR nuclear facility was  to include, among other things: a 31,100 square foot nuclear material  storage vault; a 12,800 square foot tunnel system for secure transfer  of materials between Plutonium Facility 4, the nuclear facility, and the  radiological lab; and 7,200 square feet for staging waste drums before  they were to be shipped for disposal. The revised CMRR project  does not include the storage vault, tunnel, or a new waste staging  area. In its CD-1 documentation for the revised CMRR project, NNSA  stated that it eliminated these scope elements because they were not  needed at the time. However, NNSA also stated that it will eventually  need a tunnel connecting Plutonium Facility 4 to the radiological lab  and the future modular nuclear facilities and a waste staging area and  that although the need for a new storage vault has been delayed, it  has not necessarily been eliminated. As a result, removing these  scope elements from the revised CMRR project may result in a  reduction of the CMRR project\u2019s total cost, but it may not represent a  net cost savings to the agency or the taxpayer, because some scope  elements that were removed will need to be constructed eventually.", "NNSA\u2019s calculations did not include costs associated with the  modular facilities. NNSA stated in the revised CMRR project\u2019s CD-1  documentation that the overall strategy for maintaining plutonium  operations at Los Alamos without the CMRR nuclear facility consists  of both the revised CMRR project and the Plutonium Modular  Approach. The documentation mentioned that building new modular  nuclear facilities will accommodate activities that are not included in  the revised CMRR project or that are needed to facilitate the project.  Therefore, without including some costs associated with the  Plutonium Modular Approach, any cost savings calculations from  cancelling the CMRR nuclear facility are likely to be overstated.", "According to NNSA officials and contractor representatives, NNSA\u2019s  cancellation of the previously approved CMRR project\u2019s nuclear facility  may yield benefits in terms of an improved funding profile. These officials  and representatives explained that one benefit of pursuing the revised  CMRR project and the Plutonium Modular Approach lies in improving the  agency\u2019s ability to fund the two projects. They said that although the total  cost to build a set of modular nuclear facilities is not necessarily less than  building one large nuclear facility, acquiring smaller nuclear facilities over  time may be more affordable because NNSA can spread out the facilities\u2019  effect on the budget over a greater period of time. However, we found in  our March 2016 report on NNSA\u2019s modernization plans and the budget  estimates to implement these plans that the total costs of NNSA\u2019s  plutonium infrastructure strategy at Los Alamos included in the plans  were uncertain and may be underestimated because NNSA had not  determined the number of modular facilities that may be required.

According to schedule  documentation, these activities represent about 7 percent of the total  remaining project, by cost. Specifically, these activities were scheduled to  end in 2017 at an estimated cost of approximately $134 million. In  contrast, the project\u2019s entire scope of work is not scheduled to end until  2024 at an approximate cost of up to $2 billion.", "An NNSA project team member said the team did not maintain the  integrated master schedule after CD-1 because, in general, they do not  update a CD-1 schedule until they develop the project\u2019s schedule  baseline before CD-2. NNSA directed contractor team members to create  the project\u2019s updated schedule based on a plan\u2014finalized in September  2014\u2014to implement the project through CD-2. Project team members  said that the updated schedule was sufficient for managing the project  until CD-2. Project team members also said limiting the updated schedule  to short-term work allows them to focus attention on near-term, critical  activities as they manage and execute the project. At the time of the  revised CMRR project\u2019s CD-1 approval in August 2014, Order 413.3B  directed agencies to develop project schedules before multiple critical  decisions, but the order did not specify when, and if, projects should  create and maintain an integrated master schedule. By maintaining a  schedule that is limited to short-term work ending in 2017, however,  NNSA and its contractor have limited insight into how current  performance affects completion dates beyond 2017, including completing  the first subproject to install analysis equipment in the radiological lab in  December 2019\u2014in support of ending operations in the Chemistry and  Metallurgy Research facility\u2014and completing the rest of the revised  CMRR project by 2024.", "Subsequent to approving CD-1 in August 2014, DOE updated its direction  to project managers for developing and maintaining integrated master  schedules.

In  May 2016, DOE incorporated these policies into an update to  Order 413.3B. Project team members said that they are creating a new  project schedule to support the revised CMRR project\u2019s first CD-2  decision scheduled to occur by the end of September 2016, but according  to an NNSA project team member, this schedule will be limited to  activities estimated to end in 2019, primarily involving the installation of  equipment in the radiological lab and, to a lesser extent, in Plutonium  Facility 4. As a result, this new schedule may not meet the criteria for an  integrated master schedule and may not conform to the May 2016 update  to Order 413.3B. NNSA plans to approve additional schedule baselines at  a second CD-2 decision in mid-2017 for the remaining portions of the  project, including activities needed to support upgrading the radiological  lab to a Hazard Category 3 nuclear facility and installing most of the  analysis equipment planned for Plutonium Facility 4. An NNSA project  team member said that the remaining portions will be added to the overall  project schedule estimate once their schedule baselines are approved at  the second CD-2 decision. By using this approach, however, NNSA will  not develop an integrated master schedule that includes all activities until  the second CD-2 decision in mid-2017. Without developing and  maintaining an integrated master schedule that includes all project  activities under all subprojects prior to approving the first CD-2 decision  for the revised CMRR project, NNSA does not have reasonable  assurance that it has a mechanism for measuring progress and  identifying potential problems in meeting schedule milestones for the  revised CMRR project.

This analysis determines the level of confidence that the agency can have  in whether it will meet its estimated completion dates, typically expressed  as a percentage. For example, an agency may learn from a schedule risk  analysis that it can have 70 percent confidence that it will finish the  project by the estimated completion date. For the revised CMRR project,  NNSA reported that it created an \u201caggressive\u201d schedule to finish its first  subproject by the end of 2019 to support ending plutonium operations in  the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research facility. However, because NNSA  did not conduct a schedule risk analysis, the agency does not have  information about the level of confidence associated with meeting the first  subproject\u2019s estimated completion date, and therefore cannot determine if  that date is reasonable.", "Instead of a schedule risk analysis, the CMRR project team completed a  different kind of analysis called a risk assessment to support the  August 2014 CD-1 approval decision, but this assessment minimally met  best practices for a schedule risk analysis. The risk assessment provided  information about, among other things, the potential effects of selected  technical and programmatic risks on the schedule but was less  comprehensive than a schedule risk analysis. The project team told us  that they did not conduct a schedule risk analysis because they did not  have sufficient detail about activities in the schedule, including those that  would occur beyond CD-2. However, according to best practices, a  schedule risk analysis can be performed on a summary version of the  schedule if some activities are not well defined.", "We previously found weaknesses in the schedule risk analysis that NNSA  conducted on the previously approved CMRR project\u2019s schedule. In  March 2012, immediately after NNSA deferred construction of the CMRR  nuclear facility, we found that NNSA\u2019s schedule risk analysis did not  include all risks identified by the project team, and we recommended that  the agency conduct a new schedule risk analysis when it resumed the  CMRR project and before establishing the schedule baseline at CD-2.  NNSA disagreed with our recommendation, stating that it would not be  prudent to update the project\u2019s schedule at that time because the agency  had just deferred the project. However, NNSA did not conduct a schedule  risk analysis when it later resumed the project in 2014. Project team  members told us that they plan to complete separate schedule risk  analyses before each CD-2 decision for the revised CMRR project.  According to the Secretary of Energy\u2019s June 2015 memorandum on  project management and the May 2016 update to Order 413.3B, NNSA is  to develop project schedules consistent with the methods and best  practices found in our schedule guide; these best practices include  conducting a schedule risk analysis on a complete project schedule.  Since NNSA will not create an integrated master schedule that includes  all project activities until mid-2017, the schedule risk analysis that the  agency will conduct on the portion of the project that NNSA is to approve  at the first CD-2 decision by the end of September 2016 will be limited  and may not account for all project risks. As a result, the schedule risk  analysis may provide NNSA with information about the confidence level  associated with meeting the first subproject\u2019s December 2019 completion  date, but may not provide information on the likelihood of meeting the  project\u2019s overall 2024 completion date.

NNSA\u2019s risk assessment  identified four risks to the subproject that could require from 19 to  20 months, or more, of schedule contingency if the risks are realized.  Therefore, if NNSA needs to add more than 8 days to the schedule as  contingency to mitigate risks, the subproject\u2019s completion date extends  into 2020; if NNSA needs the entire schedule contingency, the completion  date extends into 2021. Project team officials told us that they set the  completion date for the first subproject so that it would finish before the  end of 2019 to support NNSA\u2019s commitment to end plutonium operations  in the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research facility in 2019. According to  NNSA documents, the project team streamlined some activities, including  glovebox design work, to support the 2019 completion date.

We found that NNSA\u2019s cost estimate was substantially comprehensive  and well documented. For example, the estimate recorded all ground  rules and assumptions and fully defined the project\u2019s scope, including  technical characteristics and performance, design, and quality assurance  requirements, which are important for comprehensiveness. The estimate  also sufficiently described the methods used to calculate the cost of each  component of the estimate, which helps make an estimate well  documented.

Specifically, the project team generally used appropriate  estimating techniques to develop the point estimate. The team, however,  then increased the point estimate by as much as 50 percent to include  funds for management reserve. According to our cost guide,  management reserve is typically the amount of funds the contractor may  need to spend to account for uncertainty. According to best practices,  managers should use analyses, such as a risk analysis, to calculate a  project\u2019s most likely costs, and the estimate should not be overly  conservative or optimistic. Contractor project team members told us that  they set the amount of management reserve funding based on their  subject matter experts\u2019 assessments about the uncertainty related to the  project and not on a formal risk analysis.", "Similarly, contractor project team members told us that they created the  top end of the total cost range by applying the highest amount possible  under DOE guidance rather than using a risk analysis to calculate the  most likely costs. DOE guidance suggests that NNSA could have added  from 20 percent to 100 percent to the point estimate to create the top end  of the range, depending on the level of information available about the  project\u2019s scope of work. Project team members said they determined  that the highest amount possible was appropriate based on their subject  matter experts\u2019 opinion that the project carried high levels of uncertainty.  However, adding the highest amount possible above the point estimate  may increase the high end of the cost range more than necessary.  Because NNSA calculated management reserve and the total cost range  based on assumptions rather than analyses, the high end of the cost  range may overestimate the funds that will be needed and may not  provide management with reliable information to inform its decisions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cost Estimate Was Partially Credible", "paragraphs": ["We found that NNSA\u2019s cost estimate was partially credible, in part,  because NNSA did not follow the best practice to conduct a sensitivity  analysis. A sensitivity analysis quantifies the extent to which the cost  estimate could vary because of changes in key assumptions and ground  rules. Performing such an analysis increases the chance that decisions  that influence the design of the project will be made with a focus on the  elements that have the greatest effect on cost. The CMRR project team  created a document that it labeled a sensitivity analysis to support its cost  estimate, but this analysis did not follow most of the steps for conducting  a sensitivity analysis as called for by best practices. The project team  members said that they plan to conduct a sensitivity analysis to support  the baseline cost estimate at CD-2. This would be in keeping with the  Secretary\u2019s June 2015 memorandum and the May 2016 update to Order  413.3B, which direct project managers to develop cost estimates in  accordance with best practices found in our cost guide, including  sensitivity analysis.", "The cost estimate also was partially credible because NNSA did not  conduct an independent cost estimate of the revised CMRR project.  According to best practices, an independent cost estimate is generated  by an entity that has no stake in approval of the project and provides an  unbiased test of whether a project estimate is reasonable. Prior to CD-1,  DOE conducted an independent cost review of the project estimate,  which addresses a cost estimate\u2019s high-value, high-risk, and high-interest  aspects without evaluating the remainder of the estimate, as permitted  under Order 413.3B. The independent cost review identified a number of  problems with NNSA\u2019s cost estimate, such as estimation errors, and  according to DOE officials, NNSA incorporated some of the independent  cost review team\u2019s comments and recommendations prior to CD-1.  Nevertheless, an independent cost estimate is a more thorough analysis  than an independent cost review. We have previously recommended that  DOE require independent cost estimates for all major projects at CD-1 to  improve the credibility of cost estimates at this stage, but DOE has made  independent cost estimates optional at CD-1.

However, NNSA\u2019s planning for the revised CMRR  project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory indicates that the agency  still has work to do. Specifically, NNSA did not identify a type of  requirement called a key performance parameter in the revised CMRR  project\u2019s requirements document, contrary to NNSA\u2019s requirements  policy. These performance parameters are important because they define  how well a project will perform its functions, expressed in terms such as  capacity or throughput. One of the revised CMRR project\u2019s primary  functions is to provide plutonium analysis to support producing new  plutonium pits for life extension programs that are critical to NNSA\u2019s  nuclear modernization efforts. NNSA needs a sufficient amount of  plutonium analysis capacity to support the agency\u2019s pit production plans,  but it is currently unclear how well the project will support NNSA\u2019s plan to  develop the capability to produce 50 to 80 pits per year by 2030. By  updating the program requirements document for the revised CMRR  project to identify a key performance parameter that describes a pit  production rate, NNSA could clarify the extent to which the project will  support pit production plans, better enabling the agency to identify  whether it will need to acquire additional plutonium analysis equipment or  space by other methods. Also, NNSA officials told us that if the revised  CMRR project does not provide sufficient plutonium analysis capacity to  support a 50 to 80 pits-per-year rate by 2030, they do not have an  alternate plan for obtaining that capacity. Given the uncertainty  associated with the revised CMRR project supporting a 50 to 80 pits-per- year rate, having a plan for providing sufficient analysis capacity if the  revised CMRR project will not support this rate may better enable NNSA  to meet its pit production plans and support planned life extension  programs critical to the agency\u2019s modernization efforts.", "In addition, NNSA\u2019s broadly stated first requirement for the revised CMRR  project suggests that the project must meet plutonium analysis needs of  all DOE and NNSA program offices with plutonium analysis operations at  Los Alamos. However, the revised CMRR project\u2019s scope is focused on  exclusively meeting the needs of the Office of Defense Programs. Other  DOE and NNSA offices may use the plutonium analysis equipment  installed for the CMRR project, if and when it is available, but NNSA is not  including plutonium analysis equipment in the scope of the project  specifically to meet their needs. NNSA\u2019s requirements policy states that  the project\u2019s requirements should be a comprehensive set of what the  project must provide to satisfy the mission need. By updating the program  requirements document for the revised CMRR project to clarify whether  the CMRR project will provide plutonium analysis equipment to meet the  needs of DOE and NNSA programs other than those in the Office of  Defense Programs, managers and stakeholders may have a clearer  understanding of the extent to which the project will satisfy DOE and  NNSA programs\u2019 needs.", "We commend the Secretary of Energy for issuing the May 2016 update to  Order 413.3B\u2014and the June 2015 department-wide memorandum that  preceded it\u2014directing project teams to develop and maintain integrated  master schedules consistent with the best practices in our schedule  guide. Such a step is likely to improve schedule outcomes for the agency.  However, NNSA did not maintain the integrated master schedule it  created at CD-1 for the revised CMRR project, and the schedule that the  agency plans to create to support the first CD-2 decision by the end of  September 2016 may not meet the criteria for an integrated master  schedule and, therefore, may not conform to the May 2016 update to  Order 413.3B.

Also, waiting  until the second CD-2 decision in mid-2017 to create the integrated  master schedule means NNSA will not conduct a schedule risk analysis  for the entire project until then. Conducting a schedule risk analysis to  support the first CD-2 decision by the end of September 2016 may  provide NNSA with information about the level of confidence that the  agency can have in its ability to complete the first subproject by the end of  2019.

NNSA also  specifically set the project\u2019s first requirement as building no less than two  modular nuclear facilities at Los Alamos with full operating capability by  2027. By defining the mission need and requirements in terms of this  specific type of laboratory space and nuclear facility, NNSA has  effectively predetermined that it is the only alternative that can meet the  mission need and satisfy requirements.

NNSA also stated that the report incorrectly  implies that the driver for the CMRR project and the project's ultimate  success depend on meeting plutonium pit production needs when the  goal of the project is to replace specific plutonium analysis capabilities.  We state in this report that the revised CMRR project\u2019s purpose is to  provide plutonium analysis capabilities to facilitate replacing the aging  Chemistry and Metallurgy Research facility. However, we also state that,  according to NNSA documents, one of the primary functions of these  analysis capabilities is to support NNSA\u2019s efforts to produce new  plutonium pits for life extension programs that are critical to nuclear  modernization efforts. As such, the revised CMRR project plays a key role  in supporting NNSA\u2019s pit production plans. We agree that the success of  the CMRR project should not be measured in terms of actual pits  produced, but rather in terms of the plutonium analysis capacity the  project provides in support of production efforts and other stockpile  stewardship needs. As a result, we continue to believe that it is important  for the agency to be clear about how well the CMRR project will support  NNSA\u2019s pit production plans. In addition, NNSA stated that the report  does not reflect the depth and breadth of steps NNSA has taken in the  last 2 years to improve project management in accordance with the  Secretary of Energy's new policies. As we state in the report, we are  pleased with the steps that NNSA has recently taken to improve project  management, including the Secretary\u2019s new policies, and we are hopeful  that they will lead to improved outcomes.", "Concerning our recommendations, in its written comments NNSA outlined  planned actions that are responsive to two of our seven  recommendations. Specifically, the first of these two recommended that  NNSA specify plans for how the agency will obtain additional plutonium  analysis capacity if the revised CMRR project will not provide sufficient  capacity to support pit production plans. In its written comments, NNSA  stated that it will update its plutonium strategy to include estimates of the  requirements and additional means, if needed, to achieve the required  capacity. NNSA stated that this action will be completed by  September 30, 2017. The second of these two recommended that NNSA  update the CMRR program requirements document to clarify whether the  project will provide plutonium analysis equipment to meet the needs of  DOE and NNSA programs other than those in the Office of Defense  Programs. NNSA stated that it will update this document to clarify that the  project will not install any unique analysis equipment required solely for  non-defense-related programs. NNSA estimated the completion date for  this activity to be December 31, 2017, or the next planned revision of the  program requirements document.", "Regarding our other five recommendations, NNSA outlined actions  planned or taken that we do not believe are sufficiently responsive.  Specifically, regarding our recommendation that NNSA identify a key  performance parameter for the CMRR project that describes the  plutonium analysis capacity needed to support specific pit production  rates, NNSA stated that it is important to understand how the revised  CMRR project will support the agency\u2019s overall plutonium strategy,  including pit production and other NNSA programs. However, NNSA did  not agree that it would be appropriate to establish a key performance  parameter for the revised CMRR project related to supporting a specific  pit production rate. The agency stated that incorporating such a key  performance parameter would require the project to rely on factors  beyond its control to demonstrate that it had met such a performance  parameter before the project was completed. Instead, NNSA stated that it  will perform an analysis to estimate a pit production capacity range that  the project will support and include a reference to this analysis in its next  revision to the program requirements document. Although conducting this  analysis and including a reference to it in the program requirements  document may be helpful, it may not be sufficient to describe how well the  CMRR project will perform one of its primary functions\u2014conducting  plutonium analysis that is essential to supporting NNSA\u2019s pit production  activities. As a result, we continue to believe that it is important for NNSA  to define this information in a key performance parameter.", "Regarding our recommendation that NNSA develop and maintain an  integrated master schedule that includes all project activities contained  within the revised CMRR project, NNSA stated that it does not intend to  create one integrated master schedule. Instead, NNSA reiterated its  plan\u2014described earlier in this report\u2014to create a separate schedule for  each subproject as it reaches CD-2 rather than create an integrated  master schedule that includes all project efforts. NNSA stated that,  because the subprojects are minimally interdependent, there is little value  to be gained by developing an integrated master schedule for the entire  project. NNSA also stated that the subproject schedules will reflect best  practices defined in our schedule guide, including representing effort  beyond the near-term that is less well defined as planning packages. We  are pleased that DOE plans to incorporate the scheduling best practices  into the subproject schedules. However, NNSA\u2019s proposed action does  not meet the criteria for an integrated master schedule because it will not  result in a schedule that includes all activities needed to complete the  project when NNSA approves the first schedule baseline by the end of  September 2016. At that time, the project schedule will reflect work  activities only through 2019. Given that the entire CMRR project schedule  is anticipated to extend into the mid-2020s, we continue to believe that it  is necessary for NNSA to follow the best practice of creating an integrated  master schedule that reflects the entire project because it provides the  transparency needed to properly manage this complex project.", "Similarly, regarding our recommendation that NNSA conduct a  comprehensive schedule risk analysis for the revised CMRR project,  NNSA stated that, rather than conduct a risk analysis that applies to an  integrated master schedule, it would conduct separate schedule risk  analyses for each of the subproject schedules in accordance with our  schedule guide. We are pleased that NNSA will follow best practices  when conducting these analyses. Conducting individual schedule risk  analyses on each subproject schedule could provide information  regarding the level of confidence associated with meeting the subprojects\u2019  estimated completion dates. However, a comprehensive risk analysis  performed on an integrated master schedule\u2014a best practice\u2014is  important to identify threats and opportunities that may affect multiple  subprojects and the entire CMRR project.", "Regarding our recommendation that NNSA rephrase the statement of  mission need and requirements for the Plutonium Modular Approach to  be independent of a particular solution, NNSA stated that it concurs with  the recommendation. However, NNSA stated that it believes the  conclusions articulated in our report that the agency has preselected an  alternative for the Plutonium Modular Approach are incorrect and that it  initiated the analysis of alternatives process in May 2016, which was  always intended to be independent of a particular solution. We are  encouraged by NNSA\u2019s statement that it intends to conduct the analysis  of alternatives independent of a particular solution. However, we do not  believe that NNSA\u2019s actions are responsive to this recommendation  because these actions do not include rephrasing the mission need  statement and requirements. Since the mission need statement provides  the foundation on which the analysis of alternatives process is based, we  believe that continuing to define the mission need in terms of a specific  solution\u2014constructing high-hazard, high-security laboratory space\u2014 creates a potential bias against other potentially viable alternatives.", "Regarding our recommendation that NNSA identify key performance  parameters and program-specific requirements before conducting the  analysis of alternatives for the Plutonium Modular Approach, NNSA  stated in its written comments that it plans to develop initial key  performance parameters, consistent with applicable DOE policy, after it  completes the analysis of alternatives. The applicable policy, however, is  NNSA\u2019s. Under NNSA policy, NNSA is directed to define these  parameters prior to approving the mission need at CD-0 rather than after  the agency completes the analysis of alternatives, as NNSA is proposing  to do. Therefore, we continue to believe that NNSA should identify these  parameters before completing the analysis of alternatives that they have  already begun.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Energy, the Administrator of NNSA, and  other interested parties.

We interviewed  officials from the CMRR project sponsor, NNSA\u2019s Office of Defense  Programs\u2019 Office of Major Modernization Programs, and other project  stakeholders, including NNSA\u2019s Office of Acquisition and Project  Management, DOE\u2019s Office of Project Management Oversight and  Assessments, and DOE\u2019s Office of Enterprise Assessments, about the  revised CMRR project. We also interviewed Los Alamos contractor  representatives involved with the revised CMRR project during a visit to  the Los Alamos site in August 2015 and later by telephone. We then  reviewed documentation of NNSA and DOE programs\u2019 planned plutonium  analysis needs at Los Alamos, as summarized in planning documents  created by the Los Alamos contractor and as contained in the CD-1  documentation. We discussed the information in these documents with  officials from NNSA\u2019s Offices of Defense Programs and other relevant  program offices, including the NNSA Office of Defense Nuclear  Nonproliferation\u2019s Advanced Recovery and Integrated Extraction System  (ARIES) and the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy\u2019s Office of Space and  Defense Power Systems. We selected these program offices because  after the Office of Defense Programs, they conduct the most plutonium  analysis at Los Alamos.", "To determine the extent to which NNSA\u2019s Plutonium Modular Approach is  expected to meet plutonium analysis needs, we reviewed documentation  supporting DOE\u2019s November 2015 approval of the mission need (CD-0),  including the mission need statement and program requirements  document. We reviewed the mission need statement in light of DOE  Order 413.3B and accompanying DOE guidance. We interviewed NNSA  officials with the Office of Defense Programs\u2019 Office of Major  Modernization Programs\u2014the Plutonium Modular Approach sponsor\u2014 and other stakeholders, including NNSA\u2019s Office of Acquisition and  Project Management and DOE\u2019s Office of Project Management Oversight  and Assessments. We also interviewed Los Alamos contractor  representatives during our August 2015 site visit and officials with the  Office of Space and Defense Power Systems and ARIES to discuss their  involvement with the project.", "To assess how the cost and scope of NNSA\u2019s revised CMRR project  compare with those of the previously approved CMRR project, which  included the construction of a nuclear facility, we reviewed the revised  project\u2019s CD-1 documentation and noted instances where the revised  CMRR project CD-1 documentation discussed the difference between the  cost estimates for the previously approved project and the revised project,  including in the CD-1 approval memo signed by the Deputy Secretary of  Energy and in a slide presentation that NNSA provided to a DOE  acquisition advisory board. Regarding the projects\u2019 scopes of work, we  also reviewed the revised project\u2019s CD-1 documentation and noted  instances where it discussed the scope that NNSA planned to include in  the previously approved project but that the agency eliminated from the  revised project. We also reviewed an analysis conducted by the  Department of Defense\u2019s Office of Cost Assessment and Program  Evaluation that included a comparison of the scope of the CMRR nuclear  facility with the scope of the two subprojects that make up the revised  CMRR project and the Plutonium Modular Approach, and we interviewed  officials from this office about their analysis.", "To assess the extent to which the revised CMRR project schedule and  cost estimates reflect scheduling and cost-estimating best practices, we  compared the schedule and cost estimates with best practices.  Specifically, for our assessment of the revised CMRR project schedule  estimate, we used the criteria in the May 2012 GAO Schedule  Assessment Guide (schedule guide). The schedule guide identifies  10 best practices associated with effective scheduling: (1) capturing all  activities, (2) sequencing all activities, (3) assigning resources to all  activities, (4) establishing the duration of all activities, (5) verifying that the  schedule can be traced horizontally and vertically, (6) confirming that the  critical path is valid, (7) ensuring total reasonable float, (8) conducting a  schedule risk analysis, (9) updating the schedule using actual progress  and logic, and (10) maintaining a baseline schedule. We assessed an  August 2015 version of the revised CMRR project schedule that NNSA\u2019s  contractor at Los Alamos had updated since the project\u2019s August 2014  CD-1 approval. We did not assess the August 2014 project schedule  estimate that NNSA developed to support CD-1 approval, because the  agency did not provide us with an electronic copy of the CD-1 schedule,  which was necessary to conduct our analysis. NNSA provided the  August 2015 project schedule to us in two parts, one for each of the two  subprojects that make up the revised CMRR project. We assessed each  subproject\u2019s schedule estimate against the criteria in our schedule guide  and then combined the scores to create the overall schedule assessment.  For our assessment of the revised CMRR project cost estimate, we used  the criteria in the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide (cost  guide). The cost guide identifies best practices for the development of  reliable cost estimates and summarizes these best practices into four  characteristics of high-quality cost estimating\u2014comprehensive, well  documented, accurate, and credible. We reviewed the revised CMRR  project cost estimate that NNSA prepared to support the CD-1 approval in  August 2014 and assessed the extent to which it exhibited the  characteristics of high-quality cost estimating and the associated best  practices. We also reviewed the project\u2019s CD-1 documentation that  supported the cost estimate. For the schedule and cost assessments, we  interviewed members of the CMRR project team, which consisted of  NNSA officials and Los Alamos contractor representatives who helped  develop and maintain the estimates, to determine the policies and  procedures the project team had followed to develop the estimates. We  also interviewed officials with DOE\u2019s Office of Project Management  Oversight and Assessments to understand the department\u2019s schedule  and cost estimating policies and guidance, and we reviewed those  policies and guidance. After conducting our initial assessments of the  schedule and cost estimates, we shared our draft analyses with NNSA  officials and contractor representatives and obtained comments and  additional information, which we then incorporated as appropriate. We did  not assess the schedule or cost estimates for the Plutonium Modular  Approach because NNSA had not approved the estimates when we  started our review.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2015 to August 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Assessment of NNSA\u2019s Schedule Estimate for the Revised Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement Project", "paragraphs": ["When the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) approved  critical decision (CD) 1 (select alternative) for the revised Chemistry and  Metallurgy Research Replacement (CMRR) project at Los Alamos  National Laboratory in New Mexico in August 2014, the project\u2019s future  work was organized under two subprojects. The first subproject,  Radiological Laboratory Utility Office Building Equipment Installation  Phase 2, involved installing plutonium analysis equipment in the  radiological laboratory.
