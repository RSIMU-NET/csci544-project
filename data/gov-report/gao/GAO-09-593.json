GAO interviewed experts and Education officials, administered surveys to officials at state educational agencies and state agencies for higher education in the fall of 2008, and conducted site visits to three states."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Education allocates billions of federal dollars for teacher quality improvement efforts through many statutorily authorized programs that nine offices administer. Education officials said these offices share information with one another as needed, and from time to time Education has established and completed broader collaborative efforts. Yet, GAO found little sustained coordination and no strategy for working systematically across program lines. Education also has not described how it will coordinate crosscutting teacher quality improvement activities intended to support its goal of improving student achievement in its annual performance plan. Our previous work has identified the use of strategic and annual plans as a practice that can help enhance and sustain collaboration. Without clear strategies for sustained coordination, Education may be missing key opportunities to leverage and align its resources, activities, and processes to assist states, school districts, and institutions of higher education improve teacher quality. Education has conducted evaluations for some of its teacher quality programs and has awarded grants to researchers for a variety of research on teacher quality interventions, which are intended to inform policymakers and educators about program operations and which programs or interventions are having an impact. While evaluations have been done or are under way for about two-fifths of these programs, little is known about whether most of the programs are achieving their desired results. Education provides information from evaluations and also from research through the Internet and a system of regional and national providers. These providers also either conduct or synthesize research and provide assistance mainly to states and school districts. These providers coordinate among themselves and with one another in various ways. State agency officials reported through our surveys that limited resources and incompatible data systems were the greatest challenges to their collaborative efforts to improve teacher quality. State officials reported that data systems could be used to inform teacher quality policy efforts by linking student and teacher data, or linking data from kindergarten through 12th grade and the postsecondary education systems. To help address these challenges, Education provides some financial support and other assistance. For example, one $65 million program that helps states develop statewide data systems also received another $250 million in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Also, the act requires states to report on the progress they are making toward linking statewide data systems that allow matching of individual student achievement to individual teachers. This additional funding could help states defray costs associated with these efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Nationwide there are about 3 million teachers employed in approximately  14,000 public school districts with about 89,000 schools. Policymakers,  researchers, and educators have focused on improving the quality of our  nation\u2019s teachers in an attempt to raise the achievement of students in key  academic areas, such as reading and mathematics. A variety of approaches  have been taken to improve the quality of teachers, including focusing on  instructional practices. Among these approaches, improving the  qualifications of teachers is a focus of federal policy. Specifically, the No  Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLBA), which amended and reauthorized  the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), established  federal requirements that all teachers of core academic subjects be \u201chighly  qualified.\u201d This means teachers must generally have a bachelor\u2019s degree,  be fully certified, and demonstrate their knowledge of the subjects they  teach. According to the U.S. Department of Education (Education), most  teachers meet their states\u2019 requirements to be considered highly qualified  under ESEA. However, the percentage of teachers who are not highly  qualified is higher for certain populations of teachers, such as special  education teachers and teachers in high-poverty and high-minority  schools.", "ESEA as well as several other federal statutes, such as the Higher  Education Act and the Education Sciences Reform Act, authorize various  grant programs and other forms of assistance, like research, for states,  school districts, and institutions of higher education to help individuals  meet the teacher qualification requirements as well as other efforts aimed  at improving teacher quality. This funding and assistance are administered  by Education, either directly or indirectly through state and local entities.", "Student access to high-quality teachers may be affected, in part, by the  extent to which the kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) and higher  education systems work together at the federal, state, and local levels.  However, it is unclear how conducive the current configuration of entities  is to these complementary relationships. Given the importance of teacher  quality to student achievement and the role that the federal and state  governments play in this area, you asked us to address the following  questions: (1) To what extent does Education fund and coordinate teacher  quality programs? (2) How does Education target monitoring of its teacher  quality program grantees and coordinate these efforts? (3) What  evaluation and research does Education conduct on teacher quality, and  how does it provide and coordinate research-related assistance to states  and school districts? (4) What are the challenges to collaboration within  states and how does Education address these challenges?", "To conduct our work, we used a variety of methods, including interviews  with Education officials, surveys of states and the District of Columbia,  and site visits in three states. To learn about the major federal programs  supporting teacher quality efforts, we selected programs from the Guide to  U.S. Department of Education Programs 2008 and verified that these  were the relevant programs with Education officials. For each grant  program, we reviewed federal laws, nonregulatory guidance, policies,  procedure manuals, and other documentation, and interviewed officials  from a range of Education offices overseeing teacher quality programs to  determine how they coordinate program efforts as well as how they  monitor grantees. We also interviewed officials from a selection of  relevant Education-funded research organizations and related assistance  providers at the regional and national levels to understand how Education  funds and supports efforts to improve teacher quality. To learn about the  specific areas of teacher quality that state agencies are focusing on and the  challenges to collaboration within their states, we administered two  surveys between August and November 2008\u2014one to heads of state  educational agencies and another to heads of state agencies for higher  education in states and the District of Columbia using self-administered,  electronic questionnaires posted on the Internet. We received a 94  percent response rate for the state educational agency survey and a 96  percent response rate for the state agency for higher education survey. We  also conducted site visits to three states\u2014Louisiana, New Jersey, and  Oregon\u2014that were selected based on their having initiatives that focus on  teacher quality, such as coordinating bodies that are intended to bridge the  K-12 and higher education systems, and on diversity in terms of  geographic location, population, and amount of federal teacher quality  program funding. We met with state officials in each state and, to  understand the local perspective, we met with officials in at least one  school district and two universities in each state. A more detailed  explanation of our scope and methodology can be found in appendix I.  The surveys and a more complete tabulation of aggregated results can be  viewed at GAO-09-594SP.", "We conducted our work from February 2008 through July 2009 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Research points to teacher quality as an important school-level factor  influencing student learning and ultimately preparing children for their  futures as citizens and workers in a knowledge-based economy. However,  efforts to improve the quality of teachers face several challenges. One  challenge is a lack of consensus about what makes teachers effective.  Even though research demonstrates that some teachers affect their  students\u2019 academic growth more than other teachers, research has not  categorically identified the specific indicators of teacher quality, such as  the characteristics, classroom practices, and qualifications that are most  likely to improve student learning. Some researchers have shown that  with the exception of a few factors, they cannot state, with a strong degree  of certainty and consistency, which aspects of teacher quality matter most  for student learning. Another challenge is the high attrition rates and  shortages of teachers, especially in high-poverty areas. For example,  almost half of teachers leave the profession in the first 5 years of teaching,  and there is an anticipated surge in retirements of teachers from the baby  boom generation. Moreover, research has shown that many students,  especially those in high-poverty and high-minority schools, have teachers  who have limited knowledge of the subjects they teach. In addition, there  are concerns that graduates of teacher education programs are  inadequately prepared to teach to high standards and that once teachers  are in the classroom, training to help remedy this situation is sporadic and  uncoordinated.", "While many teachers follow a traditional career path of preparation  followed by ongoing professional development, there are also alternative  career paths. Many prospective teachers receive their undergraduate  degrees through teacher preparation programs administered by  institutions of higher education. Traditional teaching preparation  programs typically include field-based experience, courses in specific  subject matter, and strategies of instruction or pedagogy. Within  institutions of higher education, these prospective teachers generally learn  subject matter content in schools of arts and sciences and learn pedagogy  in schools of education. Under this traditional approach, prospective  teachers must complete all their certification requirements before  beginning to teach. Teachers may also gain certification through  alternative routes designed for prospective teachers who have been out of  the job market (e.g., stay-at-home mothers) or have a career in a different  field and who hold at least an undergraduate degree. Alternative route  candidates receive training needed to meet the certification requirements  of other teachers while teaching in the classroom. Generally, after  completing a traditional or alternative teacher preparation program,  teachers in the classroom participate in ongoing training or professional  development. Training for new and veteran teachers may differ, with some  states and school districts providing mentoring or induction programs for  new teachers. Induction for new teachers may include district- or school- level orientation sessions, special in-service training, mentoring by an  experienced teacher, and classroom observation. See figure 1 for an  illustration of the various steps in the career path for teachers.", "Entities at the local, state, and federal levels each play a role in the  preparation and ongoing professional development training of teachers.  The roles and responsibilities of these entities sometimes overlap (see  table 1). For example, about half of alternative teacher certification  programs are administered by institutions of higher education, and school  districts, state educational agencies (SEA), and other entities can also  offer alternative routes to certification.", "State agencies for higher education (SAHE)\u2014also referred to as the board  of regents or the department, commission, or council for postsecondary or  higher education\u2014can also play a role in teacher quality. These agencies  oversee state institutions of higher education where most teachers are  trained. SAHEs generally approve of new academic programs at  institutions of higher education and some may have budgetary authority.", "School districts, institutions of higher education, and states collect and  report data, which include tracking teachers\u2019 professional development  hours, maintaining records of certified teachers, tracking student test  scores and graduation rates, as well as producing teacher supply and  demand studies. These and other data are intended to inform efforts such  as improving schools, reducing student achievement gaps, and tracking  the highly qualified status of all teachers. To make better use of these data,  many states are putting in place longitudinal data systems that link data,  such as student test scores and enrollment patterns, of individuals or  groups of students over time. In addition, many states are using or have  interest in using growth models\u2014a term that refers to a variety of methods  for tracking changes in a variable over time\u2014to measure progress for  schools and for student groups or individual students. For example, one  type of model (known as a value-added model) measures students\u2019 gains  from previous test scores. GAO has reported that states with a longitudinal  data system will be better positioned to implement a growth model than  they would have been without it.", "The federal government plays an important role in education. Education\u2019s  mission is, among other things, to ensure equal access to education and  promote educational excellence throughout the nation by supporting state  and local educational improvement efforts, as well as improving  coordination and management of federal education programs. For  example, Education provides financial assistance through various formula  and competitive grant programs. Formula grants allocate federal funds to  states or school districts in accordance with a distribution formula  prescribed by statute or administrative regulation. Competitive grants are  awarded through a competitive process, whereby grant applications are  reviewed according to published selection criteria and legislative and  regulatory requirements established for the program. Education has  discretion to determine which applications best address the program  requirements and are thus worthy of funding. In addition, Education  monitors and conducts activities related to the particular program and  grantees receiving these funds. Education has eight principal offices  responsible for specific program areas. These principal offices award and  manage all grant programs for that program area. In addition, each  principal office contains several program offices that administer the day- to-day activities of one or more grant programs, such as those authorized  in Title I of ESEA (see table 2). Thirty-two program offices manage about  150 grant programs departmentwide.", "A goal of ESEA is improving student achievement so that all students will  be proficient in math and reading by 2014. To accomplish this goal,  Education has established a series of strategic objectives that include  improving teacher quality. To assess its progress in meeting this  objective, Education has established performance measures in its strategic  plan. These measures all relate to having highly qualified teachers in core  academic classes at elementary and secondary schools, including low- and  high-poverty schools. These measures are also included in Education\u2019s  annual performance plan. These plans are intended to provide a direct  linkage between an agency\u2019s longer-term goals (as defined in the strategic  plan) and what its managers and staff are doing on a day-to-day basis.", "A number of federal laws govern teacher quality. With the 2001  reauthorization of ESEA, which requires public school teachers to be  highly qualified in every core academic subject they teach, the federal  government established specific criteria for teachers. Title I of ESEA  requires every state and school district receiving Title I funds to develop  and submit a plan for how it intends to meet the teacher qualification  requirements, which is part of a broader plan outlining how it will meet  other requirements of the act such as those requiring challenging academic  content and student achievement standards. In addition, the state plan  must establish each district\u2019s and school\u2019s annual measurable objectives  for increasing the number of teachers meeting qualification requirements  and receiving high-quality professional development with the goal of  ensuring that all teachers met the requirements by the end of the 2005-2006  school year. While there is evidence that most teachers meet their states\u2019  requirements to be considered highly qualified, schools and school  districts with high student poverty rates have generally had particular  difficulty attracting and retaining highly qualified teachers; as a result,  their students are often assigned to teachers with less experience,  education, and skills than those who teach other students.", "As GAO has reported, Title II of ESEA provides states and districts with  funding to help them implement various initiatives for raising teacher and  principal qualifications. In addition, other federal laws that authorize  programs intended to influence teacher quality include the following:    The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is the primary federal law  addressing the educational needs of students with disabilities. The act, as  amended, cross-references the ESEA \u201chighly qualified\u201d teacher definition,  but unlike ESEA, this act requires that all special education teachers\u2014not  just those teaching core subjects\u2014must meet certain requirements.", "The Higher Education Act (HEA), as amended by the Higher Education  Opportunity Act, authorizes most of Education\u2019s programs targeted to  postsecondary education. Specifically, the act established discretionary  grants to prepare prospective teachers and accountability requirements for  teacher preparation programs and states. For example, it requires annual  reporting on the quality of traditional and alternative teacher preparation  programs, including the efforts of institutions of higher education to  increase the number of prospective teachers teaching in high-need areas  and being responsive to the needs of school districts.", "The Education Sciences Reform Act is intended to strengthen the principal  education research, statistics, and evaluation activities of Education.  Within Education, it established the Institute of Education Sciences, which  has a mission to provide reliable information about the condition and  progress of education in the United States, educational practices that  support learning and improve achievement, and the effectiveness of  federal and other education programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education Funds a Wide Array of Programs Intended to Improve Teacher Quality and Has Taken Some Steps to Coordinate These Programs on Occasion", "paragraphs": ["Over a third of the programs that Education administers support efforts to  improve teacher quality.

The remaining 33  programs do not have the primary purpose of improving teacher quality  and focus on other program goals or purposes, such as increasing student  access to institutions of higher education. Nevertheless, these programs  allow or require some portion of program funding to be used for teacher  quality activities.

This  formula grant is allocated primarily to school districts and may be used for  a wide variety of activities to improve teacher quality, such as providing  funding for teacher preparation, training for teachers already in the  classroom, and recruitment. In addition, states may retain approximately  5 percent of these program funds to support teacher quality efforts\u2014 generally split evenly between state educational agencies (to support  state-level teacher initiatives) and state agencies for higher education (to  support partnerships between institutions of higher education and high- need school districts that work to provide training to teachers already  teaching in the classroom).", "As shown in figure 2, 16 of the 23 programs specifically focused on teacher  quality each received less than $50 million. Nearly all of these programs  are competitive grants, and each has its own policies, applications, award  competitions, reporting requirements, and, in some cases, federal  evaluations. Furthermore, these programs are focused to support specific  activities, such as improving teachers\u2019 knowledge and understanding of  American history, recruiting midcareer professionals to teaching, or  training existing teachers in music, dance, and drama.", "As illustrated in table 3, most of the 23 programs allow funds to be used  for professional development training for teachers already in the  classroom, but many allow grantees to use funding for a range of activities  throughout a teacher\u2019s career path, such as teacher preparation, teacher  recruitment or retention, certification or licensure, and induction or  mentoring.", "The remaining 33 programs allow or require portions of their funds to be  used for teacher quality activities, but their primary focus is not on  improving the quality of teachers. Education does not routinely track  spending on teacher quality activities for nearly all of these programs.  Specifically, only 3 of these 33 programs have collected information about  the portion of funds spent on teacher-related activities. For example,  according to Education, ESEA Title I, Part A, which provides support to  programs designed to address the needs of educationally disadvantaged  children, also provided approximately $1.9 billion (or about 8 percent of  Title I, Part A funds) for spending on training for existing teachers in fiscal  year 2009. According to Education, between fiscal years 2000 and 2008,  the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education- Comprehensive Program\u2014a program supporting innovative reform  projects for improving the quality of postsecondary education and  increasing student access\u2014awarded about $82 million in grants for  teacher quality-related activities. For example, in fiscal year 2007 Western  Oregon University received a grant totaling $685,685 to support a  statewide collaboration of institutions of higher education to build the  capacity of elementary grades math and science instruction. Education  officials said the department does not collect data on expenditures for  most other programs in this category.", "In addition to the funds provided through the regular fiscal year 2009  appropriations for Education, the American Recovery and Reinvestment  Act of 2009 (the Recovery Act) provides additional funds to several of  these 56 teacher quality programs for fiscal year 2009. For example, $200  million in Recovery Act funds was provided to the Teacher Incentive  Fund, which is a competitive grant program intended to help states and  school districts design performance-based teacher compensation systems  that incorporate student performance as a factor in assessing the  effectiveness of practicing teachers. Moreover, the Recovery Act requires  that the Secretary of Education set aside $5 billion for State Incentive  Grants, referred to by Education as the Reach for the Top program, and  the establishment of an Innovation Fund. Education is providing most of  this $5 billion of funding to states for efforts that could include making  improvements in evaluating teacher effectiveness as well as ensuring that  all students have access to highly qualified and effective teachers.  Appendix II contains information on the 23 programs receiving Recovery  Act funds."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Education Has Taken Some Steps to Coordinate These Programs and Completed Broader Collaborative Efforts on Occasion", "paragraphs": ["According to Education officials, the multiple offices administering the 23  programs specifically focused on teacher quality coordinate with one  another, and on occasion the department has established and completed  broader collaborative efforts. Federal support for teacher quality is  dispersed across a wide array of grant programs in Education, with nine  program offices responsible for administering them (see table 4).  Education\u2019s program office officials said their offices take some steps to  coordinate with one another, such as participating in informal discussions  to share ideas, attending and presenting at one another\u2019s conferences, and  reviewing one another\u2019s draft grant announcements. In addition, officials  said that they have formed task groups to address broader issues and  phase them out once their tasks are complete. For example, in early 2003,  Education formed a teacher quality policy group under the auspices of the  Office of the Undersecretary of Education to coordinate multiple offices\u2019  efforts related to ESEA implementation of the highly qualified teacher  requirements. Nevertheless, in the past, GAO\u2019s and Education\u2019s Inspector  General\u2019s findings have shown that Education\u2019s programs could better  plan and coordinate to, among other things, leverage expertise and  resources as well as guide consideration of different options for  addressing potential problems among the current configuration of  programs. While Education\u2019s collaborative efforts have occurred  intermittently, several Education officials told us that they see value in  routinely working together to exchange information across the program  offices. Officials we spoke with noted that this type of sustained  coordination required support and attention from senior departmental  officials, such as formalizing the responsibilities and roles of a working  group and its members. Given that the Recovery Act provides funds to  improve teacher effectiveness, Education officials said that this presents  an opportunity to coordinate Education\u2019s resources to improve teacher  quality. Specifically, Education officials said that they recently have  initiated coordination efforts to address the Recovery Act requirements  related to teachers by forming a team made up of representatives from  several program offices and led by the Secretary\u2019s advisors.", "Education officials said that although several teacher quality programs  support similar activities, differing statutory requirements can hamper  coordination among the programs. Specifically, some officials said that  statutory barriers, such as programs with differing definitions for similar  populations of grantees, create an impediment to coordination. For  example, Education officials told us that the Mathematics and Science  Partnerships grant and the Improving Teacher Quality State (Title II, Part  A) Grant to institutions of higher education both require partnerships that  include a \u201chigh-need\u201d school district. However, while the Title II, Part A  program\u2019s authorizing legislation contains a specific statutory definition of  a high-need school district, the Mathematics and Science Partnerships  program allows states to define this term. This may hinder states\u2019 ability to  coordinate resources among these initiatives because in most states far  fewer school districts meet the Title II, Part A definition than meet the  definition that the state develops for the Mathematics and Science  Partnerships program.", "Education has not described in its annual performance plan how it will  coordinate various crosscutting teacher quality activities supporting its  goal of improving student achievement. Our previous work has identified  using strategic and annual plans as a practice that can help enhance and  sustain collaboration. As indicated in Education\u2019s strategic plan required  by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), one of  Education\u2019s primary goals is improving student achievement so that all  students will be proficient in math and reading by 2014. To accomplish this  goal, it has established improving teacher quality as a strategic objective.  However, the annual performance plan neither describes how Education  coordinates or will coordinate its teacher quality efforts nor identifies  barriers to such coordination. GPRA offers a structured means for  identifying multiple programs\u2014within and outside the agency\u2014that are to  contribute to the same or similar goals and for describing coordination  efforts to ensure that goals are consistent and program efforts are  mutually reinforcing. As GAO has previously reported, agencies can  strengthen their commitment to work collaboratively by articulating their  efforts in formal documents, such as in a planning document. We have  also reported that uncoordinated program efforts can waste scarce funds,  confuse and frustrate program customers, and limit the overall  effectiveness of the federal effort."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Offices Administering Education\u2019s Teacher Improvement Programs Use a Variety of Methods to Target Monitoring, and Education Is Beginning to Implement Mechanisms Intended to Improve and Coordinate These Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Officials we spoke with in four principal offices overseeing some of the  teacher quality improvement programs said that they use a variety of  methods and sources of information throughout the life of the grant  process to gain insight into the performance of grantees and to target  monitoring assistance accordingly. To help ensure grantee accountability  for using teacher quality program resources, monitoring begins with pre- award planning, training, and guidance to potential grantees and continues  through all phases of the award and postaward processes (i.e., a so-called  cradle-to-grave approach). For example, for the Teaching American  History program, program officials said they provide guidance to  applicants and grantees about how to develop performance measures  related to program goals so that Education can obtain credible  information on funded project outcomes from grantees. For competitive  grant programs, officials in the relevant principal offices we spoke with  said they review grantees\u2019 annual performance reports to assess whether  grantees\u2019 activities are consistent with planned objectives, with Office of  Innovation and Improvement officials saying they use a standard form to  guide their review.", "Furthermore, staff from the Office of Elementary and Secondary  Education visit each state at least once every 3 years to monitor state  efforts to meet the teacher qualification requirements and states\u2019  administration of ESEA Title II, Part A Improving Teacher Quality State  Grants. In 2008, the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education  conducted monitoring visits to 18 states and Puerto Rico, including 2 of  our 3 site visit states and provided written monitoring reports on  Education\u2019s Web site about these states\u2019 implementation of the ESEA  teacher qualification requirements. For example, Education found  instances in 2 of our site visit states of grants being awarded by state  agencies for higher education that included an ineligible partnership. In  2009 Education officials said they plan to conduct monitoring visits to 15  other states through June as part of the department\u2019s goal to monitor each  state every 3 years. In addition, Office of Special Education and  Rehabilitative Services officials said they use the results of telephone  conversations with grantees, technical assistance meetings, and  conferences to understand grantee activities.", "In addition to these methods of targeting teacher quality program grantees,  senior Education officials said that Education is beginning to implement  risk management mechanisms to help program offices, including those  administering teacher quality programs, better identify and target grantees  not in compliance with grant requirements or not meeting performance  goals. Senior Education officials said that applying risk management in  Education is a relatively new endeavor and that responsibility rests with  individual program offices for identifying risks confronting each program  and for using risk indicators. These officials said Education\u2019s risk  management approaches will continue to evolve as processes mature and  lessons are learned.", "Given that this endeavor is relatively new and that principal and program  offices tailor their monitoring to the particular teacher quality program or  grantee involved, we found that some of the program offices are further  along in developing risk indicators than others. For example, the Office of  Postsecondary Education has developed an electronic grants monitoring  system using risk-based criteria for its competitive grants. Officials we  spoke with in some of the other program offices that administer teacher  quality programs had not developed formal risk-based criteria or  electronic systems; however, as described previously, they have a means  for identifying and targeting grantees that may be at risk of noncompliance  with grant requirements or not meeting performance goals.", "Education is beginning to implement mechanisms intended to enhance as  well as coordinate these efforts, such as sharing information about  grantees. To coordinate a departmentwide risk-based management  strategy, as well as assist program offices with their monitoring efforts,  Education created the Risk Management Service. This office provides  services to program offices, such as responding to their inquiries about  policy interpretations and monitoring grants. Some program office  officials we spoke with said that the Risk Management Service alerts them  about grantees that are having problems managing other Education grants.", "As part of this effort, senior Education officials described plans for  standardizing departmentwide systems for sharing information about  grantees\u2019 management of federal funds and performance. For example,  Education is developing an automated process for enhancing its review of  the findings of financial audits, called single audits, within their  programs. As has been done in the past, this information is shared with  teacher quality program managers and others in the department.  Education officials we spoke with who are in several of the offices  overseeing teacher quality programs said they review single-audit results,  as required, to determine whether entities receiving an Education grant  may have compliance or financial management issues.

Three of the  completed evaluations\u2014those for the Early Reading First program,  Teacher Quality Partnership Grants, and one of two evaluations of the  Mathematics and Science Partnerships program\u2014provide information  about how a program focused on teacher quality is directly affecting  student achievement or how program outcomes could be indirectly  affecting student achievement through their effect on teacher quality. For  example, the impact evaluation of the Early Reading First program found  that providing scientifically based materials and professional development  to teachers had a statistically significant impact on children\u2019s ability to  recognize letters of the alphabet and to associate letters with their sounds,  but it did not have a statistically discernable impact on other aspects of  children\u2019s reading or listening skills. The outcome evaluation of the  Teacher Quality Partnership Grants found that funded partnerships that  included colleges of education, schools of arts and sciences, and school  districts led to changes in teacher preparation programs and the  development of professional development programs for veteran teachers.  The three remaining completed evaluations, which include a second  evaluation for the Mathematics and Science Partnerships program, are  process evaluations that provide information about program operations,  but they do not directly address how the program is affecting student  achievement through improved teacher quality.", "The three evaluations under way are impact or outcome evaluations.  Education officials said that for the remaining 14 programs that do not  have an evaluation under way, evaluations are not planned over the next 3  years. Of these 14 programs, 2 were initially funded in fiscal year 2008 and  another 1 in 2005, but the other 11 have been operating for at least 7 years  and have never been evaluated.", "According to Education officials, some programs may be difficult to  evaluate. In some cases federal funds are combined with state and local  funds, such as under the Improving Teacher Quality State Grants (Title II,  Part A) program, making it difficult to isolate the impact of federal funds.  While the Improving Teacher Quality State Grants program has not been  evaluated, Education has examined the implementation of teacher quality  provisions in the ESEA, primarily those related to the teacher qualification  requirements. Moreover, Education officials said that several of the  teacher quality programs are small in terms of their funding levels and as a  result, have few program-associated funds for evaluation. However, as we  have reported in the past, evaluations can be designed to consider the size  of the program and the costs associated with measuring outcomes and  collecting data.", "In addition to the federal program evaluations shown in table 5, Education  evaluates specific interventions intended to improve teacher quality. For  example, Education has conducted or has under way evaluations on  teacher induction programs, teacher preparation programs, and reading  and mathematics professional development and software programs.  Specifically, Education completed studies on the impact of professional  development on teacher practices and student achievement in early  reading as well as on teachers trained through different routes to  certification. Moreover, Education and the National Academy of Sciences  completed another study on the National Board for Professional  Standards, which offers advanced-level certification to teachers. Further,  Education officials said that they have 5 other studies under way, such as a  study on moving high-performing teachers to low-performing schools.  Interventions such as teacher induction programs and professional  development are funded under a broad array of teacher quality programs,  such as the Improving Teacher Quality State Grants, the Teacher Quality  Partnership Grants, the Transition to Teaching program, and Mathematics  and Science Partnerships. Education officials overseeing evaluations said  that to inform staff in program offices working on related issues, they  provide briefings on the results of pertinent evaluations.

State officials said that some of their objectives for  data systems are to link student and teacher data, or to link data from the  K-12 education system and the postsecondary education system, to inform  and measure teacher quality policy efforts. For example, state officials and  experts we spoke with said longitudinal data systems can be used to  measure teacher effectiveness through value-added models that estimate  existing teachers\u2019 contributions to student learning, and that these models  may also allow states to determine which teacher preparation programs  produce graduates whose students have the strongest academic growth.  For example, Louisiana officials said that although it has taken several  years, they have developed a value-added model, based on longitudinal  data, that allows them to evaluate the extent to which graduates from  teacher preparation programs improve student learning in the classroom.  However, experts, a state official, and an Education report cautioned  about using student and teacher data in value-added models for reasons  such as methodological concerns and an overemphasis on student test  scores to the exclusion of other teacher factors that may positively affect  students and schools. Moreover, senior officials from Education and state  agencies we spoke with said that some key education stakeholders have  reservations about linking student and teacher data to measure teacher  effectiveness and/or the implications for privacy. Nevertheless, several  states reported that statewide longitudinal data for the K-12 through  higher education systems can increase collaboration by enhancing  feedback loops between the K-12 and higher education systems. This  information could, for example, help state agencies address professional  development for teachers in the classroom as well as the effectiveness of  teacher preparation programs for prospective teachers.", "In addition to citing limited resources and incompatible data systems,  state agency officials reported that several other factors, such as  resistance to change, sustaining commitment, and state governance  structures pose challenges to their collaborative efforts to improve teacher  quality in their states. For example, state officials reported that different  agencies and institutions are resistant to change as a result of long-held  beliefs or difficulty in valuing new approaches to improving teacher  quality. In one instance, state officials also told us that it is hard to  maintain a sustained commitment to address teacher preparation issues  because of the volume of state initiatives focused on improving student  achievement. Another state official reported that the K-12 and  postsecondary systems have separate governance systems, a factor that,  given the different missions of each agency, limits how the two interact on  education policy. Other state officials said the number of entities playing a  role in teacher quality policy limits the state agencies\u2019 ability to collaborate  on statewide teacher quality initiatives because the state agency must  facilitate feedback from a multitude of stakeholders, which can be a time  consuming process.", "Although states face challenges to collaboration, state officials responding  to our surveys and during site visits stressed the importance of these  efforts and said that more collaboration is needed, especially to improve  professional development training for existing teachers. Our survey results  illustrate that states\u2019 teacher quality policy efforts cut across many  interrelated areas within the K-12 and postsecondary systems, such as  preservice preparation, recruitment, mentoring and induction, teacher  assessments for licensure/certification, and continued learning for veteran  teachers. State officials reported that improving teacher quality is best  achieved through several interrelated initiatives that involve the various  stakeholders within the two systems. In our survey, 22 of 48 SEA officials  and 34 of 47 SAHE officials cited a great to very great need for more  collaboration on teacher quality issues.

For example, one state official  reported that the state coordinating body facilitates open communication  among state agencies. Nevertheless, state officials reported through our  surveys that these coordinating bodies also face challenges to enhancing  collaboration, including having limited resources and needing to set  priorities and allocate roles and responsibilities. In their review of state  coordinating bodies, the Education Commission of the States reported  that for these coordinating bodies to be successful, they must commit to  long-term reform, include representatives from key stakeholder groups,  coordinate initiatives at the state level, and integrate reform into other  ongoing efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education Provides Some Financial Support and Other Assistance That May Help Address State- Reported Challenges as well as Enhance Other Collaborative Efforts, Especially for Local-Level Activities", "paragraphs": ["Education administers a grant program designed to help states develop  longitudinal data systems and provides some assistance related to these  efforts.

Further, Education has hosted grantee conferences that  have included panels on topics ranging from data privacy to how states  can leverage one another\u2019s experiences with these data systems. In  addition, a 2007 REL Midwest report outlined how states within its region  use data systems and the promising practices of and challenges  confronting these states, concluding that opportunities exist to capitalize  on states\u2019 commitment to developing longitudinal data systems by thinking  about these issues more comprehensively and systematically. In March  2009, the REL Midwest and National Comprehensive Center on Teacher  Quality cosponsored a live webcast to discuss and disseminate ongoing  research on utilizing data systems in teacher evaluation models. In  addition to grant funds provided by the State Longitudinal Data System  Grant program, state officials told us that conferences, training, and  technical assistance from the REL network would assist states in  addressing their data system challenges.", "In addition to providing the specific funding and assistance for data  systems, Education also provides funding to support partnerships within  states to address teacher quality. Some of these programs are intended to  support accountability for teacher preparation programs at institutions of  higher education or to improve teacher preparation programs by requiring  partnerships, mainly between school districts and institutions of higher  education. Of the 23 programs directed at improving teacher quality that  we discussed previously, 8 fund projects specifically requiring  partnerships. For example, according to state and university officials in  New Jersey, Teacher Quality Enhancement grants have funded efforts to  recruit high school students who are interested in pursing teaching in high- need school districts and designing teacher preparation programs for  middle school students based on strong content knowledge. These types  of efforts are accomplished through consortia, such as partnerships among  universities and their respective teacher preparation programs and liberal  arts and sciences departments as well as school districts. State and  university officials in our site visit states said that these partnership grants  generally facilitate useful collaboration among the grant partners.  However, one state official told us that outside of federal- and state-funded  partnerships between some school districts and institutions of higher  education, there are limited opportunities for collaboration between K-12  and higher education. These officials also said the partnerships are  sometimes difficult to sustain after the grants have expired.

Also, the Recovery  Act, with its large infusion of onetime funds, as well as its provisions  encouraging states, school districts, and institutions of higher education to  make improvements in assessing teacher effectiveness and in distributing  qualified and effective teachers equitably, creates an opportunity for the  department to leverage new resources with existing structures in a way to  improve teacher quality and effectiveness. However, this wide array of  programs, initiatives, and structures also creates a challenge for the  department. In the absence of a written departmentwide strategy for  integrating its wide array of teacher quality programs and efforts,  Education\u2019s offices may not be aligned in their actions to achieve  Education\u2019s long-term goal of improving teacher quality.

For example, in their comments Education officials highlighted a barrier  from this report of some teacher quality programs having inconsistent  legislative definitions and requirements. As part of establishing and  implementing a strategy for sustained coordination, Education could  consider identifying these specific definitional barriers and others and  develop a strategy for addressing them. Successful strategic and annual  planning involve identifying goals and challenges facing an agency and  detailing how an agency intends to achieve these goals and address these  challenges. As we mention in the report, these efforts should include  information on how program officials will coordinate and plan  crosscutting efforts with other related programs.

We did not send a SAHE survey to New York or Michigan  because (1) in New York the executive official of higher education is also  responsible for directing kindergarten through 12th grade education and  (2) in Michigan there is no state agency or officer with governance  authority over higher education. The surveys were conducted between  August and November 2008. Questionnaires were completed by SEA  officials in 48 states for a response rate of 94 percent, and SAHE officials  in 47 states for a response rate of 96 percent.", "The surveys posed a combination of questions that allowed for open- ended and closed-ended responses. They included questions about state  efforts including (1) state agency initiatives across a wide range of teacher  quality areas, (2) state agencies\u2019 collaborative activities within their state,  (3) the role of a state coordinating body (where applicable) in teacher  quality initiatives, and (4) the usefulness of grant funds and technical  assistance provided by Education.", "The surveys were conducted using self-administered electronic  questionnaires posted on the World Wide Web. We sent e-mail  notifications to all 51 SEA officials and 49 SAHE officials beginning on  September 15, 2008. To encourage respondents to complete the  questionnaire, we sent an e-mail message to prompt each nonrespondent  each week after the initial e-mail, on September 22, 2008, and October 1,  2008. We also contacted officials by telephone to further increase our  response rate. We closed both surveys on November 23, 2008.", "Some of the survey questions were open-ended, allowing respondents an  opportunity to provide thoughts and opinions in their own words. To  categorize and summarize these responses, we performed a systematic  content analysis of a select number of open-ended questions. Two GAO  staff independently coded the responses. All initial disagreements  regarding placement into categories were discussed and reconciled.  Agreement regarding each placement was reached again between at least  two analysts. The numbers of responses in each content category were  then summarized and tallied.", "Because this was not a sample survey, there are no sampling errors.  However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce  nonsampling errors, such as variations in how respondents interpret  questions and their willingness to offer accurate responses. We took a  number of steps to minimize nonsampling errors. For example, a social  science survey specialist designed the questionnaires in collaboration with  GAO staff with subject matter expertise. During survey development, we  received feedback from three external peer reviewers and Education  officials. The questionnaires also underwent a peer review by a second  GAO survey specialist. Each draft instrument was then pretested two  times with appropriate officials in New Mexico, Wisconsin, and West  Virginia to ensure that the questions and information provided to  respondents were relevant, clearly stated, and easy to comprehend. The  pretesting took place during July and August 2008. Since these were Web- based surveys, respondents entered their answers directly into electronic  questionnaires. This eliminated the need to have data keyed into  databases, thus removing an additional source of error. Finally, to further  minimize errors, computer programs used to analyze the survey data were  independently verified by a second GAO data analyst to ensure the  accuracy of this work.", "While we did not fully validate specific information that states reported  through our survey, we took several steps to ensure that the information  was sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. For example, we  contacted state officials via phone and e-mail to follow up on obvious  inconsistencies, errors, or incomplete answers. We also performed  computer analyses to identify inconsistencies in responses and other  indications of error. On the basis of our checks, we believe our survey data  are sufficient for the purposes of this report. The surveys and a complete  tabulation of aggregated results can be viewed at GAO-09-594SP.", "We also conducted site visits to three states\u2014Louisiana, New Jersey, and  Oregon. These states were selected based on their having initiatives that  focus on teacher quality, such as coordinating bodies that are intended to  bridge the K-12 and higher education systems, and on diversity in terms of  geographic location, population, and amount of federal teacher quality  program funding. In each state we met with SEA and SAHE officials, and  to understand the local perspective, we met with officials in at least one  school district and two universities. In addition, we interviewed experts on  teacher quality, including those at the American Institutes for Research,  Education Trust, Congressional Research Service, and the University of  Pennsylvania.
