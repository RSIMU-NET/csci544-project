Voluntary compliance is also influenced by other parties, including paid tax return preparers, tax software companies, and information return filers (employers, financial institutions, and others who report income or expense information about taxpayers to IRS). For this testimony, GAO was asked to (1) evaluate the current state of IRS\u0092s performance and its effect on the taxpayer experience, and (2) identify opportunities to improve the taxpayer experience and voluntary compliance.

For 2012, as with previous years, IRS officials attribute the lower performance to other funding priorities.", "The following are among the opportunities to improve the taxpayer experience and increase voluntary compliance that GAO identifies in this testimony:", "IRS can provide more self-service tools to give taxpayers better access to information. IRS can create an automated telephone line for amended returns (a source of high call volume) and complete an online services strategy that provides justification for adding new self-service tools online.", "Better leveraging of third parties could provide taxpayers with other avenues to receive service. Paid preparers and tax software providers combine to prepare about 90 percent of tax returns. IRS is making progress implementing new regulation of paid preparers. As it develops better data, IRS should be able to test strategies for improving the quality of tax return preparation by paid preparers. Similarly, IRS may also be able to leverage tax software companies.", "Expanded information reporting could reduce taxpayer burden and improve accuracy.

The taxpayer  experience is at its best when taxpayers are able to fulfill these  responsibilities independently without intervention from the Internal  Revenue Service (IRS). This is often referred to as voluntary compliance.  Some of the obvious influences on taxpayers\u2019 willingness and ability to  voluntarily comply include the quality of IRS\u2019s service to taxpayers,  knowledge that IRS\u2019s compliance checks and collection programs are  effective, and the belief that the tax system is fair and that others are  paying their share of taxes. Perhaps less obvious is the role of third  parties, including paid tax return preparers, tax software companies, and  information return filers (employers, financial institutions, and others who  report income or expense information about taxpayers to IRS) in  influencing voluntary compliance.", "The taxpayer experience also depends on how IRS deals with taxpayers  who fail to voluntarily comply by helping taxpayers correct unintentional  errors, and identifying and pursuing taxpayers who intentionally try to  evade taxes.", "Maximizing voluntary compliance is especially important today given the  nation\u2019s large structural budget deficits and the size of the tax gap. Earlier  this year, IRS estimated the gross tax gap\u2014the difference between taxes  owed and taxes paid on time\u2014at $450 billion for tax year 2006. IRS  estimated that it would eventually collect $65 billion of this through  enforcement actions and late payments, leaving a net tax gap of $385  billion.", "My statement today focuses on two areas: (1) evaluating the current state  of IRS\u2019s performance and its effect on the taxpayer experience, and (2)  identifying opportunities to improve the taxpayer experience and voluntary  compliance. To address these objectives, we reviewed and summarized  prior GAO reports and recommendations. Additionally, we obtained and  analyzed IRS data in delivering selected taxpayer services in recent  years. We discussed newly reported information in this statement with  IRS officials. Additional information on the scope and methodology of  underlying work is available in published products, referenced throughout  this statement. We conducted our work in April 2012 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives.

During this  period, millions of taxpayers who are trying to fulfill their tax obligations  contact IRS over the phone, face-to-face, and via the Internet to obtain  answers to tax law questions and information about their tax accounts.  This period is also when IRS processes the bulk of the approximate 140  million returns it will receive, runs initial compliance screens, and issues  over 100 million refunds.

So far in 2012, the percentage of e-filed  returns has increased by 1.9 percentage points to 88.8 percent since  about the same time last year (a 2.2 percent increase), as table 1 shows.  Since the same time in 2007, the percentage of e-filed returns has  increased from 72.3 percent to 88.8 percent. This year, IRS may meet its  long-held goal of having 80 percent of individual tax returns e-filed.  However, the overall e-file percentage is likely to decline as the tax filing  season ends since IRS typically receives more returns filed on paper later  in the filing season. In addition, IRS is in the midst of a multi-phase  modernization project, known to as the Customer Account Data Engine  (CADE) 2, which will fundamentally change how it processes returns.  With CADE 2, IRS also expects to be able to issue refunds in 4 business  days for direct deposit and 6 business days for paper checks after IRS  processes the return and posts the return data to the taxpayer\u2019s account.", "Early in the 2012 filing season, IRS experienced two processing problems  that delayed refunds to millions of taxpayers, and reported the problems  had been resolved by mid-February.

Almost 30 percent of taxpayers use such software to prepare their returns  and, in the process, understand their tax obligations, learn about tax law  changes, and get questions answered. Many also electronically file  through their software provider. Consequently, tax software companies  are another important intermediary between taxpayers and IRS. We have  reported that IRS has made considerable progress in working with tax  software companies to provide, for example, clearer information about  why an e-filed return was not accepted, require additional information on  returns to allow for IRS to better identify the software used, and enhance  security requirements for e-filing. To illustrate the potential for  leveraging tax software companies to improve taxpayer compliance, 4  years ago we recommended and IRS agreed to expand outreach efforts  to external stakeholders and include software companies as part of an  effort to reduce common types of misreporting related to rental real  estate.

In addition, IRS  research shows that when taxpayers know that IRS is receiving data from  third parties, they are more likely to correctly report the income or  expenses to IRS. As part of its recent update of its tax gap estimates, IRS  estimated that income subject to substantial information reporting, such  as pension, dividend, interest, unemployment, and Social Security  income, was misreported at an 8 percent rate compared to a 56 percent  misreporting rate for income with little or no information reporting, such as  sole proprietor, rent, and royalty income.", "GAO, Tax Administration: Costs and Uses of Third-Party Information Returns,  GAO-08-266 (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 20, 2007). have not entered into an agreement with IRS to report details on U.S.  account holders to IRS.", "As these three sets of information reporting requirements have only  recently taken effect, it is too soon to tell the impact they are having on  taxpayer compliance.", "We have made recommendations or suggested possible legislative  changes in several other areas in which IRS could benefit from additional  information reporting.

Taxpayers who rent out real  estate are required to report to IRS expense payments for certain  services, such as payments for property repairs, only if their rental  activity is considered a trade or business. However, the law does not  clearly spell out how to determine when rental real estate activity is  considered a trade or business.", "Service payments to corporations.

We believe the more narrow extensions of information  reporting to include services, but not goods, remain important options for  improving compliance.", "Additionally, we have identified existing information reporting  requirements that could be enhanced. Examples include the following:", "Mortgage interest and rental real estate. We recommended requiring  information return providers to report the address of a property  securing a mortgage, mortgage balances, and an indicator of whether  the mortgage is for a current year refinancing when filing mortgage  interest statements (Form 1098) could help taxpayers comply with  and IRS enforce rules associated with the mortgage interest  deduction. We have reported that collecting the address of the  secured property on Form 1098 would help taxpayers better  understand and IRS better enforce requirements for reporting income  from rental real estate.", "Higher education expenses. Eligible educational institutions are  currently required to report information on qualified tuition and related  expenses for higher education so that taxpayers can determine the  amount of educational tax benefits they can claim. However, the  reporting does not always separate eligible from ineligible expenses.  We recommended revising the information reporting form could  improve the usefulness of reported information.", "Identifying additional third-party reporting opportunities is challenging.  Considerations include whether third parties exist that have accurate  information available in a timely manner, the burden of reporting, and  whether IRS can enforce the reporting requirement.

For the 2012 filing  season, IRS implemented the first of three phases to introduce  modernized tax return processing systems. Specifically, IRS  introduced a modernized taxpayer account database, called CADE 2,  and moved the processing of individual taxpayer accounts from a  weekly to a daily processing cycle. IRS expects that completing this  first phase will provide taxpayers with benefits such as faster refunds  and notices and updated account information.

In one  example, IRS is exploring a process where third parties would send  information returns to IRS earlier so they could be matched against  taxpayers\u2019 returns when the taxpayer files the return as opposed to the  current requirement that some information returns go to taxpayers before  being sent to IRS. The intent is to allow IRS to match those information  returns to tax returns during the filing season rather than after refunds  have been issued.", "Another option for expanding pre-refund compliance checks is additional  math error authority (MEA) that Congress would need to grant IRS  through statute. MEA allows IRS to correct calculation errors and check  for obvious noncompliance, such as claims above income and credit  limits.

The errors being corrected can either  be in the taxpayers\u2019 favor or result in additional tax being owed.", "MEA is less intrusive and burdensome to taxpayers than audits and  reduces costs to IRS. It also generally allows taxpayers who make errors  on their returns to receive refunds faster than if they are audited. This is  due, in part, to the fact that IRS does not have to follow its standard  deficiency procedures when using MEA\u2014it must only notify the taxpayer  that the assessment has been made and provide an explanation of the  error.

In the absence of broader MEA, we  have identified specific cases where IRS could benefit from additional  MEA that have yet to be enacted.
