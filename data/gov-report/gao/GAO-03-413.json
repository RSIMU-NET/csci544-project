Over the years, the plaintiffs and DEA had agreed to remedies in many of these areas. However, minority representatives continued to raise issues in three areas--hiring, promotion, and discipline. GAO was asked to examine DEA's current processes for hiring, promoting, and disciplining special agents, and provide information about racial, ethnicity, and gender differences in these three areas."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["During the October 1997 through March 2002 period, African American, Hispanic, and white applicants to be special agents passed DEA's medical requirements and interview process at about the same rates. However, African American and Hispanic applicants had lower passing rates on (1) the test of an applicant's ability to recall and write about a video of a drug-related enforcement action and (2) suitability requirements measured through a background investigation and other tests. DEA's hiring procedures are based on criteria in federal regulations, professional standards, and standards established by subject matter experts. However, DEA had not studied its hiring requirements to see why its procedures resulted in different selection rates and whether they could be modified to reduce differences while maintaining the high standards necessary for special agents. There were no statistically significant differences in promotion rates among the various racial, ethnic, and gender groups during fiscal years 1997 through 2001. DEA has a rigorous and validated competency-based process that uses job simulations to assess capabilities at the target grade level. However, the job-relatedness of a key step involving recommending special agents for promotion had not been established and our analysis showed that African American and Hispanic special agents were recommended for promotion at significantly lower rates. Despite differences in recommendation rates, DEA's promotion decisions mirrored the race, ethnic, and gender makeup of the agency's special agent workforce. Additionally, the agency, working with a diverse panel of special agents, subsequently developed a revised recommendation process. At the time of GAO's review, DEA and the African American representatives were involved in mediation to reach final agreement. Disciplinary data for fiscal years 1997 to 2001 showed that the proportion of African American, Hispanic, and women special agents disciplined for misconduct was significantly higher than their representation in the DEA special agent workforce. These higher rates reflect that African Americans, Hispanics, and women had a significantly higher percentage of allegations of misconduct lodged against them and that a significantly higher percentage of these allegations were substantiated by investigations and resulted in disciplinary action. A recent study by an outside contractor found DEA's disciplinary process to be fair and nondiscriminatory, but that study only considered African Americans and whites and not women or other minority groups."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 1981, ruling on a class action racial discrimination lawsuit brought by  African American special agents, a U.S. district court found that the Drug  Enforcement Administration (DEA) had discriminated against the agents  in a variety of personnel practices.

In your role as Chair of the  Congressional Black Caucus, minority representatives of DEA\u2019s special  agents continued to raise issues with you about some of the personnel  practices at DEA. Based on discussions with your office, we agreed to  (1) develop information on the diversity of DEA\u2019s special agent workforce  and (2) examine the processes DEA has put in place to provide for fair and  nondiscriminatory hiring, promoting, and disciplining of special agents and  provide information about racial, ethnic, and gender differences in those  three areas.", "With regard to the diversity of DEA\u2019s special agent workforce, we  developed information by race, ethnicity, and gender for each pay grade  level. To examine DEA\u2019s processes for hiring, promoting, and disciplining  special agents, we reviewed policies and procedures and discussed them  with knowledgeable officials and representatives of groups representing  minority special agents. To identify the results that have been achieved, we  analyzed data by race, ethnicity, and gender generally for fiscal years 1997  through 2001, the 5 most recent fiscal years for which data were available,  with regard to how applicants fared at each step of DEA\u2019s hiring process,  promotions of special agents to the General Schedule (GS) grade 14 and 15  levels, and disciplinary actions taken. Our analyses were not designed to  prove or disprove discrimination; rather, they were designed to provide  information about race, ethnicity, and gender differences in personnel  actions. In analyzing hiring actions, we used the 80 percent rule set out in  the federal government\u2019s Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection  Procedures. Under the 80 percent rule, a selection rate for a racial, ethnic,  or gender group that is less than 80 percent of the selection rate for the  group with the highest rate is considered a substantially different rate of  selection that usually requires an employer to study the job relatedness of  selection procedures. To analyze differences in promotion and disciplinary  actions, we used standard statistical techniques.

Under these laws, it is  illegal to discriminate in any aspect of the terms and conditions of  employment, including hiring, firing, disciplinary actions, promotion, pay  assignments, and training.

The guidelines apply to tests and other selection procedures that  are used to make employment decisions, including hiring, promotion, and  discipline.", "Under the guidelines, adverse impact is a substantially different rate of  selection in hiring, promotion, or other employment decisions that works  to the disadvantage of a race, ethnic, or gender group. Specifically, a  selection rate for any group that is less than 80 percent of the selection rate  for the group with the highest rate is generally regarded as evidence of  adverse impact. This is not a legal definition of discrimination; rather, it is a  rule of thumb or guideline that is a practical means of keeping an agency\u2019s  attention on different selection rates in personnel actions and on the  procedures they use.

In addition, the court  found evidence of disparate treatment in work assignments because of the  way in which DEA used African American special agents for undercover  operations. The court found no discrimination in the type of appointments  or in training of special agents, and found that allegations of harassment  and reprisal were unsubstantiated. The court did not rule on issues relating  to hiring that DEA and the plaintiff class had already settled.", "The court ordered DEA to change its procedures and conduct validity  studies on those changes in order to provide for effective,  nondiscriminatory supervisory evaluation, discipline, and promotion  systems. To oversee the implementation of its orders, two groups were  established. One is called the \u201cWorking Group.\u201d Its mission is to help  ensure that the orders of the court requiring DEA to develop and validate  nondiscriminatory personnel practices are carried out. The Working Group  is made up of three industrial psychologists\u2014two from OPM and one  representing the plaintiff class members. The other group is called the  \u201cEqual Employment Opportunity Monitoring Committee\u201d or Monitoring  Committee. Made up of eight African American special agents representing  plaintiff class members, this committee monitors DEA\u2019s compliance with  the court\u2019s orders.

In  September 1999, the district court ruled on a motion for compliance  brought by the plaintiff class that claimed adverse impact in promotions of  African American special agents to managerial GS-14 and GS-15 positions.  The plaintiffs argued that there were disparities in two steps of the  multistep promotion process. They alleged that one step in the process,  called the Special Agent Promotion Program (SAPP), which involves  assessing candidates\u2019 job-related knowledge and skills through job  simulations, had an adverse impact on African Americans, thereby  decreasing their opportunities to be placed on best-qualified lists for  promotion. The plaintiffs further argued that they were adversely impacted  by another step in the process, whereby DEA senior executives\u2014special  agents in charge (SAC) and other office heads\u2014for the offices advertising  promotion opportunities, recommended a select few from a best qualified  candidate list to DEA\u2019s Career Board, the head of which ultimately makes  promotion decisions. However, the plaintiffs did not claim that there was  adverse impact in the ultimate number of promotions. According to the  court decision, the plaintiffs stated that \u201csome of the expected effect of  denying African American agents spots on the  is not  visible in the ultimate number of promotions because the Career Board  tends to \u2018overselect\u2019 African American agents when they appear on  , and also when the Career Board bypasses the  .\u201d", "In its ruling, the court noted that the use of the SAPP caused an adverse  impact despite its having been validated. Although the court did not  conclude that the use of the SAPP violated title VII, it ordered DEA to  implement a career development program to reduce the acknowledged disparate impact of the SAPP. The court found that the process for  recommendations made by SACs and office heads did have an adverse  impact on African American special agents. In its analysis, the court said  that \u201cthe fact that some of the discriminatory effect of the use of   may not appear in ultimate hiring  decisions, because the Career Board appears to be more likely to select  African Americans when they do appear, does not excuse the use of a  discriminatory device earlier in the process.\u201d The court concluded that the  SAC/office head recommendation process violated title VII, and enjoined  DEA from using such recommendations in making promotion decisions  until their use had been validated as job related. As a result, DEA  suspended promotions to GS-14 and GS-15 special agent positions. DEA  and the plaintiffs subsequently entered into a court-approved agreement in  January 2000 allowing DEA to temporarily use SAC/office head  recommendations for promotion decisions in accordance with certain  terms and conditions, until DEA created a permanent, validated process for  using SAC/office head recommendations.", "At the time of our review, DEA, working with the plaintiff class and other  employees, had developed a recommendation process. The Working Group  approved this process, which met the requirements of content validity as  described in the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures.  A diverse six-person panel of senior managers appointed by the DEA  Administrator and under the direction of an industrial psychologist  accomplished validation. In terms of job-relatedness, panel members first  individually reviewed descriptions of each competency to be assessed in  the SAC/office head recommendation process and the weight each  competency would receive. The panel then analyzed the knowledge, skills,  and abilities required for GS-14 and GS-15 special agent positions; rated  their importance to these positions; and individually linked the knowledge,  skills, and abilities to the competencies. The panel members followed the  same process for tasks required of GS-14 and GS-15 special agents.

Women made up 8.3 percent of DEA\u2019s special  agents. The diversity of DEA\u2019s special agent workforce was below overall  government workforce percentages but generally comparable with the  governmentwide population of criminal investigators, except for women  whose representation was about half that of criminal investigators  governmentwide.

The table  includes another common measure of diversity\u2014the nonfederal law  enforcement labor force\u2014that is derived from the decennial census and  includes individuals working in nonfederal law enforcement and security- related occupations that OPM, EEOC, and the Department of Labor  consider comparable to the 1811 occupational series. In addition to the  governmentwide criminal investigator workforce, DEA compares its  special agent workforce to the nonfederal law enforcement labor force.  The overall minority representation in DEA\u2019s special agent workforce is  comparable to the nonfederal law enforcement labor force, although there  is some variation in the representation of the various minority groups. DEA  has a lower representation of Native Americans and African Americans  while having a higher representation of Asian/Pacific Islanders and  Hispanics. Representation of DEA\u2019s women special agents is lower,  compared with the nonfederal law enforcement labor force. However,  there are several limitations to these data. First, these figures are dated in  that they are based on the 1990 census. Figures based on the 2000 census  will not be available until the fall of 2003, according to an official with  OPM\u2019s Office of Diversity. Additionally, the data are based on a wide variety  of police, detective, and public service occupations that include traffic  officers and police department chauffeurs as well as criminal investigators  and narcotics officers. A further problem with the nonfederal law  enforcement labor force data is that they do not distinguish educational  attainment of those working in comparable 1811 occupations\u2014DEA  requires a 4-year college degree."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Workforce Trends\u20141980- 2002", "paragraphs": ["Over the last two decades, the overall representation of minorities in DEA  special agent positions hardly changed, increasing from 19.1 percent in  1980 to 19.7 percent in 2002, while the representation of women increased,  from 2.3 percent in 1980 to 8.3 percent in 2002. While minority  representation in DEA\u2019s special agent workforce showed increases during  the 1980s, it decreased after 1990. Only Asian/Pacific Islanders continued to  increase throughout the 1980-2002 time frame. (See table 2.)", "When looked at from a grade standpoint, minority representation in DEA\u2019s  special agent workforce resembles an inverted pyramid. Representation of  minority special agents in Senior Executive Service (SES) and supervisory  special agent (GS-14 and GS-15) positions is higher than in nonsupervisory  (GS-7 to GS-13) ranks. (See table 3.) In September 2002, 36.7 percent of  DEA\u2019s SES special agents, 23.2 percent of supervisors, and 18.4 percent of  nonsupervisory special agents were members of minority groups. This was  particularly noticeable for African American and Hispanic special agents.  African Americans were 12.2 percent of SES special agents, 10.4 percent of  supervisors, and 7.5 percent of nonsupervisory special agents, while  Hispanics were 22.4 percent of SES special agents, 10 percent of  supervisors, and 8.2 percent of nonsupervisory special agents. For women,  the situation was similar in that women made up 10.2 percent of SES  special agents, which was higher than their representation in the  nonsupervisory and supervisory ranks. However, their representation in  the nonsupervisory ranks (8.8 percent) was higher than their  representation among supervisors (6.6 percent). Table 3 shows the  distribution of DEA special agents in nonsupervisory, supervisory, and SES  positions by equal employment opportunity (EEO) group in September  2002.", "The implication of the inverted pyramid is that DEA could face problems in  enhancing, or even maintaining, diversity in the agency\u2019s upper ranks in the  near future as supervisory and SES special agents retire or otherwise leave  DEA. The extent of future attrition in DEA\u2019s upper ranks (and at all levels)  is unclear because DEA has not performed a sufficient workforce analysis.  However, if governmentwide estimates are any indication, DEA could be  facing high levels of attrition. According to our estimates, 27 percent of  federal criminal investigators on board in fiscal year 1998 were expected to  retire from fiscal year 1999 through fiscal year 2006.", "Our work in the human capital area, as discussed in A Model of Strategic  Human Capital Management, found that high-performing organizations  identify their current and future human capital needs and then create strategies for filling these needs. In May 2001, the Office of Management  and Budget instructed each federal agency to provide information on the  demographics of its workforce, including age, grade, retirement eligibility,  and expected retirements over the next 5 years, and attrition, including  trends in recent retirements over the past 5 years. Such an analysis could  guide the development of DEA\u2019s recruiting and hiring plans and strategies  for a diverse special agent workforce. However, DEA\u2019s workforce analysis  is limited to examining attrition data for the previous 24 months to estimate  the coming year\u2019s hiring needs. The agency has not developed estimates on  the number of its special agents who are or will become eligible for  retirement or reach mandatory retirement age over the next 5 years or  longer and how this could affect the diversity of the special agent  workforce at the supervisory and SES levels and future recruiting needs.  DEA has faced challenges in meeting its special agent workforce needs. As  we will discuss later in this report, in addition to the high percentage of  applicants failing to meet DEA\u2019s hiring standards during the 1997-2002 time  frame covered by our review, a large number of applicants dropped out of  the hiring process. DEA officials said that many of them dropped out  because of the lengthy hiring process, which, the officials said, was  averaging about 2 years. As a result, DEA was left with a relatively small  pool of candidates meeting its hiring standards from which the agency  could hire. In fact, virtually everyone who made it through all the steps in  the hiring process was offered employment. DEA officials said that it  would be preferable to have a larger pool of suitable candidates from which  the agency could select. Because the agency is concerned about having lost  quality candidates that could have enhanced the agency\u2019s skills base and  diversity due to the long hiring process and not having a larger pool of  suitable candidates from which to choose, DEA implemented hiring  process changes in December 2002 in an attempt to reduce the time to hire  a special agent.

The reforms  include giving the field more responsibility for managing the hiring process  and avoiding time-consuming back-and-forth actions between the field and  headquarters. For example, field recruiters are to conduct criminal history  and credit records checks to identify unqualified applicants before, rather  than after, an application package is forwarded to headquarters, in order to  reduce the number of application packages reviewed. These preliminary  records checks will also help eliminate the need for costly background  investigations when an applicant is identified as unqualified, according to  DEA. In addition, background investigations are to be initiated earlier in  the process and by field offices, which also are to review the investigation  results, perform necessary follow-up, and make preliminary suitability  recommendations. Previously, background investigations had been  managed by headquarters, which referred follow-up questions to the field.  In addition, suitability determinations will be made before security  clearance reviews are conducted.

In this regard, the 2001 SAPP report found that the rating scores did not  differentiate between highly effective and less effective performers and  showed little if any correlation to assessment center tests of similar  competencies. Because performance rating scores for those who  participate in the assessment center are uniformly high and do little to  differentiate among candidates, a candidate\u2019s assessment center score is  the primary determinant of promotion competitiveness.", "The assessment center replicates a day in the life of a special agent through  exercises simulating the job at the next higher level.

In 2001, GS-13  special agents were evaluated on 12 competencies in assessment center  simulations while GS-14 special agents were evaluated on 9 competencies.  (See app. III.) The original job simulations were developed following a  content-oriented validation strategy consistent with the Uniform  Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures and the Principles for  Validation and Use of Personnel Selection Procedures. This was done by detailing special agents\u2019 job tasks and the knowledge and abilities required  to perform those tasks, establishing linkages between job tasks and the  knowledge and abilities required, and demonstrating linkages between the  required knowledge and abilities and selection procedures. The 2001  SAPP report noted that there is extensive literature documenting the  validity of job simulations for predicting supervisory and managerial  performance and that simulation measures are viewed as having a  potentially high degree of content validity, thereby reducing the possibility  of discrimination.", "DEA special agents trained by the contractor serve as assessors. To  minimize the degree of candidate/assessor familiarity and partiality when  assigning candidates to assessors, the assessment centers director collects  familiarity and partiality ratings from assessors to determine the extent to  which assessors know a promotion candidate and how impartially the  assessors believe they could evaluate the candidate. Another way of  fostering fairness is through the representation of minorities and women  among the assessors. Overall, during the 1997-2001 period, the proportion  of minority and women assessors for both the GS-14 and GS-15 assessment  centers exceeded the proportion of minorities and women participating in  the GS-14 and GS-15 SAPPs. As a check on how assessors carry out  exercises and developed scores, the assessment centers director reviews  videotapes of exercises, evaluates assessors\u2019 notes, and independently  scores candidates\u2019 performances.

However, it appears that discipline actions taken against Hispanics were to  have been included in the study, according to a memo from a former DEA  Administrator to the Hispanic Advisory Council. Neither council members  nor DEA officials could explain why this did not occur.", "As we discuss in our exposure draft A Model of Strategic Human Capital  Management, our work in the human capital area has shown that leading  organizations promote an inclusive workforce by seeking employee input  and using that input to adjust their human capital approaches. DEA has  taken, or plans to take, some steps in this regard. One step was that, as  DEA\u2019s study of a valid SAC/office head recommendation process  progressed, the agency involved minorities, in addition to Monitoring  Committee representatives that had been involved, and women. Also, the  November 2002 changes to the structure of the Career Board were based  on input from the Monitoring Committee and other special agents, and,  according to the Administrator\u2019s memo announcing the change, were  intended to bring transparency and greater participation to the promotion  process. Furthermore, in March 2002, the Administrator established an  ombudsman office to address workplace conflicts, facilitate fair and  equitable resolutions to concerns, and serve as an advisor and information  and communications resource. The ombudsperson said that she had  handled a variety of matters, mostly involving special agents, including  issues concerning performance appraisals and Career Board decisions to  reassign agents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["At some steps of DEA\u2019s hiring process, a higher percentage of minorities do  not meet the requirements to become a special agent, with African  American and Hispanic applicants hired at substantially lower rates  compared with white applicants. DEA has not analyzed why some groups  of applicants have lower passing rates and whether alternative procedures  could lessen these differences without compromising the high standards  necessary to perform the job successfully. Furthermore, because a large  number of applicants drop out or do not meet hiring standards, DEA offers  employment to virtually all applicants it finds suitable, leaving the agency  with little choice in whom it hires. DEA has not performed a workforce  analysis that takes into account expected attrition of the special agent  workforce, especially due to retirements, that could help the agency plan  for a sufficiently large pool of suitable special agent candidates with  diverse cultural and skills backgrounds from which it could selectively  hire.", "Promotions of special agents to supervisory GS-14 and GS-15 positions  have not shown statistically significant differences among groups.  However, DEA\u2019s rigorous promotion process has been subject to litigation  surrounding the SAC/office head recommendation process, the step in the  overall promotion process that had not been validated. DEA has since  developed a revised recommendation process and proposed a monitoring  process that the agency and the plaintiffs are discussing to reach  agreement about and which still must be court approved. However, the  proposed monitoring process does not take gender into account.", "The proportion of African American, Hispanic, and women special agents  disciplined for misconduct was substantially higher than their  representation in the DEA special agent workforce. However, two studies  have found DEA\u2019s discipline process to be valid and fair, but neither of the  studies addressed differences in the rates at which different groups were  disciplined, and the second study compared only disciplinary actions  involving African American and white special agents. Reliable data would  be necessary to carry out a study covering all race, ethnic, and gender  groups, and our analysis of disciplinary actions was delayed by the lack of  reliable data. Although DEA eventually developed corrected data, the  agency has not developed a process to maintain accurate and reliable  disciplinary data.", "Finally, minority and female special agents with whom we spoke generally  perceived that the promotion and discipline processes lacked fairness.  Perceptions of unfairness can be almost as corrosive to the workplace as  actual instances of unfair treatment and can undermine trust. Because DEA  did not widely share analyses of promotion and disciplinary actions with its  special agent workforce, agents were hindered in formulating informed  views about the fairness and equity of the promotion and discipline  processes. This situation would continue under DEA\u2019s proposal for  monitoring the promotion process because reporting of outcomes would  be limited to the African American special agents plaintiff group."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Administrator of DEA direct that  a process be initiated to monitor the results of decisions at the various  steps in the hiring process to identify differences in selection rates  among groups, and where substantial differences are found, determine  why they occur and what, if anything, can be done to reduce the  differences while maintaining the high standards necessary for the job  of special agent;  a workforce analysis be done, which takes into account retirement  eligibility, expected retirements, and other attrition, to guide the  development of DEA\u2019s recruiting and hiring plans and strategies;   the plans to monitor the results of the SAC/office head recommendation  process by race and ethnicity be expanded to include monitoring by  gender;   steps be taken to develop, maintain, and ensure the reliability of a  discipline database and that the study of disciplinary actions taken  against African American and white special agents be expanded to  analyze disciplinary actions against all racial, ethnic, and gender groups  of special agents; and  appropriate, aggregate statistical data on the outcomes of the promotion  and discipline processes for all racial, ethnic, and gender groups are  available to its special agent workforce to help special agents formulate  informed views about the fairness and equity of the agency\u2019s promotion  and discipline processes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, the Acting Administrator of DEA  agreed with our recommendations and said that DEA was acting to  implement them.
