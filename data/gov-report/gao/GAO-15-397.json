GAO found that CASIS implemented procedures for prioritizing research; evaluated 206 proposals and awarded approximately $20 million in grants to 77 research projects through January 2015; and cultivated relationships with academic institutions, research-specific organizations, and other entities. CASIS, however, has not been able to fulfill its responsibility in the cooperative agreement to interact with the ISS National Laboratory Advisory Committee, which NASA was statutorily required to establish under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, because NASA has yet to staff the committee as required by the NASA Authorization Act of 2008.

In January 2015, however, the Chairman of the CASIS Board of Directors told GAO that setting measurable targets is a priority for the board. CASIS, however, has yet to establish a date by which measurable targets will be developed. Using the established metrics, NASA is required by the cooperative agreement to perform an annual program review of CASIS's performance. This review is informal and not documented as ISS program officials provide the results to CASIS orally. This approach is inconsistent with federal internal control standards, which call for information to be recorded and communicated to those who need it to manage programs, including monitoring performance and supporting future decision making.

NASA officials told us that with CASIS in place, the  great majority of non-NASA ISS users do not have an agreement with  NASA because they work with CASIS. They added that there are  exceptions where NASA works with other agencies, but those are  typically for exploration technology or defense-related projects. In  addition, NASA officials indicate that the INLAC has not been staffed  because they believe that the structure and function of the current CASIS  Board of Directors has proven to be a better alternative to a NASA  advisory committee since the CASIS board represents a broad  experience base including military, medical research, strategic  partnerships, and engineering, among others. Further, NASA officials said  that the Research Subcommittee of the Human Exploration and  Operations Committee to the NASA Advisory Council also provides  research advisory oversight of the ISS National Laboratory. This  subcommittee\u2019s objectives, however, have a focus on human spaceflight  and the membership of this subcommittee is to consist of individuals from  the research committee with a broad awareness of human spaceflight  related activities.", "CASIS officials also believe that their board is performing some of the  INLAC\u2019s advisory duties, but acknowledge that the board does not meet  the section 602 requirements under the 2008 act\u2014to monitor and report  annually to the NASA Administrator its assessments and  recommendations of ISS National Laboratory utilization\u2014nor does its  membership meet the criteria specified in the act. Without a staffed  INLAC, NASA currently lacks a single advisory committee that represents  all users of the ISS National Laboratory and provides ongoing monitoring  and assessments and recommendations of ISS National Laboratory  resource utilization, as required by the charter. As a result, CASIS is not  able to fulfill its responsibilities as outlined in the cooperative agreement  and as established under section 602 of the NASA Authorization Act of  2008."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CASIS and NASA Have Taken Steps to Measure and Assess CASIS Performance, but Measurable Targets Needed", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CASIS\u2019s Metrics Consistent with Most Key Attributes, but Lack Quantifiable Goals", "paragraphs": ["CASIS has established metrics, but not targets against which its  performance can be measured by NASA.

Metrics are included in an Annual  Program Plan, which CASIS prepares with input from NASA.", "We have previously reported that successful performance measures as a  whole should have four general characteristics: demonstrate results, be  limited to a vital few, cover multiple priorities, and provide useful  information for decision making. We cited specific attributes as key to  successful performance measures, such as linkage, clarity, measurable  targets, objectivity, and balance. The four characteristics are overarching,  thus they do not necessarily directly link to the attributes. Furthermore,  the attributes may not be equal, and a noted weakness does not mean  that a measure is not useful. Weaknesses identified should be considered  areas for further refinement. Table 3 defines the key attributes of  successful performance measures.", "We assessed CASIS\u2019s fiscal year 2015 metrics, and found that the  metrics met almost all of these key attributes.

The results of our assessment of CASIS\u2019s  fiscal year 2014 metrics for key attributes of successful performance  measures can be found in appendix IV.", "Our analyses indicated that CASIS did not establish measurable targets  or goals for either fiscal year 2014 or 2015 metrics, which limits its ability  to use these metrics to assess performance. We have previously reported  that performance metrics should have quantifiable, numerical targets or  other measurable values, which help assess whether overall goals and  objectives were achieved.it is unclear how NASA objectively assesses CASIS\u2019s performance.", "Without defined measurable targets or goals,  CASIS officials noted that operating as a new entity with no history made  it difficult to establish performance targets, but this is beginning to  change. CASIS officials initially told us in July 2014 that establishing  targets would be arbitrary because CASIS processes and metrics are still  evolving. Subsequently, in January 2015, they indicated that since CASIS  now has some operating history, they will be able to do so. The Chairman  of the CASIS Board of Directors told us that measurable targets should  be developed and that this is a priority for the Board. However, CASIS  has not established a date by which measurable targets will be  developed. Further, CASIS officials indicated that not all metrics will have  measurable targets initially because some metrics are subjective, such as  those that attempt to measure the quality of research or a new technology  generated by CASIS-sponsored research. The Chairman said that the  CASIS Board of Directors is also working to develop targets for subjective  measures, and they hope to have them in place in the next several years.", "Although the ability to objectively measure performance is limited without  measurable targets, CASIS and NASA officials generally agreed about  how long-term success for CASIS will be defined. According to CASIS  officials, success would ultimately be defined by demonstrating that the  research and technology development performed aboard ISS National  Laboratory benefits Earth and that commercial markets can be sustained  in low-Earth orbit. NASA officials similarly said that developing  commercial markets in space and bringing products back to Earth will  determine success."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NASA Assesses CASIS Annually, but Performance Assessment Is Not Documented", "paragraphs": ["NASA performs an annual assessment of CASIS\u2019s performance  consistent with its responsibilities in the cooperative agreement, but this  assessment is not documented.

The cooperative agreement also requires  CASIS to propose an adjustment to the metrics if performance is not  going to be met. However, without performance targets, CASIS cannot  determine whether the metrics need to be adjusted. Further, without  these targets, NASA and CASIS cannot conduct assessments that are  measurable or conclusive and, therefore, the assessments are subjective.  According to the CATO, during the annual program review, he assesses  CASIS metrics for trends, looking for improvements over time and  questioning any perceived lack of progress. The CATO added that he  discusses any issues identified during the annual review with CASIS  officials, NASA management, and stakeholders. CASIS officials  concurred, and told us this discussion with NASA highlights areas for  further refinement. For example, as a result of such discussion, CASIS is  now more proactively engaging NASA technical expertise on available  flight hardware, and has broadened business development efforts aimed  at attracting new commercial users of the ISS National Laboratory.", "Both CASIS and NASA officials told us that NASA does not document its  annual program review of CASIS performance. Federal standards for  internal controls call for information to be recorded and communicated to  management and others who need it to carry out their responsibilities.  This type of documented information is important to support decision  making and conduct assessments. CASIS officials have not asked for a  formal summary of the results of NASA\u2019s annual program review because  CASIS receives informal feedback on quarterly reports provided to NASA.  CASIS also maintains minutes of regularly scheduled meetings with  NASA where any issues that need to be discussed between CASIS and  NASA are addressed. While NASA does not document this annual  assessment, NASA officials told us that they were generally satisfied with  CASIS performance. CASIS officials, however, said that the results of the  annual review should be reported in some sort of formal manner to make  the information more actionable.", "Because CASIS is allocated at least 50 percent of ISS research capacity,  future success of the ISS as a research platform is partially dependent on  the efforts CASIS has undertaken. However, without definitive and  documented assessment factors, NASA will be challenged to take action  in response to CASIS performance. For example, without documentation,  NASA lacks support to terminate the cooperative agreement, if deemed  necessary. Conversely, NASA also would have no record to justify  extending the cooperative agreement to support a possible ISS life  extension.

Achieving greater utilization of the  ISS and its unique capabilities, showing the benefit of commercial and  academic research, and demonstrating success to generate increased  interest from potential users could help NASA get a better return on its  significant investment in the ISS. NASA currently lacks an advisory  committee established under the Federal Advisory Committee Act that is  composed of individuals representing organizations who have formal  agreements with NASA to use the U.S. portion of the ISS. As a result,  CASIS is not able to fulfill its responsibility as outlined in the cooperative  agreement that requires it to coordinate with INLAC as established under  the NASA Authorization Act of 2008 and review recommendations  originated by the INLAC. A fully staffed and operational INLAC could  provide information to senior NASA management on how to better utilize  the constrained resources of the ISS\u2014which could affect how CASIS  attracts new users and fulfills its responsibility to increase utilization of the  ISS National Laboratory.", "In addition, clearly defined measurable targets are essential for CASIS to  demonstrate results, allow NASA to objectively assess CASIS  performance, and help stakeholders assess whether overall goals and  objectives for the ISS National Laboratory are achieved. Finally, NASA\u2019s  annual performance assessment of CASIS is not documented and the  results are provided to CASIS on an informal basis.

In response to this recommendation, both NASA and CASIS  raised concerns that the current requirements for membership of the  INLAC would create a conflict of interest. Specifically, NASA stated that  the individuals who would make up the committee would likely have user  agreements with CASIS and, in many cases, would be receiving funding  from CASIS and NASA. Furthermore, because these entities would be  competing for CASIS resource allocations, CASIS believes that they  would not be sufficiently independent to perform the functions required of  the committee. In response to these concerns, CASIS indicated the  composition of membership as defined in the NASA Authorization Act of  2008 should be amended. NASA also responded that while meeting  statutory obligations and obtaining knowledgeable input and  recommendation to achieve optimal utilization of the ISS is important, it is  the agency\u2019s position that the CASIS Board of Directors serves the intent  of the INLAC charter by providing recommendations regarding effective  utilization of the ISS. As a result, NASA indicated that it plans to work with  the Congress to adjust the INLAC requirement to address these  concerns. We continue to believe our recommendation is valid. We do not  see that staffing the INLAC as directed in the 2008 act would necessarily  result in a conflict of interest and that the entities would be competing for  CASIS resource allocations. The act required an advisory committee that  represents all users of ISS National Laboratory and that provides ongoing  monitoring and assessment and makes recommendations. According to  the cooperative agreement between CASIS and NASA, CASIS is directed  to coordinate with the INLAC and review the committee\u2019s  recommendations. The INLAC, however, functions only in an advisory  capacity; therefore we do not see how a conflict of interest would be  created by the membership of the INLAC. Furthermore, according to the  NASA Authorization Act of 2010, CASIS shall be guaranteed access to  not less than 50 percent of the United States research capacity allocation.  Because CASIS has to agree with NASA for an allocation of resources at  a level below 50 percent, we do not see how the composition of the  INLAC would create a competition for resource allocation with CASIS. In  addition, it was not clear to us in our review that the existing mechanisms  in place accomplish these requirements. If NASA were to seek relief or  changes to this requirement, it should clearly outline how these  requirements can be met through existing bodies and processes.", "NASA and CASIS concurred with our recommendation directing the ISS  Program Manager to work with CASIS to collectively develop and  approve measurable targets for metrics in fiscal year 2016 and beyond. In  response to this recommendation, NASA stated that fiscal year 2016 is a  reasonable time to establish measurable targets with CASIS because the  non-profit will be entering its fourth full year of operations. Similarly,  CASIS responded that it is now in a position to develop targets for key  metrics and plans to formalize the process in fiscal year 2016. NASA  indicated that these targets should be established by December 31, 2015.  Once complete, this action should address our recommendation to  develop and approve measurable targets for CASIS\u2019s metrics.", "NASA and CASIS also concurred with our recommendation directing the  ISS Program Manager to document the annual program assessment of  CASIS performance. In response to this recommendation, NASA said that  it would begin documenting the agency\u2019s annual program assessment in  response to CASIS\u2019s 2015 annual report.

We examined  the CASIS portfolio management and research prioritization process and  various market analyses and studies that CASIS considered in  establishing research areas. We reviewed the CASIS proposal review  and evaluation process for solicited and unsolicited proposals as well as  the Requests for Proposals that CASIS had issued to solicit research  proposals. We studied fiscal year 2014 quarterly and annual reports to  gain insight into the activities CASIS had undertaken to meet its  responsibilities. We reviewed CASIS business development efforts,  including funding and marketing processes and outreach efforts. We  reviewed the partnerships CASIS has established with philanthropic  institutions that could provide additional resources to sponsor research  aboard the ISS National laboratory and implementation partners that  provide logistical assistance to researchers. Additionally, we reviewed  CASIS education efforts, particularly science, technology, engineering,  and mathematics activities. We also reviewed GAO, NASA Inspector  General, and NASA reports on sustaining the ISS. We interviewed  several ISS program officials including the ISS Program Director, ISS  Program Manager, ISS Program Scientist, and the Cooperative  Agreement Technical Officer to gain their perspectives on the work  CASIS was performing. We also interviewed officials in the Space Life  and Physical Sciences Research and Applications division, including the  NASA Liaison to CASIS, to gain perspective on the work NASA is  sponsoring aboard the ISS. In addition, we interviewed the CASIS  President and Executive Director, the CASIS Chief Operating Officer, the  CASIS Chief Financial Officer, and the Chairman of the CASIS Board of  Directors to better understand the processes and procedures being  implemented, how proposals are evaluated, and the challenges that  CASIS faces to further implement the responsibilities outlined in the  cooperative agreement.", "To obtain additional information on CASIS\u2019s performance and the  effectiveness of its implementation of some of the required activities, we  used information provided to us by CASIS to select a random sample of  20 principal investigators who had submitted either a solicited or  unsolicited research proposal to CASIS. Of the 20 researchers selected,  we conducted structured interviews with 14 researchers to obtain  additional insights into CASIS\u2019s performance. Although the randomly  selected researchers are, in part, representative of the population of 172  researchers who had submitted proposals to CASIS through July 2014,  the descriptive nature of the responses and the relatively small sample  size does not permit the development of reliable, quantitative estimates  that are generalizable to the population.

We  also reviewed CASIS quarterly reports for fiscal year 2014 and the first  quarter of fiscal year 2015 and the fiscal year 2014 annual report to  determine how performance was measured and reported to NASA. We  analyzed CASIS\u2019s fiscal year 2014 and 2015 metrics to evaluate whether  they adhered to GAO\u2019s key attributes of successful performance  measures, which were identified in previous work.
