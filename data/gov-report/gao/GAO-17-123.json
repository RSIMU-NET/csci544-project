Fifteen entities reported the authority to retain proceeds from building disposals. However, most of these federal entities reported limited use of their independent authorities during fiscal years 2011 through 2015. Seven entities that reported having disposal authority used it during this time frame, and 5 entities that reported having authority to retain proceeds did so (see figure below). The scope of disposal authorities varies among entities; about half have broad authority but these entities only account for about 9 percent of domestic federal buildings. Other authorities are limited, for example, to specific types of facilities or methods of disposal. In addition, statutory authorities to retain proceeds also vary, with most restricting how a federal entity may use the proceeds.", "Five of the 7 entities that reported using their independent disposal authority reported using it for only about 8 percent of the buildings they disposed of in fiscal year 2015. The General Services Administration (GSA) and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) have broad authorities that were used for all of their disposals. The five federal entities that retained proceeds reported about $557 million from all building sales, not just those in which they used their authority from fiscal years 2011 through 2015. Of this amount, USPS's building disposals accounted for $446 million, GSA for $89 million, and the other 3 entities accounted for the remaining $22 million.", "Officials from most of the federal entities GAO interviewed said building disposal decisions are mainly based on mission needs rather than the authorities. Officials from 5 entities said they would like the authority to use proceeds from building sales to cover costs of preparing buildings for disposal, such as the cost of environmental remediation.

Federal real property management has been on our High-Risk  list since 2003, in part because we have found that the government  maintains too much excess and underutilized property. In addition,  agencies continue to face long-standing challenges in disposing of  buildings. In recent years the federal government has taken steps to  improve the management of its real property. In 2013, the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) implemented the \u201cFreeze the Footprint\u201d  policy, which instructed federal agencies to not increase total square  footage of their domestic office and warehouse inventory. Subsequently,  in March 2015 OMB issued the National Strategy for the Efficient Use of  Real Property, which included OMB\u2019s \u201cReduce the Footprint\u201d policy. This  policy aims to reduce the amount of property held by the government.

In addition, some federal entities have independent statutory  authority to dispose of buildings and other types of property, and in some  cases, retain proceeds from such disposals. You asked us to review the  extent to which federal agencies have disposal authority independent of  the Property Act, including the authority to retain proceeds. This report  examines: (1) the scope of building disposal authorities held by civilian  Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies and the United States Postal  Service (USPS); (2) the results of these federal entities\u2019 use of their  disposal authorities from fiscal years 2011 through 2015; and (3) the  factors that drive federal entities\u2019 building disposal decisions, and what  additional authorities officials at selected federal entities believe could  help facilitate disposals.", "To identify the scope of disposal authorities, we surveyed 22 civilian CFO  Act agencies regarding their authority to dispose of owned buildings and  retain any proceeds resulting from those disposals. We reviewed the  authorities these entities reported, as well as the authorities provided to  GSA and USPS to dispose of buildings, and summarized the  characteristics and scopes of these authorities. For example, we  reviewed disposal authorities to determine what if any limitations they  imposed. We excluded authorities that we determined to be a directed  authority, which are authorities provided in law that direct an entity to  dispose of a particular facility or facilities and, in some cases, also identify  a specific recipient of the property.", "To determine the results of the entities\u2019 use of their disposal authority,  using the same survey instrument to ask responding entities to report the  extent to which they used their authorities to dispose of buildings during  the fiscal year 2011 through 2015 time frame and, if applicable, the extent  to which the authority to retain proceeds was used. We also analyzed the  Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) database maintained by GSA for  the same time frame to corroborate responses, identify the disposal  methods that entities reported during that time, and identify the proceeds, if any, from building disposals. To assess the reliability of FRPP data, we  (1) reviewed existing documentation related to the data, (2) conducted  electronic testing of the data to identify problems with completeness and  accuracy, and (3) interviewed knowledgeable agency officials about the  data. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report.", "To obtain additional information on the results of these disposals, and  how disposals are prioritized, we interviewed officials from 11 of the 14  federal entities that reported having authority to both dispose of buildings  and retain proceeds from such disposals and officials from one agency  with the authority to dispose of buildings but not retain proceeds. We also  interviewed officials at an additional entity that reported having the  authority to dispose of buildings but not to retain proceeds. With all of  these entities, we discussed the scope and use of their authorities for  building disposals from fiscal years 2011 through 2015. We also asked  officials from these entities how they prioritized building disposals, how  their disposal authority may have influenced their decisions, and what  additional disposal authorities they believe could facilitate additional  disposals.", "To obtain more detailed information about specific building disposals, we  reviewed documents for three to five disposals from four federal entities  that used their disposal authority during fiscal years 2011 through 2015.  From each of the four federal entities, we selected three to five disposals  that varied in building value, size, location and year of sale.

As the chief management office for the executive  branch, OMB is responsible for overseeing how federal entities devise,  implement, manage, and evaluate programs and policies. OMB also  develops and provides direction to federal entities on real property  management matters. GSA has two key leadership responsibilities  related to managing the federal government\u2019s real property. First, GSA  acquires, manages, and disposes of federally owned real property for  which it has custody and control. This function is commonly referred to as  the landlord role since GSA performs these services on behalf of other  federal entities that occupy the properties. Second, GSA\u2019s Office of  Government-wide Policy is tasked with, among other things, identifying,  evaluating, and promoting best practices to improve the efficiency of  management processes. In this policy role, GSA also provides guidance  for federal entities, publishes performance measures, and maintains the  FRPP database.", "The FRPP was created in accordance with Executive Order 13327 and  contains data on federal real property assets worldwide, including  information on disposals of federally-owned buildings. Real property data  is collected and reported to the FRPP on an annual basis by all CFO Act  agencies and others that have control and responsibility for federal real  property. They report, among other things, how and when buildings were  disposed of and, if applicable, proceeds generated from the disposal.  FRPP is maintained at the asset level for land, buildings, and structures.  Some disposals include multiple assets in a transaction. For example, a  disposal may include multiple buildings and the land on which they were  built. In that scenario, each land parcel, building, and structure is  recorded separately as a disposed asset.", "GSA plays a central role in disposing of unneeded property for the federal  government. The Property Act gives GSA the authority to dispose of  property for most federal entities and mandates the process to be used.  This activity is conducted by GSA\u2019s Public Building Service (see fig. 1).  GSA initiates its disposal process when a federal entity determines it no  longer needs a building and notifies GSA. As illustrated in figure 1,  federally owned buildings may be disposed of through several different  methods depending on the particular circumstances. These methods  include transfer to another federal entity, conveyance to another public  entity for public benefit uses, such as homelessness assistance or  education, and sale. We have found in the past that the disposal process  can be time consuming.", "Some federal entities have statutory authority to dispose of buildings  independent of the Property Act. Federal entities with independent  disposal authority are not required to notify or use the services of GSA to  complete the disposal; however, federal entities with disposal authority  may choose to hire GSA to act as its agent or broker for building disposal  purposes. In such cases, the entity pays GSA for the services it performs  in disposing of a building. In addition, a federal entity with independent  disposal authority may request GSA to dispose of a building under the  Property Act.", "Federal entities are also authorized in certain circumstances, to dispose  of buildings through demolition and donation whether or not they have  independent disposal authority. Specifically, federal entities that have  control of real property are authorized to demolish or donate to a public  body buildings that have no commercial value or for which the estimated  cost of continued care and handling exceeds the estimated proceeds  from the sale.", "OMB has undertaken several initiatives and issued guidance to federal  entities to improve the management of federal real property and address  long-standing issues. In March 2015, OMB introduced the National  Strategy for Efficient Use of Real Property to improve federal utilization of  the real property portfolio. The National Strategy adopts a three-pronged  policy framework to improve the cost effectiveness and efficiency of the  federal real property portfolio. First, it aims to freeze federal real property  growth. Second, it identifies policy actions to measure the cost and  utilization of real property assets. Finally it identifies actions to reduce the  size of the federal property portfolio. Specifically, OMB issued the  \u201cReduce the Footprint\u201d policy which directed each federal entity to  establish reduction targets for office space, warehouse space, and the  disposal of federally owned buildings beginning in fiscal year 2016.", "In addition, several real property reform bills were introduced in Congress  in recent years. For example, during the 114th Congress, two bills were  introduced and passed by the House of Representatives, but have not  been enacted. The proposed Federal Asset Sale and Transfer Act of  2016 would establish a Public Buildings Reform Board to identify  opportunities for the federal government to reduce its inventory of civilian  real property and reduce its costs. The proposed Public Buildings  Report and Savings Act of 2016 would promote consolidation and  disposal by requiring, among other things, that GSA justify to Congress  any new or replacement building space beyond a specified value,  including reasons that it cannot be consolidated or collocated into other  owned or leased space."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Scope of Both Disposal and Retention of Proceeds Authorities Varies Widely", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Twenty Federal Entities Reported Having Building Disposal Authority and 15 Reported Having Authority to Retain Proceeds from Building Disposals", "paragraphs": ["In all, 20 federal entities in our review reported having at least one  statutory disposal authority that allowed them to dispose of domestic  buildings.

Fourteen of these 20 entities, plus Federal  Prison Industries, reported having statutory authority to retain proceeds  from building disposals. (See app. II). The following nine CFO Act  agencies reported having neither disposal authority nor the authority to  retain proceeds: The Departments of Commerce, Education, Housing and  Urban Development, and the Interior; the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration; Office of Personnel Management; Small Business  Administration; Social Security Administration; and the United States  Agency for International Development.

One authority for the Forest Service, which was enacted as a  provision within an appropriations act, expired at the end of fiscal year  2016, and one of VA\u2019s authorities expires on December 31, 2018.  Some authorities do not have sunset provisions but were established  decades ago and are now very rarely, if ever used. For example, one of  DOE\u2019s disposal authorities was established in 1955 to support local  governance of atomic energy communities that had previously been  managed by the federal government.

One of FAA\u2019s  disposal authorities, for example, is limited to airport or airway property,  and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s (ICE) authority is limited  to disposal of service processing centers and detention facilities. DOE  reported having three disposal authorities but none provides far-reaching  authority for all DOE buildings. One authority is derived from the Atomic  Energy Act of 1946, as amended, and only applies to specific activities  conducted under that act, as amended. One is specific to buildings  located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Richland, Washington, while the  third relates to buildings held by DOE\u2019s Bonneville Power Administration.", "In addition, some authorities prescribe a specific method of disposal or  exempt an entity from certain legal requirements that generally pertain to  disposals. Authorities provided to the Indian Health Service (IHS), for  example, are intended to support tribal entities and authorize IHS to  donate excess property to tribes, tribal organizations, and urban Indian  organizations at no cost, under certain circumstances but do not  authorize other disposal methods such as sale. Most federal entities with  disposal authority must follow the requirements of the McKinney-Vento  Homeless Assistance Act (McKinney-Vento Act). The Act created a  program to assist the homeless, in part, by identifying unused federal real  property and making it available to homeless assistance providers.  However, some entities\u2019 disposal authorities exempt them from such  requirements and thus simplify the disposal process. For example,  according to Coast Guard officials, one of their disposal authorities  exempts them from the McKinney-Vento Act requirements as well as from  the requirement to report to GSA excess real property for potential use by  other federal entities. USPS has independent disposal authority, and its  own authorities exempt it from the McKinney-Vento Act requirements as  well as reporting excess property to GSA.", "Statutory authorities to retain proceeds from building disposals also vary.  Some authorities require congressional action for the use of proceeds  while others do not. For example, the Maritime Administration must  deposit sales proceeds into a Treasury fund, and the funds are not  available to the agency until a subsequent appropriation is enacted; in contrast, the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation is broadly  authorized to use proceeds from building disposals toward mission  activities without express restriction or limitation. Other authorities limit  the use of sales proceeds to specific programs. The Department of Labor,  for example has the authority to retain proceeds from the sales of Job  Corps center facilities, but restricts the use of those proceeds to carry out  the Job Corps\u2019 programs. Some entities, such as VA, also noted that their  proceeds from building disposals would be off-set; that is, their  appropriation is subject to a reduction equal to the amount of the  proceeds; thus, the proceeds do not increase funds available to the entity."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Most Federal Entities Reported Limited Opportunities to Use Their Authorities to Dispose of Buildings and Retain Proceeds", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "About One-Third of Federal Entities Reported Using Their Disposal Authorities during Fiscal Years 2011 through 2015 but for a Minority of Their Total Building Disposals", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal years 2011 through 2015, 7 of the 20 federal entities that  reported having building disposal authority reported using that authority.

As discussed earlier, some federal entities\u2019 disposal  authorities are narrowly framed to apply only to certain programs or  facilities and thus apply to a limited number of the entities\u2019 federally  owned buildings. All 5 of these entities\u2019 disposal authorities have use  restrictions, and consequently many buildings may have been ineligible  for disposal under the entities\u2019 disposal authorities. We requested data on  building disposals by these five entities on the use of their own disposal  authority for the selected time frame, but we were only able to obtain  information from all five entities for fiscal year 2015. These five federal  entities reported disposing of 801 buildings in fiscal year 2015, but only  used their authority for 67 (about 8 percent) of their total building  disposals. (See table 1). The other two entities, GSA and USPS, which  have very broad disposal authority, used their disposal authority for all of  the buildings they disposed of that year\u2014which was 12 and 15 buildings,  respectively.", "VA officials told us that they had never used two of their independent  disposal authorities in part due to statutory limitations. Under one of the  entity\u2019s disposal authorities, all proceeds from building disposals must be  deposited into the VA Capital Asset Fund, and VA may not obligate these  funds without further congressional action. In addition, according to VA  officials, these collections are off-set, meaning that increases to the fund  balance from sales result in identical reductions in VA\u2019s appropriation.  Further, this authority requires VA to first determine whether the property  is suitable for use by another entity under its enhanced-use lease (EUL)  authority before using its disposal authority. VA officials said it was  advantageous to enter into EUL agreements to manage underused and  unutilized buildings in their portfolio rather than disposal. Officials stated  that a long-term EUL (as long as 75 years) effectively functions like a  disposal because VA has no day-to-day responsibility for the building  over an extended period of time. Further, VA officials said that their EUL  authority offers more flexibility to use the proceeds that may result from  lease arrangements. Specifically, VA\u2019s EUL authority allows funds to be  available for furnishing medical care without fiscal year limitation.   Although entering into an EUL does not constitute a disposal, VA\u2019s EUL  authority does allow for the potential disposal of property leased under  that authority.  If during the term of the EUL or within 30 days of its  termination, it is determined that the property is no longer needed, VA  may initiate action to transfer the property to the lessee.  According to VA  officials, this disposal authority has been used in the past, but not during  the 5-year time frame included in our review.", "Another condition limiting some federal entities\u2019 use of their building  disposal authorities was the location of unneeded buildings within federal  campuses or secure facilities, particularly when the entity was not  disposing of the underlying land. In these situations, the building is  typically made available for \u201coffsite use only,\u201d i.e. the conveyee or  purchaser would have to remove the building from the site at their own  cost. For example, the buildings eligible for disposal under FAA\u2019s disposal  authority were often located within the secure area of an airport and  tended to be small sheds enclosing technical equipment. According to  FAA officials, these smaller buildings were notably different from common  perceptions of federal buildings such as courthouses, post offices, and  agency headquarters, which are large and sometimes designed to serve  symbolic, ceremonial, and other purposes of government.

The total includes all  buildings disposed of by those entities during the 5-year period,  regardless of the authority used (i.e., a disposal could have been  pursuant to an independent building authority, the Property Act, or a  demolition authorized by statute). The most frequent method these  entities used to dispose of buildings was demolition (57 percent), while  disposal by \u201cother\u201d means (25 percent) and by sale (14 percent) were the  second and third most frequent methods of disposal (see fig. 6).  Demolition was one of five methods of building disposal that FRPP  allowed federal entities to report prior to fiscal year 2015; other methods  included federal transfer, public benefit conveyance, sale, and \u201cother.\u201d  Beginning in fiscal year 2015, FRPP expanded to 12 the number of  disposal methods agencies could report such as loss due to disaster,  abandonment, deterioration, exchange, return to host nation/tribe, or  reversion to prior owner.", "Demolition: Landholding agencies may demolish low value buildings  or buildings where the estimated cost of continued care and handling  exceeds any projected proceeds that might result from sale. For  example, the Coast Guard reported that 56 percent of its disposals  were through demolition. Its Shore Divestiture Program directed local  managers during fiscal years 2011 through 2015 to focus on  disposing of real property that no longer met mission needs and  determining the most appropriate method, including demolition, for  buildings with no commercial value.", "Other: Building disposals using methods not falling within the  categories in the FRPP reporting guidance are reported as \u201cother.\u201d  We asked officials from federal entities we met with to identify the  actual methods for building disposals that they had reported to FRPP  as \u201cother.\u201d Generally, agency officials were either unable to identify  the specific disposal methods for these buildings or only able to  identify the specific disposal methods for a small portion of these  building disposals. The expanded number of reporting categories  added is fiscal year 2015 should reduce the percentage of disposals  reported as \u201cother\u201d and provide more understanding of the disposal  methods being used.", "Sale: Federal entities may dispose of buildings through two types of  sale: (1) a negotiated sale to state or local governments or (2) a public  sale to a non-government entity. Public sales are competitive and  generally conducted through a sealed bid or auction. USPS\u2019s disposal  authority allows it to dispose of buildings through sale without  considering other forms of disposal as required for most federal  entities, and all of its disposals were done through sales. The small  fraction of buildings the other 20 entities disposed of by sale suggests  that many buildings held by these entities may not have been suitable  for sale. For example, Forest Service officials said that the age,  location, and condition of many of the buildings they disposed of\u2013\u2013 along with the lack of practical or economic value\u2013\u2013made demolition  the preferred disposal method rather than sale.", "Federal Transfer: When buildings become excess to the needs of a  federal entity\u2019s mission, the building is generally first offered for use by  another federal entity.

USPS and GSA retained proceeds from all of their building sales  but GSA\u2019s use of those proceeds was restricted to specific purposes. Of  these five federal entities, USPS reported the highest aggregate proceeds  of $446 million and retained proceeds from all 111 of its building  disposals. GSA reported a total of about $89 million in proceeds from its  68 building sales during the 5-year period. FRPP does not require federal  entities to report which authority under which they disposed of buildings.  As a result, the other three agencies could not easily provide information  on the proceeds retained from disposals using their authority but reported  about $22 million in proceeds from the 448 building sales over the 5 year  period. (See fig. 7).", "Figure 7 compares gross proceeds from three federal entities\u2019 building  disposal sales with those of USPS and GSA during the same time frame  and shows that, in general, sales of USPS buildings resulted in larger  gross proceeds than those of the other four federal entities combined.  Accordingly, USPS\u2019s reported aggregate gross proceeds for its 111  buildings sales was more than four times greater than the aggregate  gross proceeds reported by the other four federal entities for their  collective 516 disposals during the same time period.", "We found that in some cases FRPP data could not be used to quantify  proceeds for individual buildings. For 194 building sales in our 5-year time  frame, the reported gross proceeds field in FRPP was recorded as zero.  However, if a building disposal sale involved a facility comprised of  multiple buildings, the disposing entity may have been unable to  disaggregate the facility\u2019s sales price by asset. In such cases, the  reported gross proceeds of the sale could be assigned to one of the  buildings while entering the gross proceeds for the others as zero. For  example, in one instance, the Coast Guard assigned the $185,101 in  gross proceeds resulting from one disposal transaction that included 2  housing units and 6 other land and structure assets to one of the housing  units, while the other housing unit and other assets were assigned zero  gross proceeds. As a result it is not possible to determine the results of  buildings disposed of by sale on an asset-by-asset level using FRPP  data.", "The variation among the amount of gross proceeds and the number of  disposals among the federal entities may generally reflect the type of real  estate portfolio the federal entity held. For example, among the federal  entities included in figure 7, the Forest Service, with its portfolio of  smaller, remotely located buildings, accounted for 55 percent of all  buildings disposed of by sale but only 2 percent of the proceeds.

The proceeds are generally co-mingled with other  funds that meet the purpose of the specified account, and each account  has its own statutory requirements for obligation of the funds.

Some of these entities have implemented a formal  mechanism to identify mission needs. For example, USPS is adjusting the  size of its building portfolio to meet changing market conditions. As part of  an effort to optimize its operations, USPS has conducted area mail  processing reviews and node studies to identify buildings that are excess  to its needs. Similarly, DOE guidance for real property asset  management emphasizes that real property must be necessary to meet  program missions, and that real property assets, including buildings, that  are excess to mission needs should be identified for reuse or disposal.  According to this guidance, plans for real property assets are to be  documented and kept current by DOE sites in 5-year real property  planning and budgeting documentation.", "Other officials discussed how the disposal decisions may be initiated by  program or local offices of the federal entity. For example, FAA officials  stated that program offices identify buildings for disposal based on  mission need and that some of these decisions are made at the local  level, though approved through headquarters. Likewise, Forest Service  officials indicated that disposal decisions about buildings of little or no  value are sometimes made at the local or district level.", "In some cases, a federal entity is not making the disposal decision  because it is directed in law to dispose of property. For example, in 2013,  DOE conveyed land and 76 buildings to a non-profit organization in New  Mexico for research, education and scientific purposes, as provided in the  Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009.", "Officials from 5 of the 12 federal entities we interviewed told us that  funding to initiate the disposal process would be helpful to address the  upfront costs of disposal, including those related to maintenance and  environmental remediation. Officials from these 5 entities said that  broader authority to retain and use proceeds from disposals may help  address these disposal costs. When a federal entity other than GSA  disposes of a building, the proceeds are typically deposited into the U.S.  Treasury as miscellaneous receipts, unless a specific authority provides  otherwise. As such, although an entity invested financial resources to  initiate and execute the disposal process, proceeds generated by a  building sale are generally not available to the entity to recover those  costs. Those costs may include remediation of environmental issues such  as lead paint and hazardous waste contamination prior to disposing of a  building and can be very costly. Other upfront costs can include studies to  determine historic preservation requirements and improvements to the  physical conditions of buildings to make them marketable. Many of the  retention authorities identified by the 15 federal entities do not address  upfront costs, such as maintenance or other work necessary to put the  property on the market or to transfer it to another entity. These funds  generally come from the entity\u2019s operations and maintenance account,  meaning that preparing a building for disposal competes with ongoing  program requirements for funding. Officials at one federal entity noted  that they have delayed the disposal of such buildings if it meant less  funding for higher priorities. Legislation introduced in the 114th Congress  could address entities\u2019 concerns about upfront costs.  If enacted, the  Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016 would authorize OMB to  dispose of real property recommended for disposal by a Public Buildings  Reform Board.  As proposed, that act would authorize appropriations, as  well as proceeds from disposal, subject to appropriations, to be used to  cover upfront costs related to disposal, among other things.", "Disposal authorities themselves do little to address the other most cited  disposal challenge, a building\u2019s location, which may limit the interest in  the property or the ability to dispose of it. As discussed earlier, some  excess buildings on federal lands must be relocated by the acquiring  party if the underlying land is not sold. Likewise, landlocked buildings  inside a federal campus such as a VA medical center draw limited private  sector interest\u2014in some cases because the land cannot be disposed of  with the building. Having independent statutory disposal authority does  not address the challenges faced by federal entities when disposing of  buildings in landlocked or remote locations, where buyer interest is  limited.", "DOE officials indicated that they would like to have additional authority to  lease federally-owned buildings under DOE\u2019s control to other parties.  This authority would provide them with the opportunity to generate  revenue from facilities that are currently underutilized or unutilized, but  which they do not consider eligible for disposal because the facilities may  be needed for mission-related activities in the future.  Similarly, VA  officials indicated that expanding its EUL authority beyond the current  limitation of supportive housing would provide additional opportunities for  reuse and repurposing of underutilized and unutilized buildings, though  this expansion may not result in additional disposals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided copies of the draft report to GSA and USPS for comment  prior to finalizing the report.

Because some disposal authority statutes apply at the CFO Act agency  level and others apply at a component level, we used 2014 FRPP data to  identify which components of CFO Act agencies\u2019 owned buildings. In  total, we identified 59 components of the 22 agencies surveyed that  owned buildings, and therefore could have disposal authority. The CFO  Act agencies completed the survey for the components we identified.", "For those entities reporting disposal authorities, we asked for the legal  citations granting these authorities. We then reviewed and analyzed these  statutory authorities. We also reviewed the Property Act and the  authorities provided to the United States Postal Service. We only  reviewed authorities reported by surveyed entities. We did not verify if  additional authorities might exist. We used this analysis to determine  which federal entities fell within the scope of the review. In addition, we  also analyzed the content of the authorities reported through the survey to  identify the scope of the reported authorities and categorize them into  several broad categories, particularly in terms of any limitations they may  include regarding disposal and retention of proceeds such as specific  programs, locations or use of retained proceeds, among others. We also  interviewed agency officials about the scope and applicability of these  authorities, and the extent to which they were utilized during the fiscal  year 2011 through 2015 time frame. We summarized these authorities in  a detailed summary, which may be found in appendix II.", "To determine the federal entities\u2019 use of disposal authorities during fiscal  years 2011 through 2015 and using the same survey instrument, we  asked entities to report the number of buildings they disposed of during  the fiscal year 2011 through 2015 time frame using their disposal  authority. We also asked the federal entities to report if they retained  proceeds from their building disposals. We also obtained Federal Real  Property Profile (FRPP) data for fiscal years 2011 through 2015 from the  General Services Administration (GSA), which collects and maintains the  data, and reviewed FRPP guidance. For our analysis of FRPP data for  this engagement, we removed the Department of Defense buildings from  government-wide building data. In addition, we included only those  buildings located in the United States, that were reported disposed during  fiscal years 2011 through 2015. We used these data to determine: the  total number of building disposals that civilian CFO Act federal entities  conducted, the types of disposal methods they used, the number for  which they reported gross proceeds, and the aggregate amount of those  proceeds. We compared our analysis of the FRPP data with the disposal  numbers reported by the entities we surveyed and asked the entities to  reconcile differences between their survey responses and FRPP data  where they existed. We assessed the reliability of FRPP data by: (1)  performing electronic testing of data elements; (2) reviewing existing  information about the data and the system that produced them; and (3)  interviewing officials knowledgeable about the data. We have identified  weaknesses in FRPP data in the past specifically related to selected data  fields which we did not include in the analysis for this review. In  instances where data errors were reported by a federal entity, we noted  the errors, made corrections, and performed our data analysis once  again. The differences in the results of the analysis were not significant  enough to change the outcome of the analysis. We found that the data  were generally reliable for our purposes, which were to identify the  number of buildings disposed of by those entities with independent  disposal authority, and the extent to which the disposing federal entities  retained proceeds from disposal activities.", "To identify the factors which drive building disposals, and identify what  additional authority officials believed could help facilitate disposals, we  interviewed officials from 11 federal entities with the authority to both  dispose of buildings and retain proceeds from such disposals. We also  interviewed officials at one federal entity with the authority to dispose of  buildings but without the authority to retain proceeds, and one federal  entity with neither authority. We asked these federal entities how they  prioritized building disposals and how their disposal authority may have  influenced their priorities. We also discussed the scope and use of their  authorities for building disposals during fiscal years 2011 through 2015  and reviewed entities\u2019 disposal guidance.", "We obtained more detailed information from four of the seven federal  entities that used their disposal authority during fiscal years 2011 through  2015. We selected three to five disposals from each federal entity based  on building value, size, location and year of sale. We used this  information to characterize the agencies\u2019 disposal priorities and  processes, gather information on proceeds retained from disposals,  identify challenges to conducting building disposals, and to provide  illustrative examples for this report. The information from these specific  disposals is not generalizable to all building disposals.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2016 to December  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
