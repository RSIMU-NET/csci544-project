GAO was asked to review the effectiveness of the Commerce OIG's oversight. GAO's objectives were to provide information on the Commerce OIG's budgets, staffing, and accomplishments, and to review the OIG's effectiveness in providing audit coverage, addressing hotline complaints, and addressing employee concerns identified in OPM's annual FEVS.", "For fiscal years 2011 through 2013, GAO identified the budget and staff resources of the Commerce OIG and other cabinet-level OIGs and their reported accomplishments for comparison; reviewed the Commerce OIG's audit coverage of bureaus and offices, management challenges, and high-risk areas; compared the OIG's hotline policies with hotline guidance provided through CIGIE; and tested a random sample of hotline complaints.

The Commerce OIG had a decline of full-time equivalent staff from 171 to 137, or about 20 percent, which was a greater decline than the average decline of about 5 percent for the other OIGs. The Commerce OIG reported approximately $543 million in monetary accomplishments from audits, evaluations, and investigations for the period. Differences in missions and programs of the cabinet-level departments and agencies result in varied opportunities for OIGs to provide monetary accomplishments. While the Commerce OIG's return on each budget dollar was within the range of the lowest and highest returns for all other OIGs for fiscal years 2011 through 2013, its average return of $4.18 over the 3-year period was less than the average return of about $22.64 for the other cabinet-level OIGs.", "During this period of constrained resources, the Commerce OIG conducted mandatory audits that covered all bureaus and offices and provided performance audit coverage of Commerce's largest bureaus and offices. It also audited areas identified by the OIG as management challenges. However, the OIG did not conduct performance audits of the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of programs specific to Commerce's smaller bureaus and offices, which had combined fiscal year 2013 total budgetary resources of approximately $2.4 billion, during the 3-year period. In addition, the OIG did not conduct audits over the 3-year period of two areas on GAO's high-risk list relevant to Commerce: (1) managing federal real property and (2) ensuring the effective protection of technologies critical to U.S. national security interests. The OIG's risk-based audit planning contributed to gaps in audit coverage as the office did not provide periodic performance audit coverage of Commerce's smaller programs on a rotational basis and did not fully consider all GAO high-risk areas.", "The Commerce OIG's hotline policies and procedures were generally consistent with recommended hotline practices of other OIGs provided through the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE). However, through a review of a random sample of OIG hotline cases from fiscal years 2011 through 2013, GAO identified numerous instances where the OIG did not follow one or more of its own hotline policies and procedures regarding the processing, disposition, and timeliness of hotline cases. The OIG could not reasonably ensure that its hotline policies and procedures were consistently followed because of a lack of ongoing monitoring of its internal control activities.", "The Commerce OIG's Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) results for 2013 and 2014 improved after OIG efforts to address the poor 2012 FEVS results, but responses to specific survey questions remain lower than the government-wide average.

However, while similar in purpose to  performance audits, evaluations are not specifically required by the IG Act  and are not a substitute for audit coverage. In addition, there are  fundamental differences in the standards of each that affect the breadth  and depth of the reviews.

In addition, auditing standards require external  quality reviews of audit practices, or peer reviews, on a 3-year cycle by  reviewers independent of the OIG.

Table 9 shows the estimated percentage of exceptions we  found in each of these areas for fiscal years 2011 through 2013.", "In testing our 2011 sample, we found exceptions to the Commerce OIG\u2019s  policy to assign unique, sequential case numbers to hotline complaints.  This number is the official means of identifying a case and its  corresponding complaint documentation. During 2011, the OIG received a  large number of complaints related to sweepstakes scams. Rather than  log and dispose of each complaint individually, as called for in the policy,  management instructed staff to compile complaints and enter them into  the electronic case management system under one overall case number.  Based upon our testing, we estimate that 9 percent of the cases from  fiscal years 2011 through 2013 were not assigned a unique, sequential  case number, contrary to policy.have been the same, they were from different complainants with  allegations directed at different persons and required unique case  numbers. Compiling similar but unique complaints into a single case   While the nature of the allegations may  number inhibits the OIG from efficiently and effectively tracking  complaints received by the office and increases the risk that complaints  will be handled inconsistently.", "Based on our sample selected from the 3 years of hotline complaints, we  estimate that about 37 percent of disposition codes were not assigned to  complaints in accordance with the definitions in the OIG\u2019s hotline policies  and procedures in effect at the time. Most, but not all, of the complaints  that we identified as having the wrong code assigned were ultimately  treated in accordance with the disposition procedures called for in the  hotline policies. However, when complaints are not assigned the correct  code, the risk that a hotline complaint may not be appropriately referred  increases, and the potential exists that wrongdoing associated with  complaints may not be fully addressed. To illustrate, one complaint was  received from a private citizen who reported the suspected falsification of  federal student loan documents. The OIG\u2019s hotline review resulted in a  decision to assign a disposition code of \u201cU\u201d because the matter was  unrelated to Commerce and thus no further action was taken. However,  even though the complaint was unrelated to Commerce, enough  information was provided for the complaint to have been assigned a code  of \u201cO\u201d and forwarded to an external entity or federal agency that manages  student loans for possible action, consistent with the OIG\u2019s hotline  policies. OIG staff stated that during fiscal year 2012 the Assistant IG for  Investigations changed the disposition codes and consolidated several  codes. This change was abandoned in fiscal year 2013 and was never  reflected in written policies because it was determined to have negatively  affected the OIG\u2019s ability to report hotline complaint information. This  change of practice caused many of the exceptions we found related to  improper disposition codes in our testing of the 2012 sample. The hotline  staff agreed that the disposition codes we identified as exceptions were  not assigned in accordance with written policy.", "The OIG\u2019s hotline policies and procedures in effect at the time of our  testing required hotline staff to process complaints within specified time  frames to ensure that the complaints were handled timely. After receiving  the complaints, hotline staff were to enter them into the electronic case  management system within 24 hours and to assign a disposition code to  each case within 5 business days of receipt. Cases to be disposed of as  a referral required staff to refer each case within 5 business days after  determination of its disposition. Over the 3-year period, (1) an estimated 7  percent of cases were not entered within 24 hours, (2) an estimated 42  percent of the complaints were not assigned a disposition code within the  required time frames, and (3) an estimated 4 percent of the cases  assigned for referral to another Commerce component were not sent  within 5 days.sample was 23 days. If complaints are not handled in a timely manner,  the hotline operation\u2019s effectiveness and efficiency may be diminished.", "The longest period for assigning a disposition code in our  CIGIE\u2019s Quality Standards for Federal Offices of Inspector General  requires OIGs to establish and implement internal control activities to  ensure that their directives are carried out. However, while the  Commerce OIG has hotline policies and procedures, it has not developed  certain internal control activities to help provide reasonable assurance  that its own policies and procedures are consistently implemented.  Specifically, the OIG does not provide ongoing monitoring of its hotline  policies and procedures in the course of normal operations, which is to be  performed continually and ingrained in the OIG\u2019s operations, to help  reasonably assure that those policies and procedures are being followed.  The CIGIE standards for monitoring internal controls include self- assessment evaluations, periodic reviews of control design, and direct  testing of internal controls.", "Because OIGs evaluate how well agency programs and operations are  functioning, they have a special responsibility to reasonably assure that  their own operations are as effective as possible. Hotline complainants,  including whistle-blowers, play an important role in safeguarding the  federal government against fraud, waste, and abuse, and their willingness  to come forward can contribute to improvements in government  operations. Without effective internal control activities for its hotline  operations, the Commerce OIG is vulnerable to increased risk that  complaints of fraud, waste, abuse, or mismanagement received through  its hotline may not be handled effectively."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Commerce OIG\u2019s FEVS Results Have Improved, but Employee Concerns Remain", "paragraphs": ["OPM\u2019s FEVS asks questions of federal employees related to specific  topic areas, the responses to which determine how well the federal  government is managing its human resources and give senior managers  employee perspectives on agency management.

In the 2012 FEVS results, the  Commerce OIG employee responses to 43 of 71 survey questions had a  higher percentage of negative responses than the government-wide  average. (See app. III.) The responses for the remaining 28 questions  were either at the government-wide average or had lower percentages of  negative responses compared to the government-wide average. The  Commerce OIG\u2019s 2012 FEVS results were used by the Partnership for  Public Service to rank the Commerce OIG at 291 out of 292 other  subcomponent offices in the federal government.", "Through the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, the  Congress established a requirement for agencies to annually survey their  employees to assess employee satisfaction and employees\u2019 views of  leadership and management practices. The FEVS measures employees\u2019 perceptions of whether, and to what extent, conditions that  characterize successful organizations are present in their agencies. The  survey (1) provides general indicators of how well the federal government  is running its human resources management systems, (2) serves as a  tool for OPM to assess individual agencies and their progress on strategic  management of human capital and (3) gives senior managers critical  information to assist them in determining what they can do to improve  their agency\u2019s effectiveness. The FEVS is administered to full-time and  part-time, permanent, non-seasonal employees of departments and large  agencies, small/independent agencies, and subcomponents of larger  agencies, such as the Commerce OIG, that choose to participate in the  survey.", "As part of the annual requirement to survey their employees, federal  agencies are to assess (1) leadership and management practices that  contribute to agency performance and (2) employee satisfaction with  leadership policies and practices, work environment, rewards and  recognition for professional accomplishment and personal contributions to  achieving organizational mission, opportunity for professional  development and growth, and opportunity to contribute to achieving  organizational mission. OPM regulations for implementing the mandatory  employee survey prescribe survey questions that must appear on each  agency\u2019s employee survey. The FEVS is completed annually and  includes the same questions each year, but OPM may include agency- specific questions at the request of the agency.", "The Commerce OIG made efforts to address the issues identified in the  2012 FEVS results and the FEVS results for it in subsequent years have  improved, as did the ranking of the Commerce OIG by the Partnership for  Public Service for fiscal years 2013 and 2014. The OIG\u2019s 2013 FEVS  results had 9 out of 71 survey questions with a higher percentage of  negative responses than the government-wide average and the 2014  results had 11 such questions. However, even with these improved FEVS  responses, the Partnership for Public Service ranked the Commerce OIG  at 281 out of 300 subcomponent agencies in fiscal year 2013 and at 262  out of 315 subcomponent agencies in fiscal year 2014, indicating that  OIG employee responses remain significantly more negative than the  government-wide average for specific questions.", "OPM provides guidance to agencies on how to address the FEVS  responses that indicate the need for corrective actions. The guidance  includes steps to address areas where weaknesses are indicated and  develop an action plan with measures of success. These steps direct the  agency to (1) identify the issues, (2) set goals, (3) identify staff resources  to assist, (4) develop the action plan, (5) implement the action plan, and  (6) monitor and evaluate the implementation. The Commerce OIG  followed much of the OPM guidance to address the 2012 FEVS results  but lacked an action plan with measures of success. Specifically, the OIG  evaluated the survey questions to identify issues; set goals that  addressed leadership, morale, training, and communication; identified  staff to participate in the efforts to address the FEVS responses; and  developed 86 recommendations to meet the identified goals. In addition,  the OIG took actions to address and monitor the completion of most of  the recommendations developed by its staff. However, the OIG did not  develop an action plan with measurements to determine whether the  employees\u2019 concerns were successfully addressed. GAO\u2019s prior work has  identified attributes relevant to these action plans, including a measurable  target\u2014to determine whether performance measures have quantifiable,  numerical targets or other measurable values, where appropriate. Action  plans with attributes of successful metrics could allow the OIG to better  determine whether its goals were successfully met.", "Some of the FEVS questions with a higher percentage of negative  responses than the government-wide average have particular significance  when they occur in an OIG. OIGs have a responsibility to report on  current performance and accountability and to foster sound program  management to help ensure effective government operations. When an  OIG\u2019s own operations are not as effective as possible, recommendations  to other offices may not be viewed as credible. To illustrate, the  responses to the following FEVS questions had a higher percentage of  negative responses than the government-wide average for all 3 years we  reviewed:  \u201cMy talents are used well in the workplace.\u201d  \u201cI know what to do to be rated higher.\u201d  \u201cI recommend my organization as a good place to work.\u201d  \u201cConsidering everything how satisfied are you with your  organization?\u201d", "Also, in the 2014 FEVS results the OIG employees had a higher  percentage of negative responses to the following question: \u201cProhibited  personnel practices are not tolerated.\u201d", "Allegations of prohibited personnel practices by the OIG\u2019s senior  leadership during fiscal year 2011 were investigated by the Office of  Special Counsel (OSC).
