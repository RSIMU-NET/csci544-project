Advisory committee meetings can include both standing and temporary members. Temporary members only serve for a particular meeting. GAO was asked to examine FDA's advisory committee processes. GAO reported on (1) how FDA recruited individuals for membership and evaluated candidates for potential conflicts of interest, (2) barriers that were reported to recruiting qualified individuals to serve on committees, and (3) the proportion of standing and temporary members, and the frequency with which members with conflict of interest determinations participated in meetings. GAO reviewed FDA advisory committee policies and analyzed meeting records for FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), and Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). GAO also interviewed individuals familiar with FDA's committee member recruiting process. GAO did not examine the effects of changes in FDA's advisory committee processes resulting from the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 and 2007 FDA policy revisions as it was too soon to assess them."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the FDA Amendments Act of 2007, FDA employed several methods to recruit candidates for advisory committees and to evaluate candidates by prescreening them for potential conflicts of interest. FDA recruited candidates by announcing vacancies in the Federal Register, distributing recruitment brochures at advisory committee meetings and national meetings, word-of-mouth or asking current advisory committee members, and posting recruitment and conflict of interest information on FDA's Web site. To evaluate advisory committee candidates for conflicts of interest, FDA reviewed the candidates' curricula vitae and usually conducted a prescreening interview. FDA employed many of the same recruitment and evaluation practices used by organizations previously identified by GAO as employing methods that could ensure an independent and balanced advisory committee. FDA faced barriers to recruiting qualified advisory committee candidates, particularly those without potential conflicts of interest, according to FDA officials and former FDA advisory committee members. However, GAO found that the agency may have been able to mitigate these barriers by expanding its outreach efforts. FDA staff and former FDA advisory committee members GAO interviewed generally agreed that individuals with the expertise FDA sought for its advisory committees were the same leading experts that industry sought to conduct research. In addition, word-of-mouth--the advisory committee member recruitment method FDA officials generally agreed was most effective--was limited in the number of candidate nominations it could generate. The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 modifies FDA's process for prescreening candidates for committee membership. Standing and temporary members were 58 and 42 percent, respectively, of the 1,218 participants in the 83 advisory committee meetings held by CBER, CDER, and CDRH in 2004 and 2006 that GAO reviewed. FDA may permit an advisory committee member who has a conflict of interest, or an appearance of a conflict, and whose expertise is needed to participate in an advisory committee meeting under certain circumstances by granting a conflict of interest determination. More than half of the meetings had at least one standing or temporary member with at least one conflict of interest determination. The 200 members found to have at least one conflict of interest determination represented about 16 percent of all 83 meetings' participants. The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 limits the number of certain conflict of interest determinations that FDA can grant and FDA's conflict of interest policy revisions limit the amount of the disqualifying financial interests. In its comments on a draft of this report, HHS noted that on August 4, 2008, after GAO provided the draft report for its review, FDA issued four final guidance documents concerning management of its advisory committees. HHS also provided additional clarifications about aspects of FDA's advisory committees. GAO revised the report to cite the final guidances and to incorporate HHS's clarifications where appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for ensuring the  safety and efficacy of drugs, biological products, and medical devices the  American public uses every day. FDA convenes scientific advisory  committees to provide independent expertise and technical assistance to  help the agency make decisions about the development and evaluation of  products regulated by FDA. Advisory committees include standing  members, who are appointed by FDA to serve a specified term on an  advisory committee, and may include temporary members, who are  selected by FDA to serve at only one specific meeting. Other individuals  that may contribute to the advisory committee meeting discussion include  guest speakers, such as researchers who are invited to present scientific  papers and individuals who speak on behalf of the companies whose  products are at issue. Members of the public are also allowed to speak  during an open public hearing portion of the advisory committee meeting.  The advisory committees\u2019 recommendations are not binding on the  agency, but the agency usually follows the advisory committees\u2019 advice.", "Some advisory committee members might have financial conflicts of  interest for all or part of a committee meeting depending on the issues or  products to be discussed. Conflicts of interest, for example, might include  a member having financial investments in a drug manufacturer whose  product is under review. While some conflicts of interest could require  that a member be prohibited from participating in a meeting, FDA may  permit a member to participate in advisory committee meeting discussions  under certain circumstances by granting waivers of the statutory  prohibition on participation. FDA can also authorize a member to  participate when the statutory conflict of interest prohibition would not  have been violated, but there is the appearance of a conflict of interest,  such that the member\u2019s impartiality involving the committee meeting\u2019s  discussions could be questioned. For purposes of this report, both types of  decisions are called conflict of interest determinations. FDA has been  criticized about how it recruits qualified individuals for its advisory  committees and how it grants some conflict of interest determinations  allowing members with conflicts of interest to participate in committee  meetings. FDA maintains that its advisory committee members are  preeminent scientists in their field, and that it is inevitable that some of  these experts will have grants from, and contracts with, the regulated  industries, which could constitute a potential conflict of interest or  present the appearance of partiality. FDA asserts that its ability to make  conflict of interest determinations is essential to its effort to access the  most expert medical and scientific advice available. Others contend,  however, that the objectivity of the advice and recommendations given by  FDA advisory committees can be affected by the involvement of conflicted  members.", "You have expressed interest in information about how FDA identified,  recruited, and prescreened qualified candidates and about FDA\u2019s use of  standing and temporary members and the extent these members received  conflict of interest determinations. In this report we describe (1) how FDA  recruited individuals for advisory committee membership and evaluated  candidates by prescreening them for potential conflicts of interest,   (2) barriers that were reported to recruiting qualified individuals to serve  on FDA advisory committees, particularly candidates without potential  conflicts of interest, and (3) the proportion of standing and temporary  members in advisory committee meetings, and the frequency with which  members with one or more conflict of interest determinations participated  in advisory committee meetings.", "To report on these issues, we reviewed the Department of Health and  Human Services\u2019 (HHS) and FDA\u2019s advisory committee regulations,  policies, and guidances. We also reviewed the federal conflict of interest  statutes and the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) regulations. We  interviewed FDA\u2019s Advisory Committee Oversight and Management Staff  (ACOMS) and Ethics and Integrity Staff (EIS). We also interviewed staff  such as executive secretaries, who manage advisory committees; review  division directors; and advisory committee management staff from the  three FDA centers that we analyzed: the Center for Biologics Evaluation  and Research (CBER), which regulates biological products such as blood  and vaccines; the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER),  which regulates drugs; and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health  (CDRH), which regulates medical devices and radiological products. We  chose to analyze these three centers because most of FDA\u2019s advisory  committees were affiliated with them\u2014and these centers\u2019 advisory  committee meetings represented more than 80 percent of the total FDA  advisory committee meetings held in 2004 and 2006.", "To examine how FDA recruited individuals for advisory committee  membership and prescreened candidates for potential conflicts of interest,  in addition to interviews with FDA officials, we interviewed  representatives from selected advocacy organizations that participate in  nominating candidates for advisory committee membership, such as the  Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and  Public Citizen\u2019s Health Research Group. We compared FDA\u2019s recruitment  and prescreening methods to the methods used by the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Academies, organizations we  identified in 2004 as employing specific recruitment and prescreening  methods that could ensure independent and balanced advisory  committees. We updated our information on EPA\u2019s and the National  Academies\u2019 recruitment and prescreening methods through interviews  with agency officials.", "To examine barriers that were reported to recruiting qualified individuals  to serve on FDA advisory committees, particularly candidates without  potential conflicts of interest, we interviewed individuals and groups  familiar with FDA\u2019s advisory committee recruitment processes and  officials from organizations we identified in 2004 as employing specific  recruitment methods that could ensure independent and balanced  advisory committees. Individuals interviewed included current and former  FDA staff; former CBER, CDER, and CDRH advisory committee members;  staff involved with the advisory committee process at EPA, the National  Institutes of Health (NIH), and the National Academies; and staff from the  Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), PhRMA, and  consumer advocacy groups that have taken a position on FDA\u2019s  nomination and selection processes for advisory committee members.", "To determine the proportion of participants in advisory committee  meetings who were standing members or temporary members and the  proportion of those members who received conflict of interest  determinations, we analyzed advisory committee meetings held by CBER,  CDER, and CDRH\u2014the three FDA centers with both the most advisory  committees and the most committee meetings. We did not examine FDA\u2019s  other centers\u2019 advisory committee meetings. Beginning in November 2005,  FDA was required to post information on its Web site about the conflict of  interest waivers it granted that allowed certain members to participate in  meetings. We chose to review the committee meetings held in 2004 and  2006\u20142 years with the most recent data when we began our work\u2014 because (1) 2004 was the last full year before FDA began to post waiver  information in 2005, and (2) 2006 was the first full year in which the waiver  information had to be posted. We excluded 2005 from the analysis because  it was the year the Web site posting requirement began. We reviewed  FDA\u2019s advisory committee meeting records and conflict of interest  determination records and assessed the reliability of these data by (1)  reviewing existing information about the data and (2) interviewing agency  officials knowledgeable about the data. We found that the data were  sufficiently reliable for our analysis.", "During the course of our work, two major actions occurred that changed  FDA\u2019s recruitment and conflict of interest policies. In March 2007, FDA  issued a draft advisory committee guidance that revises FDA\u2019s policy on  how it screens individuals to determine if they have conflicts of interest  for a specific advisory committee meeting. In addition, Congress amended  the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to include, among other  provisions, a section addressing recruitment, prescreening, and conflicts  of interest, which took effect on October 1, 2007. At the time of our  review, it was too soon to assess the effect of the changes on FDA\u2019s  processes. Consequently, this report focuses on FDA\u2019s organization,  processes, and conflict of interest determinations as documented prior to  the 2007 actions. Appendix I describes these policy actions in greater  detail and we note FDA procedures that have been affected by them  throughout the report. Appendix II provides a more detailed explanation  of the scope and methodology for this report. We conducted our work  from October 2006 through September 2008 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["FDA uses advisory committees to provide expert advice and make  recommendations to help the agency reach regulatory decisions,  particularly concerning controversial issues or new products. FDA  advisory committees are subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act  (FACA), which requires that committee memberships be fairly balanced in  terms of views presented and the functions to be performed by the  advisory committee. FDA advisory committees have charters that explain  the purpose of the committee and specify the number of standing  committee members and the expertise needed by the members. FDA  advisory committee members can be medical professionals, scientists,  researchers, industry leaders, consumers, and patients. At an advisory  committee meeting, committee members generally meet publicly to  discuss and evaluate information about a specific issue. Depending on  the issues or products to be discussed at a committee meeting, a  committee member may have a potential financial conflict of interest. In  that event, FDA decides whether the member\u2019s expertise is needed for  discussing those issues or products, and if so, whether the member should  be granted a conflict of interest determination\u2014a waiver or an appearance  authorization\u2014to participate in the meeting. The members who do  participate in the committee meeting may make recommendations to  FDA\u2014by voting or by consensus through discussions\u2014that are  nonbinding on the agency. (See app. III.)", "FDA Advisory Committees  FDA has 31 advisory committees that are administratively attached to FDA  centers or to the Office of the Commissioner. Most of the advisory  committees\u201425\u2014are attached to three FDA centers: CDER has 16  committees, CBER has 5, and CDRH has 4. (See app. IV.) Advisory  committees usually meet as individual committees but may meet jointly to  consider issues involving shared interests. Joint committee meetings may  involve two advisory committees from the same center or from two  different centers depending on the issue to be discussed. Advisory  committees may also have subcommittees that meet to review specific  information that may be presented later to the full advisory committee."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Conflict of Interest Provisions May Permit Member Participation", "paragraphs": ["FDA may permit an advisory committee member\u2014standing or  temporary\u2014who has a conflict of interest and whose expertise is needed,  to participate in a meeting under certain circumstances. There are four  conflict of interest determinations\u2014three statutory waivers and an  appearance authorization as provided for in OGE regulations\u2014that FDA  can use to permit members with a conflict of interest or the appearance of  a conflict of interest to participate.", "Federal law prohibits federal employees, including SGEs, from personally  and substantially participating in an advisory committee meeting involving  a particular matter that would have a direct and predictable effect on the  employee\u2019s financial interest or the interests of others specified by law. In  determining whether an FDA advisory committee meeting involves a  particular matter, FDA officials told us that they first consider each topic  to be discussed at the meeting and determine whether it involves specific  parties, a class of persons, or the interests of a large and diverse group of  people. If one of the meeting topics involves specific parties or a class of  persons, FDA officials then determine whether the advisory committee  members who will attend the meeting have any conflicts of interest or the  appearance of conflicts of interest involving that meeting topic. Officials  told us if they are uncertain whether a meeting topic is a particular matter,  the issue is referred to FDA\u2019s ACOMS and EIS. EIS may refer the issue to  HHS\u2019s general counsel which may also seek advice from the OGE. The law  has two waiver provisions that allow standing and temporary members to  participate in an advisory committee meeting if certain criteria are met.  One waiver\u2014known as a \u00a7 208(b)(3) waiver\u2014applies only to SGEs serving  on an advisory committee subject to FACA. When granting this waiver,  FDA certifies in writing in advance that the need for the SGE\u2019s services  outweighs the potential for a conflict of interest at a specific upcoming  meeting. Another type of waiver\u2014known as a \u00a7 208(b)(1) waiver\u2014 applies to federal employees generally, including SGEs and those not  employed by FDA but who are members of FDA committees. When  granting these waivers, FDA must determine that the interest involved is  not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the  services which the government may expect from that individual. FDA  may grant a member a full or a limited waiver\u2014a written certification\u2014to  allow participation in the meeting. A full waiver may allow a member to  participate in the discussions and to vote on recommendations. FDA may  also grant a limited waiver to allow a member to discuss but not to vote on  the recommendations. In addition, there are certain situations in which  the member\u2019s financial interest qualifies for an exemption from the  application of the conflict of interest statutes and regulations applicable to  federal employees, as provided by OGE regulations, and participation will  be permitted despite the outside interest.", "In addition to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208, there was a provision in the Food and Drug  Administration Modernization Act, in effect prior to October 2007, which  effectively prohibited CBER and CDER advisory committee members from  voting on committee meeting topics involving clinical investigations or  approvals of drugs or biologics in which the member or his or her  immediate family could gain financially from the committee\u2019s advice.  However, FDA could grant a waiver of this voting restriction\u2014known as  the \u00a7 355(n)(4) waiver\u2014to a member if FDA determined that his or her  participation was necessary to provide the committee with essential  expertise. No waiver could be granted if the meeting involved the  member\u2019s own scientific work, such as work done by the member to  develop a new drug being considered for approval by CDER.", "Finally, federal regulations require the consideration of the appearance of  a conflict of interest for advisory committee members who will be  participating in a specific-parties meeting when there are circumstances in  which the member\u2019s impartiality could be questioned. The appearance of  a conflict may be created when someone in the advisory committee  member\u2019s household has a financial interest that will likely be affected by  the committee\u2019s actions or when one of the parties involved in the meeting  has a close personal or professional relationship to the committee  member. To grant an appearance authorization, FDA determines that the  interest of the agency in the member\u2019s participation in an advisory  committee meeting\u2019s topic outweighs the concern that a reasonable  person with knowledge of the relevant facts would question the member\u2019s  impartiality in the matter before the advisory committee, which may call  into question the integrity of FDA\u2019s programs and operations.

On the  basis of the advisory committee meeting\u2019s topic and its designation, the  center review division involved in the advisory committee meeting  typically compiles a list of companies and products affected by the  meeting\u2019s topic. The advisory committee management staff then sends a  memorandum with the final list of companies and products and the FDA  Form 3410\u2014the FDA financial disclosure form\u2014to the advisory  committee members.

If there are further questions about  whether the determination should be granted, advice may be sought from  FDA\u2019s ACOMS and EIS. ACOMS and EIS review all conflict of interest  determinations before their final approval. The final decision to grant or  deny a determination is made by the FDA Associate Commissioner for  Policy and Planning.

In October  2007, FDA announced draft guidance to implement agencywide  procedures for the public disclosure of (1) the type, nature, and magnitude  of any financial conflict of interest for which an advisory committee  member has been granted a waiver for a committee meeting on its Web  site, and (2) conflict of interest waivers that would be written so that  information protected from public disclosure would not appear in the  waivers and thus would not need to be redacted.

CDRH staff reported that searching the consultant pool  for a potential candidate is preferred because the executive secretary and  the review division are usually familiar with the individual\u2019s performance  on an advisory committee and the individual is familiar with the advisory  committee process.

Standing members of an FDA advisory committee  are expected to participate in all meetings held by that advisory committee  unless they are excluded from a meeting due to a conflict of interest. For  example, CDER\u2019s Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee held three  meetings in 2006.

As mentioned earlier, advisory committee  members complete financial disclosure forms before each advisory  committee meeting, and since November 2005 FDA has posted information  disclosing the nature and basis of advisory committee member conflict of  interest waivers on its Web site.", "The negative publicity surrounding certain advisory committee meetings,  especially media attention to some members\u2019 ties to industry, may have  also deterred some people from serving on FDA advisory committees.

The FDA official said people serving  on FDA advisory committees \u201cfeel like they are in fishbowls\u201d and are  concerned that they are considered tainted if they receive a conflict of  interest waiver. A representative from PhRMA echoed these concerns,  stating that many FDA advisory committees receive public scrutiny, which  may act as a disincentive for individuals to serve on committees.

Retired experts are no longer  employed and, therefore, may be less likely to have current ties to  industry. For example, a National Academies official we spoke with  explained that when the type of expertise needed for a committee lends  itself to inherently conflicted professionals\u2014for example, if a committee  focuses on the operations of drug manufacturers\u2014the organization could  seek an individual who is retired.

FDA noted that most of its advisory committee  members are already academicians. An AAMC official suggested that FDA  ask medical colleges to solicit their own staff to serve on FDA advisory  committees. He also told us that AAMC does not currently assist FDA with  advisory committee recruitment, but it would if asked. For example, he  said AAMC would be willing to post FDA advisory committee member  vacancies on its Web site at no cost.

According to some former advisory committee members, epidemiologists  and statisticians add expertise in data analysis to FDA advisory  committees. For example, biostatisticians could provide expertise in  interpreting clinical trial data. Representatives from two consumer  advocacy groups told us these individuals may be less likely than  clinicians to have conflicts of interest and may bring a different focus to  committee deliberations. According to these consumer interest group  representatives, the agency\u2019s advisory committees are overly weighted  towards clinicians and clinical trialists. One representative told us that  clinicians are more likely to have potential conflicts of interest because  they are more likely to have received industry funding, and another  representative said that they generally have a bias towards product  approval because they seek more options\u2014that is, drugs and medical  devices\u2014to help with diagnosis and treatment of their patients.

The act  requires FDA to develop and implement strategies to conduct outreach to  potential advisory committee candidates at universities and colleges, other  academic research centers, professional and medical societies, and patient  and consumer groups. FDA may also develop a new committee member  recruitment method, which would allow entities, such as universities and  other academic research centers, receiving funding from the National  Institutes of Health, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the Veterans Health  Administration, to identify a person whom FDA could contact about the  nomination of individuals to serve on advisory committees.

FDA would not grant a waiver in those circumstances  unless the FDA Commissioner determined a waiver was appropriate. Two  provisions of the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 affect conflict of interest  determinations.

Although an advisory  committee may have a regular meeting schedule, the advisory committee\u2019s  review division decides when an advisory committee meeting is needed.

The review division may determine that additional information  needs to be presented at an advisory committee meeting. The division can  select and invite guest speakers to make presentations and answer  questions before the committee. Guest speakers may, for example, be  members of other FDA advisory committees, individuals from a center\u2019s  consultant pool, federal employees from other agencies, or national or  international experts from outside FDA.

For other advisory committees, the review division considers  the topic to be discussed at a particular meeting when determining  whether it is necessary for a patient representative to serve at an advisory  committee meeting. Patient representatives usually serve on advisory  committees that focus on disease-specific topics such as reviews of  products and therapies for HIV/AIDS and cancer diagnosis and treatment.  When participating in CBER and CDER advisory committees\u2019 meetings,  patient representatives usually vote, but when participating in CDRH\u2019s  committee meetings, they do not vote.", "Who should be selected to make FDA\u2019s presentations at meetings?
