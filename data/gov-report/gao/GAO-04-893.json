The centerpiece of The Veterans Corporation's efforts remains its Veterans Entrepreneurial Training program, which offers classroom instruction to veterans on how to successfully start and expand their own businesses. It also has expanded or added several services primarily in the areas of finance, accounting, and contracting. However, The Veterans Corporation reported that it continues to face ongoing challenges to fulfilling its mission. These problems stem from its responsibility for the Professional Certification Advisory Board, difficulties in identifying the veteran-owned business population, and conflicting views about its legal status as a private versus public entity. Additionally, The Veterans Corporation lacked important internal or operational controls. Specifically, its strategic plan and annual report to Congress lacked measurable goals and outcome-oriented measures. Without outcome-oriented measures, such as the number of new veteran-owned businesses or the amount of revenue generated for veteran-owned businesses, it was difficult to determine what the impact of the programs on veterans has been. In the same vein, without meaningful performance measures, The Veterans Corporation has been unable to provide Congress with significant data on its progress or the outcomes of its efforts. Finally, The Veterans Corporation faces a number of challenges in achieving self-sufficiency. Dramatically lower-than-expected revenues have resulted in the corporation revising its currently estimated date for achieving self-sufficiency from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2009. Its self-sufficiency strategy is heavily dependent on its ability to develop a database of veteran-owned businesses and successfully marketing its services to these businesses. However, the plan did not discuss how The Veterans Corporation will identify this population or contain meaningful information on key assumptions underlying revenue projections. As such, it would be difficult for Congress and other stakeholders to judge the feasibility or reasonability of the corporation's estimates and projections."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year approximately 200,000 military service personnel transition to  civilian life.

As  mentioned in our earlier report, the program is a partnership with the  Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation\u2019s FastTrac Program, a successful  entrepreneurship-training program. The VET program incorporates  classroom instruction, mentoring, networking, and technology training.  Officials at The Veterans Corporation told us that the VET program was  their most successful effort to date. Since our last report, The Veterans  Corporation has expanded the number of class sites and locations for its  three VET courses: (1) The New Venture, which focuses on starting a  business; (2) The Planning Program, which focuses on expanding a  business; and (3) Listening to Your Business, a seminar which focuses on  assessing the health and market share of an existing business. In fiscal year  2003, The Veterans Corporation hosted 33 courses in eight states; 506  veterans participated in the program. Of the 506 participants, 458 graduated  in fiscal year 2003, which included 77 veterans that graduated from VET  courses held at local SBA-sponsored Small Business Development Centers.  These centers provide one-stop management and technical assistance to  individuals and small businesses at locations such as colleges and  universities.", "Additionally, some programs and services were still evolving to better  address Veterans Corporation mandates. For example, the organization has  refocused the Veterans Business Success Seminars, mentioned in our  previous report, to use community-based organizations (CBO), to help  veterans with training and services not currently available to veteran  entrepreneurs. A Veterans Corporation official stated that this new strategy  more consistently meets the mandate to establish and maintain a network  of information and assistance centers that veterans and the public can use.", "However, the refocused program, now called the National Veterans  Community-Based Organization Initiative, was still in its early stages. An  official at The Veterans Corporation stated that the purpose of the program  is to direct veterans to existing local service providers that offer assistance  to small businesses and identify and address gaps in service. For example,  The Veterans Corporation initially funded two CBOs, the Veteran Advocacy  Foundation in St. Louis, Missouri, and the American Veterans Coalition in  San Francisco, California, to survey the extent of entrepreneurial services  to veterans in their communities. After completing its survey, the St. Louis  CBO also received additional funding to implement its plan to enhance  entrepreneurial opportunities for veterans. A third CBO, Robert Morris  University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was also funded to survey the  availability of local business services to veterans in its community.", "According to officials at The Veterans Corporation, they were also  developing another program intended to address their mandate to organize  public and private resources to assist veterans with the formation and  expansion of small businesses. Officials first met to discuss the new  program, the National Veterans Entrepreneurial Education Initiative, in  April 2004. The intent of this effort is to leverage resources from the private  and public sectors to coordinate and focus (at a national level)  entrepreneurial education and educational assistance. The initial  participants included, but were not limited to, VA, SBA, and Small Business  Development Centers. The Veterans Corporation board chair explained  that besides education, other elements of this initiative might include  mentoring, counseling, and early-stage and advanced small business  training. At the time of our review, The Veterans Corporation was  developing a detailed concept paper on this initiative.", "Figure 1 shows the status of key initiatives that The Veterans Corporation  has undertaken.

As noted in our  previous report, Veterans Corporation officials said that they have been  careful not to duplicate existing services. Most of The Veterans  Corporation\u2019s programs were intended to fill gaps in federal services by  offering services that were either targeted specifically to veterans or  unavailable elsewhere. For example, the VET program provides small  business training to veterans. Although such training is widely available in  both the public and private sectors, The Veterans Corporation\u2019s program is  unique because it limits enrollment to veterans and their spouses,  subsidizes course fees for veterans, and tailors curricula to the needs and  experiences of veterans. The Veterans Corporation\u2019s small business finance  program is another program that complements existing federal programs  and efforts. While SBA provides loan guarantees for many small business  owners, including veterans, veterans generally receive no discounts from  their lenders when qualifying for this financing. In contrast, The Veterans  Corporation collaborates with a private lender to obtain reduced loan rates  for veterans on SBA-guaranteed loans. We were unable to identify any  other loan program specifically targeting veterans in this manner.", "We also identified several instances of collaboration between The Veterans  Corporation and federal agencies that serve veterans. Although, as  indicated in our previous report, such collaboration was limited, an official  at The Veterans Corporation explained that collaboration has improved  since then to include mutually beneficial ventures with federal agencies  that also provides veteran entrepreneurial services. For example, SBA\u2019s  Office of Veterans Business Development (OVBD) provided The Veterans  Corporation with support for the VET and CBO programs, including  assistance with program design and a $45,000 grant to help initiate the VET  program in three pilot locations. These activities support the missions of  both The Veterans Corporation and OVBD to assist veterans. Furthermore,  The Veterans Corporation entered into an agreement with SBA\u2019s OVBD and  a Florida Small Business Development Center to provide resources in  exchange for the opportunity to promote its services to veterans that  complete the course. The Veterans Corporation was also collaborating with  CVE to link their online veteran-owned business directories. Thus, veterans  who register for one directory would access the registration page of the  other directory by clicking a single button.", "While the work of The Veterans Corporation generally has complemented  the work of federal agencies, based on our analysis it appeared that there  was substantial duplication between The Veterans Corporation\u2019s online  Business Directory and CVE\u2019s online business directory, the Vendor  Information Pages. The directories both (1) aid federal and private-sector  purchasing agents by identifying the goods and services offered by veteran- owned and service-disabled veteran-owned businesses; (2) are of similar  size, were developed from similar information sources, and employ similar  methods to identify and register veteran-owned businesses on their sites;  and (3) actively seek the agreement of purchasing agents or prime  contractors to use the directory before using any other source of  information about veteran-owned businesses.", "While officials from The Veterans Corporation and VA acknowledged that  their directories were similar, they did not believe they were in  competition. According to these officials, some differences exist between  the two directories, including different registration requirements and  different emphases on public versus private purchasing. Differences we  identified are listed in figure 2.", "Additionally, each agency had a different motivation for creating its  directory. CVE built its database to fulfill a mandate to provide federal  agencies with information about service-disabled veteran-owned small  businesses. The Veterans Corporation\u2019s primary motive was to provide a  service that would attract veteran entrepreneurs to whom The Veterans  Corporation could later market its products and services. Neither agency  believes that its databases could be merged because The Veterans  Corporation markets its services to its database members, and CVE is  prohibited from releasing information for this purpose.

However, there were  no performance measures to gauge how well the programs are providing  necessary tools and resources or whether those resources are helping  veterans succeed in their businesses.

At the time of our  review, The Veterans Corporation was beginning to collect outcome data  for the first three groups of participants in the VET program, including  surveys of former participants to determine if they began a new business or  expanded their existing business after taking the training. These data  should prove helpful in determining the outcomes of this program, but the  strategic plan contained no performance measures against which to  measure these statistics.

A key program, the VET  program, is an expense-related activity rather than a revenue-generating  activity. In fiscal year 2003, The Veterans Corporation spent approximately  $1,382 for each veteran who graduated from the program; more than half of  this amount went for vouchers, provided to each course graduate, to  purchase a computer or business tools. Providing each course graduate  with such a voucher increases the cost to the organization of operating the  program and could deny The Veterans Corporation added funds to enhance  course offerings or marketing.", "While The Veterans Corporation\u2019s revised financial self-sufficiency plan  indicated it should reach its goal of self-sufficiency by fiscal year 2009, it is  only a predictor of what could occur based on several key assumptions.  Those assumptions were difficult to assess because the plan was not  comprehensive in that it did not contain meaningful information on the key  assumptions underlying revenue projections. Moreover, the plan is  fundamentally dependent on the ability to build a database of veteran- owned businesses and then successfully market The Veterans  Corporation\u2019s products and services to that population\u2014goals that will not  be easy to achieve, given the challenges we have described in this and our  previous report. Finally, including information about self-sufficiency in its  annual reports to Congress would help Congress better assess the progress  of the organization and make informed decisions about the future of The  Veterans Corporation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Chairman of the Board of Directors for The  Veterans Corporation and its staff take the following three actions:  To help guide programs and measure their effectiveness, develop  measurable, outcome-oriented goals and objectives that take into  account the increasing availability of outcome data over time.", "To potentially reduce overall expenses and aid in efforts to achieve self- sufficiency, analyze the extent to which The Veterans Corporation could  reduce or eliminate the amount of the voucher given to graduates of its  VET program without undermining demand for the program.", "To improve congressional oversight, include in its annual report to  Congress comprehensive information and data relating to progress in  achieving financial self-sufficiency, and key assumptions underlying  self-sufficiency revenue projections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested and obtained comments on a draft of this report from the  President and Chief Executive Officer of The Veterans Corporation that are  reprinted in appendix IV. We also provided a draft of this report to DOD,  SBA, and VA. We received technical comments from The Veterans  Corporation and SBA that we incorporated where appropriate. While The  Veterans Corporation had no objections to our recommendations, it offered  information that it believed would explain, clarify, or correct points made  in the draft report.", "First, on the extent of duplication between The Veterans Corporation\u2019s  Business Directory and VA\u2019s VetBiz Vendor Information Pages, The  Veterans Corporation stated that, although we accurately portrayed many  of the differences between the two sources, we understated the importance  of its directory to its operations and self-sufficiency efforts. The Veterans  Corporation also stated that it believed that, as the two databases grew,  they would continue to differ in their composition, customers, and  beneficiaries. In our report, we acknowledged that both The Veterans  Corporation and VA had different motivations for creating their directories.  We also stated that the directories were of similar size, were developed  from similar information sources, and employed similar methods to  identify and register veteran-owned businesses on their sites.", "The second and third points were directed toward strategic planning. In the  second point on developing outcome-oriented metrics that could be used in  reporting to Congress, The Veterans Corporation indicated that it had not  been in existence long enough to determine whether its programs and  services were helping businesses owned by veterans and service-disabled  veterans. It also indicated it had begun the process of developing metrics in  some areas that, over time, would help it build outcome-oriented  performance measures into its reporting. Although many of its programs  are still getting under way, we believe it is useful to identify and articulate  specific metrics as an operational control and as a means to evaluate the  benefits being provided by The Veterans Corporation to veterans. This  information would also help The Veterans Corporation ensure that the  correct data will be collected in the future. In the third point, The Veterans  Corporation indicated that it believes that the strategic goals set by the  board should not be outcome-specific, as they were meant to provide a  general framework for the corporation. The staff, however, are required to  develop specific objectives, initiatives, and performance metrics in support  of the strategic goals. We do not intend to imply that these goals are  necessarily the responsibility of the board, but we do believe they need to  exist somewhere in the strategic plan and that they should form the basis  for the annual report, both to provide Congress with better accountability  and The Veterans Corporation with a better mechanism for demonstrating  organizational effectiveness and outcomes for veterans.", "Finally, in its fourth point, The Veterans Corporation indicated that,  although its long-term survival was not guaranteed, it believed that its  strategy was sound and that sound execution of its plan would result in  achieving its self-sufficiency goal. We focused our analysis on the current  state of federal funding, The Veterans Corporation\u2019s self-sufficiency  projections, and the likelihood that the funding would no longer remain  needed based on our belief that Congress would want to consider different  perspectives on The Veterans Corporation\u2019s ability to become self- sufficient, particularly in the event that The Veterans Corporation\u2019s self- sufficiency projections were revised again. With this focus, we have  concluded that there is a reasonable amount of uncertainty regarding The  Veterans Corporation\u2019s attainment of self-sufficiency. The uncertainty  about self-sufficiency is reflected in The Veterans Corporation\u2019s revision in  its target date for achieving financial self-sufficiency from fiscal year 2004,  as we reported in April 2003, to fiscal year 2009\u2014with the addition of $2  million of federal appropriations in fiscal year 2005. As noted in this report,  The Veterans Corporation faces several challenges in its efforts to  becoming a self-sustaining organization. Notably, its self-sufficiency plan,  which did not contain meaningful information on the key assumptions  underlying revenue projections, is dependent on building an extensive  database of veteran-owned businesses and marketing its services  effectively to this population. Based on our analysis of these challenges, it  is not certain whether The Veterans Corporation\u2019s current estimate for  achieving self-sufficiency will be met as planned.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
