Although the fixed, or standardized,  amount is based on national average costs, actual hospital payments vary  widely across hospitals, primarily because of two payment adjustments in  PPS. There is an adjustment that accounts for cost differences across  patients due to their care needs, and a labor cost adjustment that accounts  for the substantial variation in average hospital wages across the country.  The fixed amount is adjusted for these two sources of cost differences  because they are largely beyond any individual hospital\u2019s ability to control.", "The Medicare labor cost adjustment for a geographic area is based on a  wage index that is computed using data that hospitals submit to Medicare.  The wage index for an area is the ratio of the average hourly hospital wage  in the area compared to the national average hourly hospital wage. The  wage indexes ranged from roughly 0.74 to 1.5 in 2001. Only the portion of  the hospital payment that reflects labor-related expenses (71 percent) is  multiplied by the wage index. The rest of the payment, which covers  drugs, medical supplies and certain other non-labor-related expenses, is  uniform nationwide because prices for these items are not perceived as  varying significantly from area to area.", "The geographic area for which a wage index is calculated is supposed to  represent an area where hospitals pay relatively uniform wages.

This geographic adjustment is a critical component of the  physician payment system. An adjustment that is too low can impair  beneficiary access to physician services, while one that is too high adds  unnecessary financial burdens to Medicare. Although much attention in  recent months has focused on the method used to annually update the  physician fee schedule, concerns have also been voiced about the  appropriateness of the geographic adjustments. H.R. 4954, the Medicare  Modernization and Prescription Drug Act of 2002, would require us to  evaluate the methodology and data that Medicare uses to geographically  adjust physician payments.

In some instances, these areas consist of an  entire state. For example, physician fees are uniform across Connecticut.  In other cases, a large city or group of cities within a state is classified into  one geographic area and the rest of the state is classified into another.  Maryland illustrates this case: Baltimore and surrounding counties are  classified into one geographic area, and the rest of Maryland is classified  as another. Finally, some large metropolitan areas, such as New York City  and its suburban counties, are split into multiple geographic areas.", "Medicare\u2019s geographic adjustments for physician fees are based on  indexes that are designed to reflect cost differences among the 92 areas.  There are three separate indexes, known as geographic practice cost  indexes (GPCI), that correspond to the three components that comprise  Medicare\u2019s payment for a specific service: (1) the work component,  reflecting the amount of physician time, skill, and intensity; (2) the  practice expense component, reflecting expenses, such as office rents and  employee wages; and (3) the malpractice insurance component, reflecting  the cost of personal liability insurance premiums. The overall geographic  adjustment for each service is a weighted average of the three GPCIs  where the weights represent the relative importance of the components  for that service. Across all physician services in 1999, the average weights  were approximately 55 percent for the work component, 42 percent for  the practice expense component, and 3 percent for the malpractice  insurance component.", "The GPCIs are calculated from a variety of data sources. The work GPCI is  based on a sample of median hourly earnings of workers in six  professional categories. Physician earnings are not used because some  physicians derive much of their income from Medicare payments, and an  index based on physician earnings would be affected by Medicare\u2019s  existing geographic adjustments. The work GPCI is a weighted average of  the median earnings of these professions in the area and their median  earnings nationwide. If the work GPCI was based solely on the median  earnings in each area, physician payments would likely increase in large  metropolitan areas and decrease in rural areas. The practice expense GPCI  is based on wage data for various classes of workers, office rent estimates,  and other information. The malpractice insurance GPCI is based on  average premiums for personal liability insurance.", "Concerns have been raised that the current geographic adjustments for  physician fees do not appropriately reflect the underlying geographic  variation in physicians\u2019 costs and that, as a result, beneficiary access to  services may be impaired in certain areas. Unfortunately, information on  physicians\u2019 willingness to see Medicare patients is dated\u2014although it does  not indicate access problems. Data from the 1990s show that virtually all  physicians were treating Medicare beneficiaries and, if they were  accepting new patients, accepted those covered by Medicare. A 1999  survey conducted by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission  (MedPAC) from that year found that 93 percent of physicians who had  been accepting new patients were continuing to do so. It is unclear  whether the situation has deteriorated since 1999. MedPAC is updating its  survey, and the new results may shed light on this issue. However,  MedPAC\u2019s survey results may not be able to identify access problems if  they occur only in certain areas. As I said in my testimony before this  Subcommittee in February, it is important to identify beneficiary access  problems quickly and take appropriate action when warranted. As part of  the work we are beginning on access to physician care, we will examine  Medicare claims data to get the most up-to-date picture possible of access  by area, by specialty, and for new versus established patients."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Medicare\u2019s PPS for inpatient services provides incentives to hospitals to  deliver care efficiently by allowing them to keep Medicare payment  amounts that exceed their costs, while making hospitals responsible for  costs that exceed their Medicare payments.

If these payment adjustments do not adequately account for cost  differences, hospitals are inappropriately rewarded or face undue fiscal  pressure.
