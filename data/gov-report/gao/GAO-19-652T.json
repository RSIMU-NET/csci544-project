This statement is based on a May 2019 GAO report and selected updates. For the report, GAO analyzed FEMA documents and data from FEMA call centers and also visited 2017 hurricane locations to interview state, territorial, and local officials.

GAO recommended that FEMA use new registration-intake questions to improve the agency's ability to identify and address individuals' disability-related needs. FEMA concurred and, in May 2019, updated the questions to directly ask individuals if they have a disability.", "GAO found that the substantial damage caused by the 2017 hurricanes prevented or slowed some individuals with disabilities from obtaining food, water, and other critical goods and services from states, territories, and localities. Officials from one state reported that few public transportation services, including paratransit, were functional following the 2017 hurricane affecting the state. The officials said this may have prevented people with disabilities from maintaining their health and wellness\u2014such as by shopping for groceries or going to medical appointments\u2014after the storm.", "GAO's May 2019 report also found that FEMA had taken limited steps to implement the agency's new approach to assist individuals with disabilities.", "GAO recommended the agency establish and disseminate objectives for implementing its new approach. FEMA concurred, and developed a draft strategic plan that includes strategic goals and objectives for the new approach, which the agency plans to finalize and disseminate in 2019.", "GAO recommended that FEMA, as part of its new approach, develop a plan for delivering training to all FEMA staff deployed during disasters that promotes competency in disability awareness. In concurring with this recommendation, FEMA described its plan to incorporate a disability awareness competency into the job requirements for all deployable staff, but has not yet developed a plan for training.", "GAO's May 2019 report also recommended that FEMA develop a timeline for completing the development of training on incorporating the needs of individuals with disabilities into emergency planning, which it planned to offer to its nonfederal partners. FEMA concurred with GAO's recommendation and, in June 2019, officials began procuring external consulting services to develop a replacement course. According to officials, the course will take about 1 year to develop and will be ready to field by August 2020."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In the May 2019 report, GAO made seven recommendations to FEMA; FEMA concurred with six.

For instance,  individuals with disabilities that affect their ability to evacuate, shelter, or  recover from hurricanes and other large-scale disasters can face  particular challenges obtaining disaster assistance. Some of these  individuals, who otherwise function independently in their day-to-day  lives, may rely on supports that disasters can interrupt. For example, after  Hurricane Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico as a category 4 hurricane,  the two suppliers of oxygen on the island of Puerto Rico lost production  capabilities due to a lack of power. According to a disability rights  organization\u2019s report, this lack of production capabilities threatened the  health of approximately 50,000 Puerto Ricans who depended on oxygen.", "The sequential Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria caused widespread  damage to critical infrastructure, livelihoods, and property in 2017. As a  result, obtaining food, water, medicine, and transportation was  challenging for those affected by the hurricanes, and was particularly  challenging for some individuals with disabilities. State, territorial, and  local emergency management and private organization partners turned to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for help, including  from FEMA disability integration staff who were responsible for providing  assistance to individuals with disabilities. In June 2018, near the start of  the 2018 hurricane season, FEMA announced plans to reorganize its  workforce to more thoroughly incorporate disability integration principles  into all preparedness, response, and recovery activities nationwide and  reduce reliance on disability integration staff in FEMA\u2019s Office of Disability  Integration and Coordination (ODIC).", "My statement today discusses information from our May 2019 report on  disaster assistance for individuals who are older or have disabilities.  Specifically, this statement addresses (1) reported challenges these  individuals faced in accessing disaster assistance from FEMA and its  nonfederal partners following the 2017 hurricanes; and (2) the extent to  which FEMA has implemented changes in how it supports these  individuals.", "This statement is primarily based on the May 2019 report as well as  selected updates. For that report we analyzed FEMA policies,  procedures, guidance, and memoranda and assessed these documents  against goals and objectives in FEMA\u2019s 2018-2022 Strategic Plan,  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policy for ensuring  nondiscrimination for individuals with disabilities, and federal standards  for internal control. We obtained and analyzed data from FEMA call  centers that operate FEMA\u2019s helpline. We also visited Florida, Puerto  Rico, Texas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands in June and July 2018 to  interview state or territorial emergency managers, public health and  human services officials, and representatives of nonprofit disability  organizations, among others. We also interviewed FEMA officials from  headquarters and staff deployed to each disaster location, including staff  focused on assisting individuals with disabilities. More detailed  information on the scope and methodology for that work can be found in  appendix I of the issued report. To update progress FEMA has made  toward addressing our recommendations from the May 2019 report, we  interviewed FEMA officials and analyzed documents they provided.", "We conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives.

In our May 2019 report, we found that some  individuals with disabilities may have faced long wait times and unclear  registration questions, and that FEMA\u2019s internal communication across its  programs about survivors\u2019 disability-related needs was ineffective.", "Long wait times: Individuals who tried to apply for assistance using  the helpline confronted long wait times, which may have posed  greater challenges for those with disabilities. In the days after  Hurricane Maria affected Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands\u2014 when survivors from Harvey and Irma were concurrently contacting  the helpline\u2014up to 69 percent of calls went unanswered and the daily  average wait time for answered calls peaked at almost an hour and a  half, according to our analysis of FEMA data. While long wait times  could be burdensome for all individuals, state officials and disability  advocates we interviewed said long wait times were especially  burdensome for people with certain disabilities, such as those with  attention disorders or whose assistive technology prevents multi- tasking when waiting on hold.", "Unclear registration questions: FEMA\u2019s registration process did not  give individuals a clear opportunity to state they have a disability or  request an accommodation because the registration did not directly  ask registrants to provide this information. According to FEMA  officials at the time, information about disability-related needs can  help FEMA staff match individuals with disabilities with appropriate  resources in a timely and efficient manner and target additional  assistance, such as help with the application process. However,  individuals with disabilities may not have requested accommodations  or reported their disability and related needs during FEMA\u2019s  registration-intake due to the unclear questions. As a result, the  registration process may have under-identified people with disabilities.  For example, in Puerto Rico, an estimated 21.6 percent of people  have disabilities, according to 2017 Census data. However, less than  3 percent of all registrants in the territory answered \u201cyes\u201d to the  disability-related question in response to Hurricanes Irma and Maria.", "Ineffective communication across FEMA programs: Individuals  may have faced challenges receiving necessary assistance because  FEMA did not effectively track and communicate information about  individuals\u2019 disability-related needs across its assistance programs  after such needs were identified. FEMA officials we interviewed for the  May 2019 report explained that accommodation requests and  disability-related information identified after registration-intake are  recorded in a general \u201cnotes\u201d section of a registrant\u2019s case file, which  can be easily overlooked as a case file is passed along to subsequent  FEMA officials.", "In our May 2019 report we recommended that FEMA implement new  registration-intake questions to improve FEMA\u2019s ability to identify and  address survivors\u2019 disability-related needs. FEMA concurred with this  recommendation, and officials reported that in May 2019 the agency  updated the questions to directly ask individuals if they have a disability.  According to FEMA\u2019s analysis of applications for assistance following  recent disasters, which used the updated questions, the percentage of  registrants who reported having a disability increased. FEMA officials  stated this increase gives them confidence the change has improved  FEMA\u2019s ability to identify and address disability-related needs of  individuals affected by disasters.", "We also recommended that FEMA improve its communication of  registrants\u2019 disability-related information across FEMA programs, such as  by developing an alert within survivor files that indicates an  accommodation request. FEMA did not concur with this recommendation,  explaining that the agency lacks specific funding to augment the legacy  data systems that capture and communicate registration information. In  its comments on our May 2019 report, FEMA stated that it began a long- term initiative in April 2017 to improve data management and exchange,  and improve overall data quality and standardization. After FEMA  completes this initiative, which officials said will be in 2024, FEMA  expects that efforts to share and flag specific disability-related data will be  much easier. We believe that in the interim, FEMA could explore other  cost-effective ways to improve communication, such as through agency  guidance that encourages program officials to review registrants\u2019 case file  notes. As FEMA moves ahead with its initiatives to improve data, we  encourage it to consider and ultimately implement technology changes,  such as developing an alert within files that indicates an accommodation  request, to help improve communication across FEMA programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Officials Reported that Individuals with Disabilities Faced Challenges Obtaining Critical Goods and Services", "paragraphs": ["State, territorial, and local governments are primarily responsible for  response and recovery activities in their jurisdictions, including those  involving health and safety. In our May 2019 report, we found that the  substantial damage caused by the 2017 hurricanes prevented or slowed  some individuals with disabilities from obtaining food and water.  According to territorial and nonprofit officials in Puerto Rico and the U.S.  Virgin Islands, as well as survivors we interviewed in the U.S. Virgin  Islands, this was due to centralized distribution models, in which the  majority of food and water was distributed to centralized locations around  the islands. Officials from one governmental agency in Puerto Rico said  this posed a major barrier to people with mobility challenges or without  caregivers receiving food and water because they had to rely on home  delivery, which took time and in some cases, did not happen. We also  found that Hurricane Maria survivors faced challenges obtaining needed  medication and oxygen in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands,  according to territorial and nonprofit officials.", "State, territorial, and local agencies are also primarily responsible for  administering shelters, when necessary, for those affected by a disaster.  We found in our May 2019 report that individuals with disabilities affected  by the 2017 hurricanes may have faced challenges accessing basic  services from local shelters, including restrooms and food, according to  state, territorial, local, and nonprofit officials in Florida, Puerto Rico,  Texas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. For example, nonprofit officials in  Florida and Puerto Rico described instances of shelter residents with  impairments that prevented them from accessing shelter restrooms.", "We also found that transportation was especially challenging for those  who relied on public transportation or were unable to walk long distances,  such as people with disabilities, according to state, territorial, local, and  nonprofit officials we interviewed. For example, Florida state officials  reported that few public transportation services, including paratransit,  were functional following Hurricane Irma. This may have prevented some  people with disabilities from maintaining their health and wellness\u2014such  as by shopping for groceries or going to medical appointments\u2014after the  storm, according to state officials.", "Officials we interviewed from Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico for our May  2019 report said they had difficulty obtaining FEMA data that could help  them deliver assistance to individuals, including those with disabilities.  The officials explained that data\u2014including names and addresses\u2014 showing who has registered for and received assistance from FEMA can  help local governments and nonprofits identify who in their community  needs assistance. To better facilitate authorized nonfederal partners  obtaining these needed data, we recommended that FEMA develop and  publicize guidance for partners who assist individuals with disabilities on  how to request and work with FEMA staff to obtain the data, as  appropriate.

For example, an April 2018 memorandum to FEMA Regional  Administrators outlined a proposal to add new disability integration staff in  each FEMA region to foster day-to-day relationships with state, territorial,  and local emergency managers and disability partners. Also, ODIC  distributed a document that described FEMA\u2019s new approach to  deployments. Under the new approach, fewer disability integration staff  are to be deployed to disasters and all deployable staff and staff in  programmatic offices are to receive training on disability issues during  response and recovery deployments.", "However, in our May 2019 report, we found that these documents did not  articulate objectives that could help the agency define success for the  new approach. We concluded that without a set of common objectives for  FEMA\u2019s new disability integration approach, FEMA risks inconsistent  application across its regions. In our report, we recommended that FEMA  establish and disseminate a set of objectives for the new approach.  FEMA concurred with this recommendation, and in July 2019 officials  provided us with the draft of ODIC\u2019s strategic plan for 2019-2022, which  includes strategic goals and objectives that the new disability integration  approach can help achieve. ODIC officials told us they will be working  throughout 2019 with FEMA\u2019s Office of External Affairs to disseminate the  plan agency-wide and to nonfederal partners.

We  reported in May 2019 that FEMA officials emphasized the need to  integrate disability competencies throughout FEMA\u2019s programmatic  offices and deployable staff. However, we found that the agency did not  have written plans\u2014including milestones, performance measures, or a  plan for monitoring performance\u2014for developing new comprehensive  training for all staff. Starting in the 2018 hurricane season, FEMA had  taken initial steps toward training some deployed staff on disability issues.  For example, FEMA required all staff to complete a 30-minute training on  basic disability integration principles and offered targeted \u201cjust-in-time\u201d  training to deployed staff. We concluded that developing a training plan  would better position FEMA to provide training to all staff to help achieve  FEMA\u2019s intended goals.", "In our May 2019 report, we recommended that FEMA develop a plan for  delivering training to FEMA staff that promotes competency in disability  awareness. In its letter commenting on our May 2019 report, FEMA  stated that ODIC is developing a plan to introduce the disability  competency in FEMA\u2019s position task books for all deployable staff. The  letter explained further that ODIC\u2019s plan will describe how FEMA will  communicate the disability integration competency throughout the  agency, establish milestones for measuring how effectively the  competency is integrated across the agency, and outline how ODIC will  monitor and measure integration of the competency across the  deployable workforce.", "In July 2019, FEMA officials told us ODIC plans to hire new staff to focus  on integrating the disability competency FEMA-wide. According to the  officials, after the position task books are updated, ODIC will work with  FEMA\u2019s training components to ensure that disability-related training is  consistent with the content of the position task books. FEMA officials also  noted that the Field Operations Division, and not ODIC, is responsible for  measuring how effectively the disability competency is integrated across  FEMA. We will continue to monitor FEMA\u2019s progress toward developing a  plan for delivering training to promote competency in disability awareness  among its staff. As noted in our May 2019 report, the plan for delivering  such training should include milestones, performance measures, and how  performance will be monitored.", "In our May 2019 report, we found that deploying a smaller number of  disability integration staff and shifting them away from providing direct  assistance to individuals with disabilities may result in nonfederal partners  (such as state, territorial, and local emergency managers) providing more  direct assistance to individuals with disabilities than they did previously. In  February 2017, we reported that the comprehensive introductory training  course on disability integration that FEMA offered to its nonfederal  partners included substantial information on how to incorporate the needs  of people with disabilities in emergency planning. However, according to  officials, FEMA stopped offering this 2-day course in September 2017.  ODIC officials told us during our 2019 review they had determined that  the course, as designed, did not provide actionable training to emergency  management partners to meet the needs of individuals with disabilities  and planned to replace it.", "However, we found in May 2019 that although officials had plans to  replace the course with new training, they had not provided a timeline,  which would help ensure that partners are provided with timely  information on inclusive emergency management practices. We  recommended that FEMA develop a timeline for completing the  replacement course and, in June 2019, FEMA officials said they had  begun procuring external consulting services to redevelop it. According to  the officials, ODIC had evaluated alternatives to the suspended course  and determined that an in-person, exercise-based course with remote  participation capabilities would be an appropriate replacement. FEMA  officials said the course will take about 1 year to develop and will be  ready to field by August 2020.", "In conclusion, FEMA has taken a number of steps toward addressing our  recommendations related to how it supports individuals with disabilities in  obtaining disaster assistance. ODIC\u2019s draft strategic plan for 2019-2022,  which articulates objectives for the new approach to disability integration,  is likely to help facilitate consistent implementation agency-wide. In  addition, we are hopeful that FEMA\u2019s revised registration-intake  questions, as well as data sharing guidance for nonfederal partners, will  help FEMA and its partners better identify and assist registrants with  disabilities. However, we continue to believe that implementing changes  to disability integration before staff have been fully trained may leave  FEMA staff ill-prepared to identify and address the challenges that  individuals with disabilities face while recovering from disasters. We will  continue to monitor FEMA\u2019s actions as it makes additional progress  toward addressing our recommendations.", "Chairman Payne, Ranking Member King, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
