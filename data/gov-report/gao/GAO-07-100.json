Responding to the act's mandate that GAO assess the Commission's effectiveness, this report reviews its progress in (1) developing a national strategy; (2) developing a Web site and hotline; and (3) coordinating federal efforts and promoting partnerships among the federal, state, local, nonprofit, and private sectors. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed Commission documents, interviewed financial literacy representatives, and benchmarked the national strategy against GAO's criteria for such strategies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The National Strategy for Financial Literacy serves as a useful first step in focusing attention on financial literacy, but it is largely descriptive rather than strategic and lacks certain key characteristics that are desirable in a national strategy. The strategy provides a clear purpose, scope, and methodology and is comprehensive in identifying the breadth of issues involved and the challenges in addressing them. However, it does not serve as a plan of action designed to achieve specific goals, and its recommendations are presented as \"calls to action\" that generally are either descriptions of existing initiatives or broad pronouncements that do not include a specific implementation plan. The strategy also does not fully address some of the desirable characteristics of an effective national strategy that GAO has previously identified. For example, it does not set clear and specific goals or performance measures by which to benchmark progress, address the resources needed to accomplish these goals, or fully discuss appropriate roles, responsibilities, and accountability. As a result of these factors, most organizations that GAO spoke with said the strategy would not play a meaningful role in guiding or informing their efforts. The Commission's Web site and telephone hotline offer financial education information from numerous federal agencies. The Web site generally serves as an effective portal to existing federal financial literacy sites. Use of the site has been growing, and it averaged about 57,000 visits per month from May through September 2006. The volume of calls to the hotline--which serves as an order line for a free tool kit of federal publications--has been limited. The Commission has not tested the Web site for usability or measured customer satisfaction with it; these are recommended best practices for federal public Web sites. As a result, the Commission does not know if visitors are able to find the information they are looking for efficiently and effectively. The Commission has taken steps to coordinate the financial literacy efforts of federal agencies and has served as a useful focal point for federal activities. However, coordinating federal efforts has been challenging, in part because the Commission must achieve consensus among 20 federal agencies, each with its own viewpoints, programs, and constituencies, and because of the Commission's limited resources. A survey of overlap and duplication and a review of the effectiveness of federal activities relied largely on agencies' self-assessments rather than the independent review of a disinterested party. The Commission has taken steps to promote partnerships with the nonprofit and private sectors through various public meetings, outreach events, and other activities. The involvement of state, local, nonprofit, and private organizations is important in supporting and expanding Commission efforts to increase financial literacy. As the Commission continues to implement its strategy, it should consider expanding its activities and work to develop mutually beneficial and lasting partnerships that will be sustainable over the long term."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["A growing body of evidence indicates that many Americans are lacking in  financial literacy\u2014the ability to make informed judgments and manage  money effectively. Numerous studies published in recent years have  shown that most adults and students have not mastered basic economic  concepts, such as the risks associated with investment choices. Poor  financial literacy can reduce consumers\u2019 economic well-being and security  in a variety of ways. For example, poor financial management and  decision making can result in a lower standard of living and prevent  families from reaching important long-term goals, such as buying a home,  paying for college education, and adequately funding retirement. Financial  literacy has broader public policy implications as well. For instance,  financial markets function best when consumers understand how financial  services providers and products work and know how to choose among  them. Further, educating the public about the importance of saving may be  critical to boosting our national saving rate, an important element to  improving America\u2019s economic growth.", "To help address this issue, Title V of the Fair and Accurate Credit  Transactions Act of 2003, cited as the Financial Literacy and Education  Improvement Act, created the Financial Literacy and Education  Commission (the Commission). The Commission, which is made up of 20  federal agencies, was charged with developing a national strategy\u2014which  is to be reviewed annually and modified as deemed necessary\u2014to improve  basic financial literacy and education for all Americans. The act also said  that to implement the strategy the Commission shall coordinate federal  financial education efforts and promote partnerships between and among  federal, state, and local governments, nonprofit organizations, and private  enterprises. As part of the national strategy, the Department of the  Treasury (Treasury Department) was required to develop and disseminate  a multimedia campaign to improve financial literacy. The law also required  the Commission to create a Web site and toll-free telephone hotline to  disseminate financial education to the public. The Commission is chaired  by the Secretary of the Treasury and is coordinated through the  department\u2019s Office of Financial Education.", "The Financial Literacy Act also mandated that we assess the effectiveness  of the Commission in promoting financial literacy and education. As  agreed with your offices, this report responds to that mandate by  reviewing the Commission\u2019s progress in (1) developing an effective  national strategy to promote financial literacy and education; (2)  implementing its Web site, hotline, and multimedia campaign; and (3)  coordinating federal financial literacy efforts and promoting partnerships  among government, nonprofit, and commercial organizations.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed the Financial Literacy Act and  analyzed relevant Commission documents, including the National Strategy  for Financial Literacy, comment letters on the national strategy\u2019s  development, and meeting minutes of the Commission and its working  groups and subcommittees. We interviewed representatives of all 20  federal agencies that are members of the Commission, as well as  representatives of 12 organizations that address issues of financial literacy  in the private, nonprofit, academic, and state and local government  sectors. We assessed the national strategy, in part, by benchmarking it  against general characteristics of an effective national strategy we have  identified in prior work.

According to a Treasury Department representative, the  working group met 11 times and working group members provided  background research and developed material for each of the strategy\u2019s  chapters. The Financial Literacy Act called for the participation of state  and local governments and private, nonprofit, and public institutions in the  creation and implementation of the national strategy. To help meet this  requirement, the working group, through the Treasury Department, issued  a request for public comment on the development of the strategy in a  Federal Register notice that was released in August 2004. The request  generated approximately 158 public responses from a wide array of  federal, state, and local government entities; private companies; nonprofit  agencies; and individuals, including academics and private citizens. The  working group also held six public meetings in February and March 2005  with individuals and organizations that had responded to the request for  public comment. Each meeting was organized around a specific sector\u2014 commercial, government, nonprofit, education, and banking\u2014with one for  individuals. Commission documents stated that the working group had  considered information and ideas from the participants of these meetings  during the development of the national strategy.", "Although the Financial Literacy Act required the Commission to adopt the  strategy within 18 months after the date of the act\u2019s enactment, or June  2005, the strategy was not publicly released until April 4, 2006. The  Commission sought unanimous consent on the national strategy, and  Commission members told us that the difficulty of reaching consensus  among all 20 member agencies had delayed the strategy. For instance,  according to a Treasury Department official, some agencies disagreed  about what the strategy should include, and some agency representatives  had difficulties securing the approval of higher-level agency officials, who  in some cases had objections. Some participants in the development of the  national strategy told us that the process was generally collaborative and  that they were given sufficient opportunity to provide input and review  drafts of the strategy. Other participants told us that they believed that the  working group was not always given ample opportunity to provide input  into important issues, such as the strategy\u2019s overall direction,  recommendations, or implementation. Many Commission representatives  acknowledged that the Treasury Department faced a significant challenge  in trying to get 20 federal agencies\u2014each with its own mission and point  of view\u2014to unanimously agree to a strategy.", "A particular source of disagreement among agencies was the issue of  whether nonfederal entities should be cited by name in the strategy  document. The national strategy includes numerous \u201cillustrative  programs\u201d that provide examples of financial literacy initiatives in the  private and nonprofit sector. According to a Treasury official, most  Commission member agencies believed that these private and nonprofit  entities should be cited by name, but some agencies did not. Specifically,  two regulatory agencies that were part of the Commission said that a  potential conflict of interest existed if they were perceived to be endorsing  a program run by an entity that was potentially the subject of an  enforcement action. To address these issues, the Commission decided to  remove names of private and nonprofit sector organizations from the  national strategy. After consultation with all Commission members, the  organizations\u2019 names were included instead in a separate document issued  by the Treasury Department, the \u201cNational Strategy for Financial Literacy:  Quick Reference Guide.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The National Strategy\u2019s Content Is Comprehensive but Largely Descriptive", "paragraphs": ["The content of the National Strategy for Financial Literacy largely consists  of a comprehensive overview of issues related to financial literacy, along  with examples of ongoing initiatives.

Seven of these chapters cover subject areas for financial  education, such as retirement saving, credit, and taxpayer rights, while  three others focus on specific groups\u2014students, the unbanked, and  multilingual and multicultural populations. There are also chapters on  academic research and program evaluation, coordination efforts, and  international initiatives. Most chapters provide a brief overview of the  subject and the challenges the nation faces in addressing it, but most of  the discussion involves \u201cillustrative programs\u201d that are already in place.  These programs, of which the report discusses more than 80, are run by  nonprofit organizations, academia, the private sector, and federal, state,  and local governments. For example, the chapter on investor protection  includes several pages describing specific resources and programs  available through federal agencies and private entities.", "The strategy is comprehensive in its scope. It describes many major  problems and challenges related to financial literacy in America, identifies  key subject matter areas and target populations, and describes what it  believes to be illustrations of potentially effective practices in financial  education across a broad spectrum of subjects and sectors.

At the same time, as  some representatives of the Commission told us, the strategy is  fundamentally descriptive rather than strategic\u2014that is, it provides  information on disparate issues and initiatives related to financial literacy  but is limited in presenting a long-term plan of action for achieving its  goal.", "Most notably, the strategy\u2019s recommendations are presented as \u201ccalls to  action,\u201d which it defines as concrete steps that should be taken for  improving financial literacy and education in particular areas. Sixteen of  these 26 calls to action are addressed to federal entities, 5 to private or  nonprofit organizations, and 5 to the public at large. However, many of  these calls to action are very general and do not discuss an  implementation strategy, and others describe initiatives that already exist.  For example, one call to action states \u201cInvestors should take advantage of  the wealth of high quality, neutral, and unbiased information offered free  of charge,\u201d but it does not lay out a plan for helping ensure that investors  will do so. Among the ongoing initiatives cited are a multimedia campaign  that the Treasury Department is to launch that is mandated in the  Financial Literacy Act.

While national strategies are not required to  contain a single, consistent set of attributes, we found six characteristics  that can offer policymakers and implementing agencies a management  tool to help ensure accountability and more effective results. These six  characteristics are (1) a clear purpose, scope and methodology; (2) a  detailed discussion of problems and risks; (3) desired goals, objectives,  activities, and performance measures; (4) a description of future costs and  resources needed to implement the strategy; (5) a clear delineation of the  government\u2019s roles, responsibilities, and mechanisms for coordination;  and (6) a description of how the strategy is integrated with other entities.

A complete description of the  purpose, scope, and methodology can make a document more useful to  the implementing entities as well as to oversight organizations such as  Congress. The National Strategy for Financial Literacy generally addresses  this characteristic. It cites the legislative mandate that required the  strategy, the overall purpose\u2014improving financial literacy and education  in the United States\u2014and subsidiary goals such as making it easier for  consumers to access financial education materials.

For example, the chapter on general saving provides  data on the decline in the personal saving rate over the last 35 years, and  the chapter on consumer protection cites an estimate on the percentage of  American adults who are scammed every year.

Moreover, a clear  understanding of our nation\u2019s overall financial condition and fiscal outlook  is an indispensable part of true financial literacy. Due to current  demographic trends, rising health care costs, and other factors, the nation  faces the possibility of decades of mounting debt, which left unchecked  will threaten our economic security and adversely affect the quality of life  available to future generations. One element of financial literacy is  ensuring that Americans are aware of these potential developments in  planning for their own financial futures since, for example, we can no  longer assume that current federal entitlement programs will continue  indefinitely in their present form. The federal government has sought to  encourage personal saving through policies such as tax incentives, but the  effect of these policies on the overall level of personal saving is  uncertain\u2014highlighting further the importance of public education in  raising our national saving rate and ensuring that Americans enjoy a  secure retirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Desired Goals, Objectives, Activities, and Performance Measures", "paragraphs": ["This characteristic deals with what goals a strategy strives to achieve and  the steps needed to meet those goals, as well as milestones and outcome  measures to gauge results.

Several  stakeholders in the financial literacy community that we spoke with noted  that the strategy would have been more useful if it had set specific  performance measures. The Commission might also have set measurable  goals for changing consumer behavior, such as seeking to reduce the  number of Americans without bank accounts or increase the number  saving for their retirement to a specified figure in the next 5 or 10 years.

As such,  the Web site was largely intended to help market and distribute existing  federal financial literacy resources to a wider audience. The Web site  subcommittee also chose to limit the site\u2019s content, in most cases, to Web  sites that are maintained or operated by federal agencies. Although the  Financial Literacy Act allowed links to nonfederal sites if the sites have no  commercial content, the Web site subcommittee decided it wanted to  ensure the integrity of the site by limiting it to information offered by  federal agencies. The Financial Literacy Act required that the Web site  offer information on all federal grants to promote financial literacy and  education, and on how to target, apply for, and receive such grants.

Usability testing typically involves having users perform a  variety of tasks with a prototype Web site while observers record notes on  what each user does and says. Testing may include collecting data on how  users do tasks, what kinds of errors they make, when and where they are  confused or frustrated, how fast they do a task, whether they succeed in  doing it, and how satisfied they are with the experience. Measuring  customer satisfaction provides an indication of whether consumers find a  Web site useful, may return to the site, and may recommend the site to  others.

The overall number of tool kit  orders has been declining slightly over the past year, falling from about  60,000 in fiscal year 2005 to 47,000 in fiscal year 2006.

After reviewing these  resources, the Commission said it found minimal overlap and duplication  among federal financial literacy programs. It noted that even when  different agencies\u2019 programs appeared similar, closer inspection revealed  important differences in things like the target audience, delivery platform,  or specific content.

The Commission reported that each agency deemed its  programs and resources to be effective and worthy of continuance.  However, rather than using an unbiased evaluator, the agencies assessed  their own programs, which did not benefit from the use of independent  third-party analysis. Moreover, given the large number of federal agencies  involved in financial literacy, a concerted effort to streamline federal  efforts is essential. As we have reported, in 2004, about 20 different federal  agencies operated about 30 different programs or initiatives related to  financial literacy.

These barriers may have affected the Commission\u2019s  efforts to coordinate federal programs. Each of the Commission\u2019s  participating federal agencies has different missions and responsibilities  and thus different perspectives and points of view on issues of financial  literacy. In addition, the agencies differ in their levels of responsibility and  expertise with regard to financial literacy and education. A Treasury  Department official stated that the extent to which senior policymakers  from the Commission\u2019s member agencies were involved in activities and  decision making varied. In addition, because agencies tend to be  protective of their resources, it might be very difficult to recommend  eliminating individual agencies\u2019 programs.", "Moreover, the Commission\u2019s ability to coordinate such major structural  change, if it chose to do so, would also be constrained by its limited  resources in terms of both staff and funding. Further, the Commission has  no legal authority to compel an agency to take any action but instead must  work through collaboration and consensus. According to Treasury  Department representatives, early on, the Commission decided that  decisions on major matters would require consensus, making efforts to  coordinate agencies\u2019 efforts more challenging. For example, as discussed  earlier, the agencies disagreed about whether nonfederal organizations  should be cited by name in the national strategy. Although the issue was  ultimately resolved, the dispute contributed to the 10-month delay in the  release of the strategy.

Treasury Department officials have cited several steps  the Commission has taken to promote such partnerships:    National strategy. The national strategy highlighted public-private and  private-private partnerships as one of the crucial areas that an effective  national strategy must encompass. Treasury Department representatives  noted that several of the strategy\u2019s calls to action sought to promote  partnerships by bringing together the public and private sectors at both  the local and national levels. For example, one call to action stated that  the Treasury and Education departments would host a summit, scheduled  for December 2006, on integrating financial education into the core school  curriculum, while another described a symposium of academic  researchers specializing in financial education that is to be convened by  the end of September 2007 by the Treasury and Agriculture departments.", "Community outreach and events.

The Commission\u2019s six sector-specific public meetings  were designed to gather input and foster communication among various  stakeholders from the private, nonprofit, academic, and public sectors.  Summaries of these meetings were published and Treasury Department  representatives said that they have played a role in influencing the  direction of the Commission\u2019s work.

Some organizations noted that they had the  opportunity to attend the Commission\u2019s public meetings and other events,  but felt that the Commission has offered little follow-up on how to foster  continued partnerships. Several private and nonprofit national  organizations have extensive networks that they have developed at the  community level across the country, and some of these organizations  suggested the Commission could do more to mobilize these resources as  part of a national effort. For example, representatives of the American  Institute of Certified Public Accountants told us that it has more than  340,000 members nationwide and that the Commission would benefit from  leveraging grassroots resources such as this to a greater degree. Similarly,  representatives of the North American Securities Administrators  Association suggested the Commission do more to tap into that  organization\u2019s extensive network of state agencies.", "Although the Financial Literacy Act required the Commission to take steps  to help promote partnerships and coordination at the state and local level,  some stakeholders told us the Commission had done relatively little to  involve state and local governments. The national strategy does not  include a significant discussion on coordinating federal efforts with those  of state and local governments, and only some state and local government  initiatives are included as illustrative examples. Some stakeholders we  spoke with suggested a variety of ways that the Commission might better  involve state and local governments, such as meeting more often with  state employees who deal with financial literacy issues. Greater  collaboration by the Commission with state and local governments may be  particularly important given the critical role that school districts can play  in improving financial literacy.

For example, the number  and complexity of financial products have grown tremendously, and  consumers face an increasing array of options for managing their personal  finances. In addition, technological advances have increased the capacity  for targeted marketing to consumers, which may increase some  consumers\u2019 vulnerability to fraudulent financial products. Further,  workers today are increasingly responsible for managing their own  retirement savings\u2014yet at the same time, the nation\u2019s personal saving rate  has fallen dramatically in recent decades, and household debt hovers at  record high levels. Financial education efforts aimed at such things as  boosting the national saving rate are key to helping improve our citizens\u2019  economic security and our country\u2019s economic growth.", "In the relatively short period since its creation, the Commission has played  a helpful role by serving as a focal point for federal efforts and making  financial literacy a more prominent issue among the media, policymakers,  and consumers.

The Commission was also successful in rolling out the My Money  Web site and telephone hotline in a relatively short time. We recognize the  significant challenges confronting the Commission\u2014most notably, the  inherent difficulty of coordinating the efforts of 20 federal agencies. Given  the small number of staff devoted to operating the Commission and the  limited funding it was provided to conduct any new initiatives, we believe  early efforts undertaken by the Commission represent some positive first  steps. At the same time, more progress is needed if we expect the  Commission to have a meaningful impact on improving the nation\u2019s  financial literacy.", "The lack of specific recommendations on roles, funding, and activities in  the national strategy may stem in part from the challenge of reaching  consensus among multiple agencies, each of which has its own set of  interests, resources, and constituencies. Moreover, the Commission is  constrained by its own resources\u2014with the equivalent of fewer than three  full-time staff, there are limits to what the Commission, as an entity unto  itself, can be expected to do. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the  Commission will depend on the commitment and collaboration of the 20  individual federal agencies that comprise it.", "The national strategy represents an evolving effort, as the law requires that  it be reviewed and modified, as deemed necessary, at least once a year.

Because the strategy does not set clear and specific  goals, benchmarks, or other evaluation mechanisms, it does not hold the  Commission and its member agencies accountable or provide overall  indicators of the nation\u2019s progress in improving financial literacy.  Moreover, the Commission\u2019s work could be more complete if  consideration were given to developing a concrete definition for financial  literacy and education to help define the scope of the Commission\u2019s work.  In addition, because the strategy does not include a clear description of  the resources needed to achieve these goals, policymakers lack  information that would be helpful in allocating resources and directing  implementation of the strategy. Finally, the lack of a detailed discussion of  suggested roles and responsibilities hinders the ability to conduct a  coordinated and productive national effort. As a result of these factors, the  strategy is likely to play a limited role in meaningfully improving the  nation\u2019s financial literacy.", "The My Money Web site and telephone hotline offer consumers access to a  variety of federal financial literacy resources in a single place.

However,  rather than using an independent evaluator, the Commission made a  determination on its own of the extent of overlap and duplication, and it  asked agencies to assess their own programs. The process thus lacked the  benefit of assessment by a disinterested party. The Commission could  benefit from conducting a more independent review of duplication and  overlap, and from an evaluation of federal activities that does not rely  solely on agencies\u2019 self-assessments.", "Further, given the wide array of state, local, nonprofit, and private  organizations providing financial literacy programs, the involvement of the  nonfederal sectors is important in supporting and expanding Commission  efforts to increase financial literacy. Thus far, the Commission has taken  some helpful steps to promote partnerships, consisting mainly of outreach  and publicity efforts, such as conducting speaking engagements and  holding public meetings.

In its  response, the department noted that the National Strategy for Financial  Literacy was the nation\u2019s first such effort and, as such, was designed to be  a blueprint that provides general direction while allowing diverse entities  the flexibility to participate in enhancing financial education. The  department said that the strategy\u2019s calls to action are appropriately  substantive and concrete\u2014setting out specific issues for discussion,  conferences to be convened, key constituencies, and Commission  members that should be responsible for each task. We acknowledge that  the national strategy represents an early effort but continue to believe that  future iterations of the strategy would benefit from inclusion of the  characteristics cited in our report. The department also said that it will  consult further with the Commission on developing definitions of  \u201cfinancial literacy\u201d and \u201cfinancial education.\u201d", "In addition, the department said that the My Money Web site and hotline  represent one of the Commission\u2019s earliest successes and that these  resources continue to be enhanced. The department said that it will ask  the Commission to consider a usability study and a customer satisfaction  survey of the Web site. Further, the department said it believes that the  Commission is satisfying the statutory requirement to identify potential  overlap and duplication through the survey of agencies it does in  conjunction with GSA. The department acknowledged that the  Commission\u2019s review of the effectiveness of federal financial literacy  materials may lack independence and said it will work with the  Commission to consider other alternatives for this process. In addition, the  department noted that it has a long history of partnerships with nonfederal  entities and will consult with the Commission about how to work more  closely with the types of organizations described in our report.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of the Treasury,  interested congressional committees, and to the heads of the other 19  agencies that are members of the Commission.

We also reviewed and analyzed  relevant documents, including the Strategy for Assuring Financial  Empowerment, National Strategy for Financial Literacy, the strategy\u2019s  Quick Reference Guide, and the Commission\u2019s meeting transcripts and  planning documents. In addition, we interviewed officials at the  Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Education, which  coordinates the Commission\u2019s work, as well as representatives of each of  the 19 other federal agencies represented on the Commission\u2014the  Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Education, Health and Human  Services, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, and Veterans Affairs;  the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation; Federal Reserve Board; Federal Trade Commission; General  Services Administration; National Credit Union Administration; Office of  the Comptroller of the Currency; Office of Personnel Management; Office  of Thrift Supervision; Securities and Exchange Commission; Small  Business Administration; and Social Security Administration. We also met  with a range of financial literacy representatives and experts outside of the  federal government to gather their views on the Commission\u2019s role and  activities. These included representatives of nonprofit organizations, such  as the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy and National  Endowment for Financial Education; the private sector, such as  Citigroup\u2019s Office of Financial Education and the American Institute of  Certified Public Accountants; state and local governments, such as offices  of financial education in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin; advocacy  organizations, such as the National Council of La Raza; and an academic  expert in the field of financial literacy.", "To review the Commission\u2019s progress in developing an effective national  strategy to promote financial literacy and education, we analyzed the  national strategy and gathered feedback on it from the stakeholders  described above. We also reviewed public comments on the national  strategy submitted to the Treasury Department, notes from meetings of  the national strategy working group, and summaries of six sector-specific  public meetings held by the Commission. We assessed the strategy, in part,  by benchmarking it against our prior work that has identified the general  characteristics of an effective national strategy. Our recommended  characteristics for national strategies were developed by reviewing several  sources of information, which included the Government Performance and  Results Act of 1993; legislative and executive branch guidance for national  strategies; general literature on strategic planning and performance; and  our prior work on issues related to planning, integration, implementation,  and other related subjects. To assess whether the National Strategy for  Financial Literacy contained these desirable characteristics, two analysts  independently assessed the strategy against each element of a  characteristic. If the analysts did not agree, their supervisor rated the  element, and all ratings were used to determine the final rating for that  element. We gave each of the six characteristics a rating of either  \u201cgenerally addresses,\u201d \u201cpartially addresses,\u201d or \u201cdoes not address.\u201d  According to our methodology, a strategy \u201cgenerally addresses\u201d a  characteristic when more than half of the elements of the characteristic  are addressed. Within our designation of \u201cpartially addresses\u201d is any  characteristic where at least one element was judged to be partially  addressed. A strategy \u201cdoes not address\u201d a characteristic when it does not  explicitly cite or discuss any parts of the elements of that characteristic or  any implicit references are either too vague or general to be useful.", "To review the Commission\u2019s progress in implementing its Web site and  telephone hotline, we interviewed representatives of the General Services  Administration (GSA), which operates these resources, and members of  the Commission\u2019s Web site and hotline subcommittees.

In addition, we gathered and reviewed  meeting minutes and planning documents of the Commission\u2019s Web site  and hotline subcommittees. We visited the Web site  (http://www.mymoney.gov) and systematically recorded, categorized, and  analyzed its content and organization. We also called the Commission\u2019s  toll-free telephone hotline (1-888-696-6639) to order the free financial  literacy tool kit and spoke to the hotline\u2019s telephone agents. To identify  best practices for U.S. government Web sites, we reviewed policies of the  Office of Management and Budget for federal public Web sites, as well as  recommended best practices and guidelines submitted to the office by the  Interagency Committee on Government Information. We also visited the  Web Content Managers Advisory Council\u2019s Web site  (http://www.webcontent.gov) and reviewed information on  implementation guidance for commonly accepted best practices.", "To determine the extent of public use of the Web site, hotline, and tool kit,  we obtained and analyzed data from GSA on their usage since their  inception in October 2004. To determine how public use of the  Commission\u2019s Web site compared with similar cross-agency portals, we  obtained and analyzed data from GSA on other Web sites hosted by its  Federal Citizen Information Center. To provide a point of comparison for  the usage of the Commission\u2019s Web site, we obtained and analyzed data on  the usage of financial education Web sites offered by three private  organizations\u2014the Employee Benefit Research Institute, the American  Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the National Endowment for  Financial Education. We compared the number of Web site \u201cvisits\u201d\u2014 defined as all the activity of one visitor to a site within a specified period,  usually 30 minutes\u2014across these sites. We did not independently verify  the data provided by these organizations.
