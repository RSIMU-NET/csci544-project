In 1996, the Congress made changes in the Food Stamp Program that, according to the Congressional Budget Office, will reduce program expenditures by a projected total of $23.1 billion for the 6-year period from fiscal year 1997 through 2002. These changes were mandated by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-193, Aug. 22, 1996), which overhauled the nation\u2019s welfare system.", "One provision of this act affects how the income of a household that receives food stamps is considered in determining the dollar value of the household\u2019s monthly food stamp benefit. Under the Food Stamp Program, the net monthly income of a household is one of the factors used to calculate the food stamp benefit. Net monthly income is determined by subtracting a number of approved deductions from the household\u2019s gross monthly income. One of these deductions is for shelter expenses that exceed 50 percent of a household\u2019s income after other allowable deductions have been taken. This deduction is known as the excess shelter expense deduction. Included among deductible shelter expenses are rent, mortgage payments, utility bills, property taxes, and insurance. The purpose of the excess shelter expense deduction is to take into consideration the effect of higher-than-average shelter costs on a low-income household\u2019s ability to purchase an adequate amount of food.", "The welfare reform act retained an existing limit, or cap, on the amount of excess shelter expenses that can be deducted from income for households receiving food stamps without elderly or disabled members. In fiscal year 1995, the cap on excess shelter expenses that could be deducted from gross income was $231 a month. Under previous legislation, the cap was scheduled to be removed on January 1, 1997. With the cap maintained, some households without elderly or disabled members will receive a smaller food stamp benefit than they would have received if the cap had been removed. This is because these households are not allowed to deduct all of their excess shelter expenses from their income used to calculate their monthly food stamp benefit.", "In October 1996, you asked us to study several issues related to the impact of welfare reform on the Food Stamp Program. This report is the first in a series addressing the legislative changes to the Food Stamp Program mandated by the 1996 welfare reform act. In this report, we describe, for fiscal year 1995, the (1) characteristics of households whose food stamp benefits were limited because of the cap on their deduction for excess shelter expenses and (2) extent to which food stamp benefits would have been higher for these households if there had not been a cap.", "To analyze the characteristics of households whose food stamp benefits were limited by the cap, we used the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) database on the characteristics of food stamp households for fiscal year 1995, the most current year for which data are available. Appendix II contains a description of the USDA database used in our analysis, information on sampling errors (margins of error), and further details on our methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Food Stamp Program helps low-income individuals and families obtain a more nutritious diet by supplementing the funds they have to spend on food with food stamp benefits. In fiscal year 1995, the average monthly food stamp benefit was $172 per household. These benefits are generally provided through coupons or electronically on debit cards (similar to a bank card) that may be used to purchase food at authorized stores.", "The Food Stamp Program is a federal-state partnership, with the federal government paying the full cost of the food stamp benefits and approximately half of the states\u2019 administrative costs. USDA\u2019s Food and Consumer Service administers the program at the federal level. States\u2019 responsibilities include certifying eligible households, calculating benefit amounts, and issuing benefits to participants who meet the income and asset standards set by the Congress.", "After a household is certified as being eligible for food stamps, the household\u2019s monthly food stamp benefit is computed on the basis of several factors, including the household\u2019s net monthly income. A household\u2019s net monthly income is computed by subtracting six allowable deductions from the household\u2019s gross monthly income: a standard deduction, an earned income deduction, a dependent care deduction, a medical deduction, a child support deduction, and an excess shelter expense deduction. A household\u2019s monthly food stamp benefit is computed by subtracting 30 percent of the household\u2019s net income from the maximum allowable food stamp benefit for the household\u2019s size. This last step is based on two assumptions. First, the maximum food stamp benefit represents the amount a household with zero net income would need to purchase food for nutritious but inexpensive meals each month. Second, a household is expected to spend 30 percent of its net income to buy enough food for a month. See appendix I for an example of how the net monthly income and food stamp benefit were calculated for a single female-headed household with three children in fiscal year 1995.", "In fiscal year 1995, about two-thirds, or about 7.2 million, of the almost 10.9 million food stamp households took the deduction for excess shelter expenses. Of the households taking the deduction, about 2.3 million were not subject to the deduction cap because they contained an elderly or disabled person. Of the remaining households taking the excess shelter expense deduction and subject to the cap, about 1.1 million households would have received more in food stamp benefits in the absence of the cap. These 1.1 million affected households, which represent about 10 percent of all food stamp households, would have received more in food stamp benefits in the absence of the cap because they (1) had excess shelter expenses they could not deduct from their income and (2) were not receiving the maximum allowable food stamp benefit. In contrast, about 90 percent, or about 9.8 million households, were not affected by the cap on the excess shelter expense deduction in fiscal year 1995 because (1) they did not take the deduction, (2) they had household members who were elderly or disabled, (3) their excess shelter expenses were lower than the cap, or (4) they were already receiving the maximum allowable food stamp benefit even though they had excess shelter expenses that were greater than the $231 cap.
