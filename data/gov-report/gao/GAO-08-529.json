CMS approves and oversees these waivers. Safeguards include the review of, and follow-up action to, critical incidents--events that harm or have the potential to harm waiver beneficiaries. GAO was asked to examine the extent to which states (1) include, as a critical incident, deaths among individuals with developmental disabilities in waiver programs; (2) have basic components in place to review such deaths; and (3) have adopted additional components to review deaths. GAO interviewed state developmental disabilities agency officials and external stakeholders in 14 states, e-mailed a survey to 35 states and D.C., interviewed experts, and reviewed documents."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["All 14 states whose officials GAO interviewed included death among individuals with developmental disabilities as a critical incident in their waiver programs. The developmental disabilities agencies in all 14 states required waiver service providers to report such deaths to the agencies. Consistent with CMS's expectation that states review critical incidents, nearly all states had processes in place to review these deaths. The extent to which states other than these 14 identified death as a critical incident has not been established. All but 1 of the 14 states included most of the six basic mortality review components identified as important by experts when reviewing deaths among individuals with developmental disabilities, but states varied somewhat in how they implemented components. For example, some states reviewed unexpected deaths only, while other states reviewed all deaths of individuals receiving Medicaid HCBS services. Mortality reviews were typically conducted at a local level, such as a county or region. Review findings led to local actions, such as tailored training with individual providers, to address quality of care. Officials in 13 of the 14 states reported that they aggregated mortality data, for example, by cause of death and age, whereas nationwide, 37 of 50 states aggregated mortality data and 13 states did not. For example, one California region observed an increase in choking deaths among individuals with developmental disabilities in 2007 and increased its educational outreach to families about choking prevention. Officials in several states said they believed their mortality reviews had reduced the risk of death and led to improvements in the quality of their HCBS waiver services. Four of the 14 states incorporated all additional components for more comprehensive mortality reviews. In general, these four additional components--state-level interdisciplinary mortality review committees, involvement of external stakeholders, statewide actions to address problems, and public reporting--gave the mortality reviews in these states greater accountability and transparency. Eleven of the 14 states had adopted at least one of these additional components. For example, 6 of the 14 states had interdisciplinary mortality review committees that reviewed deaths and that provided additional oversight to local review efforts, whereas nationwide, 24 of 50 states had review committees, and 26 states did not. In 6 of the 14 states, developmental disabilities agencies were not required to report deaths to the state protection and advocacy agencies, a key external stakeholder with authority to investigate deaths involving suspected abuse and neglect. Mortality reviews in 11 of the 14 states resulted in statewide actions, such as the issuance of safety alerts or new risk-prevention practices, to address quality-of-care concerns. Nationwide, 30 of 50 states took a statewide action to improve care, while 20 states did not. Four of the 14 states publicly reported mortality review information, such as posting annual mortality reports on their agency Web sites."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Medicaid, the joint federal-state health care financing program for  qualifying low-income individuals, plays a major role in the financing of  community-based long-term care for individuals with developmental  disabilities, including those with mental retardation. In 1981, Congress  passed section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act, which allowed states to  provide long-term care services, including personal care, day care,  transportation, and home modification, through Medicaid home and  community-based services (HCBS) waivers. While individuals with  developmental disabilities had often been cared for in large institutions,  Medicaid waivers allowed them to receive services in residential settings  such as small group homes or in the homes of parents or relatives. The  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency that  manages Medicaid, is responsible for ensuring that states satisfactorily  provide statutorily required assurances for HCBS waivers, which include  having necessary safeguards to protect the health and welfare of waiver  beneficiaries. To support this particular assurance, CMS requests states to  specify which critical incidents\u2014events that bring harm or have the  potential to bring harm to waiver recipients\u2014must be reported for review  and follow-up action. CMS identifies death as an example of a critical  incident, but does not specify how states should review deaths.", "Our 2003 report raised concerns about the need for CMS to provide states  with more detailed criteria regarding the necessary components of an  HCBS waiver quality assurance system, and about the limited information  provided by states to CMS on their mechanisms to monitor the quality of  care provided to waiver beneficiaries. Since 2004, several local and  national newspapers have reported on deaths that resulted from poor  quality of care among individuals with developmental disabilities living in  group homes. Individuals with developmental disabilities are vulnerable  because of their cognitive and physical impairments and dependency on  caregivers for assistance with many activities of daily living, such as eating  and bathing. For example, a 63-year-old man with visual impairment,  arthritis, and significant cognitive disabilities was living in a group home  that provided supportive care in the community and also offered  recreational activities. According to his legal guardians, they were notified  in 2004 that he had suffered a fatal heart attack. In part because he did not  have a history of heart problems, his guardians requested an autopsy. The  autopsy report identified quality-of-care concerns: the individual choked to  death on what appeared to be part of a sandwich, even though he was  supposed to be fed pureed food. A subsequent investigation of the death  and conditions in the group home found that the home was understaffed  and that staff did not consistently prepare meals to meet the special needs  of residents.", "In light of concerns about deaths resulting from poor quality of care and  inadequate oversight of individuals with developmental disabilities  receiving community-based care, you asked us to review states\u2019 current  processes for conducting mortality reviews and states\u2019 use of mortality  information to address quality-of-care concerns in Medicaid\u2019s HCBS  waiver program. Specifically, we examined the extent to which (1) states  include death among individuals with developmental disabilities as a  critical incident in waiver programs, (2) states have some basic  components in place to review deaths of individuals with developmental  disabilities in waiver programs, and (3) states have incorporated any  additional components to review deaths of individuals with developmental  disabilities in waiver programs.", "To assess whether states include death among individuals  with developmental disabilities as a critical incident in waiver programs,  we conducted interviews with state developmental disabilities agency  officials in 14 states. To identify the basic components of a mortality  review process, we conducted a literature review, interviewed experts in  the field of developmental disabilities, and reviewed documents authored  by these experts. These experts and state developmental disabilities  agency officials who conduct mortality reviews also contributed to the  identification of additional components of more comprehensive mortality  review processes. There may be other components for mortality reviews  that were not brought to our attention. To determine the extent to which  states incorporate both these basic and additional components into  mortality reviews, we conducted interviews with state developmental  disabilities agency officials in the 14 states and reviewed documents  related to their mortality review processes. We visited 4 of the 14 states  (Connecticut, Ohio, Oregon, and Texas) to gather detailed information  about how states review deaths of individuals with developmental  disabilities. We selected these four states because, among other  characteristics, they had well-established mortality review processes or a  large number of individuals with developmental disabilities being served  through a Medicaid HCBS waiver. We conducted focused telephone  interviews with the other 10 of 14 states that served the largest number of  individuals with developmental disabilities through Medicaid HCBS  waivers. Combined, these 14 states served approximately two-thirds of  Medicaid waiver beneficiaries with developmental disabilities nationally in  2005. However, the mortality review processes of this sample of 14 states  cannot be generalized to all states nationwide. We conducted a brief e-mail  survey of state developmental disabilities officials in the other 35 states  and the District of Columbia requesting information on three broad  aspects of mortality review processes. We also conducted interviews with  state protection and advocacy agencies in the 14 states and the District of  Columbia. Although we did not evaluate the effectiveness of state  mortality review processes, the data we collected allowed us to make  comparisons across states and to identify states with more comprehensive  mortality review processes. We conducted our review from December  2006 through April 2008 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.

About 40 percent  (415,053) of individuals served through such waivers had developmental  disabilities. Expenditures per person on this population are higher than  for other groups served through the waivers, such as the elderly, because  developmentally disabled individuals often require supportive care on a  24-hour basis. In 2004, annual Medicaid HCBS waiver expenditures per  person served were $36,697 on average for individuals with developmental  disabilities compared with $6,266 on average for elderly individuals. Fifty  states had 1915(c) waiver programs for individuals with developmental  disabilities in 2006.

As described in  CMS\u2019s guidance for HCBS waivers, a developmental disability is defined as  a severe, chronic disability, attributable to mental or physical impairments,  with onset before age 22.

CMS requires that states submit waiver  applications that identify and describe how they will provide each of the  statutory assurances. On the waiver application, CMS expects as part of  the health and welfare assurance that states specify (1) which critical  incidents states require to be reported to developmental disabilities  agencies and appropriate authorities for review and (2) the follow-up  actions required if the state identifies a situation in which a beneficiary  was not being safeguarded. CMS guidance for waiver applications  instructs that incidents of abuse, neglect, and exploitation, at a minimum,  be reported and reviewed; states may define other events as critical, as  well. For example, CMS identifies death as an event that states may  include as a critical incident.", "When reviewing HCBS waiver applications, CMS determines whether  states meet program expectations, such as including the entity responsible  for managing critical incidents to demonstrate necessary safeguards are in  place. Initial waiver applications, if approved, are approved for a 3-year  period, and subsequent applications are approved for an additional 5-year  period, unless CMS determines that the assurances provided during the  preceding term have not been met. In a 2003 report, we examined the  adequacy of CMS\u2019s oversight of state Medicaid waiver programs and  recommended that the Administrator of CMS develop and provide states  with more detailed criteria regarding the necessary components of an  HCBS waiver quality assurance system.", "In response to our recommendation, CMS added an expectation to its  Medicaid HCBS waiver program for states to improve the quality of waiver  services and has implemented this new expectation in the form of an  additional section on the HCBS waiver application. CMS defines quality  improvement as the process of collecting information about Medicaid  HCBS waiver programs to identify and correct concerns and to identify  areas for improving the care provided to waiver beneficiaries. States can  use information gathered from their critical incident reviews to determine  whether strategies are needed to improve the quality of care. States  applying for new waivers or waiver renewals after May 2005 were asked to  submit a detailed description of their quality improvement strategies. For  example, CMS guidance directs states to describe processes used to  measure the performance of their waiver programs and to develop  initiatives for quality improvement. CMS is encouraging and helping states  to develop quality improvement strategies. As of October 2007, CMS had  provided technical assistance to more than 40 states and more than 140  waiver programs that requested assistance in developing and  implementing their quality improvement strategies for the Medicaid HCBS  waiver programs. In addition, a provision of the Deficit Reduction Act of  2005 requires the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to develop  HCBS quality-of-care measures, which CMS may incorporate into its  waiver program if the measures reinforce the agency\u2019s expectations for  states regarding quality improvement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Operation of Waiver Programs", "paragraphs": ["When a state receives a Medicaid HCBS waiver, the state\u2019s Medicaid  agency is accountable to CMS for compliance with waiver program  expectations.

For waivers serving individuals with developmental disabilities,  operational responsibility is often delegated to the state developmental  disabilities agency.

Instead, information was referred to  investigative authorities, such as adult protective services, if the screening  process revealed the death was suspicious. Texas state officials also told  us that they did not currently aggregate mortality data.", "However, there was variation among the states in how they implemented  the six components. Officials in some states in which we conducted  interviews told us they reviewed only deaths determined to be unexpected  or suspicious, but in other states all deaths among individuals receiving  agency services were reviewed. Some states also used criteria other than  the cause of death to determine whether a case warranted further review.  In Washington, for example, all suspicious deaths in community settings  were reviewed regardless of cause of death, but unanticipated deaths were  reviewed on a case-by-case basis, depending on the outcome of a local- level screening process. In Massachusetts, officials routinely reviewed the  deaths of all individuals, including those residing in a private home, if they  had been receiving more than 15 hours of agency-funded community  support services. Agency officials in other states we interviewed also told  us that they did not generally have enough information to conduct a  thorough mortality review for individuals receiving limited waiver  services.

Screening this  information allows local agency officials to identify cases of possible  abuse or neglect of Medicaid HCBS waiver beneficiaries and respond to  such cases by providing for the safety of other individuals with  developmental disabilities cared for in the same setting, as well as  referring the cases to the appropriate authorities for criminal  investigations. In Florida, for example, local nurses, who were  developmental disabilities agency officials, screened information about  the circumstances surrounding deaths to determine if they warranted  further review. When the local nurses suspected abuse or neglect, adult  protective services and law enforcement officials were notified to conduct  an investigation.

Lab reports and individual support or behavioral plans might also be  reviewed to better understand each case. Reviewing multiple pieces of  information surrounding the death is useful because they can show  whether appropriate medical care was provided in the days and months  before death and whether individual support plans were followed.

For example, for the purposes of quality assurance, state- level mortality review committees in both Connecticut and Massachusetts  reviewed at least 10 percent of cases that local officials had determined  did not warrant further review. Massachusetts officials told us that the  state\u2019s committee reviewed these cases to ensure that its review  procedures were followed, these cases were being appropriately closed  locally, and there was consistency across the different local levels  conducting reviews.", "In addition, state-level committees examined in greater depth cases that  were medically complex or unusual. For example, in Ohio, the state-level  committee recently reviewed a case where an individual died suddenly.  The individual had multiple medical conditions, including a history of  heart disease, and upon review, the committee found that this individual  was taking a medication contraindicated for persons who have or had  heart problems. The committee issued a safety alert\u2014a notice to  community providers to increase their awareness of a particular risk or  safety concern\u2014about the use of this medication by individuals with  developmental disabilities who have heart conditions. In another  example, the Minnesota state-level review committee reviewed an unusual  case where an individual was hospitalized for a minor surgical procedure  and discharged. Three days later the individual was readmitted to the  hospital with a diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia and an overdose of  sedatives and prescription pain medications; after being placed on life  support the individual\u2019s condition worsened and life support was  withdrawn, resulting in death. After review of the death by the state-level  review committee, the developmental disabilities agency issued a safety  alert, including a recommendation by the committee for improving the  care provided to individuals receiving pain medication.", "State-level committee reviews were more likely than those at the local  level to be conducted by physicians, specifically, physicians with  experience treating individuals with developmental disabilities. Of the 6  states that used state-level interdisciplinary mortality review committees,  officials in 4 states told us that physicians sat on their committees and  routinely reviewed deaths. By contrast, only 1 of the 14 states reported  that physicians routinely participated in the local review process.  Physician participation is important given the complex medical conditions  of individuals with developmental disabilities. For example, Ohio officials  told us that it is important for physicians with experience treating  individuals with developmental disabilities to review medically complex  cases because such physicians are able to assess the adequacy or  appropriateness of the medical care provided prior to death. Officials also  said that such physicians are highly qualified to evaluate actions taken by  other physicians or hospital staff\u2014especially medical personnel without  experience caring for individuals with developmental disabilities. For  example, one physician serving as Medical Director for a state  developmental disabilities agency noted that a death may be  inappropriately attributed to natural causes by nonmedical reviewers but a  physician\u2019s in-depth review of medical records and medication logs could  uncover poor care that contributed to the death.", "In addition to physicians, state-level interdisciplinary mortality review  committees incorporated the knowledge and perspectives of a variety of  professionals with differing experiences and responsibility. While  physicians and nurses contributed medical and other clinical expertise to  the mortality review committees, licensing, public health, investigative,  and quality assurance professionals brought other important kinds of  expertise. One state official told us that the participation of various types  of professionals improved the quality of mortality review findings. Some  state officials we interviewed described the value that different  professionals brought to mortality reviews. For example, they said that  state licensing professionals are best able to assess whether a provider  followed state regulations and standards of practice for care. Similarly, an  investigator is best suited to evaluate the circumstances of death for  possible abuse or neglect. Finally, quality assurance professionals have  expertise in monitoring and improving delivery systems and, as a result,  can evaluate whether statewide actions may be needed to address  identified quality-of-care concerns.", "According to the 36 states that completed our e-mail survey, the  prevalence of state-level interdisciplinary mortality review committees  was similar to that in the 14 states whose officials we interviewed\u2014about  half had such a committee (18 of 36 states). Combined, 24 of 50 states  reported having a state-level review committee, and 26 did not. The types  of members on state-level committees in the 36 states we surveyed were  similar to those in the 14 states in which we conducted interviews. Among  the 24 of 50 states that we interviewed or surveyed that reported having  committees, about 80 percent included physicians or nurses, and   67 percent included quality assurance professionals. Nearly half of all  states with committees also reported that they included investigative or  forensic professionals as well as representatives from the provider  community."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Half of the 14 States Routinely Include External Stakeholders in Mortality Reviews, Promoting Independence or Shared Accountability", "paragraphs": ["Seven of the 14 states routinely included stakeholders external to the  developmental disabilities agency in their mortality review process. State  officials told us they included external stakeholders as a way to promote  independence or shared accountability. Four of 7 states used state  protection and advocacy agencies regularly for this purpose. For  example, in Connecticut an official of the protection and advocacy agency  was a member of the developmental disabilities agency\u2019s state-level  interdisciplinary mortality review committee. In several of these 7 states,  other organizations or state offices with a role in protecting and  advocating for the rights of individuals with developmental disabilities  also participated in the state developmental disabilities agency mortality  reviews, or they conducted their own reviews. In Massachusetts, for  example, a representative of the Disabled Persons Protection Commission  was a member of the agency\u2019s state-level interdisciplinary mortality review  committee, while in Minnesota the Office of the Ombudsman for Mental  Health and Developmental Disabilities\u2014a state office separate from the  developmental disabilities agency\u2014independently reviewed each death  among individuals with developmental disabilities.", "Several developmental disabilities experts and state agency officials told  us that external stakeholder involvement in states\u2019 mortality review  processes can promote independence and shared accountability.  According to experts, a natural incentive exists for state agency officials to  minimize errors or program weaknesses identified through the mortality  review process, making independence important. A federal district court  found that the District of Columbia\u2019s developmental disabilities agency  deleted factual information about eight deaths among individuals with  developmental disabilities from death investigation reports in order to  minimize quality-of-care concerns. Specifically, information was deleted  about delays in obtaining consent for medical procedures and gaps in case  management. During our interviews with developmental disabilities  agency officials in 14 states, we observed that external stakeholder  involvement could also result in shared accountability for improving the  quality of care. Because stakeholders may influence how the agency  addresses identified quality-of-care concerns, stakeholders may be more  likely to support the agency\u2019s efforts to improve the quality of care for  individuals with developmental disabilities.", "The protection and advocacy agencies are of particular value as external  stakeholders because of their authority to investigate certain deaths.  Moreover, states that receive protection and advocacy funding are  required to provide information on the quality of HCBS services to their  protection and advocacy agencies, to the extent information is available.  We found that state developmental disabilities agencies in 8 of the 14  states were required to report deaths among individuals with  developmental disabilities to their state\u2019s protection and advocacy agency.  The protection and advocacy agencies received notification in several  ways, such as on a case-by-case basis or through the distribution of weekly  reports of deaths. Developmental disabilities agency officials in 2 states  told us that they granted access to their electronic critical incident  management system databases to the protection and advocacy agencies in  their states. For example, while the protection and advocacy agencies  were not notified of all deaths in Pennsylvania and Ohio, protection and  advocacy officials told us they could access death reports among  individuals with developmental disabilities by monitoring the critical  incident database. In 6 of the 14 states in which protection and advocacy  officials were not notified of deaths among individuals with developmental  disabilities, protection and advocacy agency officials told us that state  developmental disabilities agencies should be required to notify their  protection and advocacy agencies of these deaths. Protection and  advocacy agencies that did not receive notification of deaths relied on the  media or concerned family members to alert them of deaths, but such  notification was inconsistent and sometimes happened long after the  death occurred.", "Because abuse and neglect can be difficult to detect among individuals  with developmental disabilities, developmental disabilities agency officials  may attribute some deaths to known or natural causes, even though abuse  or neglect contributed to death. As a result, such cases may not have been  referred to investigative authorities, such as medical examiners or the  state protection and advocacy agency. One state\u2019s protection and  advocacy officials told us that their own investigation of a death after  notification by a family member identified care concerns that state  developmental disabilities agency and law enforcement officials had not  detected. Protection and advocacy officials in two other states found  neglect when they conducted reviews of two deaths that the states had  determined were due to natural causes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mortality Reviews Result in Statewide Actions to Address Similar Care Concerns and to Help Prevent Deaths in Most of the 14 States", "paragraphs": ["In 11 of the 14 states, mortality reviews resulted in statewide actions to  address similar quality-of-care concerns and to help prevent avoidable  deaths among individuals with developmental disabilities. The statewide  actions resulting from mortality reviews included the issuance of safety  alerts, additional or enhanced training of staff, and new risk-prevention  practices. The most common statewide action\u2014taken by 9 of the 14  states\u2014was the issuance of safety alerts. For example, after several  individuals with developmental disabilities in Minnesota died, in part  because of delayed emergency medical care, the agency sent a statewide  safety alert to service providers with recommendations to prevent similar  incidents, including that community providers authorize their direct care  staff to call 911 when they suspect a medical emergency without first  obtaining approval from a manager. In Ohio, officials alerted agency staff  to an increase, from 2005 to 2006, in the number of deaths statewide  resulting from aspiration pneumonia. As a result, these officials  encouraged agency staff statewide to closely examine hospitalization  cases resulting from pneumonia and to train care providers on risk factors  to help prevent this condition.", "In 7 of the 14 states, developmental disabilities agencies provided  additional or enhanced training to staff statewide, and in 6 of the 14 states  they developed new risk prevention interventions for providers statewide.  As a result of several choking deaths, the Connecticut developmental  disabilities agency developed a training program on swallowing risks that  addressed the responsibilities of providers when caring for individuals  with swallowing disorders. The agency also required that all direct care  staff who provided care to individuals with developmental disabilities  receive this training. Based on mortality review findings, Oregon\u2019s  developmental disabilities agency developed an assessment tool to be  completed and regularly updated on individuals with developmental  disabilities to identify and properly address risks associated with deaths  among this population, including choking, dehydration, constipation,  seizures, and falls. Several nurses in Oregon told us that they believed the  use of the risk assessment tool had led to improvements in the quality of  care provided to individuals with developmental disabilities.", "According to responses to our e-mail survey by the other 36 states, 19 state  developmental disabilities agencies reported taking a statewide action to  improve care based on mortality information. When combined with the 14  states in which we conducted interviews, 30 of 50 states took a statewide  action, while 20 did not. The most frequently cited statewide actions  nationwide\u2014including the 36 states that completed our e-mail survey\u2014 were the issuance of safety alerts, additional or enhanced training of staff,  and new risk-prevention practices. In total, 60 percent of states nationwide  addressed quality-of-care concerns through such actions. Based on  examples provided, choking was the most frequently addressed quality-of- care concern nationwide. For example, among states that reported taking  a statewide action, 43 percent addressed choking with a statewide action,  such as additional training.

Massachusetts and  Connecticut have posted annual mortality reports on their agency Web  sites, which included mortality statistics for the population of individuals  with developmental disabilities served by their agencies as well as trend  analyses of those deaths over time. According to agency officials in  Massachusetts, publicly reporting information about mortality review  findings helps to ensure transparency in the mortality review process and  demonstrates to the public areas where the agency should direct its efforts  to improve the quality of care.

All 14 states  whose officials we interviewed included death among individuals with  developmental disabilities as a critical incident in their waiver programs.  Nearly all of the 14 states had some processes in place for conducting  mortality reviews of individuals with developmental disabilities, even  though CMS does not have an expectation for states to review deaths as  critical incidents under the waiver program. Most of the 14 states  implemented basic components of mortality review processes that experts  we interviewed agreed were important, such as the review of unexpected  or suspicious deaths. Several states also implemented additional  components, such as using a state-level interdisciplinary committee to  review individual deaths and routinely including external stakeholders, for  more comprehensive mortality review systems. We do not know the extent  to which all components were implemented in states we did not interview.  However, based on information provided by all states nationwide, (1) 13  states did not aggregate mortality data (a basic component for mortality  reviews), (2) 26 states did not utilize an interdisciplinary mortality review  committee to review deaths among individuals with developmental  disabilities (an additional component), and (3) 20 states had not taken a  statewide action to improve care based on mortality review information  (an additional component). Moreover, the extent to which states other  than the 14 whose officials we interviewed identified death as a critical  incident has not been established.", "Given the concern that agency officials may minimize identified program  weaknesses, routinely including external stakeholders\u2014such as the state  office of protection and advocacy\u2014is especially important because it  promotes accountability and independence to the state mortality review  process. When alerted to suspicious deaths, state protection and advocacy  agencies can conduct their own investigations, but not all protection and  advocacy agencies were systematically notified of deaths by state  developmental disabilities agencies and instead relied on the less  consistent or less timely notification of deaths by the media or concerned  family members.", "Many of the states whose officials we interviewed told us that they  considered their mortality review system to be one aspect of their strategy  to improve the quality of care in their Medicaid HCBS programs. CMS has  recently made some important changes in an effort to clarify its quality  expectations for HCBS waivers, such as requesting that states describe  their quality improvement strategies as part of the waiver application.

Our report does not state or suggest that  all such deaths are adverse outcomes; however, we did report that all  deaths of individuals with developmental disabilities served by Medicaid  HCBS waiver programs should be screened to determine whether further  review is warranted. HHS also stated the importance of ensuring that any  actions taken to address our recommendations are applicable to all  populations served by HCBS waiver programs (e.g., the aged) and not just  individuals with developmental disabilities. While the focus of our report  was specifically on individuals with developmental disabilities who are  vulnerable and often have complex medical needs, we support HHS\u2019s  encouraging states to utilize mortality reviews as one aspect of their  quality improvement strategy for all populations served by 1915(c) waiver  programs.", "Our evaluation of HHS\u2019s specific comments on each of our  recommendations follows.", "Disseminate information to states about basic and additional  components for mortality reviews.

HHS also stated that CMS will involve these stakeholders in a  discussion on the topic of mortality reviews to help determine whether the  six basic components we identified are applicable to other populations  served by Medicaid 1915(c) waiver programs.", "Encourage states to include death as a critical incident and  conduct mortality reviews if they do not already do so; and  encourage states to broaden their mortality review processes if  they already include death as a critical incident and conduct  mortality reviews. HHS responded that CMS concurred with this  recommendation. However, the agency did not fully address it. HHS\u2019s  comments state that CMS will initiate a meaningful dialogue with its  stakeholders to encourage states\u2019 broader use of processes to review  suspicious deaths. As noted in our report, however, screening mortality  information about all deaths among individuals with developmental  disabilities is a basic component of a mortality review system and is  necessary to determine whether further review of each death is  warranted\u2014including but not limited to those deaths involving suspected  abuse or neglect, or that were unexpected. CMS did not directly address  part of our recommendation that it should encourage states that do not  already do so to include death as a critical incident. We continue to believe  that this is important because states are expected to report and review  critical incidents and take follow-up actions when a beneficiary is not  being safeguarded. In addition, states may use information from their  critical incident reviews to identify areas for improving care provided to  waiver beneficiaries.", "Establish an expectation that state Medicaid agencies report all  deaths among individuals with developmental disabilities receiving  waiver services to their state\u2019s office of protection and advocacy.

HHS also believes it is important that CMS\u2019s actions taken to  address our recommendations apply uniformly to all populations served  by 1915(c) waiver programs. According to a CMS official, the agency\u2019s goal  is to have a consistent set of expectations for all waiver populations  served instead of expectations tailored to specific populations. The elderly  would be one such population. Given this goal, HHS commented that it  may be difficult to require the reporting of all deaths of individuals being  served by these waiver programs to the state offices of protection and  advocacy because these offices focus primarily on individuals with  developmental disabilities. We continue to believe that the state protection  and advocacy agencies are the most appropriate entities for reporting  deaths among individuals with developmental disabilities, a vulnerable  population that often has complex medical needs.
