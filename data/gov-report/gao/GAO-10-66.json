Consequently, decision makers at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the Congress need accurate and timely financial information to assess the effectiveness of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). This report assesses whether controls in place during the 2005 to 2007 time frame were effective and whether actions to improve controls are likely to address identified weaknesses. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed and analyzed FEMA/NFIP guidance, data, and financial reports, reviewed prior audit reports, interviewed FEMA officials and contractors, and selected a sample of claim losses paid to determine whether claim files contained key documents."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Weaknesses in internal controls impaired FEMA's ability to maintain effective transaction-level accountability. These weaknesses limited FEMA's ability to assure accurate NFIP financial data during the 3-year period from fiscal year 2005 through 2007, which included the financial activity related to the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes. FEMA relies heavily on Write Your Own (WYO) insurance companies to carry out NFIP financial activities such as documenting and maintaining claim files. FEMA's Bureau and Statistical Agent (BSA) serves as a liaison between the government and WYO insurance companies. GAO identified weaknesses at three levels of the NFIP transaction accountability and financial reporting process. First, at the WYO level, our internal control testing of a statistical sample determined that almost 71 percent of WYO company claims loss files did not have the necessary documents to support the claims, or reports were filed late. Second, incomplete BSA-level premium data files (lacking key information such as insureds' names and addresses) prevented an assessment of the reliability of reported NFIP premium amounts. Further, BSA-level internal control activities were ineffective in verifying the accuracy of WYO-submitted data. Lastly, FEMA's financial reporting process uses summary data that is overly reliant on error-prone manual data entry. GAO found that FEMA's broader oversight structures were also of limited effectiveness. Specifically, GAO found weaknesses in three key structures FEMA relies on to provide oversight over NFIP and monitor financial activity: (1) WYO company audits--specifically, we found that FEMA did not collect the results of state insurance department audits related to flood insurance activity and did not perform any audits for cause; (2) triennial operational reviews of WYO insurance companies--we found that FEMA did not perform operational reviews at almost one third of all WYO companies over the 3-year period; and (3) FEMA's claims reinspection program--we found that FEMA used flawed sampling procedures in the claims reinspection program. These findings are consistent with weaknesses GAO has previously identified. These oversight weaknesses limited FEMA's ability to identify and address financial transaction control breakdowns resulting from the 2005 hurricanes. FEMA's initiatives to improve specific internal control weaknesses and the overall NFIP control environment since the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes have done little to address many of the NFIP financial data deficiencies highlighted by these catastrophic events. FEMA has made improvements such as revising its claim reinspection selection methodology to provide for review of a random selection of a statistically representative sample of claim files. However, the modified reinspection methodology still does not include all claims. FEMA has also implemented a tracking system to monitor the number of WYO biennial audits obtained and reviewed. Further, FEMA has a system modernization development and implementation effort under way. It is too soon to determine the extent to which these efforts will achieve program efficiencies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a component of the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is charged with administering  the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).

Through the WYO  program, insurance companies sell and service flood insurance policies  and adjust claims after flood losses. The federal government acts as a  guarantor of flood insurance coverage for WYO policies issued under the  WYO Arrangement.

Until 2004, NFIP was able to cover most of its losses.  However, in order to pay claims arising from the 2005 hurricanes (Katrina,  Rita, and Wilma), the Congress authorized loans to NFIP of about $16.8  billion from the Treasury that the program used to cover the enormous  number of claims. Given this large debt and ongoing complex financial  challenges created by the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes, the fiscal  sustainability of the flood insurance program has come under scrutiny.", "In March 2006, we designated NFIP as a high-risk program in part because  of the program\u2019s financial condition and inability to repay borrowed funds.

Figure  4 shows that few audits were conducted for fiscal years 2005 and 2006, but  that there was considerable improvement for fiscal years 2006 and 2007.", "Prior to fiscal year 2008, FEMA had not tracked and reviewed these audit  results because FEMA did not follow NFIP policies and procedures  requiring it to receive and analyze such information. Accordingly, FEMA  could not determine whether it received and reviewed all required audit  reports, nor have a basis for monitoring implementation of necessary  corrective actions. In response to our previous recommendation regarding  this long-standing concern, FEMA is now using a tracking mechanism to  document audit reports received and those reviewed by FEMA staff.  According to FEMA, once the financial audit reports are received, staff  and management now review the audit reports and document the results  of their review on the tracking schedule. While improvements have been  made with regard to tracking and reviewing the results of biennial audits,  this is only one component of FEMA\u2019s oversight structure and, as  discussed in this report, we continue to note weaknesses in the other  areas.", "FEMA has a system development and implementation effort, referred to as  NextGen, under way. This effort has experienced delays and it is too  soon to determine whether planned program efficiencies\u2014such as  confirmation of insured\u2019s property address\u2014will be achieved under the  new system. According to FEMA, the NextGen system implementation  effort is designed to be an insurance system that links key data elements  like claims and policies through shared processes. Under the current  system, the BSA maintains claim losses paid and premium policies data in  separate databases. FEMA officials have expressed concern about the  readiness of the NextGen system to support NFIP program operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As currently designed and implemented, FEMA\u2019s internal controls over  NFIP offer limited transaction-level accountability and assurances that  financial reporting is accurate or that insurance company operations  conform to program requirements. Transaction-level accountability and  reporting to administer NFIP are fundamental to attaining accountability  over program resources. Internal controls are also critical to ensure that  claim payments are adequately supported, and FEMA was missing key  documentation to support claims. Given the involvement of multiple  private entities participating in this insurance program, establishing and  implementing effective policies and procedures to thoroughly implement  required audits and overall operational and targeted reviews will be  critical for FEMA to exercise its managerial responsibilities. FEMA has  taken some steps to strengthen NFIP internal controls such as overseeing  WYO companies by tracking and reviewing the results of their required  biennial financial audits. The enormous potential financial burden on the  federal government that flood events pose, coupled with the risks of  inaccurate and incomplete NFIP financial information described in this  report, serve to underscore that effective NFIP controls are critical. As  such, it will be important to take immediate actions to improve these  controls over NFIP transactions, financial reporting, and oversight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the financial reporting process and strengthen internal  controls, we recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security direct  the Acting Assistant Administrator, FEMA Mitigation Directorate, to take  the following seven actions:    Augment NFIP policies to require the BSA to develop procedures to  analyze financial reports in relation to the transaction-level information  that WYO companies submit for statistical purposes.", "Revise required internal control activities for the BSA to provide for  verifying and validating the reliability of WYO-reported financial  information based upon a review of a sample of the underlying  transactions or events, or obtain verification that these objectives have  been met through independent audits of the WYO companies.", "Determine the feasibility of integrating and streamlining numerous  existing NFIP financial reporting processes to reduce the risk of errors  inherent in the manual recording of accounting transactions into multiple  systems.", "Establish and implement procedures to require reviewing available  information such as the results of biennial audits, operational reviews, and  claim reinspections to determine whether the targeted audits for cause  managerial tool should be used.", "Establish and implement procedures to require maintaining and  considering current information from an independent source regarding  state audit results to gather pertinent information such as customer  service issues and inform determinations about when to conduct audits  for cause.", "Establish and implement procedures to schedule and conduct all required  operational reviews within the prescribed 3-year period.", "Establish and implement procedures to select statistically representative  samples of all claims as a basis for conducting reinspections of claims by  general adjusters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Secretary of  Homeland Security. Comments received from the DHS Departmental  GAO/OIG Liaison Office on behalf of FEMA are reprinted in appendix II. In  its comments, FEMA concurred with two of our recommendations, stated  that two recommendations were unnecessary in that the recommended  procedures were already in place, and disagreed with the remaining three  recommendations. We reaffirm all seven recommendations.", "With respect to the recommendations for which FEMA concurred  regarding (1) streamlining financial reporting processes and (2)  conducting operational reviews, FEMA noted it has actions under way to  integrate and streamline numerous existing financial reporting processes  in the design of a new NFIP system, and stated that its new operational  review process will address our recommendation to schedule and conduct  all required operational reviews within the prescribed 3-year period.", "Regarding our recommendation for establishing and implementing  procedures for reviewing all available audit and other reports, FEMA  stated that it already had a process in place to review WYO company  performance and trigger audits for cause. FEMA further commented that  the Standards Committee considers the results of biennial audits,  operational reviews, and claims reinspections when it reviews company  performance and considers whether to recommend audits for cause. We  disagree that the process FEMA has in place is sufficient to address our  recommendation. As discussed in our draft report, during the period of our  review, FEMA management, including the Standards Committee, lacked  timely access to all audit and other reports because FEMA did not  systematically track and centrally store all required evaluations,  inspections, audits, or reviews. Therefore, without further action to  establish additional procedures directed at ensuring access and a  systematic review of WYO company performance, FEMA will continue to  be unable to effectively oversee the 90-plus participating insurance  companies or determine whether any audits for cause are necessary.", "Also, regarding our recommendation concerning selecting statistically  representative samples of claims for reinspections, FEMA stated that the  reinspections are not intended to be a definitive audit of the NFIP\u2019s claims  handling process, and cited the random sample of claims it currently has  in place. We disagree. As discussed in our draft report, adjusters selected  claims to reinspect based upon judgmental criteria, not on a random  sample. Further, FEMA only required reinspection when there were more  than 400 claims per flood event for a particular WYO company. Because  reinspections are conducted principally on open claims files to document  the appropriateness of the original claims adjuster\u2019s work, the lack of a  statistically representative sample not only precludes FEMA from  projecting the results of these reinspections to determine the overall  accuracy of claims, it also limits FEMA\u2019s ability to continuously assess the  overall performance of insurance companies and adjusters in fulfilling  their NFIP responsibilities. FEMA also noted that claims operational  reviews are designed to provide feedback on claims settlements and  ascertain compliance by WYO companies. The claims operational reviews  that FEMA cited, while an important oversight mechanism, do not allow  for continuous feedback concerning the overall insurance company  performance.", "We also continue to reaffirm our three recommendations for which FEMA  disagreed in its comments on our draft report. First, with respect to our  recommendations that FEMA develop financial reports using the  transaction-level information that WYO companies currently submit for  statistical purposes, FEMA stated that implementing our recommendation  would be onerous and burdensome because of the number of transactions  involved. We subsequently adjusted our recommendation to have NFIP  augment its policies to require the BSA to develop procedures to analyze  financial reports in relation to the transaction-level information that WYO  companies submit for statistical purposes. Such a procedure would help  compensate for the risks introduced by the current approach of entering  summary-level information to its financial reporting system. Because WYO  companies already submit transaction-level data on claims losses paid and  premiums written and FEMA uses this information for statistical purposes,  using these transaction-level financial data to increase the reliability of  FEMA\u2019s financial reporting should impose minimal additional burden.", "Also, with respect to FEMA\u2019s nonconcurrence with our recommendation  to verify and validate WYO-reported financial information, FEMA  maintained that the form and structure of the transaction-level detail is  audited at the source, including consideration of the relevance, reliability,  and accuracy of the transaction-level detail. However, as discussed in our  report, during the period of our review, we were not provided any  evidence showing that FEMA obtained any assurances concerning the  accuracy or validity of WYO company transaction-level financial data.  Specifically, FEMA did not demonstrate that it had mechanisms in place  during fiscal years 2005 through 2007 for receiving and reviewing the  results of the required biennial financial statement audits of WYO  companies, or for tracking completion of these audits. FEMA was unable  to provide evidence of whether all WYO companies had completed  biennial audits and had not reviewed the results of these WYO company  biennial audits. Further, as discussed in our report, FEMA officials  exempted certain WYO companies from the biennial audit requirement  after the 2005 hurricane season. Therefore, FEMA had no assurance as to  the accuracy or validity of WYO company transaction-level financial data.  We reaffirm our recommendation that FEMA revise required internal  control activities for the BSA to provide required procedures for verifying  and validating the reliability of WYO-reported financial information based  upon a review of a sample of the underlying transactions or events. We  also adjusted our recommendation to include the option for FEMA to  obtain assurance of the reliability of WYO company-reported financial data  by verifying that those objectives were met through the independent  audits of WYO companies.", "Finally, FEMA did not concur with our recommendation to maintain and  consider information from an independent source regarding state audit  results in determining whether to conduct audits for cause. FEMA  contended that such sources do not focus on federal programs, such as  NFIP. However, FEMA\u2019s Financial Control Plan states that it is expected  that audits of WYO companies by state insurance departments will include  flood insurance activity. Further, FEMA acknowledges receiving  information from a source independent of the WYO companies.  Specifically, it acknowledged receiving correspondence from state  insurance departments regarding issues of customer service with the WYO  companies. It is important for FEMA to establish and implement  procedures to require maintaining and considering all current information  available from an independent source regarding state audit results. We  found that FEMA rarely received or reviewed information from state  insurance department audits. Consequently, we continue to reaffirm our  recommendation to obtain and consider independent information on state  audits of the WYO companies, rather than continuing to rely solely on the  WYO company that underwrites policies and processes claims to alert  FEMA of any state issues.", "FEMA also expressed concern over several points in our draft report\u2019s  narrative. We continue to affirm the process descriptions and the findings  in our draft report but made several changes in the report to clarify the  narrative. Our responses to other FEMA concerns with our draft\u2019s  narrative are provided following FEMA\u2019s comments in appendix II.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

We selected these years to identify transactions  relevant to the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes and to capture more current  financial information. We reviewed the Write Your Own (WYO) Financial  Control Plan, WYO Accounting Procedures Manual, and other relevant  NFIP policy guidance documents to determine the design of NFIP financial  reporting processes and related internal controls. We reviewed NFIP  transaction accountability in accordance with the guidelines of the Federal  Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA). We also  interviewed Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), FEMA  contractors, and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of  Inspector General (OIG) officials to document and obtain an  understanding of the financial reporting process and related internal  controls for NFIP transactions. We conducted walkthroughs to understand  the reporting process for financial transactions including the review of  related evidentiary supporting documentation, including journal vouchers  and adjusting journal entries. Further, to determine how the financial  transactions were recorded, specifically insurance premiums written and  claim losses paid, we reviewed NFIP financial reports and met with NFIP  program and FEMA officials to obtain an understanding of the processing  cycles for premiums written and claim losses paid. We interviewed FEMA  personnel and contractors responsible for collecting and maintaining NFIP  financial data to understand the available data. In addition, we obtained  requested extracts of NFIP databases of the insurance premiums written  and claim losses paid for these fiscal years to identify the total population  including the number of transactions, and planned to select statistical  samples of claims and policies to test from these databases. We reconciled  the Bureau and Statistical Agent (BSA) extracts of net premiums written  and claim losses paid databases to the BSA prepared financial statements  based on the data provided to FEMA. Once we were able to successfully  complete our reconciliation, but before selecting samples, we performed  data reliability tests on the databases and determined that the claims  losses paid database was sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We did not  audit the data that WYO companies submit to FEMA\u2019s contractor, CSC,  nor did we audit the data produced by CSC or the information included by  FEMA in DHS\u2019 annual reports. We used the statistical samples of insurance  claim losses paid as outlined below to perform detailed testing through  verification of data fields such as coverage and deductible amounts, claim  payment amounts, and policy effective dates against source documents.  We also used these samples to further test internal controls over NFIP  financial reporting. Results from the statistical samples were projected by  fiscal year both individually and combined. See table 1 below for details  related to the statistical samples.", "Using the above statistical samples, we also tested other NFIP program- oversight controls as deemed necessary and in accordance with our  engagement objectives. In order to ensure efficient detailed testing, we  conducted dual-purpose testing, which includes reviewing dollar amounts  as well as the related internal controls. We found information in the  premiums written database was not sufficiently reliable for our purposes.  We were unable to perform detailed testing of the premiums written  database due to a significant number of data-reliability issues that we  discovered.", "To evaluate oversight structures in place to monitor NFIP financial activity  for the 3-year period covering 2005 to 2007, we reviewed prior GAO and  DHS OIG reports to identify and follow up on any previously reported  weaknesses or concerns, including sample selection for claims  reinspections and tracking results of biennial financial audits. We also  interviewed FEMA personnel and contractors regarding the oversight  structures in place. In addition, we identified and assessed significant  oversight structures as outlined in the WYO Financial Control Plan, and  analyzed the results of these controls.", "To assess whether recent and planned actions to improve NFIP controls  and the overall control environment are likely to address identified  financial control weaknesses, we reviewed NFIP policy and procedural  guidance that has been issued subsequent to the 2005 Gulf Coast  hurricanes.
