SSA is also authorized to conduct CDRs on individuals receiving disability benefits under the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, and recent legislation requires CDRs for some who receive SSI benefits. Together, the programs pay about $60 billion annually to 9 million disabled beneficiaries; an additional 1.6 million nondisabled dependents of DI beneficiaries also receive benefits.", "Programs of this magnitude require sound management to ensure that funds are being spent as the Congress intended and to achieve the most effective use of resources. Such management includes (1) monitoring the disability status of all beneficiaries to help ensure program integrity and (2) helping as many beneficiaries as possible to become self-sufficient by determining their vocational rehabilitation (VR) service needs and providing them assistance to enter or reenter the workforce. The amounts in cash and medical benefits that beneficiaries can receive by age 65 average about $113,000 for SSI beneficiaries and about $225,000 for DI beneficiaries.", "Concerned about SSA\u2019s ability to conduct all the CDRs required by law, you asked us to provide information on how to improve the CDR process.

As agreed with your office, we are providing the same information to you and the Chairman, Subcommittee on Social Security, in separate reports. Both reports also include information about cases scheduled for CDRs under the SSI program. Specifically, we are providing information on (1) the number and characteristics of individuals who are due for CDRs, (2) how SSA selects individuals for and conducts CDRs, (3) whether available resources are adequate for conducting required CDRs, and (4) what potential options exist for improving the CDR process.

The DI program also pays benefits to disabled dependents of disabled, retired, or deceased workers\u2014disabled adult children and disabled widows and widowers. SSI provides assistance to disabled people who have a limited or no work history and whose income and resources are below specified amounts.State disability determination service (DDS) agencies, which are funded by SSA, decide whether individuals applying for DI or SSI benefits are disabled.", "Federal laws specify those who must receive CDRs. The 1980 amendments to the Social Security Act require that SSA review at least every 3 years the status of DI beneficiaries whose disabilities are not permanent to determine their continuing eligibility for benefits. The law does not specify the frequency of the required reviews for beneficiaries with permanent disabilities. The Social Security Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994 requires that SSA conduct CDRs on one-third of the SSI beneficiaries who reach age 18 and a minimum of 100,000 additional SSI beneficiaries annually in fiscal years 1996 through 1998. The 1996 amendments to the Social Security Act require that SSA conduct CDRs (1) at least every 3 years for children under age 18 who are likely to improve or, at the option of the Commissioner, who are unlikely to improve and (2) on low-birth-weight babies within their first year of life. The 1996 legislation also requires disability eligibility redeterminations, instead of CDRs, for all 18-year-olds beginning on their 18th birthdays, using adult criteria for disability.", "State DDS agencies set the frequency of CDRs for each beneficiary according to his or her outlook for medical improvement, which is determined on the basis of impairment and age.

Moreover, the agency has conducted relatively few elective SSI CDRs. (See tables III.1 and III.2 for numbers of previous CDRs conducted and CDR funding.) In 1996, the Congress authorized about $3 billion for CDRs for fiscal years 1996 through 2002.

On average, workers receiving DI and adult SSI beneficiaries have been receiving benefits for over 9 years and their predominant disability is mental disorders. While both are middle-aged, the average SSI adult beneficiary is about 9 years younger than the average DI worker beneficiary.

Beginning in 1993, questionnaires\u2014called mailer CDRs\u2014replaced full medical CDRs for some beneficiaries to increase the cost-effectiveness of the CDR process.", "SSA also developed statistical formulas for estimating the likelihood of medical improvement and subsequent benefit termination based on computerized beneficiary information such as age, impairment, length of time on the disability rolls, and date of last CDR. For beneficiaries for whom application of the formulas indicates a relatively low likelihood of benefit termination, SSA uses a mailer CDR; when the formula application indicates a relatively high likelihood of benefit termination, SSA uses a full medical CDR. For those who receive mailer CDRs, SSA takes an additional step to determine whether responses to a mailer CDR, when combined with data used in the formulas, indicate that medical improvement may have occurred; in this small number of cases, the beneficiary is also given a full medical CDR. Individuals who have responded to a mailer CDR and are found to be still disabled are not referred for full medical CDRs, and SSA sets a future CDR date. Currently, SSA estimates that the average cost of a full medical CDR is about $1,000, while the average cost of a mailer CDR is between about $25 and $50.

Approximately one-half of the DI and SSI beneficiaries currently due for CDRs are included in SSA\u2019s process for estimating the likelihood of benefit termination through the use of statistical formulas; these estimates are the basis of selection for CDRs. Adult beneficiaries that SSA includes in its selection process are DI worker and SSI beneficiaries under age 59 who have been classified as MIEs or MIPs. SSA currently excludes MINE beneficiaries, beneficiaries aged 59 and older, and disabled adult children and disabled widows and widowers of DI worker beneficiaries from its estimation process because it considers these categories not cost-effective to review. While SSA considers some SSI child beneficiaries cost-effective to review, children are currently selected for CDRs without the use of formulas to estimate the likelihood of benefit termination. (See fig. 1 and table III.4.)", "The development and use of formulas reflect SSA\u2019s effort to make the CDR process more cost-effective by using the estimates to identify beneficiaries who should receive a mailer CDR and those who should receive a full medical CDR. However, SSA acknowledges that the formulas are not useful for estimating the likelihood of benefit termination for most beneficiaries in this process. The formulas are primarily useful for identifying beneficiaries who SSA estimates are most or least likely to have their benefits terminated from a CDR. For individuals who fall in the middle category\u2014which constitutes the majority of beneficiaries included in the estimation process\u2014the formulas provide less accurate estimates, according to SSA. At this time, SSA does not select for CDRs any beneficiaries from this middle group because it is unable to determine whether a mailer or a full medical CDR is most appropriate for these beneficiaries. According to SSA, if it conducted mailer CDRs on the middle group, this would likely result in more beneficiaries being subsequently referred for full medical CDRs than the agency can accommodate in its budget. Similarly, if it conducted full medical CDRs on the middle group, it would be using a higher-cost process than SSA believes is necessary for some in this group. (See fig. 2 and table III.5.) Consequently, SSA selects a portion of the beneficiaries with the highest and lowest estimated likelihood of benefit termination for full medical and mailer CDRs, respectively.", "SSA has not developed statistical formulas to use in selecting SSI child and 18-year-old beneficiaries for CDRs. According to SSA, it selected low-birth-weight babies for CDRs of children for fiscal year 1996 because historically about 40 percent of this category have benefits terminated as a result of a CDR. Selecting low-birth-weight babies for CDRs is also consistent with CDR requirements that take effect in fiscal year 1997.", "For 18-year-old SSI beneficiaries in fiscal year 1996, SSA selected a judgmental sample classified as either MIE or MIP who had characteristics associated with a high likelihood of benefit termination.

Beginning in fiscal year 1997, according to SSA, formulas will be used for those beneficiaries who are classified as MINEs because they are older rather than because of their impairment. SSA also plans to develop formulas to use for children receiving SSI beginning in about fiscal year 1998. According to SSA, postponing the development of formulas for SSI child beneficiaries will allow the agency to integrate this process improvement with the knowledge it will gain about impairments that afflict children as a result of the new requirement to conduct CDRs for children in the SSI program beginning in fiscal year 1997.", "SSA also plans to pursue two approaches for the collection of medical treatment information about beneficiaries. First, SSA plans to obtain Medicare and Medicaid data and integrate the data into the statistical formulas to increase the validity of the estimated likelihood of benefit termination. SSA expects that the additional information will allow it to better determine the appropriateness of either mailer or full medical CDR for beneficiaries with estimates of benefit termination in the middle range. Second, SSA plans to develop a new type of CDR that would be conducted by mail to obtain current information about a beneficiary\u2019s disability and treatment. Unlike the current mailer CDR, the new type of CDR would collect information directly from beneficiaries\u2019 physicians and other medical treating sources.

If the plan is fully implemented, SSA will conduct the CDRs for DI worker beneficiaries under age 59, the beneficiary category the plan defines as constituting the DI backlog. In addition, it will conduct about 350,000 SSI CDRs required under the Social Security Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994 and about 2 million additional elective SSI CDRs.

SSA officials acknowledge that CDRs are required for these beneficiaries, but SSA has excluded them from the plan because it focuses on those categories SSA considers more cost-effective to review. In addition, an SSA official said that a large number of beneficiaries in the excluded categories are expected to leave the program because either they will die or convert to retirement benefits before SSA can conduct their CDRs. However, SSA has not estimated the proportion of excluded categories who may leave the program, nor does it include in its plan beneficiaries in these categories who will come due for CDRs in fiscal years 1997 through 2002.", "Process improvements are critical to SSA\u2019s ability to implement the portion of the plan that relies on the mailer CDR, a component whose use is planned to triple in fiscal year 1998. SSA\u2019s success with the mailer CDR will rely on yet-to-be-tried improvements. Although plans to expand the formulas to more beneficiary categories and collect medical treatment information appear promising, some improvements are in the earliest stages of development with only about 1 year available for completion. Thus, SSA will need to develop these initiatives more quickly than it did previous improvements. The integration of Medicare and Medicaid data into the formulas used to estimate the likelihood of benefit termination, and the development of a new type of CDR that collects information from physicians and other medical treating sources, are expected to allow SSA to begin conducting CDRs on beneficiaries with an estimated benefit termination in the middle range. SSA said that it currently is unable to determine whether the beneficiaries with estimates in the middle range should have a full medical CDR or a mailer CDR. Without that ability, SSA cannot determine the most cost-effective type of CDR to use, and its planned expansion of the use of the mailer CDR will be in jeopardy.", "SSA faces a variety of other challenges to the implementation of its plan and the elimination of the backlog of required CDRs:", "First, SSA must incorporate into its workload SSI CDRs and disability eligibility redeterminations required by the 1996 amendments to the Social Security Act. These requirements include performing CDRs once every 3 years for children under 18 years old who are likely to medically improve and for all low-birth-weight babies by their first birthday. This law also requires SSA to conduct disability eligibility redeterminations on all child beneficiaries who turn 18 years old, within 1 year of their birthday, and for between 300,000 and 400,000 children who qualified for SSI under individualized functional assessments (IFA). These reviews of children would take precedence over required CDRs and may shift resources away from other CDRs. The law also changes SSI eligibility for legal aliens who have not resided in this country for 5 years before receiving benefits, necessitating CDRs of the beneficiaries to determine continuing eligibility.", "Second, other recent legislation poses a competing priority. The law eliminates drug and alcohol abuse as a basis for receiving disability benefits; as a result, benefits will terminate for many of an estimated 196,000 DI and SSI beneficiaries whose primary impairments are drug abuse and/or alcoholism. SSA expects many of those terminated to reapply on the basis of other impairments, thus increasing SSA\u2019s workload of initial claims for benefits. Previous increases in initial claims adversely affected the number of CDRs conducted as resources were shifted away from that activity to process initial applications.", "Third, SSA\u2019s plan includes doing CDRs for many of the estimated 3.7 million SSI beneficiaries whose CDRs may be conducted at SSA\u2019s discretion. While conducting these discretionary SSI reviews may be warranted largely because relatively few SSI CDRs have been conducted in the past, it shifts resources away from conducting required DI reviews.", "Fourth, the daunting effort to gear up for the unprecedented CDR workload will include negotiations between SSA and 50 state DDS agencies to increase CDR workloads and DDS efforts to hire, train, and supervise additional staff."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Alternate Approaches Focus on CDRs\u2019 Cost-Effectiveness and Their Use in Helping Beneficiaries Move Off Disability", "paragraphs": ["In the Contract With America Advancement Act, the Congress emphasized maximizing the combined savings from CDRs under the DI and SSI programs.

Furthermore, the frequency of CDRs is currently based on medical improvement classifications that do not clearly differentiate between those most and least likely to have their benefits terminated as a result of a CDR. Our analysis found that the estimated likelihood of benefit termination, as determined by SSA\u2019s formulas, was very similar for beneficiaries classified as MIEs and MIPs. Although millions of dollars are spent annually to conduct periodic CDRs, some beneficiaries, especially those in the DI program, have received benefits for years without having any contact with SSA regarding their disability or their ability to return to work despite continuing disability. An alternate approach could build on SSA\u2019s efforts to identify those beneficiaries whose CDRs are likely to be cost-effective and also increase contact with beneficiaries who remain in the program. Such an approach involves requiring (1) CDRs of beneficiaries with the greatest potential for medical improvement, (2) CDRs of a random sample from all other beneficiaries, and (3) regular contact with the remainder of the beneficiaries to increase program integrity.", "Less rigid requirements regarding the frequency of CDRs are necessary if reviews are to be conducted primarily on those beneficiaries whose cases are cost-effective to review\u2014that is, those beneficiaries with the greatest potential for medical improvement\u2014and for SSA to still be in compliance with laws governing CDRs. According to SSA, one of the best indicators of whether beneficiaries will remain on disability rolls is whether they have previously undergone a CDR. If an initial CDR finds that the beneficiary continues to be medically eligible for disability benefits, subsequent CDRs may not be cost-effective or appropriate. Because few CDRs actually result in benefit terminations, periodic reviews, even at the maximum 3- and 7-year intervals currently used, may not be appropriate for certain beneficiaries if further reviews are not warranted after the initial CDR and at least several years on the disability rolls.", "Conducting CDRs on a random sample of beneficiaries from among those whose cases are believed by SSA to be less cost-effective to review is consistent with a more cost-effective and flexible approach to scheduling CDRs. It also addresses a weakness in SSA\u2019s current process by ensuring overall program integrity. SSA\u2019s current process excludes some categories of beneficiaries from portions of the selection process. As a result, about one-half of all beneficiaries due for a CDR will go without oversight unless SSA changes its selection process. If periodic CDRs are not conducted for all beneficiaries, it is increasingly important to develop a strategy to ensure overall program integrity.", "Contact with beneficiaries, in addition to the contact that occurs in the CDR process, can improve program integrity by reminding beneficiaries that their medical conditions are being monitored and serving as a deterrent to abuse by those no longer medically eligible for benefits. It could also support SSA\u2019s process improvement efforts, particularly within the next year. We believe that a new type of brief mailed contact would, at a minimum, in the year it is implemented, allow SSA to contact a majority of beneficiaries with overdue CDRs to remind them of their responsibility to report medical improvements and to inquire about their interest in returning to work. By collecting CDR-related information as part of this new contact, it could also speed the development of SSA\u2019s planned improvements to the CDR process. For example, SSA could gather information on physicians and other treating sources seen by beneficiaries since their last CDR. Such information is needed to implement SSA\u2019s new medical treating source CDR.", "SSA has not evaluated this three-pronged proposal for improving the CDR process, but in our discussions with agency officials, some provided comments on one aspect of it. In discussing additional, more frequent contact with beneficiaries in addition to that which occurs during a CDR, several officials raised the issue of the cost of such an initiative. Although some administrative funds would be used for this contact, it should result in significant savings because a considerable number of beneficiaries, on the basis of SSA\u2019s experience, can be expected to refuse repeatedly to provide requested information and, as a result, will have their benefits terminated after a prescribed due-process procedure is followed.According to SSA, those who fail to cooperate generally do so because they believe that they are no longer eligible for benefits. On the basis of SSA\u2019s experience with CDRs and financial eligibility redeterminations, we assumed that .71 percent of the DI beneficiaries and 1 percent of the SSI beneficiaries who were contacted would have their benefits terminated for noncooperation after all due-process procedures were followed. These termination rates represent an estimated one-time net federal savings of over $1.4 billion from contacting beneficiaries in the CDR backlog, with DI savings accounting for about $1.2 billion and SSI savings accounting for about $230 million. If extended to all beneficiaries not receiving CDRs or financial eligibility redeterminations, the costs and subsequent savings from such a contact would likely be higher.

Time limits are intended to encourage beneficiaries to obtain treatment and pursue rehabilitation to overcome their disabling conditions and obtain productive employment. Proposals for time-limited benefits generally establish criteria for deciding which categories of beneficiaries would be subject to time limits and no longer subject to required CDRs. Some believe that such broad application of time limits could significantly reduce the number of people who would continue on the rolls indefinitely and eliminate the CDR backlog. However, others believe that it could create a large backlog of disability claims when those who are terminated because of the time limit reapply for benefits. Time limits are also thought to increase the number of people on the rolls because SSA and DDS staff may, in certain cases, be more likely to award benefits because of the limited payment period. Instead of subjecting all beneficiaries with nonpermanent impairments to time limits, some believe that time limits should be applied to certain subsets or categories of beneficiaries\u2014those with impairments that are likely to improve with treatment or surgery. Such impairments include affective disorders, tuberculosis, certain fractures, and orthopedic impairments for which surgery can restore or improve function.", "However, our analysis of the characteristics of those in the CDR backlog suggests that implementing time-limited benefits on the basis of either medical improvement classifications or specific impairments is not currently feasible. As explained earlier, on the basis of our analysis of available CDR population characteristics, there is little correlation between the MIE and MIP classifications and the estimated likelihood of benefit termination.

SSA generally does little during the CDR process to determine beneficiaries\u2019 VR needs and provide assistance to help beneficiaries become self-sufficient.

A more cost-effective approach might incorporate (1) a focus on conducting CDRs for beneficiaries with the greatest likelihood of benefit termination due to medical improvement, (2) conducting CDRs on a random sample of all other beneficiaries to correct a weakness in SSA\u2019s process, and (3) contact with beneficiaries not selected for a CDR or a financial eligibility redetermination to strengthen program integrity.", "However, for this cost-effective approach to work, SSA needs to be able to accurately estimate the likelihood of benefit termination for all beneficiaries. Currently, our analysis shows that about one-half of all beneficiaries due or overdue for a CDR have been excluded from SSA\u2019s process that utilizes formulas to estimate the likelihood of benefit termination.

A full medical CDR generally follows an eight-step evaluation process (see fig. II.1).", "Figure II.1: Eight-Step Evaluation Process for a Full Medical CDR Step 1 Is beneficiary engaged in  substantial gainful activity?", "Step 2 Does impairment meet or equal severity as defined in medical listing?", "Step 3 Has medical improvement (MI) occurred?", "Step 5  Does an exception to MI apply?", "Step 4 Is MI related to ability to work?", "Step 6 Is impairment severe?", "Step 7 Is beneficiary able to  perform work done in past?", "Step 8 Based on SSA guidelines, is beneficiary  able to  perform other work?", "Determination Beneficiary remains disabled  and benefits continue.", "Determination Beneficiary is no longer disabled  and benefits terminate.", "If an exception to MI applies in which the initial determination was fraudulently obtained or the beneficiary does not cooperate with SSA, benefits are terminated.", "At step one, the SSA field office determines whether the beneficiary is engaged in SGA. Field office staff contact the beneficiary, often through a face-to-face meeting, and obtain information on the person\u2019s condition, medical treating sources, and the effect of the impairment on the beneficiary\u2019s ability to perform SGA. This information describes any changes that have occurred since the initial application or most recent CDR and includes types of treatment received, medicines received, specialized tests or examinations, vocational rehabilitation services received, and any schools or training classes attended since the last medical determination. The SSA field office also obtains information on any work activities since the person became disabled, whether the condition continues to interfere with the ability to work, and whether the beneficiary has been released for work by the treating physician. Benefits are terminated for beneficiaries engaged in SGA, regardless of medical condition. A beneficiary found to be not working or working but earning less than SGA has his or her case forwarded to the state DDS office.", "At step two, the DDS compares the beneficiary\u2019s condition with the Listing of Impairments developed by SSA. The listings contain over 150 categories of medical conditions that, according to SSA, are severe enough ordinarily to prevent a person from engaging in SGA. The DDS obtains medical evidence from the sources who treated the beneficiary during the 12 months prior to the CDR. If the medical evidence provided is insufficient for a disability decision, the DDS will arrange for a consultative examination by an independent doctor. A beneficiary whose impairment is cited in the listings or whose impairment is at least as severe as those impairments in the listings, and who is not engaged in SGA, is found to be still disabled.", "At step three, a beneficiary whose impairment is not cited in the listings or whose impairment is less severe than those cited in the listings is evaluated further to determine whether there has been medical improvement (MI). MI is defined as any decrease in medical severity of the impairment(s) present at the time of the most recent medical determination. In deciding whether MI has occurred, the DDS considers changes in symptoms, signs, and/or laboratory findings and determines whether these changes reflect decreased medical severity of the impairment(s). If MI has not occurred, the DDS skips step four and proceeds to step five to consider whether any exceptions to MI apply.", "At step four, for beneficiaries for whom MI has occurred, the DDS determines whether MI is related to the ability to work. MI relates to the ability to work when there is an increase in a person\u2019s residual functional capacity (RFC) to do basic work activities compared with the person\u2019s RFC at the last medical determination.

If MI relates to the ability to work, the DDS goes to step six.", "At step five, the DDS determines whether exceptions to MI apply. Exceptions provide a way for SSA to find a beneficiary no longer disabled in certain limited situations even though there is no decrease in the severity of the impairment. There are two exceptions to MI. The first exception applies to certain situations in which the person can engage in SGA\u2014for example,when substantial evidence shows that advances in medical or vocational therapy or technology have favorably affected the severity of a beneficiary\u2019s impairment or RFC to do basic work activities. The second exception can apply without regard to the person\u2019s ability to engage in SGA\u2014for example, in situations in which the prior determination was fraudulently obtained or in which the beneficiary fails to cooperate with SSA in providing information or in having an examination.

When SSA considers legislative changes that would make the CDR process more cost-effective, we believe that it must reassess the requirements of the existing schedule for conducting CDRs. According to SSA officials, if an initial CDR finds that a beneficiary is still disabled, subsequent CDRs are likely to result in the same conclusion. We question whether additional CDRs for that beneficiary are appropriate or cost-effective. Similarly, predictive formulas for DI worker beneficiaries allow SSA to determine those workers most likely to medically improve. Other groups not now included in the selection process may yield additional groups that are cost-effective to review. 2. While we recognize that the use of the formulas established the cases that fall into the \u201cmiddle group,\u201d SSA officials told us that SSA does not know which type of CDR\u2014full medical or mailer\u2014is more appropriate for those beneficiaries. SSA has at least two efforts under way to improve its ability to determine which type of CDR would be the more cost-effective. 3. We agree that SSA is currently testing the feasibility of expanding the use of formulas to the MINEs, and the report states that such an effort is under way. 4. While cost-effectiveness is an important aspect of the CDR process, we also believe that to ensure program integrity, all beneficiaries should have some likelihood of selection for a CDR. Such a program weakness is particularly troubling given that SSA has been unable to conduct all required CDRs for almost a decade and it estimates that the backlog will not be eliminated for another 7 years. 5. Our recommendation provides a comprehensive approach to program management that focuses on cost-effectiveness, program integrity, and increased contact with beneficiaries. Increased beneficiary contact is valuable to remind beneficiaries that their disability status is being monitored and that they are responsible for reporting medical improvement. We believe that such a contact also offers an additional opportunity for SSA to further its program improvement efforts. For example, it could be used to identify medical treating sources that should receive the medical treating source mailer currently under development. 6. We believe that ongoing periodic contact with beneficiaries is essential to a well managed program and should be done even if such an activity is considered a program operating cost. However, in estimating the costs of increased contact with beneficiaries, we considered a number of factors, including administrative and other costs. Because SSA could not provide us with estimates for these costs, we used the cost of the CDR mailer process to approximate the costs. The cost of the mailer reflects a more expensive manual process; thus we believe that it overstates the true cost of a scannable mail contact. In addition, because of the significant cost savings likely to result from the termination of benefits for individuals who do not respond\u2014a net federal savings of over $1.4 billion\u2014we believe that there is sufficient latitude to cover the cost of such an initiative. 7. Given the challenges that SSA faces, we continue to believe that its ability to eliminate the backlog of all required CDRs is uncertain. It may be possible for SSA to conduct the number of CDRs in its plan. However, the plan excludes about 848,000 required CDRs that are currently due or overdue. In addition, it does not include new CDRs and disability eligibility redeterminations required by the 1996 amendments to the Social Security Act, which take precedence over other required CDRs. Additional challenges are cited in our report. 8. We are pleased that SSA agrees with our recommendation to integrate return-to-work initiatives and the CDR process and that SSA has efforts under way to elicit the assistance of federal and private sector partners in the development of a return-to-work strategy. In our report, we acknowledge that field office employees play a limited role in providing information on VR opportunities to beneficiaries when they apply, but we also note that these staff take VR-related actions during a full medical CDR, and that state VR agencies have a role in limiting candidates for rehabilitation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, the following persons made important contributions to this report: Susan E.
