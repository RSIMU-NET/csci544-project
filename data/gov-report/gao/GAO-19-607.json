A UN report cited an increase in documented cases of sexual  violence, linking it to two factors: (1) nonstate armed groups\u2019 use of  sexual violence to enforce control over illicit exploitation of natural  resources, such as gold, and (2) FARDC military operations responding  to the activities of these nonstate armed groups. In addition to these  recent developments, UN officials we interviewed cited longstanding  difficulties such as a significant shortage of response services in the  DRC; common instances of retaliation against survivors who reported  abuse; and, as mentioned above, a climate in which perpetrators act with  impunity.", "The UN Commission of Inquiry on Burundi did not identify any steps  taken by the government of Burundi to address the country\u2019s human  rights issues, including sexual violence, in 2017 or 2018. The  Commission of Inquiry\u2014which, according to State, was denied access to  the country by the government of Burundi but conducted interviews with  more than 400 witnesses living in exile\u2014reported that serious human  rights violations, including acts of sexual violence, persisted in 2017 and  2018. For example, the commission reported that the National  Intelligence Service, police, and the youth wing of the ruling political party  used sexual violence to target supporters of the political opposition or  their relatives. The commission also recommended that the government  of Burundi establish investigative bodies to look into human rights  violations and take measures to ensure that victims of sexual violence  have access to appropriate care, including sexual health services and  psychological support."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the SEC, State, and USAID for  comment.

We downloaded 1,117 Form SD filings and any associated conflict  minerals reports included in EDGAR. Companies filed these Forms SD,  along with related conflict minerals reports in some instances, to provide  information in response to the SEC disclosure rule. To review the  completeness and accuracy of the EDGAR database, we reviewed  relevant documentation, interviewed knowledgeable SEC officials, and  reviewed our prior reports on internal controls related to the SEC\u2019s  financial systems. We determined that the EDGAR database was  sufficiently reliable for identifying the universe of Form SD filings.", "We reviewed the conflict minerals section of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall  Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and the  requirements of the SEC disclosure rule to develop a data collection  instrument that guided our analysis of a generalizable sample of Forms  SD and conflict minerals reports. Our data collection instrument was not a  compliance review of the Forms SD and conflict minerals reports. The  questions were written in both yes\u2013no and multiple-choice formats. An  analyst reviewed the Forms SD and conflict minerals reports and  recorded responses to the data collection instrument for all of the  companies in the sample. A second analyst also reviewed the Forms SD  and conflict minerals reports and verified the responses recorded by the  first analyst. Analysts met to discuss and resolve any discrepancies.", "We randomly sampled 100 Forms SD from a population of 1,117 to  create estimates generalizable to the population of all companies that  filed. We selected this sample size to achieve a margin of error of no  more than plus or minus 10 percentage points or less at the 95-percent  confidence level, which applies to all our estimates except where noted.  Because we followed a probability procedure based on random  selections, our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we  might have drawn. Since each sample could have generated different  estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular  sample\u2019s results as a 95-percent confidence interval. This is the interval  that would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the  samples we could have drawn. After using the data collection instrument  to analyze the sample of filings submitted in 2018, we compared the  resulting estimates with our estimates regarding filings submitted in prior  years to determine whether there had been any statistically significant  changes. We also attended an industry conference on conflict minerals  and spoke with company representatives and industry representatives to  gain additional context and perspectives.", "To address our second objective, we identified and assessed any  information on sexual violence in eastern DRC and the three adjoining  countries\u2014Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda\u2014that had been published or  otherwise had become available in 2018 and early 2019 and therefore  would not have been included in our most recent report on the topic. We  discussed the collection of sexual violence\u2013related data in the DRC and  adjoining countries, including population-based survey data and case-file  data, with Department of State and U.S. Agency for International  Development officials and with representatives of nongovernmental  organizations and researchers. We also interviewed officials from the  United Nations (UN) Children\u2019s Fund, the UN Special Representative of  the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, and the UN  Statistics Division, and we obtained information from the UN Population  Fund and UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic  Republic of the Congo. In addition, we searched research databases,  including MEDLINE and Scopus, to identify new academic articles  containing any additional information on sexual violence published in  2018 and early 2019. Through these searches, we identified an initial list  of 164 articles, which we then narrowed down to a priority list of studies  by considering a variety of factors pertaining to the studies\u2019 relevance to  our second objective. These factors included (1) whether the study  included rates, particularly related to the nation-wide rate of sexual  violence in the DRC and region-wide rate in eastern DRC; (2) whether the  study included case-file information; (3) whether the study contained data  from 2011 or later; (4) whether the study focused on a subset of a  broader population; (5) the geographic scope of the study; and (6)  whether the study included original research.
