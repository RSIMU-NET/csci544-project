In response to a congressional request, GAO (1) assessed IRS's implementation plans for the laws; (2) determined the extent to which IRS issued timely regulations and guidance and did outreach; (3) examined how IRS will use the new data to improve compliance; and (4) analyzed IRS's plans to assess implementation and measure performance and outcomes.

IRDM plans show several elements of effective program management, but do not document coordination with some related IRS projects such as Workforce of Tomorrow. IRS estimated IRDM costs, but MITS's estimate does not reflect some best practices, such as adjusting for inflation. Also, IRDM did not use substantiated tax form volume projections in some budget and risk decisions. To date, IRS spent about $28 million on IRDM and requested another approximately $82 million. IRS outreach with industry stakeholders was thorough early in the rulemaking process, but IRS missed its target dates for issuing regulations by about 1 year due, according to IRS officials, to time needed to learn the complex industries. After IRS released final regulations, industry stakeholders sought clarification of certain issues. IRS did not release additional written guidance until after the regulations' effective dates, which industry stakeholders said may affect their implementation of the new reporting requirements. Although IRS released drafts of the newly required or revised forms, they did not release draft instructions prior to the regulations' effective dates. To use the new data, IRS is developing systems that are expected to improve IRS's existing matching of information returns to individual tax returns and expand matching to business taxpayers. The initial enhancements are to be operational in 2012. IRDM appropriately plans to conduct research and test data quality. IRDM regularly documents lessons learned; however, IRDM has not assigned responsibility or established procedures to use them. IRDM also developed preliminary performance measures to assess the implementation and outcomes, including effects on revenue and compliance. However, IRDM has not documented a plan to finalize the performance measures, such as methodology."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that IRS improve cost estimation, form volume projections, stakeholder communication, and performance management.

To  increase the information available to IRS for compliance purposes\u2014and  therefore increase the potential for raising revenue\u2014Congress passed  several acts in recent years requiring new third-party information  reporting.  Establishing an effective matching program is important not  only for revenue collection, but also because the biggest benefit of  information reporting is the increase in voluntary compliance that is  expected to occur because taxpayers have the information they need to  accurately report income and they realize that IRS has access to those  data.  One provision of one of the new laws requires brokers to report the  adjusted cost basis for certain securities and identify whether a gain or  loss is short- or long-term (referred to in this report as \u201ccost basis  reporting\u201d).

For example, a gift card for a shopping mall is a payment  card because it is accepted as payment at a network of unrelated stores;  however, a gift card for a specific store is not a payment card because it is  only accepted by the store that issued it. A third-party payment network  accepts various forms of payment from a customer to settle transactions  with merchants who are unrelated to the network.

The PSE submits a request through the card  network, such as Visa or Mastercard, to the bank or other entity that  issued the card (issuer). The issuer checks the customer\u2019s account to  determine if the customer is able to cover the cost of the transaction.

Third-party payment  networks have widely varying business models, and can encompass many  different types of payment situations that are not easily generalized,  according to IRS officials and industry representatives. Typically, a  customer pays the third-party settlement organization for a transaction  with an agreed upon form of payment, which may include a payment card,  and the third-party settlement organization settles the transaction with the  merchant. One example of a third-party network is certain toll collection  networks. Some states that operate toll roads contract with a third-party  settlement organization to bill customers for road usage. The third-party  settlement organization provides a system that allows the toll facility to  record the passage of a vehicle with a transmitter inside.

This software is also expected to aid in the  development of a new IT system to select business taxpayer cases for  review.  In response to the delays, IRS officials said they have re- prioritized work and, as of May 2011, officials said they do not expect the  delays to affect the program\u2019s progress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRDM Did Not Document Coordination with Related IRS Projects", "paragraphs": ["The IRDM Strategic Roadmap is the foundational plan for IRDM that  describes the program\u2019s scope, desired outcome, implementation phases,  and time line.

Total costs for IRDM since the program\u2019s inception are shown in table 1.", "According to best practices established by the GAO Cost Estimating and  Assessment Guide, a cost estimate should be comprehensive, well  documented, accurate, and credible. However, MITS\u2019s IRDM cost  estimate does not fully meet these four best practices (for a description of  the best practices and the extent to which MITS met each characteristic,  see app. III).  For example,    The estimate substantially meets the best practices for a  comprehensive cost estimate. The estimate covers most life-cycle  costs, is supported by a document that defines the work needed to  accomplish the program\u2019s objectives and relates cost and schedule to  deliverables, and provides technical descriptions for each project  phase. However, although it defines assumptions and estimating  standards, also referred to as ground rules, the cost estimate does not  cite a rationale for the assumptions and only considers the impact of  risks on a portion of the estimate.", "The estimate partially meets best practices for a well documented cost  estimate. It provides technical descriptions for each project phase and  documents a management briefing, but it does not contain many details  about the underlying data used to develop the estimate. MITS used a  computer model to calculate the cost estimate, but the formulas built  into this model and the resulting calculations are not shown.  Thus, it  would not be possible for another cost analyst outside IRS to use  available documentation to recreate the estimate without access to this  computer model. Moreover, although IRS provided documentation of  its general cost estimation methodology, the methodology used to  develop this cost estimate was not provided at a meaningful level of  detail.", "The estimate partially meets best practices for an accurate cost  estimate. The model used to calculate the estimate was developed  using data from other comparable projects, which provides insight into  actual costs on similar programs. However, inflation was not  included. According to IRS officials, inflation is not applied to cost  estimates because it is factored in automatically during the budget  process. If inflation were included in the cost estimate, it would  be  double-counted in the budget. Applying inflation is an important s creating a cost estimate and it is a best practice for inflation to be  included and documented when creating cost estimates. Cost data  must be expressed in like terms, which requires the transformation of  historical or actual cost data into constant dollars. Additionally, the  cost estimate does not explain variances between planned and actual  costs because the estimate was developed before the program started;  there were no actual IRDM cost data available. A comparison between  the original estimate and actual costs would allow estimators to see  how well they are estimating and how the program is changing over  time.  In 2008, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration  (TIGTA) recommended that IRS provide similar information.", "The estimate minimally meets best practices for a credible cost  estimate. It contains a risk analysis, but it only addresses risks on a  small portion of the overall costs and how the risk analysis was done is  not clearly documented. IRS performed a cross-check on the estimate  by using an alternative estimation method to see if it produced similar  results.  Specifically, IRS did one cross-check by comparing the  estimate to an expected ratio of operations costs and nonrecurring  costs. However, there was no evidence that other cross-checks were  performed. Further cross-checks using different calculation methods  could enhance the estimate\u2019s reliability if they showed that different  methods produce similar results. In addition, the cost estimate does not  contain a sensitivity analysis, which would examine the effects of  changing assumptions and estimating procedures and therefore  highlight elements that are cost sensitive. IRS officials said they  typically do not perform a sensitivity analysis unless the program has  reached its preliminary design phase, which was not the case when  they estimated IRDM costs.  Furthermore, although the IRS group that  did the cost estimate was independent from the IRDM program office,  IRS did not obtain an independent cost estimate conducted by an  outside group to validate it. According to officials, due to limited  resources, IRS generally only does an additional independent cost  estimate for its largest programs and does not do an additional  estimate for a cost estimate done at the start of a program. Therefore,  because IRDM is not a large program, according to officials, and  because its cost estimate was done before the program started, an  additional independent cost estimate was not done. Although we  recognize that it would be challenging for IRS to do an independent  cost estimate for each project because IRS lacks the resource to do so,  it is a best practice to do an independent cost estimate because it  would provide an unbiased test of whether the original cost estimate is  reasonable.", "IRS officials said that, because their cost estimation procedures became  more robust after this cost estimate was prepared in 2008, a revised cost  estimate would follow best practices to a greater extent. Officials also said  that they could more accurately estimate costs now that they know more  about the IRDM program, and that they are considering revising the  estimate but may not do so due to limited resources.

After the final regulations were issued, the cost basis and  transaction settlement industries had, respectively, 2 \u00bd months and 4 \u00bd  months before data collection was to begin.", "According to IRPAC and representatives from both industries, the timing  of final regulations left the industries with a short implementation time.  Three cost basis groups said that while the legislation was under  development, they requested from congressional staff 18 months to  implement any information systems or other changes needed to comply  with final regulations; third-party payment networks said they requested a  year.  A senior IRDM official said companies could have started systems  development before regulations were final.  Although some cost basis and  transaction settlement industry members used proposed regulations to  guide their initial implementation, IRPAC representatives said companies  had to make some assumptions about what would be in the final  regulations, which increases costs.", "The short implementation time may affect the quality of data sent to IRS.   One cost basis industry group told us that small firms may not be ready to  comply with the regulations and, as a result, taxpayers and IRS may  receive inaccurate data on the Form 1099-B from those firms.  Although  cost basis industry representatives believe it is too soon to tell which data  quality issues will be most pressing, they pointed out that there may be  significant inconsistencies in gifted and inherited securities because  calculation methods are unclear and systems were not fully prepared for  implementation.  If these securities are transferred to other brokers, data  quality issues may follow, resulting in long-term consequences for  securities gifted or inherited in 2011, but sold in later years. A transaction  settlement industry group identified several issues as potential data quality  challenges, including that the industry does not identify merchants based  on Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TIN).  According to third-party  payment network representatives, it is too soon to tell how data may be  affected by the short implementation time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional IRS Communication on Rulemaking, Guidance, and Outreach May Improve Industry Implementation", "paragraphs": ["After IRS\u2019s issuance of final regulations, industry stakeholders sought  clarification of certain issues.

Regarding outreach, IRDM  officials told us that IRDM planned to begin outreach once final  regulations were issued so that messages would be based on stable  information.  Continuous engagement of external stakeholders is  important to ensure compliance with new tax legislation.", "Because IRS did not release clarifying guidance or continue outreach until  after the effective dates of the laws, industry groups experienced a gap in  communication from IRS which, according to industry representatives,  could affect implementation.  Four industry groups told us after the final  regulations were issued that they were awaiting additional information,  including clarification on certain reporting responsibilities, which could  affect their implementation of the laws. For example, one cost basis group  pointed out that taxpayer confusion associated with reporting wash sales  may cause a large volume of corrected Forms 1099-B during the year  following implementation.", "IRS released a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document for cost basis  reporting on its Web site in March 2011.  For transaction settlement  reporting, as of May 4, 2011, IRS had not released additional written  guidance since issuing the final regulations. IRS counsel said some  transaction settlement companies and cost basis entities have contacted  them about technical details of implementation, such as filling out forms,  and that IRS has spoken with them. Additionally, outreach events that will  cover both laws, such as speaking at events for tax professionals, began in  February 2011 and, as of April 2011, are scheduled through November  2011. IRPAC and two industry groups we spoke with said they are not  always aware of IRS's plans for issuing guidance or beginning additional  outreach.", "The transaction settlement industry\u2019s implementation also could be  affected by the gap in guidance and outreach after the regulations were  issued. For example, the definition in the regulations for \u201cthird-party  payment network\u201d is broad, according to representatives of several third- party payment network companies. The definition could lead some  companies to question whether they will need to file a Form 1099-K,  according to the companies. IRS counsel acknowledged that the  applicability of the definition depends on a company\u2019s specific business  model and said the regulations could not address all possible examples of  third-party payment networks. IRS counsel said they plan to post FAQs on  their Web page and to do letter rulings on request. Third-party payment  network representatives we contacted told us they were unaware of IRS's  plans.", "In addition to IRS counsel\u2019s communication with reporting entities, IRDM  established a team and a plan for stakeholder outreach. IRDM hired an  employee shortly after the laws\u2019 effective dates to lead the communication  team, and IRDM participated in its first external outreach event at the end  of February 2011. Earlier action by the IRDM outreach team might have  helped to bridge the communication gaps between IRS and the cost basis  and transaction settlement industries. Earlier outreach might have also  helped IRS raise awareness among companies, such as certain third-party  payment networks, who may not be aware that they will be required to  report. The IRDM Stakeholder Management and Communication Plan  provides a potentially useful framework to analyze stakeholders\u2019 concerns  and to prescribe appropriate IRDM responses. For example, the plan  describes a methodology for analyzing the potential effect of IRDM  regulations on stakeholder groups, and the degree of influence of each  stakeholder.  The IRDM team is to analyze stakeholder concerns and  ideas, summarize trends, and develop strategies for specific groups.  The  plans also emphasize the need to gauge the effectiveness of IRDM  communications.  This framework, if followed, could be a useful tool to  help identify and assess stakeholder needs.", "IRS already has a Web page on cost basis, transaction settlement, and  other new information reporting requirements. The page contains copies  of the information returns and regulations for both laws, cost basis FAQs,  and, for transaction settlement stakeholders, instructions for using IRS\u2019s  TIN Matching Program. The page does not contain prospective  information about upcoming guidance or outreach or, for other  information reporting laws, upcoming rulemaking actions.  The  Department of Transportation has a Web page that contains information  about the status of significant rulemakings, including scheduled  milestones, actual dates that milestones were met, and explanations for  any delays.  The page is a public version of more detailed internal tracking  of rulemaking milestones and assessing schedules, which helps  department officials determine if a rule is on or behind schedule, based on  target dates.  A representative from a cost basis industry group referred  us to a similar Web page run by the Financial Industry Regulatory  Authority, which also contains outreach information on securities  regulations.", "Additional Web-based information from IRS, such as information about  upcoming events or IRS\u2019s approach to letter rulings, could benefit industry  stakeholders. IRS could use the Transportation or Financial Industry  Regulatory Authority pages as a guide for enhancing its Web-based  information on regulations and guidance, and could also include outreach  information. Such information could be especially helpful for the cost  basis industry as IRS begins a new rulemaking for additional securities  that will be required to collect cost basis information beginning in 2013.  Representatives from the cost basis and transaction settlement industries  said such a Web page, if kept up to date, would aid in their implementation  of the laws.", "Officials at IRS told us their ability to provide projected issuance dates for  regulations is limited by the uncertainties in Treasury\u2019s review process.   An official in Treasury\u2019s Office of Tax Policy agreed that their review  process, which could result in significant revisions, makes it challenging to  post projected release dates that are useful and accurate.  According to the  official Treasury does not have an internal system for tracking rulemaking.

IRS solicited comments on the forms during the rulemakings process  and continued communication afterwards with industry groups as new  drafts were created.  IRS has since posted final instructions for both  forms, and officials told us they are taking comments on the instructions  through August 2011.", "IRPAC representatives said they were unable to adequately comment on  the draft forms without seeing definitions and other explanations typically  included in instructions, and cost basis and transaction settlement  industry stakeholders also emphasized the need for instructions to help in  their implementation of the laws. Not having instructions available when  draft forms were issued left industry stakeholders with some key  unanswered questions, whose outcomes may affect their system  development efforts and ultimately data reported to taxpayers and IRS.  For example, some transaction settlement representatives asked IRS why  the Form 1099-K requests the gross amount of \u201cpayments\u201d rather than the  gross amount of \u201creportable payment transactions\u201d as required in the  regulations. For the transaction settlement industry, there is a difference  between a payment and a transaction that could affect the dollar amount  reported. Specifically, the transaction amount of a purchase will almost  always be greater than the payment actually received by a merchant, due  to fees charged by the PSE, card issuers, or other entities facilitating the  transaction. The draft instructions explained what was meant by the term  \u201cpayments.\u201d If transaction settlement groups had viewed the draft  instructions with the draft forms, their concerns may have been addressed  earlier and they could have proceeded with greater confidence in  designing their data collection processes.", "IRS officials acknowledged that some comments made on the forms could  have been avoided if the instructions were available.

A notable planned AUR improvement is the  development of technology to match data from the Form 1099-K to  business tax returns.  The existing IRS nonfiler programs work individual  taxpayer and business nonfiler cases. IRS recently implemented a project  to modernize its business nonfiler compliance program and IRDM is  developing plans to use and work with that project, according to a senior  IRDM official.  In particular, IRDM is assessing the feasibility of  establishing a business version of the program IRS uses to estimate taxes  owed, known as the Automated Substitute for Return program, and submit  a return on behalf of individual nonfilers.

For example, IRDM is planning to update  rules\u2014criteria for selecting cases\u2014based on prior case results and other  data. These rules are important for IRS to target the cases with potential  tax assessments.  With the existing system, rules are difficult to update.  Because this will be the first time IRS includes businesses in the document  matching program, IRS must establish rules for businesses.  IRDM is  conducting research to establish an initial rule set for tax year 2011,  according to a senior IRDM official.  As IRS gains information on business  cases, the rules are to be refined.  Eventually, according to the senior  official, they would like to use industry data on the usage of payment  cards to profile and segment business tax returns for appropriate  treatment.", "IRS also plans to develop new technology to help manage individual and  business cases and, eventually, to contact business taxpayers  automatically through notices.  Additionally, IRDM is intended to enable  monthly updates and storage of 10 years worth of information return data,  thereby modernizing the existing reliance on files that cannot be updated  frequently. IRS expects to accomplish this by using the Integrated  Production Model (IPM) database to house the data that feed the matching  processes. IPM is designed to serve as a central repository for  compliance data.  It includes taxpayer data from databases known as  Master Files, which contain taxpayer and business account information.

IRDM plans also suggest that if funding is not received for fiscal year 2011,  staff from the individual program may be diverted from their current work  to help work in the business matching organization.  IRDM considers the  risk of not receiving 2011 funding to have a low probability of occurring  and, if it does occur, IRDM predicts a moderate impact on schedule.

Our guide,  which is based on extensive research of best practices for estimating  program schedules and costs, indicates that a high-quality, valid, and  reliable cost estimate should be well documented, comprehensive,  accurate, and credible. We analyzed the cost estimating practices used by  MITS against these best practices to determine whether the IRDM cost  estimate is comprehensive, accurate, well-documented, and credible. We  then characterized the extent to which each of these four characteristics  of reliable cost estimates were met; that is, we rated each characteristic as  being either: Met, Substantially Met, Partially Met, Minimally Met, or Not  Met. To do so, we scored each of the individual key practices associated  with cost and scheduling best practices on a scale of 1-5 (Does n 1, Minimally Meets = 2, Partially Meets = 3, Substantially Meets = 4, and  Meets = 5), and then averaged the individual practice scores associated  with a given best prac cost guide, the criteria against which we evaluated the program\u2019s cost    We  estimates, as well as our preliminary findings with program officials. then discussed our preliminary assessment results with IRDM officials an cost estimators.
