Although the PART has enhanced the focus on performance, the PART remains a labor-intensive process at OMB and agencies. Most PART recommendations are focused on improving outcome measures and data collection, and are not designed to result in observable short-term performance improvements. Since these necessary first steps on the path to long-term program improvement do not usually lead to improved short-term results, there is limited evidence to date of the PART's influence on outcome-based program results. Moreover, as of February 2005--the date of the most recent available OMB data--the majority of follow-on actions have not yet been fully implemented. By design OMB has not prioritized them within or among agencies. Because OMB has chosen to assess nearly all federal programs, OMB and agency resources are diffused across multiple areas instead of concentrated on those areas of highest priority both within agencies and across the federal government. This strategy is likely to lengthen the time it will take to observe measurable change compared with a more strategic approach. OMB has used the PART as a framework for several crosscutting reviews, but these have not always included all relevant tools, such as tax expenditures, that contribute to related goals. Greater focus on selecting related programs and activities for concurrent review would improve their usefulness. OMB has taken some steps to clarify the PART-GPRA relationship but many agencies still struggle to balance the differing needs of the budget and planning processes and their various stakeholders. Unresolved tensions between GPRA and the PART can result in conflicting ideas about what to measure and how to measure it. Finally, we remain concerned that the focus of agencies' strategic planning continues to shift from long-term goal setting to short-term executive budget and planning needs. OMB uses a variety of methods to communicate PART results, but congressional committee staff we spoke with had concerns about the tool itself, how programs were defined, and the usefulness of goals and measures. Most said that the PART would more likely inform their deliberations if OMB consulted them early on regarding the selection and timing of programs; the methodology and evidence to be used; and how PART information can be communicated and presented to best meet their needs. It is also important that Congress take full advantage of the benefits arising from the executive reform agenda. While Congress has a number of opportunities to provide its perspective on specific performance issues and performance goals, opportunities also exist for Congress to enhance its institutional focus to enable a more systematic assessment of key programs and performance goals."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Given current trends and challenges facing the nation\u2014including the  federal government\u2019s long-term fiscal imbalance\u2014we must take advantage  of opportunities to enhance performance, ensure accountability, and  position the nation for the future. To this end, it is critical to reexamine the  relevance of federal programs and their fit with national priorities, while  maximizing program performance within current and expected resource  levels.", "In the 1990s, Congress and the executive branch laid out a statutory and  management framework that provides the foundation for strengthening  government performance and accountability, with the Government  Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) as its centerpiece. GPRA is  designed to inform congressional and executive decision making by  providing objective information on the relative effectiveness and efficiency  of federal programs and spending. A key purpose of the act is to create  closer and clearer links between the process of allocating scarce resources  and the expected results to be achieved with those resources\u2014also known  as performance budgeting. Performance budgeting holds promise for  reexamining existing federal government programs and aligning them with  current needs. It can increase the government\u2019s capacity to assess  competing claims for federal dollars and has the potential to enrich the  budget debate by arming decision makers with credible information on  both individual programs and the relationship between policies, programs,  and other tools designed to address related goals.", "This administration has made budget and performance integration one of  five governmentwide management priorities under its President\u2019s  Management Agenda (PMA). The Executive Branch Management  Scorecard, which employs a red-yellow-green stoplight grading system,  tracks how well departments and major agencies are executing the five  governmentwide management initiatives. A central element in this  initiative is the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Program  Assessment Rating Tool (PART), which OMB describes as a diagnostic tool  meant to provide a consistent approach to evaluating federal programs as  part of the executive budget formulation process.", "At your request, we reported in January 2004 on OMB and agency  experiences during the first year of PART implementation. Specifically, we  examined how the PART changed OMB\u2019s decision-making process in  developing the President\u2019s fiscal year 2004 budget request; the PART\u2019s  relationship to GPRA; and the PART\u2019s strengths and weaknesses as an  evaluation tool. Our findings and recommendations from the January 2004  report are detailed later in this report. In light of the challenges we  identified, you asked us to examine (1) OMB\u2019s and agencies\u2019 perspectives  on the effects the PART recommendations are having on agency operations  and program results, including issues encountered in responding to the  PART recommendations; (2) OMB's leadership in ensuring an integrated,  complementary relationship between the PART and GPRA, including  instances in which multiple programs or agencies are involved in meeting  goals and objectives; and (3) steps OMB has taken to involve Congress in  the PART process. To help us fulfill these objectives, we also followed up  on the issues and challenges we identified during our January 2004 review.  Lastly, we agreed to issue a separate report that explores (1) progress  agencies have made in responding to OMB\u2019s PART recommendations that  they obtain program evaluations, (2) what factors have facilitated or  impeded agency progress toward obtaining the program evaluations that  OMB recommended, and (3) whether the evaluations appear designed to  yield the desired information on program results.", "To address the first two objectives, we reviewed OMB materials on the  implementation, application, and revision of the PART for calendar years  2002 through 2004. We also interviewed OMB branch chiefs and OMB staff  on the Performance Evaluation Team whose role is to provide guidance to  budget examiners and help ensure consistent application of the PART  across OMB offices. To better understand OMB\u2019s experience with  crosscutting reviews, we interviewed OMB staff responsible for  coordinating the Community and Economic Development and Rural Water  crosscutting reviews conducted for the fiscal year 2006 President\u2019s budget  request. To obtain agency perspectives on the relationship between the  PART and GPRA and their interactions with OMB concerning that  relationship, we interviewed department and agency officials, including  senior managers, and program, planning, and budget staffs at (1) the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), (2) the Department of  Energy (DOE), (3) the Department of Labor (DOL), and (4) the Small  Business Administration (SBA). We also interviewed officials from these  departments and agencies concerning their perspectives and activities in  response to the PART recommendations and the effects of implementing  those recommendations on operations and results.", "We selected these three departments and one independent agency for a  number of reasons. Collectively, they offered examples of all seven of the  PART program types (e.g., block/formula grants, competitive grants, direct  federal, and research and development) for review. These examples  covered about a fifth of all the programs subject to the PART as of 2004 and  thus could provide a broad-based perspective on how the PART was  applied. Our selection of these four agencies was also influenced by our  intent to integrate this work with our related work examining progress in  addressing the PART program evaluation recommendations.  Approximately half of the evaluation recommendations in the 2002 PART  were encompassed in our four case selections.", "As part of our work on the second objective, we also performed various  analyses of the PART recommendations made in all 3 years to discern  possible changes or trends in recommendations over time and  relationships between the type of recommendations made, type of  program, overall rating, the total PART score, and answers to selected  PART questions. In addition, we also examined relevant OMB and agency  documents to help determine how recommendations are tracked and their  impact evaluated by OMB and the selected agencies.", "To address our third objective of examining the steps OMB has taken to  involve Congress in the PART process, we interviewed OMB and agency  officials and asked questions about the steps OMB and agencies have taken  to involve Congress in the PART process or in using the results of the PART.  To obtain documented instances of Congress\u2019s uses and views of the PART,  we interviewed House and Senate committee staff (minority and majority)  for the authorization and appropriations subcommittees with jurisdiction  over our selected agencies as well as OMB and officials from the four  selected agencies. Finally, we reviewed fiscal years 2005 and 2006 House  and Senate congressional hearing records and reports as well as  conference reports for mentions of the PART. In addition, where possible,  we corroborated testimonial evidence with documentary evidence of OMB  and agencies\u2019 strategies for involving the Congress as well as evidence of  collaboration and coordination, such as planning documents, briefing  materials, or other evidence of contact with Congress.", "While our summary analyses include all or almost all programs subject to  the PART for the years 2002 to 2004 or all or almost all programs within a  specified subset of programs (e.g., program type, specific year, specific  rating, etc.), the information obtained from OMB, congressional, and  agency officials as well as documentary materials from the selected  agencies is not generalizable to the PART process for all years or all  programs. The information obtained from various officials reflects their  views and experiences with the PART. However, the consistency and  frequency with which officials identified certain issues and concerns in our  prior review and in this one suggest that they are both significant and  continuing aspects of the PART\u2019s use as a budget and evaluation tool.", "We conducted our audit work from January 2005 through September 2005  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Detailed information on our scope and methodology appears in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Federal interest in performance information and its potential relationship  to budgeting practices has existed to varying degrees for over 50 years.  More recently, this interest culminated in the passage of GPRA and related  management reforms of the 1990s. GPRA mandates that federal agencies  develop performance information describing the relative effectiveness and  efficiency of federal programs as a means of improving the congressional  and executive decision-making processes. Among other statutory  obligations, GPRA requires federal agencies to publish strategic and annual  plans describing specific program activities with the intention of  establishing a more tangible link between performance information for  these programs and agency budget requests.", "The current administration has taken several steps to strengthen  performance-resource linkages for which GPRA laid the groundwork. The  budget and performance initiative of the PMA contains the criteria agencies  must meet in order to achieve \u201cgreen\u201d status on the initiative. The criteria  include elements relating to budgeting and strategic planning and also ties  those elements to individual performance. As we have previously reported,  creating a \u201cline of sight\u201d between individual performance and  organizational success is a leading practice used in public sector  organizations to become more results-oriented.", "Central to the budget and performance integration initiative of the PMA,  the PART is a means to strengthen the process for assessing the  effectiveness of programs by making that process more robust,  transparent, and systematic. The PART is a series of diagnostic questions  designed to provide a consistent approach to rating federal programs. (See  app. II for the PART questionnaire.) Drawing on available performance and  evaluation information, OMB staff use the questionnaire to rate the  strengths and weaknesses of federal programs with a particular focus on  individual program results. The PART asks, for example, whether a  program\u2019s long-term goals are specific, ambitious, and focused on  outcomes, and whether annual goals demonstrate progress toward  achieving long-term goals. It is designed to be evidence-based, drawing on a  wide array of information, including authorizing legislation; GPRA strategic  plans, annual performance plans, and reports; financial statements;  inspectors general and GAO reports; and independent program evaluations.  The PART questions are divided into four sections; each section is given a  specific weight in determining the final numerical rating for a program.  Table 1 shows an overview of the four PART sections and the weights OMB  assigned.", "In addition, each PART program is assessed according to one of seven  major approaches to delivering services. Table 2 provides an overview of  these program types and the number and percentage of programs covered  by each type in the 2002 through 2004 performance assessments.", "As of February 2005, the PART ratings have been published for 607  programs (according to OMB, this represents about 60 percent of the  federal budget). Each program received one of four overall ratings:  (1) \u201ceffective,\u201d (2) \u201cmoderately effective,\u201d (3) \u201cadequate,\u201d or  (4) \u201cineffective\u201d based on program design, strategic planning, management,  and results. A fifth rating, \u201cresults not demonstrated,\u201d was given\u2014 independent of a program\u2019s numerical score\u2014if OMB decided that a  program\u2019s performance information, performance measures, or both were  insufficient or inadequate. Table 3 shows the distribution of ratings for  2002-2004. During the next 2 years, the administration plans to assess all  remaining executive branch programs with limited exceptions.", "In our January 2004 report on the PART, you asked us to examine (1) how  the PART changed OMB\u2019s decision-making process in developing the  President\u2019s fiscal year 2004 budget request; (2) the PART\u2019s relationship to  the GPRA planning process and reporting requirements; and (3) the PART\u2019s  strengths and weaknesses as an evaluation tool, including how OMB  ensured that the PART was applied consistently. We found that the PART  helped structure OMB\u2019s use of performance information for its internal  program and budget analysis, made the use of this information more  transparent, and stimulated agency interest in budget and performance  integration. Our analysis confirmed that one of the PART\u2019s major impacts  was its ability to highlight OMB\u2019s recommended changes in program  management and design. We noted that while much of the PART\u2019s potential  value lies in the related program recommendations, realizing these benefits  would require sustained attention to implementation and oversight to  determine if desired results are achieved, and that OMB needs to remain  congnizant of this as it considers capacity and workload issues in the PART.", "We also recognized that while there are inherent challenges in assigning a  single rating to programs having multiple purposes and goals, OMB  devoted considerable effort to promoting consistent ratings but challenges  remain in addressing inconsistencies among OMB staff, such as  interpreting the PART guidance and defining acceptable measures. OMB  senior officials recently told us that inconsistencies in the PART process  could also be attributed to agency staff, given the shared agency-OMB  responsibilities in the PART process. Limited credible evidence on results  also constrained OMB\u2019s ability to rate program effectiveness, as evidenced  by the almost 50 percent of programs rated \u201cresults not demonstrated.\u201d", "We also found that the PART is not well integrated with GPRA\u2014the current  statutory framework for strategic planning and reporting. We said that by  using the PART process to review and sometimes replace GPRA goals and  measures, OMB substituted its judgment for a wide range of stakeholder  interests. The PART/GPRA tension was further highlighted by challenges in  defining a unit of analysis useful for both program-level budget analysis and  agency planning purposes. Although the PART can stimulate discussion on  program-specific measurement issues, it cannot substitute for GPRA\u2019s  focus on thematic goals and department- and governmentwide crosscutting  comparisons, and was not used to evaluate similar programs together to  facilitate trade-offs or make relative comparisons.", "Lastly, we said that while the PART clearly must serve the President\u2019s  interests, the many actors whose input is critical to decisions will not likely  use performance information unless they feel it is credible and reflects a  consensus on goals. Our work showed that it if OMB wanted to expand the  understanding and use of the PART beyond the executive branch, it would  be important for OMB to discuss in a timely fashion with Congress the  focus of the PART assessments and clarify the results and limitations of the  PART and the underlying performance information. On the other hand, we  noted that a more systematic congressional approach to providing its  perspective on performance issues and goals could facilitate OMB\u2019s  understanding of congressional priorities and thus increase the PART\u2019s  usefulness in budget deliberations.", "In light of these issues, we recommended that OMB address the capacity  demands of the PART, strengthen the PART guidance, address evaluation  information availability and scope issues, focus program selection on  crosscutting comparisons and critical operations, broaden the dialogue  with congressional stakeholders, and articulate and implement a  complementary relationship between the PART and GPRA. We also  suggested that Congress consider the need for a structured approach to  articulating its perspective and oversight agenda on performance goals and  priorities for key programs.", "OMB took several steps to implement many of our recommendations. For  example, OMB clarified its PART guidance on defining the PART programs,  using outcome and output measures, and expanded the discussion of  evaluation quality; began to use the PART as a framework for crosscutting  assessments; and expanded its discussion about the relationship between  the PART and GPRA. The guidance notes that the PART strengthens and  reinforces performance measurement under GPRA by encouraging the  careful development of performance measures according to GPRA\u2019s  outcome-oriented standards. It also requires that PART goals be  \u201cappropriately ambitious\u201d and that GPRA and the PART performance  measures be consistent. They have also begun reporting on the status of  each program\u2019s recommendations and implemented PARTWeb, a Web- based data collection tool to, among other things, improve collaboration  between OMB and agencies and centrally track the implementation and  status of the PART recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The PART Encourages a Focus on Performance Measurement and Program Review", "paragraphs": ["The PART process has aided OMB\u2019s oversight of agencies, and has focused  agencies\u2019 efforts to improve performance measurement. According to  OMB, the PART is a framework for program assessment and informs its  budget decisions. Many agency officials told us that the PART helped either  create or strengthen a culture of evaluation within the agencies by  providing external motivation for program review. Not surprisingly, agency  officials used the PART results to make a case for increased resources in  general and for program evaluation specifically. This increased focus on  performance is often reflected in improved ratings when \u201cresults not  demonstrated\u201d programs get reassessed by the PART\u201486 percent of  programs previously rated \u201cresults not demonstrated\u201d were subsequently  rated adequate, moderately effective, or effective when reassessed. This  focus is not without cost, however; the PART remains a labor-intensive  process for both OMB and agencies.", "OMB senior officials describe the PART as providing a consistent  framework for assessing federal programs, and as a means to inform its  budget decisions. As a major component of the PMA, OMB clearly relies on  the PART\u2014a significant component of the PMA\u2014as a major oversight tool  and finds information from the PART reviews useful. As we previously  reported, the PART has helped to structure and discipline OMB\u2019s use of  performance information for internal program analysis and budget review,  and made their use of this information more transparent. Given the PART\u2019s  use in the budget process, the high profile of the PMA scorecard, and the  strong connection between the PART and successful performance on the  PMA\u2019s budget and performance integration initiative, agencies have clear  incentives to take the PART seriously.", "Many agency officials told us that the PART helped either create or  strengthen a culture of evaluation within the agencies by providing external  motivation for program review. The PART question that asks whether a  program has undergone regular, independent evaluations sends the  message that program assessment and evaluation is an important  management tool. For example, according to one agency official at the  Health Resources Services Administration in HHS, this requirement  encouraged staff to think more broadly about using different types of  program evaluations and how they could get the most out of their  evaluation dollars. Another HHS official reported that the PART provided  an impetus for finishing strategic and evaluation plans for his program,  which in turn helped inform the division\u2019s planning process. Our  companion report on the PART evaluation recommendations reports  similar findings, noting that most program officials interviewed for that  report said that the PART recommendations directed senior management\u2019s  attention to the need for evaluation.", "Not surprisingly, agency officials used the PART results in some cases  successfully\u2014to argue for increased resources in general as well as  specifically for program evaluation. For example, officials in one agency  said that a good rating on the PART is a powerful aid in gaining bipartisan  support for budget increases. DOL agency officials told us that absent the  PART, they might not have received funding to evaluate the Youth Activities  program\u2014a program they felt had been in need of an evaluation for a long  time.", "Agency officials we spoke with credited the PART with increasing attention  to the use of performance measurement in day-to-day program  management, which they considered to be of greater consequence than the  PART\u2019s bottom-line ratings and recommendations. For example, agency  officials at DOL credited the first year\u2019s PART assessments with  encouraging managers to take steps prior to assessments to identify and  address program weaknesses, develop and improve performance  measures, and train staff on the PART. Officials from DOL\u2019s Trade  Assistance program said that the PART forced them to look at the program  in a new light, and be objective about what they are doing and how they are  doing it. SBA officials said that the PART and the PMA helped them move  away from \u201canalysis by anecdote\u201d and refocused their attention on the  impact their programs have on small businesses, instead of largely on  output measures such as the number of loans they have made. One official  at HHS said that the PART allowed him to \u201cevangelize\u201d on the importance  of good performance data and the perils of bad data. Other officials echoed  a similar sentiment, one of them indicating that the PART scores helped to  create \u201ca new sense of urgency\u201d about performance measures and  completing the changes to performance systems that were already  underway. The link between program ratings and the PMA scorecard also  provided an incentive for change.  \u201cResults not demonstrated\u201d ratings have implications beyond the PART.  For an agency to achieve \u201cgreen\u201d on the Performance and Budget  Integration initiative of the PMA scorecard, less than 10 percent of its  programs could have received a results not demonstrated PART rating for  more than 2 years in a row. According to OMB\u2019s PMA scorecard update as  of June 30, 2005, only nine agencies have met this particular criterion.", "This increased focus on performance is often reflected in improved ratings  when programs originally rated \u201cresults not demonstrated\u201d are reassessed.  When reassessed, 86 percent of programs previously rated \u201cresults not  demonstrated\u201d were rated adequate, moderately effective, or effective.  Because programs were only reassessed when OMB determined that  significant changes had been made to address deficiencies, this result is not  surprising. However, it was, on average, the \u201cresults not demonstrated\u201d  programs with initially higher section IV scores (section IV measures  program results) that, when reassessed, showed the greatest improvement  in rating. While there were programs with low section IV scores that  received an \u201cadequate\u201d rating when reassessed, lower scoring programs  generally remained in the \u201cresults not demonstrated\u201d category or received  an \u201cineffective\u201d rating when reassessed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "PART Remains a Labor- Intensive Process at OMB and Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Although the PART has enhanced the focus on performance, this has not  come without a cost.

During this review we found that while the learning curve did appear to  flatten, it did not seem to compensate for either the increased workload  due to the sheer number of programs being assessed or reassessed each  year or the amount of time an individual assessment takes. This finding is  consistent with views expressed by OMB staff during our 2004 review. They  told us that they were surprised that reassessments took almost as long as  assessing programs for the first time. OMB limited the scope of  reassessments to include only those programs where there is significant  evidence of change. Programs that received a \u201cresults not demonstrated\u201d  rating received priority for reassessment. According to OMB officials, this  change was made partly due to resource constraints.", "Officials in some of our case study agencies expressed concern that OMB\u2019s  growing workload affects how the PART programs are defined. They said  that as more programs are assessed OMB has less time to focus on the  PART units that \u201cmake sense\u201d and instead is creating larger PART units to  help control the number of the PART assessments that need to be  completed. One official recognized that getting into too much detail can be  time consuming, but nonetheless noted that reviewing a larger \u201cprogram\u201d  can lead to missing some important details; another said it can lead to  recommendations that are not specific enough to be useful to a program.", "One agency official said that the PART assessments can be thoughtful when  OMB is knowledgeable about a program and has enough time to complete  the reviews, but the assessments are less useful when OMB staff are  unfamiliar with programs or have too many of the PART assessments to  complete. Officials across all of our case study agencies reported these  types of issues. For example, one official said that although the PART  reviews were to be completed by the cognizant OMB examiner for the  program, this was not always the case. He said that due to turnover at  OMB, programs in his department were assessed by several people even  within a single PART cycle, resulting in a lack of continuity. In several  cases, agencies reported that OMB was not able to reassess programs  because of resource constraints. Some officials told us that the heavy  workload meant that the PARTs were not completed in a timely enough  fashion to allow agencies to appeal ratings or present new performance  measures, sometimes resulting in lower PART scores. OMB officials noted  that OMB policy permits agencies to appeal answers to individual  questions, not entire ratings, and that in practice, ratings may be appealed  at any time during the PART process whether the ratings are in draft form  or completed.", "Although a senior OMB official acknowledged continuing capacity issues  regarding the PART, he said that the PART is still a better way for  examiners to accomplish their traditional program assessment  responsibilities because it is more objective and transparent. He noted that  OMB is devoting more people to help administer the PART tool and that  PARTWeb, OMB\u2019s new on-line Web-based data collection system for PART,  is also designed to ease the management of the process. For example, the  official said that PARTWeb will automate the production of PART summary  sheets.", "The PART is a resource-intensive process for agencies as well. Some  agency officials at DOL noted that the PART process is \u201cone size fits all\u201d in  that a small program at DOL is supposed to have the same resources to  devote to helping the budget examiner through the process and have the  same analytic and evaluation resources as a large organization like the  Social Security Administration.

For example, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  Plant and Animal Health Monitoring Programs within the Department of  Agriculture received three recommendations, one of which would create  efficiency measures and the other which would update the program\u2019s  measures and accomplishments. Such measures improve managers\u2019 ability  to assess program outcomes, identify information gaps, and assess next  steps, but are not expected to result in observable program improvement in  the short term. OMB claims that many programs are getting better every  year\u2014which it defines as improving program outcomes, taking steps to  address the PART findings, improving program management, and becoming  more efficient\u2014but, as noted above, these claims have not yet been fully  born out.", "Some recommendations are aimed at changing a program\u2019s purpose or  design and/or implicitly or explicitly require action by Congress. For  example, the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Commodity Credit Corporation\u2019s  Marketing Loan Payments program received a recommendation to have the  \u201cHouse and Senate Agricultural committees examine the issue of payment  limits for marketing loan and LDP gains and how they could be tightened.\u201d  A Department of Education special education program was told to \u201cwork  with Congress on the IDEA reauthorization to increase the act\u2019s focus on  accountability and results, and reduce unnecessary regulatory and  administrative burdens.\u201d Even in cases where there is general agreement  that legislative action or statutory changes are needed, making them takes  time.", "OMB has said that if statutory provisions impede effectiveness, one result  of a PART review could be recommendations for legislative changes. The  responsibility to implement the PART recommendations lies with agency  and program managers. Successfully implementing recommendations that  require legislative action or statutory changes requires the additional step  of positively engaging Congress. A perceived disconnect between what one  is held accountable for and what one has the authority to accomplish is not  unusual. Our 2003 survey of governmentwide federal managers supports  this view. We found that while 57 percent of non-Senior Executive Service  (SES) managers and 61 percent of SES mangers believed they were held  accountable for results to a great or very great extent, only 38 percent and  40 percent, respectively, believed that managers at their level had the  decision-making authority they needed to achieve agency goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Lack of Prioritization of PART Recommendations Has Implications for Resource Allocation", "paragraphs": ["Although OMB has given agencies discretion to define strategies to  implement recommendations, OMB officials told us that, as a matter of  policy, they have generally not prioritized the recommendations within  each agency or across the more than 1,700 recommendations  governmentwide because they do not want to dilute attention paid to any of  the recommendations by deeming them a lower priority. Realistically,  though, agencies cannot act on all of them concurrently. Because OMB has  chosen to assess nearly all federal programs, resources are diffused across  multiple areas instead of concentrated on those areas of highest priority  both within agencies and across the federal government. This strategy is  likely to lengthen the time it will take to observe measurable change.", "Moreover, as we report in our companion report on the PART evaluation  recommendations, agency officials questioned the PART\u2019s assumption that  all programs should have evaluations. Agency officials in one of our case  study agencies said that they were able to fund some evaluations for small  programs without cutting into program budgets, but other agency officials  pointed out that spending several hundred thousand dollars for an  evaluation study was a reasonable investment for large programs; they  questioned whether all programs, regardless of size or importance, need to  be evaluated, especially in times of tight resources and suggested instead a  risk-based approach to prioritizing programs to be evaluated.

In  other words, although they complement each other, they serve different  needs. OMB senior officials acknowledged that combining programs could  theoretically make each component\u2019s successes and challenges less  apparent, but that in this case it is hard to argue that programs authorized  by different titles of the Public Health Services Act are unrelated to each  other.", "The goals and recommendations developed in a PART review, and hence  the overall quality of the review, may suffer when the unit of analysis is not  properly targeted. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention\u2019s (CDC) National Immunization Program (NIP) includes both  the 317 program\u2014which provides funding to support 64 state, local, and  territorial public health immunization programs for program operations  and vaccine purchase\u2014and the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program\u2014 which provides publicly purchased vaccines to participating providers  which are then given to eligible children without cost to the provider or the  parent. Only the 317 program has been assessed by the PART to date. In its  PART assessment of the 317 Program, OMB noted that the administration  was including a legislative proposal in the fiscal years 2004 and 2005 budget  requests to \u201cmake it easier for uninsured children who are eligible for the  CDC Vaccines for Children (VFC) program to receive immunizations in  public health clinics, to improve program efficiency in the overall  childhood immunization program.

Program officials were unable to convince OMB to remove the  VFC legislative proposal from the 317 program PART assessment summary  sheet. Similarly, when OMB proposed a goal related to the global  eradication of polio, HHS officials were unable to convince OMB that while  global eradication of polio is a goal of the NIP overall, it is not within the  scope of the individual 317 program, which is solely a domestic program.  Although one of the program\u2019s annual measures is still the \u201cnumber of polio  cases worldwide,\u201d OMB responded to the agency\u2019s concern in the most  recent PART summary sheet for the 317 program, noting that \u201cthe global  polio measure will be tracked by the global immunization program, which  will be assessed separately in the future, and not by the 317 program.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns about PART Measures Reflect Long-standing Tensions over Performance Measurement", "paragraphs": ["We have long recognized the difficulties of developing useful results- oriented performance measures for programs such as those geared toward  long-term health outcomes and research and development (R&D)  programs.

We noted that agencies were  exploring a number of strategies to address these issues, such as using  program evaluations to isolate program impact, developing intermediate  measures, employing a range of measures to assess progress, and working  with stakeholders to seek agreement on appropriate measures. OMB  recognizes several of these approaches as appropriate alternatives to  outcome measures for PART purposes but as described below, agencies  have had mixed success reaching agreement with OMB in these areas.  Although these types of measurement challenges are clearly not new or  unique to the PART, they are aggravated by the difficulties of developing  measures useful for multiple purposes and audiences and often remain a  point of friction in agencies and sometimes within OMB.", "For programs that can take years to observe program results, it can be  difficult to identify performance measures that will provide information on  the annual progress they are making toward achieving program results.  This can complicate efforts to arrive at goals useful to multiple parties for  multiple purposes. For example, CDC officials told us that long-term health  outcome measures favored by the PART are often not as useful to them as  data on preventative measures, which tell managers where more efforts are  needed and allows them to respond more quickly.", "Programs where the federal government is one among many actors present  similar challenges\u2014when an outcome is beyond the scope of any one  program, any changes made to a single federal program will not necessarily  have an immediate effect. For example, for the Diabetes program OMB  expressed interest in a long-term health outcome measure that tracks  changes in national blindness and amputation rates. Program officials said  that these types of changes generally cannot be attributed solely to the  Diabetes program because it serves a relatively small portion of the  population and works with many partners. The Breast and Cervical Cancer  program\u2014which screens low-income women and provides public  education, quality assurance, surveillance, partnerships, and evaluation  regarding breast cancer screening among low-income women\u2014has similar  concerns about OMB\u2019s interest in linking the program to changes in the  overall mortality rates of cancer patients.", "Agency experiences with the PART\u2019s emphasis on efficiency measures  presented a more varied picture. Some programs had success by defining  efficiency in terms of program administration rather than program  operations. For example, HHS\u2019s foster care officials said that because  children\u2019s safety could have been compromised by moving children too  quickly out of foster care, OMB agreed that an administrative efficiency  measure would be appropriate instead of the type of outcome-oriented  efficiency measure cited above. DOE officials told us that the Strategic  Petroleum Reserves program is well suited to the PART\u2019s view of  \u201cefficiency\u201d because it can show (1) how every dollar from its budget is  spent, (2) that it is spent efficiently, and (3) that the program results related  to spending those dollars.", "In other cases, differences of opinion about efficiency measures  highlighted the challenges that can result from the difficult but potentially  useful process of comparing the costs of programs related to similar goals.  For example, DOL agency officials told us that since Job Corps is a self- paced program, participants are permitted to remain in the program for up  to 2 years (or up to 3 years with special approval). They consider this to be  adequate time for students to complete their education and/or vocational  training, which, as studies indicate, generally results in higher wages. DOL  agency officials noted that since costs per participant increase the longer a  student remains in the program, Job Corps appears less \u201cefficient\u201d  compared with other job training programs, which reflects poorly in Job  Corps\u2019 PART assessment. They suggested cost per student day as a cost  measure with less inherent perverse incentive, but OMB did not accept the  suggestion.", "Similarly, DOL agency officials explained that whereas Job Corps\u2019 current  GPRA measures track the percentage of job/education placements for  program exiters who graduate, the common measures\u2014which OMB uses  to gauge performance across all job-training programs\u2014track entered  employment/education for all program exiters, regardless of their graduate  status at exit. Although there are significant differences in the time  frames, the placement criteria, and the pool of participants for these  measures, these officials told us that the measures are treated as  interchangeable in the PART review. In other words, the same benchmark  set for the \u201cgraduate placement\u201d GPRA indicator is also used for the  \u201cplacement of all participants\u201d common measure indicator. Consequently,  agency officials said, Job Corps is in the position of either (1) failing to  meet the common measure goal or (2) being labeled un-ambitious by OMB  if the goal is changed to be attainable yet\u2014in DOL\u2019s view\u2014still aggressive.  Either way, the agency officials said that their PART assessment is  negatively affected.", "Several R&D officials noted that prior to the PART, there had been a  collaborative effort to develop OMB\u2019s R&D investment criteria to better  assess the value of R&D programs. However, these managers believed that  the investment criteria\u2014which R&D program managers find useful to  manage their programs\u2014have been overshadowed by the PART\u2014which  OMB finds useful in its budget development process. Part of the trouble  seems to be that the PART explicitly requires all programs to have or be  developing an efficiency measure, while the investment criteria do not. The  investment criteria focus on improving the management of basic research  programs. One agency official noted that this is a management efficiency  question, not a cost question; therefore it should be captured in the PART\u2019s  management section instead of the results section. Such a change could  affect a program\u2019s PART score because the management section represents  20 percent of the total weighted score whereas the results section  represents 50 percent of the total weighted score.", "In the investment criteria published with the 2004 PART guidance, OMB  noted that it had worked to clarify the implementation of the investment  criteria, stating that the investment criteria are broad criteria for all R&D  programs while the PART is used to determine compliance with the  investment criteria at the program level. OMB also recognized that while  programs must demonstrate an ability to manage in a manner that  produces identifiable results, taking risks and working toward difficult-to- attain goals are important aspects of good research management,  especially for basic research. They further note that the intent of the  investment criteria is not to drive basic research programs to pursue less  risky research that has a greater chance of success, and that the  administration will focus on improving the management of basic research  programs.", "Disagreements over when and how to revise and communicate information  about federal programs further highlight tensions between OMB and  agencies.

However, several agency officials reported  problems with adjusting or retiring goals. For example, agency officials  told us that sometimes goals need to be retired or consolidated, and cited  instances in which they were not permitted to do so even after intense  negotiation with OMB.

An agency\u2019s communication with stakeholders, including Congress, about  goals and measures created or modified during the formulation of the  President\u2019s budget, is likely to be less than during the development of the  agency\u2019s own strategic or performance plan.", "Although OMB\u2019s PART guidance discusses the need to integrate the PART  and GPRA, we continue to find evidence that the closed nature of the  executive budget formulation process may not allow for the type of  stakeholder involvement in strategic and annual planning envisioned by  GPRA. Beginning with the fiscal year 2005 budget submission, OMB  required agencies to submit a performance budget, which is expected to  satisfy all statutory requirements of the GPRA annual performance plan. It  is generally expected to include the PART performance goals (including  annual and long-term performance measures with targets and time frames)  for programs that have been assessed by the PART. The PART guidance  recognizes stakeholder involvement in strategic planning as required by  GPRA by saying agencies must consult with Congress and solicit and  consider the views of interested and potentially affected parties.", "At the same time, the executive budget formulation process\u2014to which the  PART belongs\u2014is \u201cpredecisional.\u201d This means that information from the  annual budget process, including information required in agencies\u2019 annual  GPRA plans, is embargoed within the executive branch until the President\u2019s  budget request is transmitted to Congress. Agencies may therefore be  prevented from consulting with their stakeholders when developing annual  and long-term goals and measures. Some of our case study agencies  described similar experiences. Their interaction with key stakeholders was  limited. Sometimes they had to present new or revised program goals and  measures to their stakeholders after the fact, and in some cases  stakeholders disagreed with the goals, or had no choice but to accept them  after the fact.", "Discussions of how performance information is being used are important  because GPRA performance reports are intended to be one of Congress\u2019s  major accountability documents. As such, these reports are to help  Congress assess agencies\u2019 progress in meeting goals and determine  whether planned actions will be sufficient to achieve unmet goals, or,  alternatively, whether the goals should be modified. Because predecisional  performance information must be excluded from the reports, their  potential as a source of information to Congress is limited. However, this  embargo conflicts with OMB\u2019s own reporting requirements regarding the  issuance of agency Performance and Accountability Reports (PAR). OMB\u2019s  Circular A-11 guidance notes that the transmittal date for an agency's PAR  is November 15, and that because this precedes the transmittal of the  President's budget, an agency may need to omit certain \u201cprivileged\u201d  information from its PAR. As described in Circular A-11, this privileged  information includes specifically required elements of agency PARs,  including an evaluation of performance for the current fiscal year;  schedules for achieving established performance goals; and, if a  performance goal is impractical or infeasible, an explanation of why that is  the case and what action is recommended.

For the PART to result in  congressional action on the PART\u2019s funding and policy recommendations  as OMB desires, the PART must hold appeal beyond the executive branch.  The PART was designed for and is used in the executive branch budget  preparation and review process; as such, the goals and measures used in  the PART must meet OMB\u2019s needs. Because OMB has not developed an  effective strategy for connecting the PART process to congressional needs,  Congress generally does not use the PART in its deliberations. Without  developing an effective strategy for obtaining and acting on congressional  views on what to measure, how to measure it, and how to best present this  information to a congressional audience, it is more likely that PART will  remain an executive branch exercise largely ignored in the authorization,  appropriations, and oversight processes. Infusing a performance  perspective into budget decisions may only be achieved when we discover  ways to reflect both the broader planning perspective that can add value to  budget deliberations and foster accountability in ways that Congress  considers appropriate for meeting its roles, responsibilities, and interests.

We also interviewed OMB branch chiefs and OMB staff  on the Performance Evaluation Team (PET). The PET\u2019s role is to provide  guidance to budget examiners and help ensure consistent application of the  PART across OMB offices. To better understand OMB\u2019s experience with  crosscutting reviews, we interviewed OMB staff responsible for  coordinating the Community and Economic Development and Rural Water  crosscutting reviews conducted for the fiscal year 2006 President\u2019s budget  request. To obtain agency perspectives on the relationship between the  PART and the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA)  and their interactions with OMB concerning that relationship, we  interviewed department and agency officials, including senior managers,  and program, planning, and budget staffs at (1) the Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS), (2) the Department of Energy (DOE), (3) the  Department of Labor (DOL), and (4) the Small Business Administration  (SBA). We also interviewed officials from these departments and agencies  concerning their perspectives and activities in response to the PART  recommendations and the effects of implementing those recommendations  on operations and results.", "We selected these three departments and one independent agency for a  number of reasons. Collectively, they offered examples of all seven PART  program types (e.g., block/formula grants, competitive grants, direct  federal, and research and development) for review. These examples  covered about a fifth of all the programs subject to the PART as of 2004 and  thus could provide a broad-based perspective on how the PART was  applied. We also chose to return to HHS and DOE\u2014two of the departments  included in our previous study on the PART. To broaden our coverage of  agency perspectives we selected DOL and SBA because they had received a  \u201cgreen\u201d score on their President\u2019s Management Agenda Executive Branch  Management Scorecard for the budget and performance integration  initiative and were considered good candidates for showing progress. Our  selection of these four agencies was also influenced by our intent to  integrate this work with our related work examining progress in addressing  the PART program evaluation recommendations. Approximately half of the  evaluation recommendations in the 2002 PART were encompassed in our  four case selections.", "As part of our work on the second objective, we also performed various  analyses of the PART recommendations made in all 3 years to discern  possible changes or trends in recommendations over time and  relationships between the type of recommendations made, type of  program, overall rating, total PART score, and answers to selected PART  questions. To do these analyses, we classified the recommendations OMB  made into the same four categories we used in our prior report, i.e.,  program assessment, program design, program management, and funding.  We employed a slightly modified classification procedure from our  previous review, which included the addition of an \u201cother\u201d category for  recommendations that did not fit within any of the four categories. We  then combined the results of our recommendation classifications with  selected data we downloaded from PART summaries and worksheets  posted on OMB\u2019s PART Web sites, data developed for our previous report  of the 2002 PART, and a data set provided by OMB of programs covered in  the 2004 PART. In addition, we also examined relevant OMB and agency  documents to help determine how recommendations are tracked and their  impact evaluated by OMB and the selected agencies.", "To address our third objective of examining the steps OMB has taken to  involve Congress in the PART process, we interviewed OMB and agency  officials and asked questions about the steps OMB and agencies have taken  to involve Congress in the PART process or in using the results of the PART.  To obtain documented instances of Congress\u2019 uses and views of the PART,  we interviewed House and Senate committee staff (minority and majority)  for the authorizing and appropriations subcommittees with jurisdiction  over our selected agencies as well as OMB and officials from the four  selected agencies. Finally, we reviewed fiscal years 2005 and 2006 House  and Senate congressional hearing records and reports as well as  conference reports for mentions of the PART. In addition, where possible,  we corroborated testimonial evidence with documentary evidence of  OMB\u2019s and agencies\u2019 strategies for involving Congress as well as evidence  of collaboration and coordination, such as planning documents, briefing  material, or other evidence of contact with Congress.", "We did not independently verify the PART assessments as posted on OMB's  Web sites; however, we did take several steps to ensure that we reliably  downloaded and combined the various data files with our recommendation  classifications. Our steps included (1) having the computer programs we  used to create and process our consolidated dataset verified by a second  programmer; (2) performing various edit checks on the data and  (3) selecting computer-processed data elements checked back to source  files for a random sample of programs and also for specific programs  identified in our analyses or through edit checks. We determined that the  data were reliably downloaded and combined, and sufficient for the  purposes of this report.", "While our summary analyses include all or almost all programs subject to  the PART for the years 2002 to 2004 or all or almost all programs within a  specified subset of programs (e.g., program type, specific year, specific  rating), the information obtained from OMB, congressional and agency  officials, as well as documentary material from the selected agencies is not  generalizable to the PART process for all years or all programs.", "We conducted our audit work from January 2005 through August 2005 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
