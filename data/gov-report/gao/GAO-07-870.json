GAO was asked to determine whether Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has implemented appropriate controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information and systems used to support the US-VISIT program. To do this, GAO examined the controls over the systems operated by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) that support the US-VISIT program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The systems supporting the US-VISIT program have significant information security control weaknesses that place sensitive and personally identifiable information at increased risk of unauthorized and possibly undetected disclosure and modification, misuse, and destruction. Weaknesses existed in all control areas and computing device types reviewed. Deficiencies in access controls and other system controls exposed mainframe computer, network infrastructure, servers, and workstations to insider and external threats. For example, CBP did not implement controls to effectively prevent, limit, and detect access to computer networks, systems, and information. To illustrate, it did not (1) adequately identify and authenticate users in systems supporting US-VISIT; (2) sufficiently limit access to US-VISIT information and information systems; (3) ensure that controls adequately protected external and internal network boundaries; (4) effectively implement physical security at several locations; (5) consistently encrypt sensitive data traversing the communication network; and (6) provide adequate logging or user accountability for the mainframe, workstations, or servers. In addition, CBP did not always ensure that responsibilities for systems development and system production were sufficiently segregated and did not consistently maintain secure configurations on the application servers and workstations at a key data center and ports of entry. These weaknesses collectively increase the risk that unauthorized individuals could read, copy, delete, add, and modify sensitive information, including personally identifiable information, and disrupt the operations of the US-VISIT program. They make it possible for intruders, as well as government and contractor employees, to bypass or disable computer access controls and undertake a wide variety of inappropriate or malicious acts. These risks are not confined to US-VISIT information. The CBP mainframe and network resources that support US-VISIT also support other programs and systems. As a result, the vulnerabilities identified in this report could expose the information and information systems of the other programs to the same increased risks. A key reason for these weaknesses is that, although CBP has made important progress in implementing elements of the department's information security program, it did not effectively or fully implement essential program activities. For example, CBP did not fully characterize the risks facing critical systems, update interconnection security agreements in security plans, sufficiently test and evaluate security controls, incorporate required elements in remedial action plans, adequately implement incident detection and handling procedures, and consistently address privacy issues. Until DHS and CBP act to mitigate the weaknesses in CBP systems supporting the US-VISIT program and CBP effectively and fully implements its information security program, limited assurance exists that the US-VISIT program will achieve its goal of enhancing the security of U.S. citizens and its visitors."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the years since the 2001 terrorist attacks, the need to secure U.S.  borders has taken on added importance and has received increasing  attention from Congress and the public.

For  example, if controls for systems supporting US-VISIT were inadequately  implemented there is a risk that unauthorized individuals could (1) delete  or alter visitor records used or processed by US-VISIT and allow a drug  smuggler, terrorist, or convicted felon to illegally enter the United States  or (2) mount denial of service attacks and cripple computer processing at  U.S. air, land, and sea ports of entry as well as the networks and  infrastructure that support these ports of entry.", "As agreed, our objective was to determine whether the Department of  Homeland Security has implemented appropriate information security  controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the  information and systems used to support the US-VISIT program.

Among other things, Section  110 of the of IIRIRA directed the former Immigration and Naturalization  Service (INS) to develop an automated entry exit control system to collect  records of departure from every alien leaving the United States and match  it with the alien\u2019s record of arrival. In 2000, the Immigration and  Naturalization Service Data Management Improvement Act amended  section 110 of IIRIRA by replacing it in its entirety.

For  example, the USA PATRIOT Act mandates that this system be capable of  interfacing with other law enforcement agencies, and that it uses  biometric technology and tamper-resistant documents. In addition, the  Aviation and Transportation Security Act requires air carriers to  electronically transmit manifest information for all international flight  passengers and crew members to the Commissioner of Customs before  landing at a U.S. airport. Furthermore, the Enhanced Border Security and  Visa Entry Reform Act further requires the use of biometrics in travel  documents and expands the passenger arrival manifest requirements in  the Aviation and Transportation Security Act to sea carriers and to air and  sea departures.", "With the passage of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, 22 federal  agencies and organizations merged into the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS). Shortly after DHS assumed operational control, the  Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security renamed the entry exit  system US-VISIT. Most recently, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism  Prevention Act of 2004 calls for the Secretary of the Department of  Homeland Security to accelerate the full implementation of an automated  biometric entry and exit data system.

For example, if a \u201cmatch\u201d is received  from IDENT during primary inspection, the encounter data is stored as  part of the US-VISIT process, and the traveler would be sent to secondary  inspection for further action. During secondary inspection processing, the  officer can access US-VISIT systems such as IDENT\u2019s Secondary  Inspection Tool and ADIS to receive additional information, but the officer  will also separately log into other CBP systems or interconnections such  as NCIC, to retrieve the full case management information as part of the  CBP border management and enforcement process.", "Figure 1 is a simplified diagram of key computer systems and networks  that support the US-VISIT program.", "As shown in the diagram, air, land, and sea ports of entry are connected to  Customs and Border Protection local-area networks which are connected  to a wide-area network.
