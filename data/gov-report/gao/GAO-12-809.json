Specifically, DHS has demonstrated leadership commitment by establishing a governance board to serve as the decision-making body for DHS information-sharing issues. The board has enhanced collaboration among DHS components and identified a list of key information-sharing initiatives. The board has also developed and documented a process to prioritize some of the initiatives for additional oversight and support. However, because DHS has not revised its policies and guidance to include processes for identifying information-sharing gaps and the results; analyzing root causes of those gaps; and identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks of removing incomplete initiatives from its list, it does not have an institutional record that would help it replicate and sustain those information-sharing efforts. Overall, DHS\u0092s key information-sharing initiatives have progressed, and most have met interim milestones. However, progress has slowed for half of the 18 key initiatives, in part because of funding constraints. For example, 5 of DHS\u0092s top 8 priority information-sharing initiatives currently face funding shortfalls. The board has not been able to secure additional funds for these initiatives because they ultimately compete for funding within the budgets of individual components, but DHS officials noted that the board\u0092s involvement has kept some initiatives from experiencing funding cuts. DHS is also developing plans that will be important in managing its information-sharing efforts, such as a revised strategy for information sharing and a related implementation plan.", "DHS has taken steps to track its information-sharing efforts, but has not yet fully assessed how they have improved sharing. Specifically, DHS is tracking the implementation progress of key information-sharing initiatives, but the department does not maintain completion dates and does not fully assess the impact initiatives are having on sharing. Determining and documenting initiative completion dates and how initiatives affect sharing, where feasible, would help the board better track progress in implementing the initiatives and make any necessary course corrections if completion dates are delayed. Further, DHS has begun to assess the extent to which its technology programs, systems, and initiatives\u0097which include the key information-sharing initiatives\u0097have implemented critical information-sharing capabilities, such as secure user access authorization. However, DHS has not yet determined the specific capabilities each particular program must implement for DHS to conclude that it has improved information sharing enough to achieve its information-sharing vision for 2015. Establishing the level of capabilities programs must implement could help DHS prioritize programs, and track and assess progress toward its vision. In addition, DHS is in the process of implementing customer feedback measures on the usefulness of information provided and has taken steps to assess customers\u0092 information needs. DHS has not yet developed measures that determine the impact of its information-sharing efforts on homeland security, but plans to develop ways to assess information-sharing results toward achieving its 2015 vision.

According to DHS  officials, because of technological limitations in tracking the dissemination  of products, I&A does not know the number of recipients or readers of  each product, which prevents I&A from knowing the full impact of this  bias.", "For example, a bias is created by the requirement that a  I&A has taken a number of steps to obtain feedback in other ways and  help ensure it provides customers with the right information at the right  time. For example, according to I&A officials, I&A has initiated a core  customer study designed to establish a common definition of core  customers, allowing I&A to identify and directly survey representative  samples of customers from across each segment on their satisfaction  with I&A\u2019s intelligence support. However, the study is in the beginning  phases; thus I&A has not yet established a completion date and it is too  early to evaluate the results. In addition, I&A has established a Customer  Feedback Working Group to analyze feedback-related issues and devise  ways to improve products. For example, on the basis of feedback that I&A  products did not contain enough relevant local content, the group has  begun a project to improve the regional content in intelligence products,  according to I&A officials.

This, in turn,  can affect how relevant some of the customers find DHS and its  components\u2019 information to their mission. For example, fusion centers are  higher-priority customers than customers in the intelligence community,  such as the FBI, according to the I&A Strategic Plan. As a result, DHS  officials stated that the department focuses more of its funding and  initiatives on fusion centers. We interviewed senior officials from 10 state  and major urban area fusion centers, ICE, ODNI, and the FBI.

For example, officials at 1 fusion center reported that I&A products  keep officials up to date on national and global terrorism trends that  may have an impact on their region. In addition, officials at another  fusion center stated that reports, such as the Joint Intelligence  Briefing from DHS and the FBI on the 10th anniversary of 9/11, and  special assessments of security at sporting events, have helped the  fusion center provide guidance to state and local law enforcement.  Further, in response to an I&A report on radicalization of prison  inmates, 1 fusion center\u2019s detectives met with corrections department  staff to enhance their awareness of prison radicalization and held  trainings on suspicious activities and radicalization indicators.  Moreover, officials at this center noted that the timely dissemination of  reports has improved, that reports are more specific to regional needs  than in the past, and that I&A has responded to fusion center  feedback. However, officials at 2 other fusion centers we met with  stated that I&A information was not always timely. These officials  reported that sometimes, I&A information is already available through  media outlets or other information sources. According to one official,  although this practice can be considered a method to verify the recent  news media information, the volume of information tends to flood the  network and can lead to reduced attention being paid to I&A  products. In addition, officials at 2 fusion centers we met with reported  that I&A distributes too many reports that are not specific to their  region. Further, results from a 2012 Homeland Security Policy  Institute survey that asked fusion center staff to order their most  important sources of information suggest that DHS may have  opportunities to better meet customer needs.

Fifty-seven percent of the customers we  surveyed (155 of 275 who answered this question) indicated that they  were satisfied with the products they receive.", "ICE: ICE directors and analysts in the Homeland Security Intelligence  Office did not comment on the information contained in I&A reports,  but noted that they were generally dissatisfied with I&A reports  primarily because they found it difficult to determine which reports are  most relevant to their needs. For example, the officials stated that I&A  is not proactive in informing ICE about the products it completes and  would find useful. ICE officials stated that connectivity and access to  I&A products have improved since 2010, but the ease of finding these  products and understanding what is relevant to ICE remains  problematic.", "ODNI: ODNI officials stated that they were generally satisfied with the  department\u2019s responsiveness to information needs and that  collaboration with DHS has improved since 2010. For example, if  circumstances necessitate ODNI obtaining passenger manifest data,  DHS provides such information more quickly than in the past. In  addition, ODNI has successfully used DHS data to counter potential  terrorist threats. For example, by cross-checking refugee application  data from DHS with other data, ODNI has facilitated numerous arrests  and removed over 500 people who posed a potential threat from the  refugee stream prior to their arrival in the United States. However,  ODNI officials stated that some DHS intelligence reports are not  timely enough for their needs. Further, DHS\u2019s finished intelligence  products are generally not as valuable to the intelligence community  because they are generally written for state and local customers.", "FBI: Two FBI headquarters divisions responsible for sharing terrorism- related information reported on their satisfaction with information from  DHS. Specifically, officials from one of the two FBI divisions reported  that, overall, the division was neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with I&A  information, and officials from the other division reported their division  was somewhat satisfied. These same officials also reported that they  were very satisfied with the information received from CBP, ICE, and  TSA. For example, the FBI officials reported that its Counterterrorism  Division and ICE have enhanced the consistency with which  information is shared and have worked toward a transparent and  coordinated effort for developing, sharing, and distributing terrorism- related information. The FBI reported that DHS intelligence products  are generally not produced for the FBI\u2019s use specifically, and that the  FBI collaborates with DHS to develop reports on a variety of topics,  such as potential terrorist attacks.", "DHS also monitors the extent to which I&A finished intelligence products  address issues that state, local, and tribal customers deemed as most  critical to their needs, which could increase customer satisfaction with  products. Customers articulate their critical needs based on 10 threat- based categories, such as Terrorism and Illicit Drug Operations. I&A  tags its intelligence products and information reports with relevant  \u201cstanding information needs\u201d prior to distribution, which enables I&A to  monitor the extent to which I&A is distributing products and reports that  match customers\u2019 needs. The 2011 annual performance report shows  that I&A determined that 85 percent of finished intelligence products were  directly responsive to its state, local, and tribal customers\u2019 information  needs, which met the performance target for this measure. I&A data show  that the department reached similar conclusions during the first two  quarters of 2012.

Customer satisfaction is  based on three factors: quality of communication, the accuracy of the  information provided, and satisfaction with the process. Specifically,  customers request certain information from I&A\u2014such as background  information for a person of interest\u2014and I&A officials are to respond to  that request by an agreed-upon time frame. The 2011 annual performance report shows that I&A answered 85 percent of requests  within the time frame I&A and the customer agreed upon to the  customer\u2019s satisfaction. Since I&A is currently updating this measure to  include other DHS entities, 2012 is a baseline year that the department  plans to use to evaluate the extent to which timeliness and satisfaction of  information requests are improving over time.

DHS stated that  the department, through the board, has recently initiated an effort to draft  a DHS-wide Information Sharing and Safeguarding Implementation Plan.  The implementation plan is to ensure that DHS\u2019s sharing and  safeguarding activities align with the forthcoming Fiscal Year 2012\u20132017  DHS Information Sharing and Safeguarding Strategy. DHS stated that the  templates that the department will use to develop the implementation plan  will identify information-sharing and -safeguarding gaps and the  anticipated results. DHS also plans to update its Roadmap  Implementation Guide to provide the department with an institutional  record to better replicate, and therefore sustain, ongoing and future  implementation efforts to improve information-sharing and -safeguarding.  DHS also concurred with the second recommendation, to direct the  Information Sharing and Safeguarding Governance Board to document  and implement a process for analyzing the root causes of those gaps.  DHS stated that the templates that the department will use to develop the  implementation plan will identify the specific root causes of information- sharing and -safeguarding gaps for the initiatives contained in the  implementation plan. DHS also plans to update its Roadmap  Implementation Guide to document the processes by which it identifies  the root causes of the gaps. DHS stated that this effort will better ensure  that the department invests in the correct information-sharing solutions  and effectively reduces risks. DHS concurred with the third  recommendation, to direct the Information Sharing and Safeguarding  Governance Board to establish and document processes for identifying  and assessing risks of removing initiatives from the list, as well as  determining whether other initiatives or alternative solutions are needed  to mitigate any significant risks related to the relevant information-sharing  gap. DHS stated that it plans to establish and document such processes,  and also plans to update its Roadmap Implementation Guide to document  the processes by which it identifies and assesses risks. DHS stated that  preliminary planning to address this recommendation has begun.", "DHS concurred with the fourth recommendation, to direct the Information  Sharing and Safeguarding Governance Board to incorporate into the  board\u2019s existing tracking process milestones with time frames that  initiatives must achieve to be considered complete, where feasible, and  information to show the impact initiatives are having on information  sharing. DHS stated that the board will incorporate the recommended  changes into its tracking process, and that preliminary planning to  address this recommendation has begun. DHS also concurred with the  fifth recommendation, to direct the Information Sharing and Safeguarding  Governance Board and the Office of the CIO to include in the mechanism  the board is developing to track programs\u2019 achievement of key  capabilities the specific capabilities certain programs must implement in  order to achieve the department\u2019s 2015 information-sharing vision. DHS  stated that the board and the Office of the CIO will include the  recommended changes in the mechanism, and stated that preliminary  planning to address this recommendation has begun.", "If fully implemented, DHS\u2019s planned efforts will address the intent of the  five recommendations.", "DHS and the FBI also provided us with technical comments, which we  considered and incorporated in the report where appropriate.

To determine the extent to which DHS has made  progress in achieving its information-sharing mission, we analyzed  relevant strategic planning documents, such as DHS\u2019s January 2011  Integrated Strategy for High Risk Management, the DHS Information  Sharing Strategy, the 2007 National Strategy for Information Sharing, and  the Office of Intelligence & Analysis (I&A) Strategic Plan 2011-2018. In  addition, to determine the extent of DHS leadership\u2019s demonstrated  commitment to information sharing, we analyzed documents related to  DHS\u2019s governance structure for information sharing, including charters  that are current as of September 2012 and meeting minutes for relevant  governing bodies from January 2011 through April 2012.", "To determine the extent to which DHS has developed information-sharing  plans and identified key efforts, we analyzed documents related to DHS\u2019s  plans and initiatives for sharing, such as DHS\u2019s list of key information- sharing initiatives, and analyzed documents from one initiative\u2014the Law  Enforcement Information Sharing Initiative (LEISI)\u2014which is led by DHS\u2019s  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). We selected this  initiative as an example case study of DHS\u2019s actions related to  information-sharing initiatives because it is a priority initiative and an  established program. To determine the extent to which DHS\u2019s other key information-sharing initiatives have made progress, we analyzed DHS  documents tracking those initiatives. To determine the extent to which  DHS has the resources needed to achieve its information-sharing  mission, we analyzed documents related to DHS\u2019s budget, including the  DHS fiscal year 2013 Budget in Brief, and the funding status of key  information-sharing initiatives. To determine the extent to which DHS has  the technology needed for information sharing, we analyzed documents  related to DHS\u2019s technology framework for information sharing, such as  the Information Sharing Segment Architecture Transition Plan, among  other things.", "In addition, we interviewed program officials within DHS\u2019s I&A to obtain  information on the department\u2019s information-sharing mission, goals,  programs, activities, and funding; the Segment Architecture; efforts to  improve terrorism-related information sharing; and related challenges. We  interviewed ICE officials about LEISI\u2019s progress and their experiences  working with I&A on improving DHS\u2019s information sharing. To determine  the progress DHS has made on the technology framework for information  sharing and on the funding of information-sharing programs, we  interviewed officials from DHS\u2019s Office of the Chief Information Officer  (CIO). We assessed DHS\u2019s plans and efforts against Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government and criteria that we use in  assessing high-risk issues. We also reviewed DHS\u2019s efforts related to its  Segment Architecture against our prior report and federal guidance on  defining architecture content.", "To determine the extent to which DHS tracks and assesses information- sharing improvements, we analyzed relevant strategic planning  documents, such as the I&A Strategic Plan for fiscal years 2011-2018 and  the February 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR).  Furthermore, to determine how DHS tracks progress and results in its  information-sharing initiatives, we analyzed documentation and examples  of DHS\u2019s tracking mechanisms for its information-sharing efforts. We  analyzed documentation and data on DHS\u2019s performance measures for  fiscal years 2011 and 2012 to determine the extent to which DHS is  monitoring the effectiveness of information sharing. We also used these  DHS performance measurement data to determine if DHS could  demonstrate progress in information sharing by analyzing data for  customer feedback and customer information needs, among other areas.  To assess the reliability of the data obtained from DHS, we analyzed  performance measurement documentation and interviewed officials  knowledgeable about the controls over the integrity of the data. On the  basis of our assessments, we determined that the performance  measurement data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. In addition, we interviewed program officials within I&A and from  DHS\u2019s Office of the CIO on I&A\u2019s and DHS\u2019s progress in sharing  terrorism-related information, and on mechanisms they use to monitor  effectiveness.", "To supplement the steps we took to assess how DHS tracks and  assesses information-sharing improvements, we also obtained  information from various customers of DHS\u2019s information sharing on the  usefulness of I&A and other DHS components\u2019 products. Specifically, we  obtained information from 10 of 77 fusion center customers, 1 of 7 DHS  operational components who participate in the DHS Intelligence  Enterprise, and 2 of DHS\u2019s 16 intelligence community customers. We  interviewed or received written input from directors and other senior  officials from 10 fusion centers\u2014where states and major urban areas  collaborate with federal agencies to improve information sharing\u2014 including the President of the National Fusion Center Association. The  national network of fusion centers is the hub of much of the two-way  intelligence and information flow between the federal government and  state, local, tribal and territorial partners, making fusion centers key  customers of I&A\u2019s intelligence reports. Because we selected a  nonprobability sample of fusion centers to contact, the information we  obtained from these locations may not be generalized to all fusion centers  nationwide. However, because we selected these centers based on,  among other things, geographic dispersion and variation in risk based on  the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) 25 Cities Project, the information we  gathered from these locations provided us with an understanding of  similarities and differences in fusion centers\u2019 satisfaction with DHS\u2019s  information sharing across different centers. We interviewed ICE officials  from the Homeland Security Investigations and Intelligence office and  officials from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s (ODNI)  National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC). Further, we received written  input from two headquarters divisions of the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI) that are responsible for sharing terrorism-related  information. We selected ICE, ODNI, and the FBI because they are key  customers of DHS\u2019s intelligence products or partner with I&A to create  these products. ICE is a DHS component that shares terrorism-related  information and leads two of DHS\u2019s key information-sharing initiatives.  ODNI and the FBI are federal agencies that have key roles in analyzing  terrorism threats to the United States and jointly issue products with DHS.  The FBI also has the primary role in carrying out investigations within the  United States of threats to national security. The views of ICE, ODNI, and  the FBI are not generalizable to all of DHS\u2019s federal customers, but they  provided us with a general understanding of the perspectives about  DHS\u2019s information sharing held by different customer types nationwide.  To supplement these views, we reviewed our prior work on DHS  customer satisfaction and analyzed a report from a survey on information  sharing conducted by the George Washington University Homeland  Security Policy Institute and discussed the report with a representative  who conducted the survey. In January and February 2012, the institute  administered a 78 question self-completion survey to individuals working  in 72 state and major urban area fusion centers, and 71 individuals  voluntarily took the survey. On average, 48 to 49 individuals answered  each question. Our analysis included reviewing the methodology and  assumptions of the study, and discussing the study\u2019s scope and  conclusions with the George Washington University Homeland Security  Policy Institute. As a result of our review and analysis, we determined  that the study and its results were appropriate for use in our report. We  assessed DHS\u2019s mechanisms to track and assess information-sharing  improvements against criteria for practices in program management.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2011 through  September 2012 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, David A.
