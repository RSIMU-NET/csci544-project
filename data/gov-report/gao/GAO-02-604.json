Following this assessment, Congress, in the Water Resources Development Act of 1992, authorized the design and eventual construction of the Delaware River ship channel to accommodate the movement of larger vessels. The total estimated cost of the project is over $420 million. The federal share of the project cost\u2014approximately $287 million\u2014would be for constructing the deeper channel and the disposal sites for the dredged material, as well as maintaining the channel for 50 years at a depth of 45 feet. The Delaware River Port Authority (DRPA), the nonfederal sponsor, would be responsible for most of the rest of the cost. The Corps\u2019 economic analysis of the project, updated in 1998, concluded it would yield annual benefits of $40.1 million, largely in the form of transportation cost savings related to importing crude oil (about 80 percent of the benefits) and importing or exporting cargo in containers, as well as bulk commodities including scrap metal, iron ore, and coal. The economic analysis estimated annualized project costs of $28.8 million. In addition to questions about the project\u2019s cost and benefits, a number of concerns have been raised about whether the project would have adverse environmental impacts\u2014for example, whether it would resuspend toxic substances in the water, degrade water quality, permit salt water intrusion into groundwater supplies used for drinking and other purposes, or significantly harm fish and wildlife.", "We were asked to review whether (1) the Corps of Engineers\u2019 economic analysis accurately and appropriately considered the benefits and costs of the project and (2) the environmental implications of the project have been fully addressed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Figure 1 is a map of the Delaware River Ship Channel that also shows the locations of various project features discussed throughout the report.", "The Delaware River project plan calls for deepening the main navigation ship channel from the mouth of the Delaware Bay through Philadelphia Harbor, and on to Beckett Street Terminal in Camden, New Jersey\u2014a distance of 102.5 miles. The project includes plans for constructing three new disposal facilities for dredged material, called confined disposal facilities, in Gloucester and Salem counties, New Jersey. Two of these new disposal facilities would be needed to maintain the current channel, even if the project were not built. The new facilities and 10 other existing facilities would accommodate the material dredged during the construction of the deeper channel and during the 50-year maintenance period that would follow. The project also includes plans to restore two wetland areas, one in New Jersey and the other in Delaware, and to replenish a beach site in Delaware.", "The Delaware River Port Authority, the nonfederal sponsor, would share in the costs of the project, according to requirements in the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 and a project cooperation agreement that would need to be signed with the Corps before beginning construction.

The Corps then prepared a design memorandum in 1996, which provided details on the final design and engineering plans for the project, and published a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement in 1997. In its Limited Reevaluation Report of 1998, the Corps updated the project\u2019s benefits and costs. Approval of this report constituted the Corps\u2019 decision to budget construction funds for the project.

Some of the major problems we identified in the Corps\u2019 analysis of project benefits are discussed below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Corps\u2019 Benefit Analysis Contained Miscalculations", "paragraphs": ["Based on a number of miscalculations, the Corps\u2019 analysis overstated annual project benefits by about $8.6 million. In one instance, the Corps misapplied the projections of commodity growth rates for traffic in the Delaware River ship channel when estimating future project benefits. For example, for oil imports from West Africa, the underlying data indicated that the appropriate predicted growth rate for 1992 through 2000 would be 5.8 percent, and 1.4 percent for 2001 through 2005. However, the Corps applied the 5.8 percent growth rate to the entire 1992 through 2005 time period and repeated the mistake by incorrectly applying predicted rates elsewhere in its analysis. In aggregate, this miscalculation led to about a $4.4 million overestimate of annual project benefits. Corps headquarters officials agreed with our analysis.", "After taking the Corps\u2019 misapplication of growth rates into consideration, there remained about a $4.7 million gap between the Corps\u2019 estimated annual project benefits and the outcome of our efforts to replicate its results. The Corps\u2019 economist for the project told us that this gap was created by a computer error and speculated that it could have occurred when files were transferred from one program to another. Ultimately, however, the Corps was unable to definitively explain the discrepancy between its original estimate and our attempt to replicate its estimate and acknowledged that the error overstated project benefits by about $4.7 million. Corps headquarters officials agreed with our analysis.", "The Corps also inconsistently discounted the project\u2019s future benefits to determine their net present value. Specifically, the Corps used different discount rates, realized benefits at different times of the year, and used different 50-year project time periods for the various benefit categories. For example, the Corps estimated project benefits for coal shipments for the period 2005 through 2055 (note that this is 51 years, not 50 years), while it estimated benefits for container ships from 2000 through 2050. Also, the Corps used an 8.75 percent discount rate to discount the coal benefits for present value purposes, but used 7.625 percent for crude oil. The Corps\u2019 economist for the project acknowledged the errors and noted that the discounting procedures used for net present value purposes should have been consistently applied. Taking these errors into consideration, as called for by applicable Corps guidelines for water resource projects, we found that annual project benefits would be about $0.4 million less than the Corps had projected. Corps headquarters officials agreed with our analysis.", "Finally, the Corps presented its benefit estimates in dollar values for different years for the various benefit categories. The Corps stated in its 1998 Limited Reevaluation Report that the benefit and cost estimates were in 1996 dollars. However, this was not true for any of the benefit categories: coal benefits were calculated in 1991 dollars; crude oil, iron ore, and scrap metal benefits in 1993 dollars; and container benefits in 1995 dollars. A basic principle of benefit-cost analyses is that benefit and cost estimates be given in the same year dollar values. Without such consistency, it is not possible to accurately compare project benefits and costs. Taking this mistake into account, we found that estimated project benefits increased by about $0.9 million. Corps headquarters officials agreed with our analysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corps\u2019 Benefit Analysis Was Based on Invalid Assumptions", "paragraphs": ["Based on a number of invalid assumptions, the Corps\u2019 analysis overstated annual project benefits by about $9.4 million. The Corps\u2019 analysis of the benefits that a 45-foot channel would be expected to produce was based on several components, such as time at sea, time in port, tonnage shipped, and average shipping cost per unit of cargo. For certain crude oil vessels, one of these components is time savings in unloading crude oil. Currently, crude oil vessels that are loaded to a hull depth of more than 40 feet must stop at the mouth of the Delaware River to transfer crude oil to smaller vessels (a process called lightering) until the ship\u2019s hull is no deeper than 40 feet below the surface. This transfer of cargo takes time and thus increases costs. With a deeper channel, such ships would spend less time lightering, or might not need to lighter at all, thus reducing costs. In calculating the economic benefits that a 45-foot channel would produce, the Corps assumed time savings from reduced lightering at both the port of origin and the port of destination. However, the benefits of reduced lightering are realized only at the destination of the voyage. Thus, the Corps double-counted this benefit, resulting in an overstatement of about $2.6 million in annual project benefits. Corps headquarters officials agreed that its analysis double-counted lightering time savings and therefore overstated annual project benefits.", "The Corps\u2019 economic analysis also claimed project benefits for predicted shipments of crude oil on vessels that require a channel depth of only 40 feet. Currently, some of the vessels that deliver crude oil to the Philadelphia area refineries require less than a 40-foot channel depth, but they have the capacity to more fully load, and thus could potentially take advantage of a deeper channel. To estimate the benefits of a 45-foot channel for these vessels, the Corps used a statistical model (two stage least squares) to predict how much oil these vessels would carry if a 45-foot channel were available. The model predicted benefits by analyzing 137 combinations of ship types and trade routes. The model predicted that only 32 of these 137 combinations (or 23 percent) would require a channel depth of greater than 40 feet to make the trip upriver to the oil refineries. Nonetheless, the Corps assumed benefits for all 137 combinations. The Corps\u2019 economist was unable to provide a clear rationale for claiming benefits for the 105 ship-type/trade-route combinations that its model predicted would not benefit from a deeper channel. The result was that the Corps claimed about $3.0 million in annual project benefits that were not supported by its model. Corps headquarters officials told us they believe that a greater number of these vessels could benefit from additional channel depth, but they could not verify their model. We agree that the deeper channel could benefit crude oil vessels with sailing drafts of less than 40 feet, but the amount of such benefits cannot be determined without a comprehensive reanalysis.", "We also found that the Corps\u2019 container ship benefit analysis was based on several invalid assumptions. First, the Corps incorrectly assumed the same one-way distance (3,600 nautical miles) for each of several different container ship trade routes (Australia, East Coast of South America, Europe, and the Mediterranean). For example, the one-way distance from Australia to Philadelphia via the Panama Canal is about 10,000 nautical miles. Further, for the Australia-to-Philadelphia route, the Corps assumed that with a 45-foot channel containers would be shipped on larger vessels and would go through the Suez Canal\u2014as opposed to using the Panama Canal, the current trade route for this traffic. But, the Suez Canal trade route is significantly longer than the Panama Canal trade route, raising serious questions about whether shipping via the Suez Canal would be more cost-effective. After taking this invalid assumption regarding distances into account, and using the Corps\u2019 methodology, we found that\u2014even with a 45-foot channel depth\u2014the least costly container ship trade route from Australia to Philadelphia remains through the Panama Canal. Furthermore, vessels using the Panama Canal are currently restricted to sailing drafts of 39 feet 6 inches. Thus, the benefits of the deeper channel for this trade route would be minimal. After taking the invalid assumptions in the Corps\u2019 analysis into account, we estimated that annual container ship benefits would be about $1.7 million less than the Corps estimated. Corps headquarters officials acknowledged our findings and their relative impact, as calculated on the basis of the information presented in the 1998 Limited Reevaluation Report. However, they now believe that container ship benefits may be higher than presented in the 1998 report because of changed shipping patterns. While changes have occurred in the container shipping industry, it would be premature to speculate on the effect these changes would have on project benefits without a comprehensive reanalysis.", "Moreover, the Corps also incorrectly assumed the same distance for different trade routes when estimating benefits for the category of crude oil vessels with sailing drafts less than 40 feet. Taking this invalid assumption into account reduced annual project benefits by about $1 million. Finally, we identified about $1.0 million in additional overestimated annual benefits due to other invalid assumptions related to the analysis for scrap metal, iron ore, and coal commodities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corps\u2019 Benefit Analysis Was Based on Outdated Information", "paragraphs": ["Much of the baseline information that underpins the Corps\u2019 project benefit analysis dates from 1985 through 1991. Thus, the data are outdated and do not reflect current shipping practices and trends. For example, the data the Corps used in its economic analysis led to a projection that crude oil imports up the Delaware River would increase by over 20 million short tons from 1992 though 2000. However, our review of available data indicated that crude oil imports increased by only about 10 million short tons over this period. We identified a number of instances, discussed below, in which the information used in the Corps\u2019 analysis was outdated. Where possible, we updated the information, and found that the Corps\u2019 analysis overstated total annual project benefits by about $8.8 million.", "The Corps\u2019 1992 feasibility study included benefits for the time savings related to reduced lightering of crude oil by tankers with a sailing draft of greater than 40 feet. The Corps estimated that crude oil could be unloaded from crude oil tankers to the refineries\u2019 storage tanks about twice as fast as it could be transferred to lightering vessels. Since that time, however, the company that provides lightering services in the Delaware River has modified its fleet of vessels that performs this service. Based on information provided by several refineries and the lightering company, lightering rates are almost the exact opposite of those used in the Corps\u2019 analysis. According to these sources, crude oil can be transferred from oil tankers to lightering vessels almost twice as fast as it can be unloaded from oil tankers to refineries. The Corps\u2019 use of the outdated information resulted in overstating annual project benefits by about $3.2 million.", "As discussed previously, the Corps overestimated the projected growth in crude oil imports. Substituting the predicted growth rates used by the Corps with actual growth rates based on historical import data to the Philadelphia region (at the time of the 1998 Limited Reevaluation Report), we found that the Corps\u2019 annual benefits were overestimated by about $3.5 million. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Corps stated that its crude oil projections (1992 through 2000) were in line with actual recorded tonnage. However, this statement is misleading because the crude oil import data that the Corps used to make this claim were inconsistently collected between 1992 and 2000. Nevertheless, the Corps stated in its comments that its project reanalysis would need to verify the database used to establish current and historic shipments to ensure data reliability. In addition, the Corps\u2019 predicted growth rates for container ship imports for some trade routes were also overestimated; substituting the predicted growth rates with actual growth rates, we found that the Corps\u2019 annual benefits were overestimated by about $0.3 million.", "Finally, the Corps\u2019 analysis included benefits for exporting scrap metal to Turkey and importing coal and iron ore. However, since the time of the Corps\u2019 1992 analysis, trade of these commodities on the Delaware River has greatly declined. Updating for this information, we found that benefits for scrap metal, iron ore, and coal were reduced by about $1.7 million a year (beyond the $1.0 million benefit reduction mentioned earlier). Corps headquarters officials concurred that shipments of scrap metal, coal, and iron ore have decreased since the 1998 Limited Reevaluation Report but stated that shipments of these commodities increased from 2000 to 2001 and may warrant further analysis.", "Table 1 shows the Corps\u2019 1998 benefit estimates and summarizes errors in those estimates based on our evaluation of the Corps\u2019 analysis.", "It is important to note that because of the numerous shortcomings in the Corps\u2019 analysis, the actual project benefits cannot be reliably known without a comprehensive reanalysis. To be complete, such a reanalysis would need to account for the miscalculations and invalid assumptions we identified.

Some of these changes\u2014reducing the volume of material and locations where dredging would need to be performed\u2014would reduce annual project costs. But this cost reduction would be offset by several other updates and corrections that would increase project costs. Accounting for these increases and decreases, in aggregate, annual project costs would likely be about $27 million (in 2001 dollars) rather than the $28.8 million estimated by the Corps in the 1998 Limited Reevaluation Report. However, other Corps costs were based on outdated information, contained errors, or did not take into account all pertinent information.

Originally, assuming that the overall depth of the existing channel was 40 feet, the Corps estimated the amount of material to be dredged at 33 million cubic yards. However, new information developed by the Corps indicates that parts of the channel are already deeper than 40 feet. Thus, the Corps has reduced its estimate of the material to be dredged to approximately 26 million cubic yards, thereby lowering the costs of dredging.", "Further, new surveys of the main ship channel and the use of new technology have given the Corps more accurate information about areas of the channel that are 45 feet or deeper already and will not need to be dredged. The new technology\u2014side scan sonar\u2014provides more accurate mapping of the contour of the shipping channel, thereby enabling the Corps to determine that less total area needs to be dredged than it previously believed.

The Corps has revised the disposal costs for the construction phase of the project to reflect this change.", "Also, during our review of the Corps\u2019 cost estimate, we identified a number of omissions.

A Corps official was unable to explain why this occurred, but the Corps has since corrected for the omission.", "Finally, we identified a number of errors in the Corps\u2019 cost estimate, one having to do with inconsistent discounting. In estimating costs for maintenance dredging, the Corps used end-year discounting, but for construction costs and benefit calculations, it used different discount periods. As discussed earlier, benefits and costs should be determined using consistent discounting procedures.

Moreover, a number of specific errors and omissions in the cost estimate remain to be addressed; making the necessary corrections would likely increase project costs. For example, the cost estimate for maintaining a 45-foot channel has not been revised to reflect that one of the disposal facilities is no longer available. The alternative location is more distant from the dredging operation. Corps officials agreed that this problem exists in the cost estimate and that the additional distance would increase costs. At the time of our review, the Corps had not calculated how much this correction would increase project costs. Corps headquarters officials believe that updating maintenance and berthing area cost estimates to correct for outdated data and inaccuracies would have a marginal impact on the total project costs. However, the full extent of the impact cannot be accurately estimated until project costs have been completely reanalyzed.", "In addition, the Corps\u2019 current cost estimate assumes that maintenance dredging for the 45-foot channel would begin after the last year of construction and continue for 50 years. But maintenance dredging for some sections of the channel could begin before the 5-year construction phase of the project is completed because the sections that are to be deepened to 45 feet in the first years of construction would likely start to fill in as sand and silt resettle in the channel. The Corps\u2019 estimate for maintenance costs does not account for the fact that some costs should be inflated and others discounted to reflect that maintenance in certain sections of the channel would need to be done at different times. Taking this oversight into account would increase costs. Although a Corps official acknowledged this inaccuracy, the Corps had not, at the time of our review, calculated how much this correction would increase annualized project costs. Corps headquarters officials have stated that this problem could potentially be corrected by modifying the project construction schedule. However, any modification of the schedule would affect the total project cost.", "Finally, the Corps did not include in its estimate all the capital investments that private companies, such as oil refineries, would need to make to take advantage of the deeper channel. For example, officials at two refineries told us that they would need to build additional on-site storage capacity to take advantage of a deeper channel, but these costs were not included in the cost estimate. While taking this omission into account would likely increase annualized project costs, the Corps had not addressed this issue at the time of our review. Corps headquarters officials stated that they assumed no land-side costs attributable to the proposed project at the time of the 1998 Limited Reevaluation Report.

If and when these uncertainties are resolved, expected benefits and costs could further increase or decrease, thus affecting the project\u2019s economic merits."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Uncertainties Related to Project Benefits", "paragraphs": ["It is uncertain whether the companies expected to benefit from the project, primarily oil refineries, would undertake the capital improvements necessary to take full advantage of a deeper channel and, if so, whether they would do it in the same time frame as assumed by the Corps. In its economic analysis, the Corps assumed that all potential beneficiaries would perform the work necessary to take advantage of a deeper channel, such as dredging side channels and berthing areas, by the end of the last year of planned construction. However, potential beneficiaries have made few firm commitments to make these capital improvements. An official of one company wrote to the Corps supporting the project, and a public relations official from another responded to a local newspaper saying the company would look favorably on the project. In addition, representatives of several other companies told us they believe the project could benefit them, but because substantial work could be necessary to deepen their berthing areas, retrofit docking areas, or expand storage capacity, they would not make a firm commitment to making these improvements. If any of the benefiting companies did not perform the necessary work, or if they delayed these efforts until after the project was completed, anticipated benefits would be reduced. Corps headquarters officials reaffirmed the Corps\u2019 support of the draft project cooperation agreement, which calls upon the nonfederal sponsor to enter into agreements with the benefiting firms to complete the necessary work in conjunction with the construction of the project. The draft project cooperation agreement provides that the Corps may elect to stop project construction in the absence of such agreements.", "As discussed earlier, one of the benefits of the deeper channel\u2014included in the Corps\u2019 analysis\u2014is a reduced need for the lightering of crude oil. In fact, the company that provides lightering services in the bay currently estimates that the demand for its services could decrease by a third, from lightering 90 million barrels of crude oil per year to 60 million. The uncertainty involves how this company would react to a reduction in demand for its services. An official of this company told us that the company might reduce the number of lightering vessels operating in the bay from three to two, which could potentially increase the time that vessels might have to wait for lightering services, increase lightering fees, or both. These scenarios would likely decrease the economic benefits of reduced lightering. Another possibility is that the lightering firm could reduce its fees in an effort to maintain demand for its services. In any event, less lightering could reduce gaseous emissions that occur during the lightering process, thus resulting in some environmental benefits.", "In addition, Federal Principles and Guidelines for Water Resource Agencies call for including project benefits that contribute to national economic development. Yet, it is uncertain whether all of the potential benefits of a 45-foot channel would contribute to national economic development because most of the ships coming into Delaware River ports are foreign-owned. The Corps\u2019 analysis did not take into account the distribution of the project benefits between U.S. and foreign interests; in essence, the Corps assumed that all transportation savings attributable to the project would accrue to U.S. interests. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Corps stated that we are making an implicit assumption that all benefits should accrue to American interests, and those realized by foreign interests should be netted out in the determination of U.S. national economic development. First, we are not making an implicit assumption. The Economic and Environmental Principles for Water and Related Land Resources Implementation Studies\u2014a publication that establishes principles intended to ensure proper and consistent planning by the Corps\u2014and the Corps\u2019 own guidance state: \u201cThe Federal objective of water and related land resources project planning is to contribute to national economic development consistent with protecting the Nation\u2019s environment, pursuant to national environmental statutes, applicable executive orders, and other Federal planning requirements.\u201d Second, it is unclear how the Corps can meet that definition of national economic development without analyzing the distribution of project benefits between U.S. and foreign interests. In summary, our concern is that to the extent that some of the transportation cost savings of this project\u2014as well as those for other similar Corps navigation projects\u2014accrue to foreign interests, the contributions of the project to national economic development are overstated.", "Finally, an area of uncertainty that could increase project benefits is the degree to which there are commodities being shipped on the Delaware River that the Corps did not include in its economic analysis. For example, recent shipping data indicate that imports of iron and steel increased from about 550,000 short tons in 1990 to about 4 million short tons in 2000. The importers of these and other goods might benefit from a deeper channel, but the Corps\u2019 benefit analysis did not consider these commodities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uncertainties Related to Project Costs", "paragraphs": ["There are several uncertainties regarding project costs. One area of uncertainty involves mitigation costs for any unexpected environmental damage that could potentially emerge. While the Corps has included some costs for assessing the likely environmental impacts of the project, should monitoring or construction activities reveal unanticipated problems, the costs to slow the dredging schedule or rebuild damaged habitat are unclear. In addition, discussed below are several other uncertainties that we identified during our review that may increase or decrease costs by an as yet unquantified amount.", "One such uncertainty concerns the recent addition of beach replenishment to the project\u2019s plan for disposal of dredged material. The Corps\u2019 current disposal plan calls for transporting sand dredged from the lower Delaware Bay to Broadkill Beach in Delaware. However, it is unclear whether the clean sand will ultimately go to Broadkill Beach because, pending an agreement with the state of Delaware, another beach, or beaches, could be selected. Using a beach that is closer to the dredging area would result in a lower cost for beach replenishment than is currently estimated. Alternatively, if the selected beach were farther from the channel-dredging area, the cost of the operation would be higher than estimated. For example, the current costs of dredging the channel and transporting the sand to Broadkill Beach are estimated at $10 per cubic yard; the costs for the same activities with Dewey-Rehoboth Beach as the destination would be about $18 per cubic yard. Given the uncertainty about which beach or beaches will ultimately be chosen, the final cost of this activity is unclear.", "It is also uncertain how much purchasing the sites for the three new confined disposal facilities in New Jersey would cost, and whether the project sponsor would be able to acquire all of these sites. Currently, these sites are estimated to cost $15.4 million. The Corps does not intend to update its appraisal of these sites, which would involve estimating the amount of land to be purchased, until after the project cooperation agreement between the Corps and the nonfederal sponsor has been signed. In the meantime, the Gloucester County Improvement Authority of New Jersey is seeking to buy portions of these areas for recreational purposes. Given these uncertainties, it is possible that the costs of land needed for new confined disposal facilities could increase.", "Another uncertainty concerns how much it would cost the Corps to comply with certain environmental restrictions, called windows. Designed to protect habitat and vulnerable populations such as horseshoe crabs, oysters, and winter flounder in certain sections of the Delaware River, the windows limit where and when dredging, beach replenishment, and wetland restoration activities can occur. For example, to protect the habitat of winter flounder, dredging cannot occur in the lower portion of the river from January through May without relief from the window. If the Corps could not complete its scheduled dredging from June through December, it would incur additional costs to stop the work and start it up again later. The Corps is currently studying the extent to which fish and surrounding habitat would be harmed by dredging activities. A Corps official told us that these studies may show that the current windows are overly protective, a finding that the official believes would provide some support for federal and state agencies to provide relief from some of the restrictions. In addition, the Corps plans to use two dredges in the areas where restrictions are established to reduce dredging time. In any event, the 1998 estimate and its recent update do not include the potentially increased costs of complying with these windows. According to a Corps official, because the Corps is unsure how much relief it would obtain from the restrictions, it is uncertain how much project costs would increase. Corps headquarters officials now state that a significant portion of the project construction work could be accomplished within the existing environmental windows. Specifically, they have said that the operations at Broadkill Beach and Kelly Island would not require relief. However, to the extent that the Corps cannot obtain the necessary relief in other areas, project costs would increase.", "A further uncertainty concerns whether the Corps will employ the technique known as economic loading for its dredging operations in the lower bay area. Using this technique, the water content of dredged material that has been loaded onto a barge, or dredge, is allowed to drain back into the river at that site. Therefore, when the barge is fully loaded, it contains a higher percentage of dredged material, resulting in fewer trips to the disposal sites. Because of concerns that the water drained from the dredge material would contain a large amount of particulate matter that would cause a plume in the water column, the Corps studied the potential environmental effects of economic loading in 1999. The study concluded that economic loading would not cause significant long-term environmental harm. Having reviewed the results of the study, officials from Delaware and New Jersey said they would consider allowing the use of economic loading in the lower bay. However, it should be noted that this option was not included as part of the Corps\u2019 permit application to the state of Delaware and that formal approvals from either Delaware or New Jersey have not been requested. Should the Corps formally seek and obtain permission to use economic loading, costs would decrease. In commenting on the draft of this report, Corps officials said that indications from the states of New Jersey and Delaware are that this process may be viable and practical in the Delaware Bay for dredging sandy material. The Corps estimated that if economic loading were permitted, it could result in a 30 to 40 percent reduction in the unit cost of dredging, which the Corps stated previously would translate into approximately $2 million in annualized cost savings. However, the Corps recognized that it is uncertain whether economic loading would be used, and that this issue would need to be investigated in any reanalysis of the project.", "Finally, a new dredging technology, known as a ladder pump, increases dredge material production rates and has the potential to decrease costs for some of the dredging operations that would occur during the construction and maintenance phases of the project. However, the Corps did not incorporate the use of this new technology into its cost estimate, and it is not known whether the contractors that would conduct the project\u2019s dredging operations would use it."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Corps\u2019 Quality Control Process Did Not Identify Major Flaws in the Economic Analysis", "paragraphs": ["The Corps has a three-tiered quality control process designed to ensure that its economic analyses of proposed projects are factually accurate and based on sound economic principles. Three organizational levels are involved: the Corps\u2019 district offices, division offices, and headquarters. In general, for projects such as the Delaware River deepening project, the following process is used:  The relevant district office is responsible for conducting a feasibility study that addresses the technical and economic aspects of a proposed project and manages the planning, engineering, and design work that follows. The district office also prepares the Limited Reevaluation Report that updates the technical and economic data as needed. Once it has developed these project justification documents, the district office reviews them for technical accuracy and quality, and upon approval, it forwards them to the division for its review.", "The division\u2019s responsibility is primarily procedural. It reviews the project justification package to ensure that the district has prepared the required documents such as the Feasibility Study and Limited Reevaluation Report and has obtained all necessary approvals. It does not review such documents for technical accuracy or to verify the underlying analysis. The division ensures that reports such as the Limited Reevaluation Report have undergone a technical review and that the district has issued a quality control certification report with the required district office level approvals. Once the division is satisfied that procedures have been followed, it approves the package and forwards it to headquarters.", "Headquarters is responsible for ensuring that critical documents such as the Feasibility Study and Limited Reevaluation Report, the major assumptions on which the justification is based, and the recommendations adhere to Corps policy for conducting benefit-cost analyses and environmental studies. Headquarters also ensures that any concerns that it has raised have been addressed. Once headquarters is satisfied that policy has been followed and that the justification is based on sound economics and environmental studies, it approves the project for construction funding.", "Although the district, division, and headquarters offices approved the project according to the procedures in place in 1992 and changes that followed in 1995, these review processes were ineffective in detecting and correcting the significant miscalculations, invalid assumptions, and outdated information in the economic analysis that our review revealed. For example, we found no indication that problems related to benefits, such as misapplying growth rates, double-counting lightering time savings, and miscalculating potential benefits derived from time savings in unloading crude oil at the refineries, were detected during the internal reviews and quality control certification process. This raises serious questions about the adequacy and effectiveness of the Corps\u2019 review process. Corps headquarters officials have stated that notwithstanding the changing and existing procedures, there were failures in the execution of the process for the development and review of the feasibility analysis and the Limited Reevaluation Report. The economic update in the Limited Reevaluation Report was performed in accordance with existing regulations but did not get to the root of the underlying problems, some of which were carried forth from the original report.", "Another concern is that since 1995, the primary responsibility for performing the quality reviews of key project documents has been largely delegated to the district office level. The Philadelphia district office prepared the economic analysis and other documents justifying the deepening project and, following the 1995 change in Corps procedures, prepared the 1998 Limited Reevaluation Report and then conducted the technical review and quality control certification process on the report. The fact that the same office that prepared the economic analysis was also responsible for conducting the technical and quality reviews raises questions about the independence of the review process. Similar concerns about the Corps\u2019 project review procedures were addressed in section 216 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000, which directed the Corps to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to study and make recommendations with regard to the need for independent reviews of Corps feasibility studies. The estimated date of completion for the study is 2003.", "Looking beyond the Delaware River deepening project, the number and magnitude of problems that were not detected by the Corps\u2019 quality control process raises questions about whether, or to what degree, such oversights might exist for other Corps projects. This concern is shared, at least, to some degree by the Corps of Engineers. Specifically, shortly after we briefed the Corps\u2019 Director of Civil Works on our findings regarding the Delaware River deepening project, he initiated a pause on projects authorized, but not yet under construction, to resolve any questions about the accuracy and currency of the Corps\u2019 economic analyses, the validity of plan formulation decisions, and the rigor of the Corps\u2019 review process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Environmental Concerns Have Been Addressed, but Several Related Issues Remain Unresolved", "paragraphs": ["The Corps has largely addressed the likely environmental effects of the project\u2019s dredging operations and dredge material disposal to the satisfaction of federal and state environmental agencies; however, several issues are not yet resolved.

The Corps also made some changes as a result of agencies\u2019 comments. For example, in response to concerns raised by the National Marine Fisheries Service and others, the Corps eliminated its proposal to dispose of some dredged material at an underwater sand stockpiling location. On the basis of their review of these and subsequent documents, as well as consultations performed by the Corps, officials from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania determined that deepening the Delaware River ship channel would not cause significant long-term harm to the environment.

Such monitoring would be central to ensuring that project activities would not degrade water quality, damage groundwater through saltwater intrusion, or harm commercially valuable or vulnerable species. Consequently, the Corps has conducted preconstruction monitoring studies on whether the project would adversely affect oysters and water and sediment quality. In addition, the Corps has studied the likely impact of the project on blue crabs in the lower part of the bay and on winter flounder, horseshoe crabs, and shorebirds at Kelly Island. The Corps has provided the results of these studies to the federal and state environmental agencies for their review, and Corps officials told us that they would continue to monitor these and other environmental issues during and after construction.

To satisfy the commission\u2019s concerns, the Corps agreed to the test, which it has not yet conducted.", "In addition, New Jersey officials told us that they would encourage the Delaware River Port Authority to explore alternatives to disposing of dredge material, such as using it for highway construction, before New Jersey would grant water quality certificates for the three confined disposal facilities to be acquired by the Port Authority and built by the Corps in New Jersey. In addition, the Corps and New Jersey\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection have developed a groundwater-monitoring program designed to ensure that existing confined disposal facilities in New Jersey do not harm drinking water.

To determine whether the environmental implications of the project have been fully addressed, we contacted a number of federal and state environmental agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the Delaware River Basin Commission, and the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control. We also obtained information from environmental groups and other interested parties. For both these objectives, we obtained the Corps\u2019 key documents for the project, such as the Interim Final Feasibility Study of 1992, the Design Memorandum of 1996, the Limited Reevaluation Report of 1998, the Environmental Impact Statement of 1992, and the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement of 1997.

Where we were unable to replicate the Corps\u2019 estimates, we met with the Corps\u2019 economist to discuss and resolve the discrepancies. Second, to identify questionable assumptions in the analysis, we examined the data used and calculations applied in the Corps\u2019 benefits programs. To determine whether the Corps\u2019 assumptions were supportable, we requested documentation or guidelines from the Corps\u2019 economist that validated the questioned approach. In addition, we met and talked with industry representatives to obtain their response. Third, to identify whether the analysis was based on up-to-date information, we reviewed the origin of any changes to the benefits estimates in the 1998 Limited Reevaluation Report from the 1992 Interim Final Feasibility Study and the 1996 Design Memorandum.

Our subsequent efforts focused on changes to the project, various updates to costs by the Corps, corrections we identified, and additional issues that could further affect costs.

Because the Corps makes extensive use of internally developed cost- estimating computer programs, we obtained these programs so that we could replicate construction costs and operations and maintenance costs using the Corps\u2019 programs and methodology. We gained an understanding of the Corps\u2019 Cost Engineering Dredge Estimating Program, which estimates costs for each of the three types of dredging operations used in the project, and the Corps\u2019 Micro Computer-Aided Cost Estimating System, which estimates the costs of constructing elements of the project that require land equipment, such as the confined disposal facilities.

For example, where new information existed on the volume of the material to be dredged from the channel, we asked for documentation from the Corps, not only on the volume of material that had been reduced but also on where those reductions had occurred in the channel. When we learned that less of the channel needed to be dredged because side-scan sonar technology provided better information on the areas of the river that were already 45 feet deep, we obtained survey maps from the Corps and verified that the estimated reductions in surface areas that the Corps was using in its revised costs were reasonable.
