Following immediate relief efforts, Congress provided $1.14 billion for reconstruction in the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010. USAID is responsible for implementing $651 million of this amount, and it has allocated about $268 million of this and other funding to construct a power plant and port to support the CIP in northern Haiti and permanent housing in several locations. The Act required State to report periodically to Congress on funding obligated and disbursed and program outputs and outcomes. GAO was asked to review USAID's efforts in Haiti. This report examines USAID's (1) funding obligations and disbursements and State's reports to Congress on funding and progress; (2) USAID's progress in two CIP-related activities--a power plant and port; and (3) USAID's progress in constructing permanent housing.

The Department of State (State) submitted four of five periodic reports to Congress, as required by the Act. The reports included information on funding obligated and disbursed and anecdotal information on outputs and outcomes of some activities, as the Act required. The Senate Appropriations Committee, in its Committee Report accompanying the Act, had also directed State to report more detailed information on funding and sector activities in Haiti, which State did not include in the reports. Although most funds have not been disbursed, State's reporting requirement ended in September 2012. As a result, Congress lacks information on the amounts of funds obligated and disbursed and program-by-program progress of U.S. reconstruction activities.", "USAID has allocated $170.3 million to construct a power plant and port to support the newly developed Caracol Industrial Park (CIP), with mixed results. According to USAID documents and external studies, the sustainability of the CIP, power plant, and port are interdependent; each must be completed and remain viable for the others to succeed. USAID completed the power plant's first phase with less funding than allocated and in time to supply power to the first CIP tenant. Port construction will not begin until at least 2 years later than originally planned due in part to a lack of USAID expertise in port planning in Haiti. In January 2011, the mission made an unsuccessful attempt to solicit a person to fill a vacant port engineer position but made no additional attempts prior to May 2013 and this position currently remains unfilled. As a result, planning has been hindered by (1) unrealistic initial timeframes, (2) delays in awarding the contract for a feasibility study, and (3) incomplete information in the feasibility study. According to initial estimates of port construction costs, USAID funding will be insufficient to cover a majority of projected costs. The estimated gap of $117 million to $189 million is larger than initially estimated, and it is unclear whether the Haitian government will be able to find a private sector company willing to finance the remainder of the project.", "USAID has reduced its permanent housing construction targets in Haiti. USAID initially underestimated the funding needed for its New Settlements housing program. As a result, the agency increased the amount allocated by 65 percent, from $59 million to $97 million, and decreased the projected number of houses to be built by over 80 percent, from 15,000 to 2,649. The estimated number of beneficiaries was reduced from 75,000 to 90,000 to its current estimates of approximately 13,200 to 15,900. Cost increases resulted from inaccurate original estimates that used inappropriate cost comparisons and from the Haitian government's request for larger houses with improvements such as flush toilets. USAID currently estimates construction will be completed almost 2 years later than initially scheduled. Delays occurred due to the difficulties of securing land titles and coordination issues with partner donors. USAID is attempting to mitigate potential sustainability risks, such as the possible lack of economic opportunities, affordability of housing and services, and community cohesion, but gaps in the support of community development mechanisms may increase these risks."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider requiring State to provide it with periodic reports on reconstruction progress, funding, and schedules until most funding for each program sector has been disbursed.

USAID does not know what portion of this funding is  needed for the additional studies and design; however, it is clear that the  amount remaining for construction will be a significantly smaller portion  than USAID had initially planned to contribute to the project\u2019s total  construction cost. As a result, USAID officials recognize that there is a  risk that no private company interested in operating the port would be  willing to cover the entire remaining costs of construction, particularly  given the political risks of operating in Haiti.

Other power plants in the region  produce intermittent power. The existing ports in Haiti have high port  costs and those in the Dominican Republic that currently  accommodate cargo traffic are distant from the CIP, raising the cost of  doing business at the CIP (see fig. 4). In addition, according to the  port feasibility study, the Cap-Ha\u00eftien port, the closest current port to  the CIP, has limited capacity. The study concluded that the CIP will  only succeed if expanded, efficient port facilities are developed  nearby.", "The port and power plant depend on revenues from the CIP: CIP  tenants will generate a substantial portion of the revenue for the  power plant and port, so the sustainability of these projects will  depend on the Haitian government finding additional tenants and  maintaining the park. Potential tenants may be wary of moving to the  CIP because of Haiti\u2019s history of instability and corruption or the lack  of Haitian government capacity, although as noted earlier, according  to State officials, there were four additional potential tenants for the  CIP as of May 2013.", "All three projects depend on Haitian government capacity: The  Haitian government will be responsible for maintaining and managing  the CIP and power plant and for overseeing the private company that  will operate the new port. Studies of the CIP have cited concerns  about the relevant Haitian government ministry\u2019s ability to manage  and maintain the infrastructure in and around the CIP given their  limited staff and technical resources. Aware of such concerns, the CIP  has contracted a professional industrial facility management firm to  operate and maintain the park. According to the September 2011 AAD  for the energy sector, the sustainability of investments in the Haitian  energy sector depends on legal, regulatory, and management reforms  to improve the commercial viability of Haiti\u2019s electrical system and  provide resources for its maintenance and operations. To address this  for its first 3 years, USAID will pay for a contractor to operate and  maintain the power plant, and to prepare the Haitian electricity  department to take over these functions after the 3 years. According  to USAID documents, Haiti will need institutional and regulatory  reforms to ensure efficient customs operations and competitive port  charges, to curtail monopolistic practices, and to facilitate private  investment in the port sector.", "Obtaining revenue for the power plant from electricity  distribution outside the CIP: As of February 2013, the few  customers connected to the power plant outside the CIP had largely  paid their initial bills on time. However, according to a 2010 report on  the Haitian energy sector, 64 percent of Haitians do not pay their  electricity bills in a timely manner and 33 percent do not pay at all. In  addition, USAID officials have recognized that it is common  throughout Haiti to tap into lines without paying, and this practice is  unlikely to have repercussions. As a result, the USAID operations and  maintenance contractor plans to provide training to local communities  on the use and value of electricity.", "Attracting a private company to construct and operate the port:  The government of Haiti has considered charging $260 for each  container coming into the northern port to use the revenues generated  for social programs. However, the port feasibility study concluded that  such a government surcharge would make the project financially  infeasible. State officials have communicated this information to the  Haitian government to encourage them to lower the surcharge to  allow the port to be successful. Given this and other risks associated  with the port listed above, it is unclear whether the Haitian  government will be able to find a private company interested in  investing in port construction and operations.

These issues have resulted in delays, with the  program currently expected to be completed nearly 2 years later than  initially scheduled.

These costs are comprised of two main categories: (1) cost of  site preparation per plot and (2) cost of construction per house. In its  planning documents, USAID originally estimated costs at $1,800 per plot  and $8,000 per house. As of April 2013, average costs based on awarded  contracts have increased to $9,598 per plot and $23,409 per house.  Overall, the cost for USAID to prepare a plot and build a house increased  from original estimates of $9,800 to average costs of $33,007. These cost  differences stem primarily from the inaccuracy of USAID\u2019s original  estimates, and secondarily from Haitian government requests for design  changes. Figure 5 compares the original estimates, initial contract costs,  and revised contract costs.", "More details on the reasons for cost differences in this program are  outlined below.", "Original estimates: By November 2010, USAID had developed its  original cost estimates for the New Settlements program. Prior to the  earthquake, the mission had no housing programs in Haiti, and as a  result did not have its own historical data on construction costs and  few existing relationships with potential shelter sector partners. The  mission hired a Senior Shelter Advisor and staffed a shelter team to  develop the original cost estimates, layouts, and design concepts for  what would become the New Settlements program. According to  USAID officials, these estimates were not adequately supported; they  did not document the sources of data or the methodologies used to  derive these estimates. Rather, the original estimates were based in  part on the USAID shelter team\u2019s calculations and costs reported by  the World Bank and an NGO that was building houses in northern  Haiti. USAID mission officials noted that these original cost estimates  were used to develop the budget and projected goals of the New  Settlements program. However, to meet certain technical and financial  planning requirements, the shelter team prepared independent  government cost estimates prior to issuing solicitations for bids for  each site preparation and each housing construction project. The first  independent government cost estimates for site preparation and  housing construction were conducted in September and November  2011, respectively. Those efforts provided the shelter team with more  detailed and accurate information to guide them through the  procurement process.  Initial contract costs: By April 2012, USAID awarded multiple  contracts for construction projects at two settlement sites, where costs  exceeded the original estimates. In particular, site preparation per plot  increased from $1,800 to $6,165, a 242-percent increase. The  inaccuracy of the site preparation estimates had a more substantial  impact on USAID\u2019s program budget and goals than the inaccurate  estimates of housing construction costs because USAID planned to  finance all site preparation costs, while NGOs and other partner  donors would finance and build the majority of houses. According to  USAID officials, original estimates did not adequately consider the  stringent international building codes and disaster resistance  standards planned for New Settlement houses and did not take into  account the extent or complexity of service infrastructure USAID  intended to provide. Furthermore, USAID officials noted that, as  multiple reconstruction efforts have progressed, the demand and cost  for construction materials has increased.", "Revised contract costs: By July 2012, USAID signed a revised  contract to accommodate design changes requested by the Haitian  government, which also increased costs. Specifically, the design  changes called for an increase in the size of housing units, from about  275 square feet to about 450 square feet, and the inclusion of flush  toilets, rather than a more traditional dry toilet system. USAID agreed  to these changes and revised the initial contracts to include these  modifications and allow for the increased costs. The Haitian  government\u2019s design changes drove total cost increases up from the  initial contract costs by 34 percent, from $24,625 to $33,007. Officials  noted that providing housing with higher earthquake and hurricane  resistance standards and with electricity, plumbing, and flush toilets,  takes longer to construct and costs more than options provided by  other donors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Funding Has Significantly Increased", "paragraphs": ["Based on original estimates, the New Settlements program was allocated  approximately $59 million under USAID\u2019s Shelter AAD. However,  USAID increased the program budget after receiving multiple bids from  private sector contractors for both site preparation and housing  construction. USAID also dedicated additional funds to institutional  strengthening to support local organizations\u2019 beneficiary selection, and  added a community development component. All together USAID  increased program funding to approximately $97 million, about a 65- percent increase. As of March 31, 2013, USAID had obligated about $48  million and had disbursed about $32 million for New Settlements  permanent housing activities (see table 5).", "USAID has reduced its program targetss a number of times. As of April  2013, it had reduced the number of houses it expects USAID and its  partners  to complete, and therefore the number of beneficiaries, by over  80 percent. Of the 15,000 houses originally planned, only 2,649 are  expected to be completed, with USAID building 906 houses and NGOs  and other partner donors estimated to build 1,743 (see fig. 6). USAID  officials noted that USAID would commit no further funds to housing  construction and will only commit funds for site preparation if USAID has  written agreements with partner donors. Therefore, the estimated number  of houses and completion dates may vary from current projections.", "USAID also reduced the total number of projected beneficiaries from an  original estimate of 75,000 to 90,000 to its current estimate of  approximately 13,200 to 15,900. USAID originally planned for new  settlements to be distributed geographically with 5,000 houses to be built  in the northern Cap-Ha\u00eftien corridor and 10,000 houses to be built in the  Port-au-Prince and St-Marc corridors, closer to where the earthquake\u2019s  epicenter occurred. In addition to the overall decline in housing numbers,  the distribution of these houses between the north and south also shifted.  Current projections are for the Cap-Ha\u00eftien corridor to have 1,967 houses,  or 74 percent of the total. A combined 682 or 26 percent of the total are to  be built in the Port-au-Prince and St-Marc corridors. Of those houses in  the Cap-Ha\u00eftien corridor, over 90-percent are planned to be within a 13- mile radius of the CIP (see fig. 7).", "USAID is nearing completion of two settlement sites, Caracol-EKAM in  the Cap-Ha\u00eftien corridor and DLA 1.5 in the St-Marc corridor. The  Caracol-EKAM settlement is projected to provide permanent houses to  approximately 3,750 to 4,500 residents, and the DLA 1.5 settlement is  projected to provide permanent houses to approximately 780 to 936  residents. Beneficiaries will begin to occupy houses once all construction  is complete. The planned move-in date for beneficiaries at both  settlements is July 2013 (see fig. 8).", "The U.S. government\u2019s January 2011 strategy projected that all USAID  permanent housing construction and site preparation under the New  Settlements program would be completed by July 2012, but the current  estimated completion date for planned sites is March 2014, nearly 2 years  later. Housing construction began at Caracol-EKAM and at DLA 1.5 in  April 2012. NGO and other partner donor financed housing construction  on USAID prepared sites is planned but has not yet begun.", "According to State and USAID officials, USAID faced difficulties trying to  secure proper land title for permanent housing, which resulted in delays.  These delays affected the implementation of the program and availability  of NGO and other partner donor financing. For example, according to  USAID officials, USAID spent a substantial amount of time trying to  secure clear title to private and government-owned land but was able to  acquire only one site through private owners because of difficulties in  confirming legitimate ownership. USAID discontinued attempts to partner  with private owners in August 2011. Additionally, land titling issues arose  with government-owned land. For example, although USAID officials  reported that the agency had conducted due diligence and approved 15  potential housing sites in November 2010, USAID later found that the  secure land titles for some of these sites could not be confirmed due to  unclear or disputed ownership, and thus reduced the number of site  options and further delayed site selection.", "Partnering with NGOs and other donors on the planning and construction  of permanent houses was more complicated and time consuming than  USAID originally expected. According to USAID officials, NGOs and  other partner donors have their own processes, procedures, and goals  that often differ from those of USAID. According to USAID officials, the  mission shelter team was involved in negotiations with several key donor  partners as early as November 2010. In January 2011, the President of  the American Red Cross (Red Cross) announced its intention to partner  with USAID and provide $30 million to build homes on at least two sites.  Later, in June 2011, USAID signed a memorandum of understanding with  the Red Cross to build more than 3,000 houses; however, according to  USAID officials, that partnership did not materialize because of difficulties  and delays in securing land title from privately owned sites near Port-au- Prince. In addition, according to USAID officials, the partnership was  further delayed because of turnover in various Red Cross leadership  positions, resulting in shifting approaches to the development of housing  settlements. According to officials, USAID also had plans to partner with  Food for the Poor, an NGO with experience building houses in Haiti, to  build 750 of the houses at Caracol-EKAM. However, this discussion  ended in part because that NGO decided it did not want to assist in  building communities that large.", "The success of USAID\u2019s New Settlements program relied heavily on  partner NGOs. The USAID mission was confident that the program would  attract partners because one of the primary challenges NGOs faced in the  first year after the earthquake was finding suitable land with clear title.  According to one of USAID\u2019s implementing partners, NGOs providing  housing assistance hesitate to invest in land for new housing if legal proof  of ownership cannot be secured. By securing land title, the program  would help partners avoid the complex land tenure issues that were  already seriously impeding many of their shelter programs. However,  lengthy delays in resolving land title issues contributed to difficulties in  solidifying partnerships because the delays allowed time for potential  NGO partners to change their shelter strategies or commit their funds to  other reconstruction activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Housing Settlements Have Numerous Sustainability Challenges", "paragraphs": ["According to USAID, the sustainability of the new housing settlements will  depend on broad factors such as the capacity of the Haitian government  and regional economic opportunities. USAID is attempting to ensure the  viability of settlements by locating them in areas with employment,  healthcare, education, and transportation. In the Cap-Ha\u00eftien corridor, the  United States and other international donors are making multiple  investments in new infrastructure, such as the CIP and potential port, to  create an economic growth pole in the region. If those efforts do not  successfully provide adequate economic opportunities, beneficiaries may  not be able to afford the fees and services connected with their new  homes, or may have to relocate altogether. USAID is also working with  the Haitian government in areas where capacity issues exist, such as  energy sector management.", "In addition, more site-specific factors will affect sustainability. USAID has  made some limited mitigation efforts, but notes that further support for  community development is necessary to maintain the settlements over  time. Local governments and community members need to provide  ongoing support, maintenance, and management of the new settlements  to ensure their sustainability. Specifically, beneficiaries will face site- specific issues related to affordability, community management, and the  possibility of informal expansion or sprawl of shantytowns.", "Affordability: According to USAID officials, the Haitian government  has indicated that beneficiaries must make some number of monthly  payments, in an amount to be determined, before title to the house is  conferred. Beneficiaries will also face charges for utilities and  services, such as electricity and sewage.", "Housing payments: According to USAID officials, although  beneficiaries are scheduled to move into the Caracol-EKAM and  DLA 1.5 settlements as early as July 2013, a beneficiary  agreement has not yet been finalized, and the exact amount and  structure of the monthly payments remain uncertain. USAID  officials have said that a contract, or occupancy agreement, will be  signed before beneficiaries move in. Fees for utilities and services  may or may not be rolled into, collected, and paid through these  monthly housing payments. The monthly housing payment  structure may be flat or tiered, meaning amounts may be set at a  flat rate for every household or may be progressive depending on  income level.", "Electricity: USAID plans to install electricity, with individual meters,  in each new house. USAID officials acknowledged that non- payment for electricity is a fairly common practice in parts of Haiti  where electrical grids exist. Therefore, it remains to be seen  whether the practice of non-payment may also be a challenge at  the new settlement locations.", "Sewage: Prior to the January 2010 earthquake, there were no  wastewater treatment plants in Haiti. A temporary facility has been  constructed at the CIP and there are plans to build a permanent  facility there as well. In addition, a treatment plant was opened in  May 2012 near the Port-au-Prince metro area. These facilities  may be able to serve some settlements, but it is unclear if they will  be able to serve all of the facilities and at what cost to beneficiary  households. One senior USAID official acknowledged that if septic  tanks are not emptied regularly, there is a potential for a public  health risk.", "Community management: The New Settlements program currently  plans to create eight new \u201ccommunities,\u201d of between 148 to 1,283  households, each with beneficiaries from various locations in Haiti and  with varied income levels. USAID officials acknowledged concerns  about issues that might arise among the beneficiaries themselves and  between the settlement and surrounding communities.", "Shantytowns: There is a risk that informal dwellings, or shantytowns,  may be built around the new settlements to take advantage of the  economic opportunities or services available near those locations. If  employment opportunities at the CIP draw a large number of people,  the current housing stock may be too low to accommodate them.", "To mitigate these types of site-specific sustainability concerns, USAID  obligated $4.8 million for development of the Emergency Capacity  Assistance Program to establish community management committees,  self-governing bodies made up of selected beneficiaries, and to create  other mechanisms intended to support community development. To  address issues related to affordability, USAID, through this assistance  program, worked to ensure that the household income and employment  status were criteria addressed in the beneficiary selection process. To  address other issues, USAID planned for the community management  committees to promote social cohesion, to serve as a decision-making  body, and to act as the residents\u2019 representatives with government  counterparts. At the Caracol-EKAM settlement, a provisional community  management committee was formed and will be trained to engage with  local and national authorities to help ensure that community services such  as grounds keeping, infrastructure maintenance, and solid waste  collection are undertaken. However, funding for ECAP only allowed for  some of these initial activities to take place at the Caracol-EKAM  settlement, and, according to officials, the program ended in April 2013.", "USAID allocated $5 million to support community development efforts at  the new settlements. In April 2013, USAID issued a request for  applications to find an implementing partner for a community  development program for Caracol-EKAM, at an estimated cost of $1.3 to  $1.5 million. This partner would provide support for the phased  occupation and management of the settlement and engage in an array of  activities designed to help ensure its long\u2010term sustainability. Although  still in the planning stage, USAID\u2019s current budget indicates over half of  the community development funds will go toward assisting just three  sites, including Caracol-EKAM. The remaining five or more settlement  sites face the possibility of delayed or reduced support. To address that  gap, USAID plans to foster partnerships with other organizations to assist  and contribute to these activities. USAID has entered into such a  partnership with the International Federation of the Red Cross to provide  community development support at DLA 1.5. Additionally, in a  memorandum of understanding between USAID and partner donors, it is  noted that partner donor funds are to be provided for community  development activities at those settlements; however that understanding  does not fully secure such a financial commitment. Similarly, according to  USAID officials, the agreement USAID is attempting to finalize with the  Red Cross will budget for community development activities to be  covered with Red Cross funds. However, there is the possibility that such  partnerships will not be available to support all the settlements. USAID  officials responsible for key parts of the New Settlements program have  stated that it is crucial to have these support mechanisms in place to  ensure a smooth transition when beneficiaries move in, to set the tone for  interaction among beneficiaries moving forward, and to ensure that  community management needs are understood and acted upon.  Furthermore, USAID documents state that it is critical to initiate the  beneficiary organization process as soon as beneficiaries occupy their  homes because it may be difficult to work with beneficiaries before they  arrive. Failure to find an implementing partner to provide and create these  support mechanisms for each settlement may further increase the  sustainability risks inherent in large-scale housing reconstruction projects,  thus endangering the significant investments already committed to these  efforts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Following the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the U.S. government  made a strong commitment to Haiti\u2019s reconstruction and economic  development.

The power plant was completed in  time to provide electricity for the CIP\u2019s first tenant, in part because the  USAID mission in Haiti had on staff a senior energy advisor to help plan  and oversee the project. However, the mission has not filled an equivalent  position to oversee the port project and has experienced delays and  challenges associated with this significant project. The USAID mission  continues to lack technical port expertise to oversee this project to which  more than $72 million in U.S. funding has been allocated, is at least 2  years behind schedule, and has been found to be more complex than  initially envisioned. Further, USAID\u2019s contribution to port construction was  not intended to fund the entire port, and it is unclear whether the Haitian  government will be able to find a private sector company willing to  contribute the large amount of remaining funding through a public-private  partnership. This uncertainty puts at risk USAID\u2019s investments in port  planning and design, as well as the sustainability of the CIP and power  plant due to the three projects\u2019 interdependence.", "USAID developed the budget and projected targets of the New  Settlements program using faulty and inaccurate cost estimates, which  has led to a significantly reduced number of USAID-funded houses for the  Haitian people. USAID agreed to the Haitian government\u2019s request to  enlarge and upgrade the houses, further reducing the number of houses it  would build. As a result, USAID currently has plans to provide less than a  quarter of the houses it originally projected it would build, and at a much  greater cost. Difficulties in securing land title and challenges in  establishing partnerships with NGOs also delayed and further reduced  USAID\u2019s targets. Furthermore, the sustainability of USAID\u2019s New  Settlement program is uncertain. The agency has dedicated some  funding to help ensure sustainability through the development of  community support mechanisms; however, it is unclear if funding for  these support mechanisms will be available for each new settlement. In  addition, USAID has taken steps to secure commitments for partner  donor funding to assist in these efforts, but has not yet secured such  commitments for all planned settlements and it is uncertain whether the  partner organizations will be able to fulfill their commitments.

When reviewing these studies,  reports, and calculations, we noted the methodologies used and any  potential limitations those methodologies may have had on their findings.  To ascertain the IDB\u2019s progress in building the CIP, we performed a site  visit at the CIP in December 2012, interviewed the CIP\u2019s construction  manager, and received a tour of the Sae-A facility. In addition, we  received copies of more recent photos and videos of the CIP that were  taken by IDB staff in January 2013. To determine the Haitian  government\u2019s progress in filling the CIP with tenants, we met with State\u2019s  Senior Advisor for Industrial Development in Haiti who works with the  Haitian government to recruit companies to the CIP to learn about the  recruitment process and its progress. From this State official, we also  received documents containing summaries of information about new and  potential tenants to the CIP.", "To describe USAID\u2019s progress with the CIP power plant, we reviewed  plans for the power plant as outlined in the September 2011 Activity  Approval Document (AAD) for the Haitian energy sector and compared  these plans with the time frames, costs, and descriptions of the power  plant project in award documents and amendments, as well as progress  reports from the construction contractor. We also interviewed USAID and  State officials in Washington, D.C., and Haiti to determine the reasons for  any differences between planned and actual costs and time frames. To  describe how USAID assessed the power plant project for its  environmental and social impact, we reviewed the June 2011  environmental assessment of the CIP that a USAID contractor had  performed. To determine how USAID followed up on mitigation measures  suggested in this environmental assessment, we interviewed USAID  officials and reviewed contracts for building, overseeing the construction  of, and operating and maintaining the power plant, as well as progress  reports from the construction and oversight contractors that included  updates on the mitigation measures being taken. To determine the  planning and progress made regarding electricity distribution from the CIP  power plant to residences and businesses outside the CIP, we  interviewed USAID officials and reviewed USAID planning documents,  the cooperative agreement for initial power distribution outside the CIP,  and progress reports from the nongovernmental organization (NGO)  responsible for this distribution.", "To describe USAID\u2019s progress with a new port for the Cap-Ha\u00eftien  corridor, we reviewed plans for the port such as those articulated in the  most recent draft of the AAD for the Haitian port sector dated August  2011, in procurement documents for the port feasibility study, and in  interviews with USAID and State officials. We then reviewed the port  feasibility study and interviewed USAID officials on the process and  results of that study to determine USAID\u2019s progress against its initial  plans.", "To describe USAID\u2019s progress constructing permanent houses under its  New Settlements program, we reviewed plans as outlined in the August  2011 AAD and compared these plans with the time frames, costs, and  descriptions of the New Settlements program in design packages, award  documents and amendments, and progress reports from various site  preparation and construction contractors. We also interviewed USAID and  State officials in Washington, D.C., and Haiti to determine the reasons for  any differences between planned and actual costs, time frames, and  expected results. We calculated the weighted average cost of  construction per plot and per house by (1) calculating the total cost of plot  and house construction for the two sites that had awarded contracts, (2)  calculating the total number of plots and houses at both sites, and (3)  dividing the first number by the second. For the initial average cost per  plot, we used data on costs and numbers of plots and houses at each site  obtained from initial contracts. For the revised average cost per plot, we  used data on costs and numbers of plots and houses at each site  obtained from modifications to the initial contract. To discuss the role of  NGOs and other partner donors in the New Settlements program, we  reviewed various documents related to partners who had planned or  committed to building houses on USAID-developed sites. We interviewed  a partner organization housed with the Haitian government and funded by  the IDB; however, we were unable to interview other potential partner  NGOs because negotiations over the terms of agreements were ongoing.  In addition, we interviewed the implementers responsible for a  cooperative agreement with USAID related to community development  and beneficiary selection efforts for the New Settlements program and  reviewed the beneficiary selection data they had gathered for the  Caracol-EKAM site.", "To determine the sustainability of the power plant, port, and new  settlements, the definition of sustainability we use is based on the  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development definition,  which defines \u201csustainability\u201d as \u201cthe continuation of benefits from a  development intervention (such as assets, skills, facilities, or improved  services) after major development assistance has been completed.\u201d We  operationalized this definition by specifying that sustainability is the ability  of the Haitian government to operate and maintain the USAID-funded  power plant, port, and new settlements in such a condition as is required  to produce the projected benefits. To determine issues that may affect the  sustainability of these three projects, we reviewed reports commissioned  by agencies and organizations, such as USAID, State, the International  Finance Corporation, the World Bank, and the U.S. Trade and  Development Agency, on the Haitian energy, port, and shelter sectors.  We reviewed procurement documents, assessments, and progress  reports related to these specific projects. We also interviewed USAID  officials to understand their key sustainability concerns for these projects.", "We traveled to Haiti in December 2012 and met with U.S. officials from  USAID and State, and representatives from some of USAID\u2019s partners  involved in implementing the projects in our review\u2014including the IDB,  Sae-A, and construction firms and partner donors involved in the New  Settlements program. In the Cap-Ha\u00eftien corridor, we visited the CIP, the  CIP power plant, one of the sites for the proposed port, and all New  Settlement sites under construction or planned for future construction. In  the Port-au-Prince corridor, we visited the New Settlement sites under  construction and planned for future consideration, sites where temporary  shelters were built, and sites damaged by the earthquake.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2012 through June  2013 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the U.S. Agency for International Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Leslie Holen (Assistant Director),  Lynn Cothern, Heather Latta, George Taylor, and Brian Tremblay made  key contributions to this report.
