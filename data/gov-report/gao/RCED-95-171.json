U.S. producers, importers, and others handling a variety of agricultural products pay millions of dollars annually for promotion and research programs to increase domestic and foreign sales of these products. The programs, authorized by individual federal laws, are known as check-off programs because of the way they are funded: A small amount is deducted from the revenues that producers and/or other members of an industry receive from the sale of their products. The programs are operated by check-off boards, such as the National Dairy Promotion and Research Board. The Secretary of Agriculture appoints the board members from candidates nominated by industry. Many other countries also have agricultural marketing organizations that conduct agricultural promotion and research activities. As the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) reduces export subsidies and domestic price supports and increases access to protected markets, the check-off programs may become a more important tool for enhancing agricultural competitiveness in both domestic and foreign markets.", "Specifically, this report provides information on (1) how U.S. check-off programs are organized and what kinds of activities they carry out, (2) what factors the check-off boards consider in planning future program activities, and (3) how comparable marketing organizations in Australia, Germany, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom are organized and carry out their activities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Generic promotion and research programs funded through voluntary check-off contributions have existed at the local, state, and regional levels for more than 50 years. These programs were developed to expand the market for the agricultural products of a given industry. To facilitate better coordination across states, encourage equitable participation from all those who benefit from these programs, and create a larger funding base, agricultural industry groups began to seek federal legislative authority to establish mandatory national programs. The first federally authorized program was enacted in 1954, but the majority were created during the 1980s and 1990s. Of the 19 programs that have been authorized, 15 are currently active and 4 are inactive. Industry members who would pay the assessments must approve the creation of a check-off program in a referendum. Legislation for all check-off programs also provides industry members with an opportunity to terminate the program through a referendum.", "The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), through its Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), is responsible for (1) developing regulations to implement these check-off programs, in consultation with the affected industry, and (2) ensuring compliance with the authorizing legislation and the agency\u2019s related orders. AMS reviews each board\u2019s budgets, projects, and contracts to ensure that the board does not engage in prohibited activities, such as lobbying. Boards reimburse AMS for its oversight costs.", "Generally, USDA does not review the effectiveness of the programs. However, the legislation authorizing the Dairy Board requires the Secretary of Agriculture to submit an annual report to the Congress that includes an independent analysis of the Dairy Board\u2019s effectiveness. In addition, USDA\u2019s Foreign Agricultural Service requires evaluations of the check-off projects that receive funding from its Market Promotion Program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Check-Off Programs\u2019 Organizational Structures and Activities Vary Considerably", "paragraphs": ["The six check-off programs vary organizationally and in the emphasis given to, and methods used to carry out, promotion and research activities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Check-Off Programs Differ in the Way They Are Organized and Conduct Business", "paragraphs": ["The programs we reviewed vary in the composition of their governing boards, methods used to assess industry members, and ways the programs are initiated and terminated. (See app. I for more detailed information on each board reviewed.)", "The authorizing legislation for each program specifies the composition of the check-off board. These boards vary by the groups represented\u2014that is, producers, importers, and consumer advisers or public representatives\u2014and by size. For example, the Beef Board has 101 producers and 6 importers on its board, and the Egg Board has 18 producers and their alternates. Board membership generally reflects a geographical mix of the producers assessed and can be changed administratively in some cases to reflect shifts in production. Some boards\u2014Cotton, Egg, and Potato\u2014are authorized to include consumer advisers or public representatives. Members of the boards are appointed for 2- or 3-year terms.", "The authorizing legislation for each program also sets an assessment level and specifies who in the industry should be assessed. However, these legislative provisions vary in the (1) methods used to calculate the assessment, (2) assessment of imports, (3) refunding of assessments, (4) process for revising assessment rates, (5) arrangements for giving credit to producers for contributions made to qualified state and regional check-off programs, and (6) methods for terminating the program.", "As table 1 shows, the six check-off boards we reviewed used several assessment methods.", "Smaller-volume producers are exempt from assessments for two of the six programs\u2014egg and potato. The authorizing legislation for three of the check-off programs\u2014beef, dairy, and soybean\u2014gives credit to producers for contributions they make to qualified state or regional check-off programs. The Egg and Cotton boards have provided funds to state and regional groups, although they are not required to do so. Finally, three of the six programs we reviewed\u2014beef, cotton, and potato\u2014assess importers.", "In the past, many check-off programs allowed those who had been assessed but did not wish to participate in the program to request refunds of the assessment they had paid. However, most refund provisions have been eliminated. Of the six programs reviewed, only the soybean program continues to offer refunds of up to a maximum of 10 percent of the assessments collected from producers in each state. By statute, USDA must poll soybean producers to see if they want a referendum held to determine support for the refund policy. Such a poll is scheduled for July 1995.", "The check-off programs we reviewed also differ in their requirements for revising assessment rates. The programs with fixed rates\u2014beef, dairy, and soybean\u2014must have their rates revised by statutory amendment, while the other programs\u2014cotton, eggs, and potatoes\u2014can have their rates revised administratively within their statutory ceiling. For the egg program, any increase must be approved by referendum.", "All programs have termination provisions that enable producers voting in a referendum to terminate the program. The soybean program provides for periodically polling producers to determine whether they want to have a referendum on continuing the program. The dairy program is unique in that it allows dairy cooperatives to cast bloc votes for their members. However, members are given an opportunity to vote individually if they disagree with their cooperative\u2019s position. Legislation was introduced in January 1995 in the Senate that would eliminate the dairy program\u2019s bloc voting process because of concerns about whether it is fair and equitable. In addition, this proposed legislation would require that the Dairy Board periodically determine producers\u2019 support for the program. No action has been taken to date on this legislation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Check-Off Boards Place Different Emphasis on Promotion, Research, and Information Activities", "paragraphs": ["The six boards vary considerably in the emphasis placed on, and methods used to carry out promotion (domestic and export), research, and consumer and industry information activities. (See apps. II and III for more information on the use of funds and the activities conducted by the six check-off boards.)", "Five of the six boards spent most of their fiscal year 1994 funds\u2014ranging from about 56 percent for the Egg Board to 75 percent for the Potato Board\u2014promoting agricultural products, principally in the domestic market. The Soybean Board does not promote products in the domestic retail market. However, it does provide information to domestic consumers on the use of soybean products. The boards relied on a mix of methods\u2014television and radio advertising, print media, in-store promotions, and industry newsletters\u2014to communicate their messages to various audiences. The boards also targeted their promotions to certain consumer or industry groups. The three major types of intended audiences were consumers, the food service industry (restaurants and institutions), and manufacturers.", "The boards also use different advertising methods for various target audiences. For example, the Beef, Cotton, Dairy, and Egg boards have devoted a considerable portion of their promotion budgets to television advertising campaigns intended to influence consumers. Additionally, the Egg Board has used radio tie-ins with major networks to deliver its national campaign message. Promotional efforts have included such campaigns as the Egg Board\u2019s \u201cI Love Eggs\u201d and the Beef Board\u2019s \u201cBeef. It\u2019s What\u2019s For Dinner.\u201d In contrast, the Potato Board\u2019s 1993 consumer advertising concentrated on print advertisements in national magazines.", "The boards also differ in the emphasis they place on developing foreign markets; funding for export promotion activities ranged from less than 1 percent for the Egg Board to 29 percent for the Soybean Board. In addition, the boards have participated either directly or through related industry contractor organizations in the Foreign Agricultural Service\u2019s export promotion programs\u2014the Market Promotion Program and/or the Foreign Market Development Program. These programs provide funds for projects to promote exports through supermarket promotions, nutritional information, and technical assistance. Federal funding for these two programs has decreased over the past few years from about $237 million authorized in fiscal year 1992 to about $134 million authorized in fiscal year 1994.", "The percentage of fiscal year 1994 funds spent on research activities and the types of research also varied among the six boards. The percent of check-off funds spent on research varied among the boards, with the Cotton Board being the highest at about 24 percent. Research efforts of the Beef, Dairy, and Egg boards have focused primarily on nutrition education and product development. However, other boards, such as the Cotton and Soybean boards, focus their research efforts on production enhancement and product development. These efforts have included the Soybean Board\u2019s production research on altering the genetic composition of soybeans and product development research on identifying and developing new uses for soybeans, such as soy ink and SoyDiesel fuel. In some cases, the authorizing legislation for a board prohibits it from conducting certain types of research. For example, the Dairy and Beef boards are prohibited from engaging in production research activities.", "In addition to promotion and research, the six boards spend funds to provide educational information to consumers and industry. In 1994, funds spent in this way ranged from about 1 percent for the Cotton Board to about 30 percent for the Soybean Board. Consumer information involves activities to provide product information to consumers through groups that influence consumers, such as educators, dieticians, physicians, and food manufacturers. These efforts have included the Egg Board\u2019s distribution of educational kits to kindergarten through sixth grade classroom teachers across the United States. These kits contain lessons and activities about food safety, nutrition, and product characteristics. Industry information efforts have included the Beef Board\u2019s distribution of information to commercial meat buyers in the marketing chain to help them in purchasing trimmed beef while maintaining an acceptable profit margin."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Check-Off Boards Plan Activities Using Market Research, Evaluation, and Coordination", "paragraphs": ["In planning future activities, check-off boards rely heavily on market research and program evaluation.

This market research consists of a variety of efforts, including measuring changes in consumers\u2019 attitude and behavior toward a board\u2019s products, assessing consumers\u2019 attitudes toward a board\u2019s advertising campaigns, and identifying new uses and markets for a board\u2019s products, including export markets. The boards also obtain market research on the views of other groups, such as health and food service professionals, that may affect demand for the product.", "While only the Dairy Board is legislatively required to evaluate its program\u2019s activities, all the check-off programs we reviewed evaluate their activities using market research, and some use econometric studies.These evaluations were for specific projects as well as the overall program. Evaluations may occur during a project as well as upon its completion. We did not assess the evaluation methods used by the six check-off boards.", "In addition to other evaluation methods, the Dairy and Beef boards use independently prepared econometric studies to help them measure the effectiveness of their domestic programs. As part of its statutorily required annual report on the effectiveness of the dairy program, USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service prepares an annual econometric report on the impact of the board\u2019s advertising on the sales of two major dairy products\u2014fluid milk and cheese. Similarly, the Beef Board prepares a biennial econometric report on the impact of its program on beef prices and calculates the return on each dollar invested.", "Check-off boards use several methods to evaluate the effectiveness of their export programs, including feedback from trade shows, consumer surveys, and promotion reports. In addition, board-sponsored export promotion activities that receive federal funding must comply with the Foreign Agricultural Service\u2019s evaluation requirements.", "In 1993, we reported that USDA had evaluated few of the Market Promotion Program\u2019s activities. However, our December 1994 report noted that USDA now attempts to measure the effectiveness of activities funded under the Market Promotion Program by selectively evaluating the results of participants\u2019 ongoing activities against measurable goals provided in the participants\u2019 funding proposals. USDA has developed a methodology to identify activities that have not been effective in expanding or maintaining market share.

These national boards coordinate with the state and regional boards to ensure that their efforts complement each other and achieve maximum impact. In addition, the boards plan future work with input from manufacturers, universities, and related trade groups.", "The joint efforts take a variety of forms. For example, the Beef Board obtains comments on its preliminary annual plan from state beef boards, with which it shares assessment revenues, and other industry-related groups. As an incentive for state groups to participate in the Egg Board\u2019s \u201cI Love Eggs\u201d national campaign, the Egg Board agreed to pay a portion of the state industry group\u2019s radio advertising costs for most of 1994.", "Check-off boards share marketing and research-related information with state and other organizations through monthly newsletters, annual reports, data bases, and periodic meetings. This arrangement helps ensure more efficient use of resources and avoid duplication of effort. For example, the Potato Board shares monthly briefing information and promotional material and holds an annual meeting with state program managers. Similarly, the Dairy Board has established a market research data base that it shares with related industry groups.", "In addition, the Dairy Board has formed a cooperative effort with a related industry group, and the Beef Board plans to work with a new industry group. In 1994, the Dairy Board and the United Dairy Industry Association undertook a cooperative effort, Dairy Management Incorporated, to formalize joint planning and funding between the two organizations. A beef industry oversight committee, in which the Beef Board participates, is recommending that two of the board\u2019s major contractors\u2014the National Cattlemen\u2019s Association and the National Live Stock and Meat Board\u2014be consolidated.

For example, Germany\u2019s Central Marketing Organization of German Agricultural Industries (CMA) promotes most agricultural products in both domestic and export markets. The United Kingdom\u2019s Food From Britain also promotes British food and drink products primarily in export markets.

In Germany, while government representatives are not on CMA\u2019s board, they participate in a supervisory board that helps guide CMA\u2019s activities.", "The assessment methods used by the marketing organizations in the four countries we reviewed also differed from the methods used by the U.S. check-off boards. While the foreign programs\u2019 assessment rates were generally a fixed dollar amount per unit or volume sold, like the U.S. programs\u2019 assessment rates, the foreign rates can generally be revised with the approval of the Minister of Agriculture and do not require statutory amendment. In addition, while the U.S. check-off boards we reviewed assess producers, the United Kingdom\u2019s Meat and Livestock Commission assesses slaughterhouses and exporters as well as producers. Unlike some U.S. check-off boards that assess imported products, only 1 of the 19 foreign marketing organizations we reviewed assessed imported products. Furthermore, smaller-volume producers are generally not exempted from paying required assessments, as they sometimes are in the United States; refunds of assessments are not permitted; and the programs cannot be terminated through a referendum. According to officials of the marketing organizations we reviewed, only national legislation can terminate their programs.", "Some foreign marketing organizations receive significant funding from sources other than mandatory industry assessments. The United Kingdom\u2019s Food From Britain receives about 60 percent of its funds from the government, and the remainder comes from industry contributions and user fees. New Zealand\u2019s organizations may receive partial government funding for some research projects.

Some foreign competitors have a long history of exporting and have developed significant expertise in market development activities. This greater emphasis on exports may give foreign producers a competitive advantage in the global marketplace.", "In this context, a more vigorous export focus would seem to be in the interest of U.S. promotion and research boards. On the other hand, foreign countries now have increased access to some U.S. markets that were previously protected from import competition.

For example, the Dairy Research and Development Corporation manages research and development for the dairy industry and receives an assessment of $0.013 per kilogram of butterfat produced, while the Australian Dairy Corporation receives $0.0377 per kilogram of milkfat produced for promotional activities.", "In addition to representation on some boards, government involvement in board activities ranged from simple oversight to direct economic support of research and promotional activities. The government matches each industry\u2019s research and development assessment funds up to a maximum of 0.5 percent of the industry\u2019s gross value of production.

Because of this economic situation, the Australian government is not providing as much direct financial assistance to its agricultural sector as it once did. The government used to shield its farmers from the uncertainty of world markets by providing price supports and other financial assistance. Now, government assistance typically takes the form of export market development grants and trade enhancement programs rather than price supports. Price supports still exist in the dairy industry but are funded by a market support assessment on milk producers.", "Since agricultural industries must focus more on market forces than ever before, promotional and research activities have assumed a greater role. Agricultural producer boards, which are statutory marketing authorities, participate in these activities. In addition, the Australian Dairy Corporation and the Australian Wheat Board can purchase and sell products. While all boards engage in typical marketing activities, such as trade shows, point-of-sale promotions, and advertising, some practice more nontraditional marketing techniques. For example, the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation participates in the Australian Government Officials\u2019 Scheme, through which Australian embassies and consulates purchase domestic wine for official functions, thus increasing the product\u2019s exposure.", "Australian marketing organizations also carry out other activities not generally conducted by U.S. check-off boards, such as setting quality standards for the industry and issuing export licenses. In addition, they invest in other ventures, which allow them to diversify their holdings and further expand their export businesses. For example, the Australian Dairy Corporation wholly controls Austdairy, a subsidiary that turned a profit of $1.33 million in fiscal year 1993-94.

Historically, trade has been concentrated on outputs from the land. The most significant productive use of land has always been agriculture. New Zealand\u2019s producer marketing boards, which began forming in the 1920s, are among the oldest and best known government-sponsored institutions. Originally they were given broad legislative authority to negotiate freight rates and insurance charges, stabilize domestic prices through product acquisition, even out seasonal peaks in produce shipping, coordinate export promotion, and conduct other activities to improve grower returns. In the mid-1980s, as part of a widespread deregulation of key sectors of its economy, New Zealand abolished more than 30 agricultural production and export subsidy programs. As a result, New Zealand farmers lost nearly 40 percent of their gross income and had to become more responsive to the market. This deregulation also changed the fundamental role of the boards and caused them to reevaluate their operations and marketing strategies and to implement new initiatives.", "The seven New Zealand marketing organizations we reviewed were (1) the New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board, (2) the New Zealand Dairy Board, (3) the New Zealand Game Industry Board, (4) the New Zealand Horticulture Export Authority, (5) the New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board, (6) the New Zealand Meat Producers Board, and (7) Wools of New Zealand (formerly the New Zealand Wool Board).

However, through its Public Good Science Fund, the New Zealand government remains the dominant supplier of research funds. Research priorities and requirements are established by a joint government and private sector board. Funding for agreed-upon projects is disbursed on the basis of bids received.
