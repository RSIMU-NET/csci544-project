Under the medium-specific approach, permits are issued and inspections are conducted for pollution released to each medium. Although these programs have significantly improved the condition of the environment, concerns have been raised that the medium-specific approach encourages \u201cend-of-the-pipe\u201d pollution controls to treat, store, or dispose of waste, rather than encouraging pollution prevention. In addition, some industry representatives believe that having a different set of requirements for each medium increases the cost and the complexity of compliance with environmental programs.", "Environmental agencies in Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey have experimented with multimedia, or integrated, approaches to environmental management as alternatives to the traditional medium-specific approach. The integrated approaches used in these three states focus to varying degrees on a whole industrial facility and all of its sources of pollution. Proponents believe that integrated approaches will encourage pollution prevention, reduce compliance costs to industry, and make environmental programs more efficient. In its recent review of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Academy of Public Administration concluded that EPA should move toward integrating its responsibilities under various statutes to provide the maximum flexibility needed to effectively meet environmental priorities.", "Because of your interest in environmental management, you asked us to review (1) the approaches used in Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey; (2) state and industry experience with these approaches; and (3) EPA\u2019s role in these efforts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 established the national policy that pollution prevention, as opposed to pollution control, is the preferred method of addressing the nation\u2019s pollution problems. The act also specified that reduction of pollution at its source (source reduction) is the preferred method to prevent pollution and should be used whenever possible. Source reduction includes modifying equipment, technology, processes, or procedures; reformulating or redesigning products; substituting raw materials; and improving operations and maintenance.", "EPA generally delegates responsibility for the day-to-day implementation of environmental programs to state agencies that perform a variety of regulatory functions. Examples of regulatory functions include issuing permits to limit facilities\u2019 emissions, conducting inspections, and taking enforcement actions against violators. States may also provide nonregulatory technical assistance, public education, and outreach activities to industry. Because many of the nation\u2019s environmental statutes are medium-specific, state environmental agencies and EPA have traditionally been organized around separate medium-specific program offices.", "State program offices receive federal grants under environmental laws, such as the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Each state program office has traditionally conducted its own regulatory activities and reported them to EPA. Program offices within a state may have had little contact with each other. For example, an air inspector may not know whether a facility is complying with hazardous waste or water regulations or what impact a required remedial action is likely to have on releases to other media. Most of EPA\u2019s funding for state environmental programs has also traditionally been medium-specific, although in recent years EPA has provided some funding for the states\u2019 multimedia activities.", "Managing the states\u2019 regulatory functions to cut across medium-specific program lines is a recent phenomenon. In 1991, the New Jersey legislature directed that state\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection to conduct a pilot project. In 1992, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation began integrating its environmental programs by using a facility-management approach, under which the agency assigned a team and a \u201cfacility manager\u201d employed by the state to coordinate environmental programs at targeted facilities. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection began testing multimedia pollution prevention inspections in 1989 and in 1993 adopted the approach statewide. Other states, such as Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin, have taken steps to integrate their regulatory activities, but their efforts have been either very recent or limited in scope.", "Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey have moved toward integrating their regulatory activities to promote the use of pollution prevention strategies, particularly source reduction, rather than strategies that rely on pollution control. Pollution control methods include installing devices that treat waste after it has been produced. The three states have also sought to address problems arising from fragmented, medium-specific approaches to environmental management, such as pollution shifting, whereby equipment intended to control pollution in one medium merely transfers pollutants to another medium rather than reducing or eliminating them at the source."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Each State Has Chosen a Different Approach to Integration", "paragraphs": ["Each of the three states has taken a different approach to integrating its regulatory activities (see table 1). Massachusetts conducts multimedia, facilitywide inspections instead of numerous medium-specific inspections. The state also coordinates its enforcement activities to address violations in all media. New York coordinates the activities of its separate medium-specific environmental programs and targets its efforts at the firms generating most of the state\u2019s toxic discharges. New Jersey is testing the use of facilitywide permits, which would replace a facility\u2019s medium-specific permits with a single permit governing the facility\u2019s releases to all media. Although the three states have taken different approaches to integrating regulatory activities, each state looks at whole facilities and their production processes to identify opportunities to prevent pollution.", "All three states plan to evaluate the environmental outcomes of integrating environmental management. Although they have just begun to develop evaluation plans, the data needed to fully evaluate their initiatives will not be available for some time. On the basis of their experiences thus far, officials in Massachusetts and New York generally consider the integrated approaches in their states to be successful, while New Jersey officials believe that it is too early to predict the success of that state\u2019s permitting test."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Massachusetts Uses Facilitywide Inspection and Enforcement", "paragraphs": ["In contrast to the medium-specific inspections most states use to assess whether a facility\u2019s releases to a specific medium comply with state and EPA regulations, Massachusetts has developed a multimedia approach that incorporates inspections for all media into a single, facilitywide inspection that focuses on a facility\u2019s production processes. Inspectors follow the flow of materials used in the production processes and the inputs and outputs of each process. At each step of a process, an inspector identifies areas of regulatory concern and opportunities to prevent pollution. EPA Region I helped Massachusetts develop the single, unified inspection procedure used by that state\u2019s inspectors.", "Massachusetts began testing its facilitywide approach to inspection and enforcement in 1989 and then implemented it statewide in 1993. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection annually conducts about 1,000 inspections at the approximately 20,000 facilities in the state that are subject to facilitywide inspections. To support this approach, the Department reorganized its Bureau of Waste Prevention, which had been organized with separate air, waste, and water sections, each of which had performed its own compliance, enforcement, and permitting activities. In field offices, these sections were replaced by a combined section for compliance and enforcement and a separate section for permits. The Bureau did not eliminate medium-specific units in the central office because the medium-specific nature of federal environmental statutes necessitated some corresponding organization. Instead, the Department established an Office of Program Integration to coordinate these medium-specific units and foster pollution prevention.", "Massachusetts\u2019s enforcement actions encompass violations in all media and encourage violators to use source reduction techniques to achieve compliance. When notifying a facility of any violation, the state encourages the facility to implement any specific opportunities for source reduction that the state inspector has identified and informs the facility that the state\u2019s Office of Technical Assistance can assist in identifying and pursuing additional opportunities for source reduction. The state also forwards a copy of all enforcement documents to the Office of Technical Assistance, which in turn contacts the facility to offer free, confidential assistance. When serious violations and large penalties are involved, the state may negotiate agreements requiring facilities to undertake pollution prevention measures in exchange for reduced penalties.", "In addition to its multimedia inspections, Massachusetts recently tested facilitywide permits that incorporate pollution prevention by combining the various permits issued to a facility for each medium into a single permit. According to a state official, Massachusetts ended this test because of a lack of participation by the business community, which apparently believed that a permit process with a pollution prevention component would be more complicated than the existing permit process, which was focused exclusively on pollution control."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Although Program Is Not Yet Fully Evaluated, Massachusetts Believes It Is a Success", "paragraphs": ["Under a fiscal year 1995 multimedia demonstration grant from EPA, Massachusetts is required to evaluate the results of its integrated management efforts. After fiscal year 1995, Massachusetts plans to develop and test a number of \u201cenvironmental-yield\u201d indicators, such as the number of unregistered waste streams discovered and waste streams eliminated as well as the amount of emissions reduced. During the next few years, the state plans to assess the effectiveness of its integrated program by measuring the extent to which pollution has been reduced at its source.", "Massachusetts officials believe that the implementation of the state\u2019s facilitywide inspection approach has improved the state\u2019s enforcement program. They reported that facilitywide inspections have successfully found sources of pollution that had not been registered or permitted, promoted pollution prevention, and encouraged companies to seek technical assistance from the state. According to state officials, facilitywide inspections have streamlined the regulatory process by replacing numerous single-medium inspections with one multimedia inspection at most facilities.", "However, the transition from medium-specific to facilitywide inspections has been challenging. It has required inspectors, previously knowledgeable about a single environmental statute, to become familiar with multiple statutes, techniques to prevent pollution, and industry\u2019s manufacturing processes. According to state officials, inspectors have found it difficult to keep abreast of regulations in numerous environmental programs, as well as the latest strategies to prevent pollution. As a result, some inspectors are concerned that they may overlook compliance problems outside their area of expertise. In a 1994 report on the state\u2019s enforcement program, EPA praised the program\u2019s emphasis on pollution prevention but questioned whether inspectors were focusing on pollution prevention to the detriment of taking enforcement actions. The report noted, however, that the state had begun an enforcement training course that stressed the importance of stronger enforcement actions.", "In addition, Massachusetts has found that facilitywide inspections are unworkable at the state\u2019s largest, most complex facilities, which constitute five percent of the firms it inspects. According to a state official, the state uses a single-medium approach at these facilities because facilitywide inspections at these facilities take too long, require too many inspectors, and demand too much expertise."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New York Uses a Facility-Management Approach", "paragraphs": ["New York is pursuing integrated environmental management by coordinating its medium-specific activities. In 1992, New York started to target its regulatory activities at the approximately 400 facilities that produced about 95 percent of the state\u2019s toxic discharges. The state still performs single-medium program activities, such as inspections and permitting, but state officials coordinate these activities to provide an integrated approach at targeted plants. To coordinate activities at each of these plants, New York has assigned employees of its Department of Environmental Conservation as facility managers at 94 plants. According to a state official, however, it will likely take more than the originally planned 10 years before New York will be able to assign a facility manager to each of its 400 targeted facilities.", "The facility manager serves as the primary point of contact between the state and a plant. Working with a team of inspectors and other technical staff, the facility manager plans and oversees inspections, enforcement, and other regulatory activities at the facility. For example, the facility manager guides team members in developing a profile of the facility that includes permit data, compliance history, and other information chronicling the plant\u2019s emission and waste-handling practices. In doing so, the facility manager can assess what is needed to enhance the facility\u2019s efforts to prevent pollution.", "Because developing the expertise needed to perform multimedia inspections is difficult, New York requires its inspectors to perform only medium-specific inspections. However, the facility managers coordinate these inspections to provide an integrated inspection approach. As the liaison between the state and the facility, each facility manager must work closely with company officials. One facility manager pointed out that an advantage of this relationship is that the facility manager can sometimes convince the company to implement pollution prevention strategies without enforcement actions.", "New York uses enforcement actions as an opportunity to require a company to undertake projects to prevent multimedia pollution. For example, after identifying environmental violations by a chemical manufacturer, the state negotiated a multimedia consent order requiring the manufacturer to adopt air, water, and other compliance measures and to fund an employee from the Department of Environmental Conservation to assist the facility manager by serving as a full-time monitor at that facility. A consent order at another facility required the company to fund a monitor and develop a chemical-specific pollution prevention program with specified reduction goals. New York also allows companies to reduce their penalties for violating environmental laws by performing actions that provide environmental benefits, such as contributing to emergency preparedness programs for toxic spills.", "In addition to coordinating inspection and enforcement activities, New York plans to test the use of integrated permits at 3 or 4 of the 400 targeted facilities. Initial testing has begun at one facility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Although Challenges Remain, New York Believes Program Is a Success", "paragraphs": ["According to New York officials, the state\u2019s facility-management approach has improved the efficiency of its regulatory activities while simplifying the facilities\u2019 compliance activities. New York\u2019s approach operates more efficiently because each facility manager coordinates all of the state\u2019s regulatory activities and the various inspectors approach each facility as a team. One facility manager said New York\u2019s approach has been effective in bringing problem facilities into compliance more rapidly because the facility manager is able to focus on problems in all media at one time. State officials report that industry has benefited from having a single point of contact with the state to coordinate the state\u2019s inspection visits. Although the facility-management approach is labor-intensive and challenging for the facility managers\u2014who must develop expertise in a wide range of federal and state laws, industry processes, and techniques to prevent pollution\u2014the difficulty in obtaining detailed knowledge about each environmental program is mitigated by the presence of single-medium inspectors on each facility\u2019s inspection team.", "As part of a departmentwide review, New York plans to develop performance measures to evaluate its program. These measures will assess the amount of pollution prevented and the impact of environmental programs on the state\u2019s natural resources.

Under the existing practice, a facility may have dozens of medium-specific permits that regulate environmental releases through \u201cend-of-the-pipe\u201d treatment. Depending on the medium-specific program, permits may state what pollutants may be discharged, prescribe technology-based discharge limits, or contain other requirements.", "In 1991, the New Jersey legislature passed a Pollution Prevention Act that directed the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection to test the use of facilitywide permits at industrial facilities. The test is intended to identify ways to streamline and integrate medium-specific requirements, incorporate pollution prevention into the permitting process, and improve the overall administrative efficiency of permitting by consolidating all of a facility\u2019s environmental permits for air, water, and solid and hazardous waste into a single, facilitywide permit. This permit incorporates a pollution prevention plan that examines all of a facility\u2019s production processes and identifies those that use or generate hazardous substances regulated under New Jersey\u2019s Pollution Prevention Act. Thus, the permit encourages the facility to consider those substances for elimination or reduction.", "In the past, industry has criticized permits to approve a facility\u2019s production processes and equipment, particularly air permits, because they hampered the facility\u2019s efforts to respond quickly to changing market conditions. Facilities that wish to make even minor changes to a process often had to go through lengthy preapproval procedures. As an incentive to participate in its permitting pilot, New Jersey allows facilities with facilitywide permits to change processes without preapproval, as long as the changes will not increase releases of hazardous substances or increase the generation of waste. Companies that take advantage of this operating flexibility are required to expand the number of pollutants that come under their plans to prevent pollution.", "New Jersey\u2019s facilitywide permit requires facilities to at least meet existing emission standards. State officials believe that requiring facilities to achieve the lower emission levels identified in their source reduction plans would deter them from identifying opportunities to reduce emissions. State officials expect that facilities will voluntarily undertake additional source reduction projects and reduce their emissions to obtain such benefits as reduced costs for raw materials and waste disposal.", "New Jersey officials selected 18 facilities from those that volunteered to participate in the test of facilitywide permits. According to state officials, issuing the first permit took 3 years because major changes were made in the state\u2019s permitting process and some participants did not calculate the information on waste generation needed to identify opportunities to prevent pollution. New Jersey issued the first facilitywide permit in December 1994 to a pharmaceutical manufacturer that makes tablets, ointments, creams, and inhalation products for asthmatics.

Nonetheless, New Jersey officials have already found that some facilities lack key technical data about the amount of waste generated, such as accurate data on baseline emissions for a whole facility. New Jersey\u2019s legislature has directed the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection to report by March 1, 1996, on the results of the test and include recommendations as to whether the state should expand the use of facilitywide permits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Industry\u2019s Views", "paragraphs": ["To obtain industry\u2019s views on integrated approaches, we interviewed officials representing six firms that had participated in the integrated initiatives in the three states.

For example, according to an official from a Massachusetts electroplating company, the awareness of preventing pollution that was gained from the state\u2019s facilitywide inspections and technical assistance has convinced the company of the value of reducing pollution at its source. The company anticipates that replacing a hazardous chemical with a nonhazardous one will allow it to pay lower annual compliance fees as a small- rather than large-quantity generator of hazardous waste.", "According to a representative of a New York manufacturer, its facility manager has been able to expedite changes in the company\u2019s production processes. For example, in less than a month the facility received approval to substitute ethanol for methanol, a change that eliminated the need for at least 30 air permits. According to this representative, the approval process ordinarily would have taken 8 or more months.", "Representatives of a New Jersey pharmaceutical manufacturer, the first company in that state to obtain a facilitywide permit, stated that this facility has eliminated one hazardous substance and substantially reduced the use of two others. The company eliminated 1-1-1 trichloroethane, an ozone-depleting substance, in its label-making process by changing to an aqueous-based process that uses no hazardous substances. The facility also developed a recycling program to recover Freon, an ozone-depleting substance, from its production of inhalers.", "Representatives of this firm also thought that the facilitywide permit had simplified their company\u2019s compliance activities. For example, a new 5-year permit combines 70 air and water permits, as well as approvals of hazardous waste storage, into a single permit that eliminates the need for the company to frequently renew multiple permits. The company\u2019s facilitywide permit consolidates a 3-drawer horizontal file cabinet filled with permits into one 4-inch binder (see fig. 1). The company also enjoys greater operating flexibility under New Jersey\u2019s air regulations, which allow holders of facilitywide permits to change production processes without a lengthy preapproval process if the change does not increase hazardous emissions to air or discharges to water.", "According to representatives of the pharmaceutical manufacturer, the company spent $1.5 million in capital and labor resources to develop the permit but anticipates annual cost savings of $300,000 from reduced costs for waste disposal and raw materials. The company also anticipates substantial reductions in administrative costs because it will no longer have to frequently replace numerous individual permits.", "Officials at other facilities, however, were less positive about their state\u2019s integrated approach. For example, while supportive of New York\u2019s integrated approach, an official of a company in that state thought that the competitive marketplace, rather than the government, prompted industrial involvement in preventing pollution.

Once EPA approves a state\u2019s plan, it allocates funding on the basis of the planned activities. In fiscal years 1993 and 1994, Massachusetts and New Jersey requested that EPA provide additional credit for work performed under these medium-specific programs for their facilitywide inspection and permit programs.
