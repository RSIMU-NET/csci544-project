The CFSR uses states' data profiles and statewide assessments, as well as interviews and an on-site case review, to measure state performance on 14 outcomes and systemic factors, including child well-being and the provision of caseworker training. The CFSR also requires progress on a program improvement plan (PIP); otherwise ACF may apply financial penalties. This testimony is based on our April 2004 report and addresses (1) ACF's and the states' experiences preparing for and conducting the statewide assessments and on-site reviews; (2) ACF's and the states' experiences developing, funding, and implementing items in PIPs; and (3) any additional efforts that ACF has taken beyond the CFSR to improve state performance. For the April 2004 report, we surveyed all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico regarding their experiences throughout the CFSR process, visited 5 states to obtain first-hand information, and conducted a content analysis of all 31 available PIPs as of January 1, 2004.

Additionally, both ACF and the states have dedicated substantial financial and staff resources to the process. Nevertheless, several state officials and child welfare experts we interviewed questioned the accuracy of the data used in the review process. While ACF officials contend that stakeholder interviews and case reviews complement the data profiles, many state officials and experts reported that additional data from the statewide assessment could bolster the evaluation of state performance.

Officials from 3 of the 5 states we visited said ACF's PIP-related instructions were unclear, and at least 9 states reported in our survey that challenges to implementing their plans include insufficient funding, staff, and time. While ACF has provided some guidance, ACF and state officials remain uncertain about PIP monitoring efforts and how ACF will apply financial penalties if states fail to achieve their stated PIP objectives. Since 2001, ACF's focus has been almost exclusively on the CFSRs and regional staff report limitations in providing assistance to states in helping them to meet key federal goals. While staff from half of ACF's regions told us they would like to provide more targeted assistance to states, and state officials in all 5 of the states we visited said that ACF's existing technical assistance efforts could be improved, ACF officials acknowledged that regional staff might still be adjusting to the new way ACF oversees child welfare programs. In the April 2004 report, we recommended that the Secretary of HHS ensure that ACF uses the best available data to measure state performance. We also recommended that the Secretary clarify PIP guidance and provide guidance to regional officials on how to better integrate their many oversight responsibilities. In commenting on a draft of the April 2004 report, HHS acknowledged that the CFSR is a new process that continues to evolve, and noted several steps it has taken to address the data quality concerns we raised in that report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for inviting me here today to discuss states\u2019 efforts to comply  with federal Child and Family Services Reviews (CFSR). As you are aware,  in 2001, the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS)  Administration for Children and Families\u2019 (ACF) began implementing the  CFSRs to hold states accountable for improving child welfare outcomes.  Unlike prior federal reviews\u2014which determined states\u2019 adherence to  certain process measures\u2014ACF designed the CFSR as an outcome- oriented approach to assess children\u2019s safety; their timely placement in  permanent homes; and their mental, physical, and educational well-being;  and it developed certain standards against which to measure states\u2019  success in these areas. ACF also designed the reviews to assess states\u2019  performance across a range of systemic factors, such as caseworker  training and foster parent licensing. The CFSR has multiple phases,  consisting of a statewide assessment; an on-site review, which culminates  in the release of a final report; and the development and implementation of  a program improvement plan (PIP) when states are found to be deficient.  Pursuant to CFSR regulations, ACF can withhold federal funds if states do  not show adequate progress implementing their PIPs.", "My testimony today will focus on three key issues: (1) ACF\u2019s and the  states\u2019 experiences preparing for and conducting the statewide  assessments and on-site reviews; (2) ACF\u2019s and the states\u2019 experiences  developing, funding, and implementing items in their PIPs; and (3)  additional efforts, if any, that ACF has taken beyond the CFSR to help  ensure that all states meet federal goals of safety, permanency, and well- being for children. My comments are based on the findings from our April  2004 report.  Those findings were based on a survey of all 50 states, the  District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico regarding their experiences during  each phase of the CFSR process; post-survey follow up phone calls with  key states; and site visits to California, Florida, New York, Oklahoma, and  Wyoming to obtain first-hand information on states\u2019 experiences. We  selected these states for diversity in their location, size, program  administration, performance on the CFSR, and the timing of their review.  We also examined all 31 approved PIPs available as of January 1, 2004, and  conducted interviews with ACF\u2019s senior officials, regional staff from all 10  regions, ACF contractors, staff from all 10 national resource centers, and  key child welfare experts.  We conducted our work between May 2003 and  February 2004 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.", "In summary, ACF and many state officials perceive the CFSR as a valuable  process and a substantial undertaking, but some data enhancements could  improve its reliability. ACF staff in 8 of the 10 regions considered the  CFSR a helpful tool to improve outcomes for children, and 26 of 36 states  responding to a relevant question in our survey commented that they  generally or completely agreed with the results of the final CFSR report,  even though none of the 41 states with final CFSR reports released  through 2003 has achieved substantial conformity on all CFSR outcomes  and systemic factors.

Nevertheless,  several state officials and child welfare experts we interviewed questioned  the accuracy of the data used in the review process and noted that  additional data from the statewide assessment could bolster the evaluation  of state performance. While states\u2019 PIP planning is under way,  uncertainties have affected the development, funding, and implementation  of these plans. Officials from 3 of the 5 states we visited said ACF\u2019s PIP- related instructions were unclear, and at least 9 of the 25 states reporting  on PIP implementation in our survey stated that insufficient funding, staff,  and time, as well as high caseloads, were among the greatest challenges.  While ACF has provided some guidance, ACF and state officials remain  uncertain about PIP monitoring efforts and how ACF will apply financial  penalties if states fail to achieve their stated PIP objectives. Further, since  2001, ACF\u2019s focus has been almost exclusively on the CFSRs and regional  staff report limitations in providing assistance to states in helping them to  meet key federal goals.

Among other activities, ACF staff are responsible for developing  appropriate policies and procedures for states to follow to obtain and use  federal child welfare funds, reviewing states\u2019 planning documents required  by Title IV-B, conducting states\u2019 data system reviews, assessing states\u2019 use  of Title IV-E funds, and providing technical assistance to states through all  phases of the CFSR process. In addition, ACF staff coordinate the work of  the 10 resource centers to provide additional support and assistance to the  states.", "Spurred by the passage of the 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act  (ASFA), ACF launched the CFSR in 2001 to improve its existing  monitoring efforts, which had once been criticized for focusing exclusively  on states\u2019 compliance with regulations rather than on their performance  over a full range of child welfare services. The CFSR process combines a  statewide self-assessment, an on-site case file review that is coupled with  stakeholder interviews, and the development and implementation of a 2- year PIP with performance benchmarks to measure progress in improving  noted deficiencies.  In assessing performance through the CFSR, ACF  relies, in part, on its own data systems, known as NCANDS and AFCARS,  which were designed prior to CFSR implementation to capture, report,  and analyze the child welfare information collected by the states.  Today,  these systems provide the national data necessary for ACF to calculate  national standards for key performance items against which all states are  measured and to determine, in part, whether or not states are in  substantial conformity on CFSR outcomes and systemic factors. Once  ACF approves the PIP, states are required to submit quarterly progress  reports. Pursuant to CFSR regulations, federal child welfare funds can be  withheld if states do not show adequate PIP progress, but these penalties  are suspended during the 2-year PIP implementation term.", "In preparation for the next round of CFSRs, ACF officials have formed a  Consultation Work Group of ACF staff, child welfare administrators, data  experts, and researchers who will propose recommendations on the CFSR  measures and processes. The group\u2019s resulting proposals for change, if  any, are not yet available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The CFSR Is a Valuable Yet Substantial Undertaking, but Data Enhancements Could Improve Its Reliability", "paragraphs": ["ACF and many state officials perceive the CFSR as a valuable process\u2014 highlighting many areas needing improvement\u2014and a substantial  undertaking, but some state officials and child welfare experts told us that  data enhancements could improve its reliability.

For  example, ACF officials from 8 regional offices noted that the CFSRs were  more intensive and more comprehensive than the other types of reviews  they had conducted in the past, creating a valuable tool for regional  officials to monitor states\u2019 performance. In addition, state officials from  every state we visited told us that the CFSR process helped to improve  collaboration with community stakeholders. Furthermore, state staff from  4 of the 5 states we visited told us the CFSR led to increased public and  legislative attention to critical issues in child welfare. For example,  caseworkers in Wyoming told us that without the CFSR they doubted  whether their state agency\u2019s administration would have focused on needed  reforms. They added that the agency used the CFSR findings to request  legislative support for the hiring of additional caseworkers.", "Along with the value associated with improved stakeholder relations, the  ACF officials we talked to and many state officials reported that the  process has been helpful in highlighting the outcomes and systemic  factors, as well as other key performance items that need improvement.  According to our survey, 26 of the 36 states that commented on the  findings of the final CFSR report indicated that they generally or  completely agreed with the findings, even though performance across the  states was low in certain key outcomes and performance items. For  example, not one of the 41 states with final reports released through 2003  was found to be in substantial conformity with either the outcome  measure that assesses the permanency and stability of children\u2019s living  situations or with the outcome measure that assesses whether states had  enhanced families\u2019 capacity to provide for their children\u2019s needs.  Moreover, across all 14 outcomes and systemic factors, state performance  ranged from achieving substantial conformity on as few as 2 outcomes and  systemic factors to as many as 9. As figure 1 illustrates, the majority of  states were determined to be in substantial conformity with half or fewer  of the 14 outcomes and systemic factors assessed.", "States\u2019 performance on the outcomes related to safety, permanency, and  well-being\u2014as well as the systemic factors\u2014is determined by their  performance on an array of items, such as establishing permanency goals,  ensuring worker visits with parents and children, and providing accessible  services to families. The CFSR showed that many states need  improvement in the same areas. For example, across all 41 states reviewed  through 2003, the 10 items most frequently rated as needing improvement  included assessing the needs and services of children, parents, and foster  parents (40 states); assessing the mental health of children (37 states); and  establishing the most appropriate permanency goal for the child  (36 states)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ACF and the States Report That Reviews Have Been a Substantial Undertaking", "paragraphs": ["Given the value that ACF and the states have assigned to the CFSR  process, both have spent substantial financial resources and staff time to  prepare for and implement the reviews. In fiscal years 2001-03, when most  reviews were scheduled, ACF budgeted an additional $300,000 annually for  CFSR-related travel. In fiscal year 2004, when fewer reviews were  scheduled, ACF budgeted about $225,000. To further enhance its capacity  to conduct the reviews, and to obtain additional logistical and technical  assistance, ACF spent approximately $6.6 million annually to hire  contractors. Specifically, ACF has let three contracts to assist with CFSR- related activities, including training reviewers to conduct the on-site  reviews, tracking final reports and PIP documents, and, as of 2002, writing  the CFSR final reports. Additionally, ACF hired 22 new staff to build  central and regional office capacity and dedicated 4 full-time staff and 2  state government staff temporarily on assignment with ACF to assist with  the CFSR process. To build a core group of staff with CFSR expertise, ACF  created the National Review Team, composed of central and regional  office staff with additional training in and experience with the review  process. In addition, to provide more technical assistance to the states,  ACF reordered the priorities of the national resource centers to focus their  efforts primarily on helping states with the review process.", "Like ACF, states also spent financial resources on the review. While some  states did not track CFSR expenses\u2014such as staff salaries, training, or  administrative costs\u2014of the 25 states that reported such information in  our survey, the median expense to date was $60,550, although states  reported spending as little as $1,092 and as much as $1,000,000 on the  CFSR process. Although ACF officials told us that states can use Title IV- E funds to pay for some of their CFSR expenses, only one state official  addressed the use of these funds in our survey, commenting that it was not  until after the on-site review occurred that the state learned these funds  could have been used to offset states\u2019 expenses. States also reported that  they dedicated staff time to prepare for the statewide assessment and to  conduct the on-site review, which sometimes had a negative impact on  some staffs\u2019 regular duties. According to our survey, 45 states reported  dedicating up to 200 full-time staff equivalents (FTE), with an average of  47 FTEs, to the statewide assessment process. Similarly, 42 states  responded that they dedicated between 3 and 130 FTEs, with an average of  45 FTEs, to the on-site review process. For some caseworkers, dedicating  time to the CFSR meant that they were unable or limited in their ability to  manage their typical workload. For example, Wyoming caseworkers  whose case files were selected for the on-site review told us that they  needed to be available to answer reviewers\u2019 questions all day every day  during the on-site review, which they said prevented them from  conducting necessary child abuse investigations or home visits. Child  welfare-related stakeholders\u2014such as judges, lawyers, and foster  parents\u2014also contributed time to the CFSR."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States and Child Welfare Experts Report That Several Data Improvements Could Enhance CFSR Reliability", "paragraphs": ["State officials in the 5 states we visited, as well as child welfare experts,  reported on several data improvements that could enhance the reliability  of CFSR findings. In particular, they highlighted inaccuracies with the  AFCARS and NCANDS data that are used for establishing the national  standards and creating the statewide data profiles, which are then used to  determine if states are in substantial conformity. These concerns echoed  the findings of a prior GAO study on the reliability of these data sources,  which found that states are concerned that the national standards used in  the CFSR are based on unreliable information and should not be used as a  basis for comparison and potential financial penalty. Furthermore, many  states needed to resubmit their statewide data after finding errors in the  data profiles ACF would have used to measure compliance with the  national standards. According to our national survey, of the 37 states that  reported on resubmitting data for the statewide data profile, 23 needed to  resubmit their statewide data at least once, with one state needing to  resubmit as many as five times to accurately reflect revised data. Four  states reported in our survey that they did not resubmit their data profiles  because they did not know they had this option or they did not have  enough time to resubmit before the review.", "In addition to expressing these data concerns, child welfare experts as  well as officials in all of the states we visited commented that existing  practices that benefit children might conflict with actions needed to attain  the national standards. For example, officials in New York said that they  recently implemented an initiative to facilitate adoptions. Because these  efforts focus on the backlog of children who have been in foster care for  several years, New York officials predict that their performance on the  national standard for adoption will be lower since many of the children in  the initiative have already been in care for more than 2 years. Experts and  officials from multiple states also commented that they believe the on-site  review case sample of 50 cases is too small to provide an accurate picture  of statewide performance, although ACF officials stated that the case  sampling is supplemented with additional information. For example,  Oklahoma officials we visited commented that they felt the case sample  size was too small, especially since they annually assess more than 800 of  their own cases\u2014using a procedure that models the federal CFSR\u2014and  obtain higher performance results than the state received on its CFSR.  Furthermore, because not every case in the states\u2019 sample is applicable to  each item measured in the on-site review, we found that sometimes as few  as 1 or 2 cases were being used to evaluate states\u2019 performance on an item.  For example, Wyoming had only 2 on-site review cases applicable for the  item measuring the length of time to achieve a permanency goal of  adoption, but for 1 of these cases, reviewers determined that appropriate  and timely efforts had not been taken to achieve finalized adoptions within  24 months, resulting in the item being assigned a rating of area needing  improvement. While ACF officials acknowledged the insufficiency of the  sample size, they contend that the case sampling is augmented by  stakeholder interviews for all items and applicable statewide data for the  five CFSR items with corresponding national standards, therefore  providing sufficient evidence for determining states\u2019 conformity.", "All of the states we visited experienced discrepant findings between the  aggregate data from the statewide assessment and the information  obtained from the on-site review. We also found that in these 5 states, ACF  had assigned an overall rating of area needing improvement for 10 of the  11 instances in which discrepancies occurred. ACF officials acknowledged  the challenge of resolving data discrepancies, noting that such  complications can delay the release of the final report and increase or  decrease the number of items that states must address in their PIPs. While  states have the opportunity to resolve discrepancies by submitting  additional information explaining the discrepancy or by requesting an  additional case review, only 1 state to date has decided to pursue the  additional case review. Further, several state officials and experts also  told us that additional data from the statewide assessments\u2014or other data  sources compiled by the states\u2014could bolster the evaluation of states\u2019  performance, but they found this information to be missing or  insufficiently used in the final reports. For example, child welfare experts  and state officials from California and New York\u2014who are using  alternative data sources to AFCARS and NCANDS, such as longitudinal  data that track children\u2019s placements over time\u2014told us that the inclusion  of this more detailed information would provide a more accurate picture  of states\u2019 performance nationwide. An HHS official told us that alternative  data are used only to assess state performance in situations in which a  state does not have NCANDS data, since states are not mandated to have  these systems.", "Given their concerns with the data used in the review process, state  officials in 4 of the 5 states believed that the threshold for achieving  substantial conformity was difficult to achieve. While an ACF official told  us that different thresholds for the national standards had been  considered, ACF policy makers ultimately concluded that a threshold at  the 75th percentile of the nationwide data would be used. ACF officials  recognize that they have set a high standard. However, they believe it is  attainable and supportive of their overall approach to move states to the  standard through continuous improvement."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Program Improvement Planning Under Way, but Uncertainties Challenge Plan Development, Implementation, and Monitoring", "paragraphs": ["Forty-one states are engaged in program improvement planning, but many  uncertainties, such as those related to federal guidance and monitoring  and the availability of state resources, have affected the development,  implementation, and funding of the PIPs. State PIPs include strategies  such as revising or developing policies, training caseworkers, and  engaging stakeholders, and ACF has issued regulations and guidance to  help states develop and implement their plans. Nevertheless, states  reported uncertainty about how to develop their PIPs and commented on  the challenges they faced during implementation. For example, officials  from 2 of the states we visited told us that ACF had rejected their PIPs  before final approval, even though these officials said that the plans were  based on examples of approved PIPs that regional officials had provided.  Further, at least 9 of the 25 states responding to a question in our survey  on PIP implementation indicated that insufficient time, funding, and staff,  as well as high caseloads, were the greatest challenges they faced.

Table 1 shows the  number of states that included each of the six categories and  subcategories of strategies we developed for the purposes of this study.", "Our analysis also showed that many states approached PIP development  by building on state initiatives in place prior to the on-site review. Of the  42 surveyed states reporting in our survey on this topic, 30 said that their  state identified strategies for the PIP by examining ongoing state  initiatives. For example, local officials in New York City and state officials  in California told us that state reform efforts\u2014borne in part from legal  settlements\u2014have become the foundation for the PIP. State officials in  California informed us that reform efforts initiated prior to the CFSR, such  as implementing a new system for receiving and investigating reports of  abuse and neglect and developing more early intervention programs,  became integral elements in the PIP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Insufficient Guidance Hampered State Planning Efforts, but ACF Has Taken Steps to Clarify Expectations and Improve Technical Assistance", "paragraphs": ["ACF has provided states with regulations and guidance to facilitate PIP  development, but some states believe the requirements have been unclear.

Officials in the  states we visited echoed survey respondents\u2019 concerns with officials from  3 of the 5 states informing us that ACF had given states different  instructions regarding acceptable PIP format and content. For example,  California and Florida officials told us that their program improvement  plans had been rejected prior to final approval, even though they were  based on examples of approved plans that regional officials had provided.  In addition, California officials told us that they did not originally know  how much detail the regional office expected in the PIP and believed that  the level of detail the regional office staff ultimately required was too high.  Specifically, officials in California said that the version of their plan that  the region accepted included 2,932 action steps\u2014a number these officials  believe is too high given their state\u2019s limited resources and the 2-year time  frame to implement the PIP.", "ACF officials have undertaken several steps to clarify their expectations  for states and to improve technical assistance. For example, in 2002,  2 years after ACF released the CFSR regulations and a procedures manual,  ACF offered states additional guidance and provided a matrix format to  help state officials prepare their plans. ACF officials told us the agency  sends a team of staff from ACF and resource centers to the state to  provide intensive on-site technical assistance, when it determines that a  state is slow in developing its PIP. Further, ACF has sent resource center  staff to states to provide training almost immediately after the completion  of the on-site review to encourage state officials to begin PIP development  before the final report is released. Our survey results indicate that  increasing numbers of states are developing their PIPs early in the CFSR  process, which may reflect ACF\u2019s emphasis on PIP development.  According to our analysis, of the 18 states reviewed in 2001, only 2 started  developing their PIPs before or during the statewide assessment phase.  Among states reviewed in 2003, this share increased to 5 of 9.", "Evidence suggests that lengthy time frames for PIP approval have not  necessarily delayed PIP implementation, and ACF has made efforts to  reduce the time the agency takes to approve states\u2019 PIPs. For example,  officials in 3 of the 5 states we visited told us they began implementing  new action steps before ACF officially approved their plans because many  of the actions in their PIPs were already under way. In addition, according  to our survey, of the 28 states reporting on this topic, 24 reported that they  had started implementing their PIP before ACF approved it. Further, our  analysis shows that the length of time between the PIP due date, which  statute sets at 90 days after the release of the final CFSR report, and final  ACF PIP approval has ranged considerably\u2014from 45 to 349 business days.  For almost half of the plans, ACF\u2019s approval occurred 91 to 179 business  days after the PIP was due. Our analysis indicated that ACF has recently  reduced the time lapse by 46 business days. This shorter time lapse for PIP  approval may be due, in part, to the ACF\u2019s emphasis on PIP development.  According to one official, ACF has directed states to concentrate on  submitting a plan that can be quickly approved.

Such uncertainties include not knowing whether state  resources are adequate to implement the plans and how best to monitor  state reforms. In answering a survey question about PIP implementation  challenges, a number of states identified insufficient funding, staff, and  time\u2014as well as high caseloads\u2014as their greatest obstacles. Figure 2  depicts these results.", "One official from Pennsylvania commented that because of the state\u2019s  budget shortfall, no additional funds were available for the state to  implement its improvement plan, so most counties must improve  outcomes with little or no additional resources. A Massachusetts official  reported that fiscal problems in his state likely would lead the state to lay  off attorneys and caseworkers and to cut funding for family support  programs. While state officials acknowledged that they do not have  specific estimates of PIP implementation expenses because they have not  tracked this information in their state financial systems, many states  indicated that to cope with financial difficulties, they had to be creative  and use resources more efficiently to fund PIP strategies. Of the 26 states  responding to a question in our survey on PIP financing, 12 said that they  were financing the PIP strategies by redistributing current funding, and 7  said that they were using no-cost methods. In an example of the latter,  Oklahoma officials reported pursuing in-kind donations from a greeting  card company so that they could send thank-you notes to foster parents,  believing this could increase foster parent retention and engagement.  Aside from funding challenges, states also reported that PIP  implementation has been affected by staff workloads, but these comments  were mixed. In Wyoming, for example, caseworkers told us that their high  caseloads would prevent them from implementing many of the positive  action steps included in their improvement plan. In contrast, Oklahoma  caseworkers told us that the improvement plan priorities in their state\u2014 such as finding permanent homes for children\u2014have helped them become  more motivated, more organized, and more effective with time  management.", "ACF officials expressed uncertainty about how best to monitor states\u2019  progress and apply estimated financial penalties when progress was slow  or absent, and 3 of the 5 states we visited reported frustration with the  limited guidance ACF had provided on the PIPs quarterly reporting  process. For example, 4 regional offices told us that they did not have  enough guidance on or experience with evaluating state quarterly reports.  Some regional offices told us they require states to submit evidence of  each PIP action step\u2019s completion, such as training curricula or revised  policies, but one ACF official acknowledged that this is not yet standard  procedure, although the agency is considering efforts to make the  quarterly report submission procedures more uniform. Moreover, ACF  staff from 1 region told us that because PIP monitoring varies by region,  they were concerned about enforcing penalties.  Shortly before  California\u2019s quarterly report was due, state officials told us they still did  not know how much detail to provide; how to demonstrate whether they  had completed certain activities; or what would happen if they did not  reach the level of improvement specified in the plan. Based on data from  the states that have been reviewed to date, the estimated financial  penalties range from a total of $91,492 for North Dakota to $18,244,430 for  California, but the impact of these potential penalties remains unclear.  While ACF staff from most regional offices told us that potential financial  penalties are not the driving force behind state reform efforts, some  contend that the estimated penalties affect how aggressively states pursue  reform in their PIPs. For example, regional office staff noted that 1 state\u2019s  separate strategic plan included more aggressive action steps than those in  its PIP because the state did not want to be liable for penalties if it did not  meet its benchmarks for improvement. State officials also had mixed  responses as to how the financial penalties would affect PIP  implementation. An official in Wyoming said that incurring the penalties  was equivalent to shutting down social service operations in 1 local office  for a month, while other officials in the same state thought it would cost  more to implement PIP strategies than it would to incur financial penalties  if benchmarks were unmet. Nevertheless, these officials also said that  while penalties are a consideration, they have used the CFSR as an  opportunity to provide better services. One official in another state agreed  that it would cost more to implement the PIP than to face financial  penalties, but this official was emphatic in the state\u2019s commitment to  program improvement."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "ACF\u2019s Focus Rests Almost Exclusively on Implementing the CFSR", "paragraphs": ["To implement the CFSRs, ACF has focused its activities almost entirely on  the CFSR review process, and regional staff report limitations in providing  assistance to states in helping them to meet key federal goals. ACF  officials told us the CFSR has become the agency\u2019s primary mechanism for  monitoring states and facilitating program improvement, but they  acknowledged that regional office staff might not have realized the full  utility of the CFSR as a tool to integrate all existing training and technical  assistance efforts. Further, according to ACF officials, meetings to discuss  a new system of training and technical assistance are ongoing, though  recommendations were not available at the time of publication of our April  2004 report. Levels of resource center funding, the scope and objectives of  the resource centers\u2019 work, and the contractors who operate the resource  centers are all subject to change before the current cooperative  agreements expire at the close of fiscal year 2004.", "ACF officials told us that the learning opportunities in the Children\u2019s  Bureau are intentionally targeted at the CFSR, but staff in 3 regions told us  that this training should cover a wider range of subjects\u2014including topics  outside of the CFSR process\u2014so that regional officials could better meet  states\u2019 needs. All 18 of the courses that ACF has provided to its staff since  2001 have focused on such topics as writing final CFSR reports and using  data for program improvement, and while ACF officials in the central  office said that the course selection reflects both the agency\u2019s  prioritization of the CFSR process and staff needs, our interviews with  regional staff suggest that some of them wish to obtain additional non- CFSR training. In addition, although ACF organizes biennial conferences  for state and federal child welfare officials, staff from 5 regions told us that  they wanted more substantive interaction with their ACF colleagues, such  as networking at conferences, to increase their overall child welfare  expertise. Further, staff from 6 of the 10 regions told us that their  participation in conferences is limited because of funding constraints.", "ACF staff in all 10 regions provide ongoing assistance or ad hoc counseling  to states, either through phone, e-mail, or on-site support, but staff from 6  regions told us they would like to conduct site visits with states more  regularly to improve their relationships with state officials and provide  more targeted assistance. Further, staff in 4 regions felt their travel funds  were constrained and explained that they try to stretch their travel dollars  by addressing states\u2019 non-CFSR needs, such as court improvements,  during CFSR-related visits. While an ACF senior official from the central  office confirmed that CFSR-related travel constituted 60 percent of its  2002 child welfare-monitoring budget, this official added that CFSR  spending represents an infusion of funding rather than a reprioritization of  existing dollars, and stated that regional administrators have discretion  over how the funds are allocated within their regions. In addition, the  same official stated that he knew of no instance in which a region  requested more money for travel than it received.", "Concerns from state officials in all 5 of the states we visited echoed those  of regional office staff and confirmed the need for improvements to the  overall training and technical assistance structure. For example, state  officials in New York and Wyoming commented that ACF staff from their  respective regional offices did not have sufficient time to spend with them  on CFSR matters because regional staff were simultaneously occupied  conducting reviews in other states. However, our survey results revealed  that states reviewed in 2003 had much higher levels of satisfaction with  regional office assistance than those states reviewed in 2001, which  suggests improvements to regional office training and technical assistance  as the process evolved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["ACF and the states have devoted considerable resources to the CFSR  process, but to date, no state has passed the threshold for substantial  conformity on all CFSR measures, and concerns remain regarding the  validity of some data sources and the limited use of all available  information to determine substantial conformity. The majority of states  surveyed agreed that CFSR results are similar to their own evaluation of  areas needing improvement. However, without using more reliable data\u2014 and in some cases, additional data from state self-assessments\u2014to  determine substantial conformity, ACF may be over- or under-estimating  the extent to which states are actually meeting the needs of the children  and families in their care. These over- or under-estimates can, in turn,  affect the scope and content of the PIPs that states must develop in  response.", "In addition, the PIP development, approval, and monitoring processes  remain unclear to some, potentially reducing states\u2019 credibility with their  stakeholders and straining the federal/state partnership. Similarly, regional  officials are unclear as to how they can accomplish their various training  and technical assistance responsibilities, including the CFSR. Without  clear guidance on how to systematically prepare and monitor PIP-related  documents, and how regional officials can integrate their many oversight  responsibilities, ACF has left state officials unsure of how their progress  over time will be judged and potentially complicated its own monitoring  efforts.", "To ensure that ACF uses the best available data in measuring state  performance, we recommended in our April 2004 report that the Secretary  of HHS expand the use of additional data states may provide in their  statewide assessments and consider alternative data sources when  available, such as longitudinal data that track children\u2019s placements over  time, before making final CFSR determinations. In addition, to ensure that  ACF regional offices and states fully understand the PIP development,  approval, and monitoring processes, and that regional offices fully  understand ACF\u2019s prioritization of the CFSR as the primary mechanism for  child welfare oversight, we recommended that the Secretary of HHS issue  clarifying guidance on the PIP process and evaluate states\u2019 and regional  offices\u2019 adherence to this instruction and provide guidance to regional  offices explaining how to better integrate the many training and technical  assistance activities for which they are responsible, such as participation  in state planning meetings and the provision of counsel to states on  various topics, with their new CFSR responsibilities. In response to the  first recommendation, HHS acknowledged that the CFSR is a new process  that continues to evolve, and also noted several steps it has taken to  address the data quality concerns we raise in our report. We believe that  our findings from the April 2004 report, as well as a previous report on  child welfare data and states\u2019 information systems, fully address HHS\u2019s  initial actions, as well as the substantial resources the agency has already  dedicated to the review process. However, to improve its oversight of state  performance, our recommendation was meant to encourage HHS to take  additional actions to improve its use of data in conducting these reviews.  In response to the second recommendation, HHS said that it has continued  to provide technical assistance and training to states and regional offices,  when appropriate. HHS noted that it is committed to continually assessing  and addressing training and technical assistance needs. In this context,  our recommendation was intended to encourage HHS to enhance existing  training efforts and focus both on state and on regional officials\u2019  understanding of how to incorporate the CFSR process into their overall  improvement and oversight efforts.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
