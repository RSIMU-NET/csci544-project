As requested, this report addresses (1) the historical funding trends for BOS as contrasted with funding for facilities sustainment, restoration and modernization (S/RM); (2) how effectively the Department of Defense (DOD) and the military services have been able to forecast BOS requirements and funding needs; and (3) how the Army's and Navy's reorganizations for managing installations have affected support services, and whether the Air Force and Marine Corps could benefit from similar reorganizations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Congress has designated increased funding for BOS programs in recent years, sometimes more than requested, but because those amounts were often less than the cost of BOS services provided at installations, hundreds of millions of dollars designated for S/RM and other purposes were redesignated by the military services to pay for BOS. As GAO has previously reported, such funding movements while permissible are disruptive to the orderly provision of services, contribute to the degradation of many installation facilities, and can adversely affect the quality of life and morale of military personnel. The problem appears to be greatest in the Army. Further, in fiscal year 2004, U.S. military installations faced additional pressures in managing available BOS and S/RM funding as the services redesignated varying amounts of these funds to help pay for the Global War on Terrorism. Similar problems are reportedly occurring in fiscal year 2005. While difficult to quantify, installation officials at the locations GAO visited voiced concerns about the potential for these conditions to adversely affect operations and readiness in the future. Moreover, such movements of funds add considerable uncertainty regarding actual BOS requirements and the extent of underfunding. The ability of DOD and its components to forecast BOS funding requirements has been hindered by the lack of a common terminology across the military services in defining BOS functions as well as the lack of a mature analytic process for developing credible and consistent requirements comparable to the model developed for facilities sustainment. The lack of common definitions among the services, particularly where one service resides as a tenant on an installation operated by another service, can lead to differing expectations for installation services, and it obscures a full understanding of the funding required for BOS services. Because the military services have often based future requirements estimates largely on prior expenditures, they do not necessarily know if BOS services were provided at appropriate levels. DOD and the military services have a strategic plan for installations and have multiple actions under way to address these problems, but they have not synchronized varying time frames for accomplishing related tasks. Until these problems are resolved, DOD will not have the management and oversight framework in place for identifying total BOS requirements, providing Congress with a clear basis for making funding decisions, and ensuring adequate delivery of services. While the Army's and Navy's creation of centralized installation management agencies can potentially create efficiencies and improve the management of the facilities through streamlining and consolidation, implementation of these plans has so far met with mixed results in quality and level of support provided to activities and installations. Until more experience yields perspective on their efforts to address the issues identified in this report, GAO is not in a position to determine whether the approach should be adopted by the other services."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) manages nearly 517,000 buildings and  structures (replacement value of $650 billion) and over 46,000 square miles  of real estate at its bases and installations worldwide. At the same time,  DOD recognizes that it maintains infrastructure in excess of its needs, and  that it faces challenges in allocating sufficient funds to maintain this  infrastructure and supporting other base operating needs. We have  previously reported on the impact resulting from such underfunding,  including the deterioration of facilities, and its negative effects on the  quality of life for those living and working at the installations and on their  ability to accomplish their mission activities. More recently, you and  others have expressed concerns about the adequacy of funding for overall  base operations and whether funds were being moved to meet other  pressing needs, leaving shortfalls in base operating accounts.", "Operation and maintenance (O&M) funding is the primary category of  funds used to keep military installations running and the facilities in good  working order. Within O&M funding, there are distinct functional areas,  including (1) base operations support (BOS)\u2014a term used to describe a collection of day-to-day programs, activities, and services needed to keep  the bases and installations running; (2) facilities sustainment, restoration  and modernization (S/RM)\u2014the recurring maintenance and repairs needed  to keep facilities in good working order and in up-to-date condition; and  (3) mission support\u2014the goods and services needed to prepare for and  conduct combat and peacetime missions, including training and weapons  systems maintenance.", "For fiscal year 2004 O&M activities, Congress appropriated about  $83.5 billion for active duty forces and about $14.3 billion for reserve and  national guard forces, excluding DOD-wide and miscellaneous O&M  activities. Within the O&M appropriations, conference report data show  that Congress designated $14 billion for BOS, $5.5 billion for facilities  sustainment, and $78.3 billion for mission and other support. These  designations were based on the sum of a set of defined program elements  or activity groups and subactivity groups supporting the appropriation bill\u2019s  conference report, and are not binding unless they are incorporated  directly or by reference into an appropriation act or other statute. Thus,  DOD and its components have considerable flexibility in using O&M funds  and can redesignate funds among activity and subactivity groups in various  ways. Accordingly, it is important to note that amounts designated in the services\u2019 accounting records for O&M functional areas, such as BOS,  do not perfectly coincide with these congressional designations.  For example, according to historical data provided by the military services,  fiscal year 2004 O&M funds designated for BOS services totaled  $15.6 billion, about $1.6 billion more than data supporting the conference  report showed as being designated for BOS at the beginning of the fiscal  year.

Accordingly, this report uses the congressional  designations as adjusted by the services\u2019 accounting and redesignations of  O&M funds for BOS and S/RM to depict funding trends.", "Until recently, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the military  services have, for the most part, carried out installation management  functions at the local level, where installation commanders have set  priorities and regularly moved funds among BOS, S/RM, and mission  support accounts to pay for services and programs at their respective  installations. Increasingly, however, some of military services are moving to  centralize the management of these activities, with the expectation that  such efforts would help mitigate previous problems of funds intended for  installation management being redesignated to other purposes.", "This report addresses (1) the historical funding trends for BOS functions,  as contrasted with funding for S/RM; (2) how effectively DOD and the  military services have been able to forecast BOS requirements and funding  needs; and (3) how the Army\u2019s and the Navy\u2019s reorganizations for managing  installations have affected the quality and level of support provided to  individual activities and installations, and whether the Air Force and  Marine Corps would benefit from similar reorganizations.", "To address these questions, we met with officials in DOD\u2019s Office of  Installations and Environment and with Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine  Corps headquarters officials and collected and analyzed historical funding  data. We obtained data on historic funding levels from fiscal years 2001  through 2004 from the military services based on their categorization of  BOS functions, but we concentrated our analysis principally on fiscal year  2004, the most recent year for which obligation data were available. To  ensure consistency in analyzing funding trends from one year to the next,  the historical data provided by the services and used in this report do not include congressional adjustments of a one-time nature or supplemental  appropriations for O&M that Congress provided during a particular fiscal  year for such things as hurricane damage cleanup and repairs or for the  Global War on Terrorism. We determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this review in indicating broad trends and  comparisons between identified requirements, budget requests, designated  funding amounts, and subsequent obligations of funds for BOS and S/RM  functions. However, various data limitations are noted throughout the  report, such as differences between conference committee designations for  BOS funding and amounts categorized by the services. We obtained  information on the roles that OSD and the military services play in the  overall base operations process, requirements determination, budgeting,  and installations management. We visited two Air Force bases; two Marine  Corps bases; three Army bases; six Navy bases; the Army\u2019s Installation  Management Agency\u2019s (IMA) Headquarters and Southwest and Northeast  regions; and the Commander, Navy Installations (CNI) Command\u2019s  Headquarters and South and Southwest regions.

Funding  requirements are influenced by many factors, including force structure  levels, such as the number of aircraft squadrons and Army and Marine  Corps divisions; installations; military personnel strength and deployments;  rates of operational activity; and the quantity and complexity of equipment  such as aircraft, ships, missiles, and tanks in operation. For fiscal year  2004, Congress appropriated $114 billion for O&M activities. DOD uses  distinct activities and accounting structures to manage O&M budgeting and  funding for functional areas such as the following:  BOS\u2014a term that derives from the \u201cbase operations\u201d program area  (which includes installation transportation, supply, information  management, food services, legal and accounting services, and so forth)  to which the military services have added other program areas including  family and quality of life programs, force protection, environmental  compliance and conservation programs, communications services, and  grounds maintenance, as well as other facilities services such as utilities, leases, and custodial services, which OSD has referred to  as real property services. Thus, in practice BOS is not a single,  well-defined program area but a collection of many diverse programs,  activities, and services. The different BOS functions and activities used  by the military services are shown in appendix II.", "S/RM\u2014the maintenance and repairs needed to keep facilities in good  working order and in up-to-date condition. Sustainment funds cover  expenses for all recurring maintenance costs and contracts, as well as  for major repairs of nonstructural facility components (for example,  replacing the roof or repairing the air conditioning system) that are  expected to occur during a facility\u2019s life cycle. In addition to facilities  sustainment, O&M funds are sometimes used for facilities restoration  and modernization. Restoration includes repair and replacement work  needed to restore facilities damaged by inadequate sustainment,  excessive age, natural disaster, fire, accident, or other causes.

We  have previously reported on the movement of funds from BOS to alleviate  shortfalls in S/RM, and we have also reported instances where funds  intended for maintaining facilities had to be used to support base  operations or to cover other mission costs. However, such movements of  funds often raised or aggravated concerns about the adequacy of funding  for each of these areas or about how efficiently and effectively programs  were executed during the year.", "The Army and the Navy have recently taken steps to reorganize and  centralize their installation management activities. One of the expectations  established in setting up these centralized activities was that they would  curtail or prevent the movement of funds from facilities and base  operations to other priorities and create greater stability in the execution  of those activities. IMA was activated on October 1, 2002, providing  consolidated management of Army installations worldwide. The services  managed by IMA include engineering, information technology, resource  management, and other installation support activities. The agency\u2019s  objective is to standardize installation management services, providing  consistent and equitable facilities and services via common standards. IMA  is made up of seven regional offices, four in the continental United States  and three overseas. To establish IMA, the Department of the Army worked  with its major commands to identify the activities, personnel, and  resources that provided facilities and base operations support. These  service activities and the associated workforce were then organizationally  realigned from the major commands and their installation commanders to  establish IMA. Under the reorganization, IMA headquarters assumed  control of the BOS and S/RM budgets in fiscal year 2004 and determined the  funding for these programs and activities.", "CNI was activated October 1, 2003, and is responsible for Navy-wide  installation management. Its mission is to provide uniform program, policy,  and funding management, along with oversight of shore installation  support. Prior to the activation of CNI, management of its base operations  support activities was conducted at regional levels. With the activation of  CNI, shore installation management and the personnel associated with  those functions were organizationally realigned under CNI\u2019s control. CNI is  made up of 16 regions, 10 in the continental United States and 6 overseas.  Consolidation of the management of services provided at the regional and  installation levels was intended to reduce base operating support costs  through the elimination of unnecessary management layers, duplicative  overhead and redundant functions. The Army and Navy reorganizational  management structures are discussed further in appendix III.", "The Marine Corps, because it is small, has always been somewhat centrally  managed, but it generally leaves to the individual base commanders the  decisions about the level of BOS services required and issues regarding  quality of life at an installation.

We examined the impacts on areas such as  facilities maintenance and BOS\u2014areas that were already considered to be  underfunded against projected needs. For example, our February 2000  report compared the funding amounts that Congress had designated for  DOD\u2019s O&M subactivities, including BOS and S/RM, with DOD\u2019s obligations  for those same subactivities, and we showed that DOD consistently  obligated a different amount from what Congress had designated.

As a result of these holdbacks and movements, we  concluded that the amounts of funds spent on facilities maintenance and  repairs were not sufficient to reverse the trend of facility deterioration.

Congress gave the Army increasing funds for BOS in some  fiscal years, but these funds were less than the amounts projected by the  Army as being required and less than the amounts that were actually  obligated. As shown in figure 1, fiscal year 2004 data showed a spike in  projected requirements due at least in part to the Army\u2019s use of a model  that projected requirements at a higher level of service than was previously  used in projecting budget requirements. Obligations were higher than funds  initially provided, with funds being moved to BOS from other accounts,  such as S/RM, to permit this increase. At the same time, funding  turbulence across BOS and facility sustainment accounts was exacerbated  in fiscal year 2004 as the Army withheld funds that otherwise would have  been designated to fund BOS and S/RM, to help pay for the Global War on  Terrorism, although some funding was restored toward the end of the  fiscal year. Such turbulence occurring during the year makes it difficult to  execute planned programs effectively and, as noted later, resulted in the  Army\u2019s underexecuting its S/RM program in fiscal year 2004.", "The data show that BOS funding provided by Congress increased in fiscal  year 2002, remained stable in fiscal year 2003, and declined in fiscal year  2004. They also show that BOS obligations increased, particularly in 2003  and 2004, and that the Army routinely obligates more for BOS services than  adjusted congressionally designated amounts, through redesignations of  funds from other accounts. For example, in fiscal year 2004, the Army\u2019s  request for BOS funding\u2014$5.756 billion\u2014was about 65 percent of the  amount it projected as being needed to provide traditional levels of BOS  services. According to Army officials, while congressionally designated  amounts as adjusted by the Army\u2014$6.009 billion\u2014were somewhat more  than they requested, during the year they nevertheless had to reduce BOS  programs because they did not have sufficient funds to pay for traditional  levels of BOS services since they had to temporarily move some BOS funds  to pay for the Global War on Terrorism. To what extent the Army\u2019s actual  needs increased over prior years is difficult to fully gauge because,  according to Army officials, the requirements model used for fiscal year  2004 budget requests reflected improved information on the resources  needed to provide BOS programs and services compared to what they had  used in prior years. At the same time, because many BOS programs  involved bills that must be paid in a timely manner (such as utilities and  contracts), during the year the Army moved $882 million from S/RM  accounts and $816 million from other O&M accounts and used  supplemental funding for the Global War on Terrorism to cover its essential  bills and BOS services (total amount obligated was $7.707 billion).", "In contrast with BOS requirements, S/RM trend data show that S/RM  requirements and President\u2019s budget requests have remained relatively  constant since fiscal year 2002. Army officials attributed this consistency to  improved facilities sustainment requirements forecasts achieved by using  DOD\u2019s facilities sustainment model and a cost factors handbook, both of  which were developed for this purpose in recent years. However, as  shown by figure 2, the Army has consistently requested fewer funding  dollars for S/RM services than it had internally projected as being needed to  provide levels of S/RM services projected by the model. Furthermore, the  Army obligated fewer funding dollars for S/RM activities than adjusted  congressionally designated amounts in the last 3 years.", "According to Army officials, the difference between the amounts  designated for S/RM services and the amounts obligated is made up of  funds moved from S/RM activities and redesignated to BOS activities to pay  for \u201cmust pay bills\u201d (such as utilities and, increasingly, obtaining services  from contractors). This indicates a continuation of the historic trend of  funds being moved among various O&M subaccounts during the year, but a  reversal of a trend we saw a few years ago where BOS funds were more  likely to be redesignated to fund facilities maintenance and other needs.  S/RM services were also affected by the Army\u2019s withholding O&M funds  that otherwise would have been designated to fund BOS and S/RM, to help  pay for the Global War on Terrorism. Similar problems reportedly are  occurring in fiscal year 2005. The Army ultimately was able to provide  additional funds to installations late in the fiscal year ($100 million in  August 2004 and another $100 million on September 30, 2004), as  supplemental funding was made available to cover warfighting costs, but  Army officials told us that the timing made it difficult for the installations to  execute many of their BOS and S/RM activities promptly and efficiently. We  noted that this resulted in the Army\u2019s underexecuting its S/RM program by  $882 million in fiscal year 2004. As we have previously reported, such  problems adversely affect efforts to maintain facilities and provide base  support services.

The difference between the Navy\u2019s  obligations and its funding also appears to be smaller than that for the  Army, but the Navy\u2019s obligations for BOS still were greater than were its  congressionally designated amounts for BOS as adjusted by the Navy.

Despite the benefits  afforded by their service agreement with the Navy base, Coast Guard  officials expressed concern over decreasing levels of BOS services,  including reductions that negatively impact their mission. For example,  Coast Guard officials said they cannot always meet their 30-minute launch  requirement for nighttime air missions because the base has cut back on  operating hours, keeping the airfield open only during the day. Therefore,  Coast Guard officials said, when performing after-hours missions, the flight  crew must get out of their aircraft, stop traffic, and manually unlock and  open a gate to access the runway. This process sometimes makes it  impossible for the Coast Guard to meet its 30-minute launch requirement.  In addition, Coast Guard officials said they could never be certain that  runway lights would be on when they needed to land late at night or  whether the tower would answer, and they are unable to conduct training  at the base at night, when the airfield is closed. Corpus Christi Army Depot,  another of the Naval Air Station\u2019s tenants, also has a service agreement  with the base that identifies which services are to be provided by the Navy  at no cost and which services the Army Depot must pay for (through  reimbursements to the Navy). Army Depot officials told us that they were  incurring increasing costs but receiving reduced BOS services from the  Navy. Corpus Christi officials said they had no choice but to reduce  services because they did not have the BOS and S/RM funds needed to  maintain the levels of services they had provided in the past.", "Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, houses multiple Air Force missions  across multiple commands and also hosts the Navy as a tenant activity  on the base. An Air Force official from a command other than the one  responsible for managing the base told us that its support agreement,  signed in 1996, did not clearly specify the quantity or quality of services the  base would provide and that the base did not have enough money to  provide all of the needed services. As a result, the tenant said it spends  from $55,000 to $75,000 a year on BOS services from its O&M mission  accounts and works personnel extended hours to meet some needs. We  found that the Navy tenant has an interagency support agreement with the  Air Force, regarding which services the Air Force is to provide at no cost  (such as food services), which services the Navy will reimburse the Air  Force for (such as utilities), and which services the Air Force will not  provide due to the uniqueness of different approaches and governing  regulations between the military services (such as legal support  personnel). The Air Force at Tinker has contracted with the private sector  for much of its BOS, and the Navy shares in the cost of that contract, in  accordance with its interagency support agreement. While Navy officials  stated that overall the BOS services provided by the Air Force were  adequate, they nonetheless expressed concern about limitations in some  base support services, which forced them to pay separately for some BOS  services, such as security and education, out of other O&M funds. Navy  officials also expressed concern that some expected BOS services were  being scaled back; for example, mail service pickup and delivery were  reduced from twice to once per day, and fire department inspections and  repair and replacements of fire extinguishers were postponed. Navy  officials expressed further concern about service reductions in the  facilities sustainment area, compromising preventive maintenance and  contributing to further deterioration of the facilities.", "According to Tinker Air Force Base officials, they do not have sufficient  funds to provide all BOS and S/RM services at the levels or timing desired  by their tenants, and they have worked to gain efficiencies in their  programs and have scaled back some programs that are not mission  critical. For example, they said that they can only replace carpet once every  10 years; thus, if a tenant\u2019s carpet is worn out in 8 or 9 years, the tenant  must either wait 1 or 2 years or use other funds to pay for new carpet.  Tinker officials conceded that there is not as much money available for  preventive maintenance as they would like, but they believe that the base  has done a good job of fixing things when they break. They acknowledged  that the tenants might think things do not get fixed fast enough, but stated  that the base and its contractor are in full compliance with Air Force  standards for performing such services. In addition, they are negotiating  revisions to their support agreements to help clarify which BOS and S/RM  services the tenants should pay for and which services should be the  responsibilities of the base.", "We found similar concerns at the other installations we visited, particularly  those with multiple commands represented on a single base or with one  service residing as a tenant at an installation operated by another service.  The potential magnitude of the problem of differing expectations is  significant, as the Army alone has about 1,200 agreements with the other  military services to provide BOS services and about 250 agreements with  other agencies for this purpose. As DOD increasingly emphasizes jointness  and potentially joint basing, problems such as those noted above are likely  to increase in the absence of clearer delineation of BOS service  requirements and common definitions of BOS functions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Requirements and Funding Needs Have Historically Been Service Driven and Based on Previous Expenditure Levels", "paragraphs": ["The Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and  Environment oversees the procedures that the military services use to  develop BOS requirements and funding needs, but each service has  historically developed its own BOS requirements and funding needs subject  to its own definition of BOS and the types and levels of services it deems  necessary to provide. Unlike the facilities sustainment area, in which DOD  has developed a model useful for forecasting funding requirements, for  BOS the services have had few institutional-level requirements-forecasting  tools. Until recently, they have relied heavily on previous expenditures as  the basis for stating their future requirements. But while the services can  tell Congress how much was spent in an area in the past, they do not  necessarily know whether these services were provided at appropriate  levels or how much it would or should cost to provide them in the future.  DOD and the services have recognized this as a problem and have various  initiatives under way to better develop and calculate BOS requirements and  funding needs, similar to what they have done in the facilities sustainment  area.", "As noted earlier, DOD has taken steps to improve its identification of the  funding required to maintain its facilities. For example, as we previously  reported, in 1999 DOD issued its first defense facilities cost factors  handbook. Based on the guidelines in the handbook, DOD divides defense  facilities into approximately 400 categories and uses commercial  benchmark costs to determine the annual cost per square foot (or similar  unit of measure) to sustain each facility type. The purpose of the handbook  was to standardize the methods by which the services would determine the  sustainment costs of their facilities and to establish a minimum  sustainment funding level for facilities. Likewise, in 1999, DOD developed  the facilities sustainment model, which estimates the annual sustainment  cost requirement, adjusted for area costs, for each service and defense  agency, based on the number, type, location, and size of its total inventory  of facilities. Because of competing priorities, the services have not always  funded sustainment at 100 percent of requirements identified using these  tools, and we have reported instances where percentages of funding  reaching individual installations varied. Nonetheless, these tools offer a  superior basis for identifying requirements than existed previously. Similar  tools have not been developed for forecasting requirements in the BOS  area, although OSD and individual services are taking some steps to  improve forecasting BOS requirements.", "Until recently, the Army relied heavily on historical expenditures as the  basis for stating its future BOS requirements. In the mid-1990s, the Army  developed a model that forecasts its BOS requirements based on regression  cost-estimating relationships derived using historical data, demographics,  pacing measures, and quality factors. According to Army officials, they  continually work to improve the model and to update the information used  in it. They indicated that since the model currently reflects all the resources  needed to provide BOS programs and services at the highest standards  without any shortcomings, the Army does not expect to fully fund its  requirements and is working instead to ensure that the necessary and  affordable services are provided. Army officials told us that they are now  working to develop common level of support models that they will use to  provide definitive guidance, performance standards, and performance  measures for the uniform delivery of various BOS services at an affordable  support level across Army installations worldwide. The Army is evaluating  95 categories of services and plans to implement its common level of  support models incrementally, beginning in fiscal year 2005, as it completes  its evaluations of selected service categories. For example, the Army  analyzed the various activities that constitute recreation services\u2014 exercise programs, libraries, movie theaters, and sporting events\u2014and  solicited the users\u2019 priorities. It then determined which activities need no  longer be provided and developed common standards that it plans to  apply to remaining recreation services at each installation.", "The Navy is also moving away from historical expenditures as the basis for  stating its future BOS requirements. In fiscal year 2004, the Navy  centralized its installations management and began costing out its BOS  services based on a selection of service capability options ranging from  1 (most) to 4 (least). According to Navy officials, by providing a range of  service levels and funding requirements associated with those levels for  various BOS services, decision makers can see what risks they face with  selecting given levels of funding. In an effort to reasonably balance the  levels of services provided against risk and affordability, Navy officials said  that no capability level 1 or 4 options were selected in implementing fiscal  year 2004 BOS programs and services. Instead, BOS programs and services  specifically tied to air and port operations, utilities, and some recreational  services at remote overseas locations were to be funded at level 2. All other  BOS programs and services\u2014including such things as environmental  compliance, public safety, and human resources\u2014were to be funded at  level 3. However, officials at Navy bases we visited told us that there were  not enough funds available to the installations in fiscal year 2004 to provide  services even at the reduced levels and that they were experiencing  degradation in the quality of some services, which in some cases had gone  to level 4. For example, Navy officials at Corpus Christi said that although  fire protection was to be funded at level 3 in fiscal year 2004, they received  only 82 percent of the funding needed to provide that level of service,  resulting in the actual service level provided being level 4. Navy officials  stated that the level of fire protection at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi is  in full compliance with DOD and Navy requirements.", "The Marine Corps also has had few institutional-level tools for forecasting  requirements and, for the most part, has relied on historical expenditures  as the basis for stating its future BOS requirements. Marine Corps officials  told us that some BOS programs have performance requirements, such as  response times and minimum staffing necessary for their fire protection  and emergency response teams to effectively and safely operate during  emergencies. By utilizing the performance requirements and their metrics,  they can evaluate their response times to forecast staffing requirements to  operate a fire department, which in turn drives the program\u2019s funding  requirement. Although based primarily on the previous year\u2019s execution  amounts, Marine Corps officials told us that most Marine Corps BOS  programs and services are executed as required by the base commanders,  who have many competing needs, many of which vary annually. For  example, if the installation has a heavy snow year, the commander may  reduce the requirement to cut the grass to stay within budget.", "The Air Force has historically based its BOS requirements on the average  of the previous 4-year obligations, with programmatic adjustments as  necessary. However, beginning with the fiscal year 2006 budget submission,  Air Force officials told us that BOS requirements for the active Air Force  major command installations were derived from a BOS cost projection  formula that used multiple linear regression analysis involving BOS  personnel, plant replacement value, and contractor manpower  equivalents. The Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard BOS requirements are still based on the 4-year average method. Air Force  officials said that their major commands are actively engaged with  subordinate commanders in the funding and management of BOS services  and programs at their installations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OSD Has Launched Some Initiatives to Improve BOS Management and Enhance Requirements Determinations", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the military services\u2019 efforts to address BOS, OSD has  recognized BOS management as a problem and, in March 2004, the  Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and  Environment designated the improvement of BOS management as a  priority. According to office officials, DOD\u2019s and the military services\u2019  ability to forecast BOS requirements and funding needs has been hindered  by the lack of a common terminology across the military services for  defining BOS functions and the lack of common definitions impairs the  development of a complete picture of total BOS requirements and can lead  to differing expectations for services where multiple military services are  collocated on a single installation. Office officials explained that BOS is  not a single program but instead comprises many diverse functions  and activities\u2014the Army has identified 95 different categories of BOS  functions, the Navy has identified 124 categories, and so forth. The  different BOS functions and activities used by the military services are  shown in appendix II. Recognizing that definitions of BOS functions varied  among the military services, officials in the Office of the Under Secretary  told us that they are working with the services to (1) develop a common  definition of BOS services and programs between the military services,  (2) improve the tracking of BOS funding, (3) model BOS requirements, and  (4) measure performance. Accomplishments through March 2005 include  updating the Defense Installations Strategic Plan to articulate the need to  define common standards and metrics, using commercial benchmarks as a  starting point to define and model each subfunction of facilities operations  (utilities, leases, custodial services, snow plowing, and the like) and  establishing cross-service working groups to examine definitions and  budget structures. Officials with the Office of the Under Secretary said that  common definitions and standards would be developed incrementally, a  process that could take several years for full development and  implementation.", "In a related effort, in late 2004 a separate Senior Joint Basing Group that  was created to address installation management issues at joint bases began  efforts to resolve long-standing challenges involving support agreements  where one service is a tenant on an installation operated by another  service. Key enablers to this effort are common definitions and DOD-wide  standards, metrics, and reimbursement and costing rules for BOS services  and programs between the military services. This group has its own set of  time frames for resolving the long-standing inconsistencies among the  definitions of BOS services. Specifically, a Senior Joint Basing Group  official told us that by the end of 2005, the four military services expect to  have a common set of BOS services and programs to use in support  agreements at joint bases. It appears that a difference between OSD and  the group is that OSD focuses on developing common definitions of BOS  services for use in benchmarking funding requirements for future-year  programming and budgeting purposes at the DOD component level, while  the Senior Joint Basing Group focuses on developing common definitions  of BOS services for use in executing the programs and services at the  installation level in a joint environment. Also, DOD has attempted to gain  managerial control and better oversight of facilities and installations by  establishing an Installations Capabilities Council (formerly called the  Installations Policy Board). The council, chaired by the Deputy Under  Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment, serves as the  coordinator and integrator of all installation tasks and activities.  Collectively, these initiatives offer an overall vision for resolving the  long-standing inconsistencies in the definitions of BOS services and the  development of analytically based requirements. Even so, we found that  time frames for completing BOS tasks were being reported differently by  different groups which raise questions about how well these efforts will be  coordinated, synchronized, and integrated.", "Regarding DOD\u2019s efforts in modeling BOS requirements, the same official  with the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations  and Environment expressed doubt regarding whether there could be a  single BOS model because BOS, as it currently exists, has too many diverse  activities to model (see app. II). Also, because various BOS functions are  managed by various offices in DOD this official told us there is no single  focal point, and therefore, it is likely that a suite of BOS tools will evolve. It  will take some time to fully develop them and each office in DOD may  ultimately run its own model or metric. As a starting point, the Office of the  Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment is  developing a facilities operation model that will capture all the functions  related to facilities (utilities, fire protection, grounds maintenance, and so  forth). The requirements in this model will be driven by the facilities  inventory, commercial benchmarks, and local factors, including weather  and labor rates. The office has been building the cost factors for a few  months and simultaneously preparing the model. A prototype facilities  operations model, tested on March 31, 2005, is being validated and targeted  for implementation in fiscal year 2008. Next, the office expects to address  those installation services that are not related to facilities. These functions  include transportation, supply, and information management. There will  likely be a model or metric for each of these functions, such as a  \u201ctransportation activities model\u201d or a \u201chuman resources management  metric.\u201d An official in the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense  for Installations and Environment told us that a transportation activities  model may be very much like the facilities sustainment model, except that  instead of being based on an inventory of facilities, it could be based on an  inventory of vehicles. The human resources management metric may be  like the facilities recapitalization metric, except that instead of being based  on a facilities inventory, it may be based on an inventory of people. The  Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and  Environment and the Office of the Secretary of Defense for Program  Analysis and Evaluation will likely act as overseers of the whole process.

Typical efficiency actions completed or under way  included consolidations of contracts and services. Officials at IMA\u2019s  Southwest Region told us that one benefit was the ability to look across  multiple major commands and then realize benefits through consolidations  or other efficiencies.

The most critical  issue involved the different major commands\u2019 mission and support needs.  Officials at the Army and Navy installations we visited contended that a  \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach was not working well; they expressed concern  that although air and ground operations and various training missions each  required a different level of BOS, they did not perceive that difference  always being recognized by the centralized management agencies. Officials  from commands on Navy bases stated that CNI needed to step back and  identify service levels appropriate for their customers\u2019 needs and recognize  changes in operations (such as increases in the sailor population), and  then fund to those levels. Officials from major commands claimed that  a disconnect existed between their mission needs for BOS and CNI\u2019s  perspective and that in their judgment CNI should not be responsible for  determining the relative priorities of various mission activities\u2019 BOS needs.  For example, Navy Mine Warfare Command officials told us that in fiscal  year 2004 they had to spend $327,000 of O&M mission funds for BOS  services because the command no longer received BOS funds and CNI  either delayed funding or did not pay for the services out of its BOS funds.", "Citing growing pains associated with the centralization of installation  management above the installation level, installation officials raised  concerns about staffing levels, cited delays in obtaining funding guidance,  and articulated concerns with IMA\u2019s ability to quickly respond to shifting  needs. For example, during fiscal year 2004, IMA opted not to redesignate  available S/RM funds to meet an emerging funding need in BOS activities.  At Fort Eustis, an installation affected by IMA\u2019s decision, officials told us  that the installation commander had the flexibility to move funds where  needed before the creation of IMA, and the installation commander would  have done so this year but doing so would have caused significant facilities  maintenance work to be deferred. These officials explained that because  IMA directed installations to use existing S/RM funds for maintaining  facilities while BOS funds were depleted, Fort Eustis and other  installations had to request an additional $200 million of BOS funds from  IMA headquarters. They did not receive these funds until the end of the  fiscal year.", "In visiting various military installations we found instances where a lack of  clarity existed concerning who or what source was responsible for funding  select base support functions\u2014installation tenants and their O&M funding  or the installation\u2019s O&M funding. Furthermore, we found many cases  where delays in funding from the installation management agency  prompted an installation\u2019s tenants to fund BOS services from mission  funds. For example, installations in IMA\u2019s Southwest Region and their  tenants could not agree on who should pay for such services as the  following: information management services and specialized information  technology equipment (such as cell phones and pagers), dedicated  administrative use vehicles, long-distance phone service, postage,  dedicated copiers, hazardous waste disposal, and tactical equipment  maintenance.", "Officials with major command organizations at Naval Base San Diego and  Naval Air Station Corpus Christi said that under CNI they are seeing the  closing of automobile hobby shops, libraries, swimming pools, and other  recreational activities. The officials said they were concerned that the  reduction or elimination of base services would encourage military  personnel to spend more time away from the bases and in less-controlled  or less-desirable places. In addition, officials said mission operations have  been affected by funding shortages. For example, at Naval Base San Diego,  tugboat operating hours were cut back and the number of tugboats being  used was reduced from six boats to four boats, at CNI\u2019s direction. Although  this action saved money on fuel operations and overtime pay, once San  Diego\u2019s port operations demonstrated that they could not meet mission  requirements with fewer tugs, CNI authorized that an additional tugboat  be returned to service. Navy officials stated that some facility closures  (e.g., auto hobby shops) are due to lack of interest and are offset by facility  openings (e.g., cyber cafes).", "Finally, officials at various installations expressed concern that they  were not receiving sufficient facilities sustainment funding to maintain  their facilities at levels they had expected relative to DOD\u2019s facilities  sustainment model, which was congressionally funded at 94 percent of  the facilities sustainment requirement in fiscal year 2004. For example,  Naval Station Ingleside, Texas, provided documentation showing that  facilities sustainment funds available to it were only 62 percent of its  facilities sustainment requirement under the model. An official at another  installation claimed facilities sustainment funding to be as low as  45 percent of their facilities sustainment requirements under the model.  As we have previously reported, such funding shortfalls adversely affect  efforts to maintain facilities and provide base support services. DOD  officials stated that the facilities sustainment model is a macro  programming tool that establishes an average annual investment across  entire defense components for categories of facilities over the life of those  facilities and, therefore, the actual requirement for a single facility or small  set of facilities can be expected to vary across sets of facilities or  installations and from year to year. They stated that when the sustainment  program is funded at 94 percent of requirements, they would not expect  every installation and every facility to be funded at 94 percent of its  individual requirement. We recognize that facilities sustainment funding  levels at individual installations may vary from overall funding levels in a  given year, depending upon where the facilities are in the sustainment  cycle. However, this view was not widely recognized at the installations we  visited, particularly when an installation\u2019s sustainment funding was  significantly less than overall sustainment funding levels. Military barracks  and housing repairs were frequently delayed due to lack of S/RM funding,  according to installation officials, and the following problems have been  typical: leaking roofs; peeling painting; worn carpet; lack of hot water in the  showers; energy inefficient windows; cracked sinks in bathrooms; broken  heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems; and molded ceilings  and walls. Although funding shortfalls have been disruptive to planned  maintenance and support programs and have potentially caused adverse  effects on quality of life and morale, it is difficult to measure any direct  impact they may have on readiness. Officials with major command  operations at the installations we visited often voiced concerns about the  potential impact on operations and readiness in the future, should these  conditions continue. They were particularly concerned with the cumulative  impact of continually working military personnel extra hours and  weekends to make up for the lack of funding in S/RM and BOS programs.", "Army IMA and Navy CNI installation management officials we contacted  viewed these concerns and problems as being temporary in nature and  attributable to organizational growing pains and, to some extent, to  personnel\u2019s resistance to the changing the role of the installation  commander. They told us that while having consistent levels of services  from one installation to the next was their goal, they have made exceptions  when warranted.

As shown by figure 15, only in fiscal year 2004 were BOS  obligations\u2014$4.896 billion\u2014less than the congressionally designated  amounts, as adjusted by the Air Force\u2014$5.260 billion. This indicates that  BOS funds were being redesignated to meet other needs in that year, but  funds from other O&M accounts were redesignated to BOS in earlier years.  Air Force headquarters officials told us that rather than being headquarters  directed, the Air Force relied on its major commands to redesignate BOS  and S/RM funds as needed for the Global War on Terrorism and to decide  which BOS programs and services would be scaled back.", "Air Force trend data for S/RM activities during fiscal years 2001 through  2004 show that obligations were greater than designated funding or budget  requests in each of the 4 years. According to Air Force officials, BOS funds  were redesignated by installation commanders in fiscal year 2004 to  supplement S/RM funds. Since both BOS and S/RM obligations exceeded  their funding designations in fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003, this would  suggest that funds were redesignated to these areas from other O&M  activities in those years (see fig. 16)."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Latasha Brown, Erica Haley,  Mark Little, Erica Miles, Tanisha Stewart, Roger Tomlinson, Cheryl  Weissman, and Michael Zola made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Defense Infrastructure: Long-term Challenges in Managing the Military  Construction Program.
