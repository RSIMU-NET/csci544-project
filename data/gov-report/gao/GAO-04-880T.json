The program allowed the Iraqi government to use the proceeds of its oil sales to pay for food, medicine, and infrastructure maintenance. The program appears to have helped the Iraqi people. From 1996 through 2001, the average daily food intake increased from 1,300 to 2,300 calories. From 1997-2002, Iraq sold more than $67 billion of oil through the program and issued $38 billion in letters of credit to purchase commodities. However, over the years numerous allegations have surfaced concerning potential fraud and program mismanagement.

This estimate includes oil revenue and contract amounts for 2002, updated letters of credit from prior years, and newer estimates of illicit commissions from commodity suppliers. The United Nations, through the Office of the Iraq Program (OIP) and the Security Council's Iraq sanctions committee, were both responsible for overseeing the Oil for Food Program. However, the Security Council allowed the Iraq government, as a sovereign entity, to negotiate contracts directly with purchasers of Iraqi oil and suppliers of commodities. This structure was an important factor in allowing Iraq to levy illegal surcharges and commissions. OIP was responsible for examining Iraqi contracts for price and value, but it is unclear how it performed this function. The sanctions committee was responsible for monitoring oil smuggling, screening contracts for items that could have military uses, and approving oil and commodity contracts. The sanctions committee took action to stop illegal oil surcharges, but it is unclear what actions it took on contract commissions. U.N. external audit reports contained no findings of program fraud. Summaries of internal audit reports pointed to some concerns regarding procurement, coordination, monitoring, and oversight and concluded that OIP had generally responded to audit recommendations. Ongoing investigations of the Oil for Food program may wish to further examine how the structure of the program enabled the Iraqi government to obtain illegal revenues, the role of member states in monitoring and enforcing the sanctions, actions taken to reduce oil smuggling, and the responsibilities and procedures for assessing price reasonableness in commodity contracts. Evolving policy and implementation decisions on the food distribution system and the worsening security situation have affected the movement of food commodities within Iraq. As a result, as of June 2004, food warehouse stocks are low and Iraq has less than a month's supply of essential food items, according to U.S. and World Food Program officials. In addition to these current food security challenges, the new government will have to balance the need to reform a costly food subsidy program with the need to maintain food stability and protect the poorest populations. Also, inadequate oversight and corruption in the Oil for Food program raise concerns about the Iraqi government's ability to manage the food distribution system and absorb $32 billion in expected donor funds for reconstruction. The coalition authority has taken steps, such as appointing inspectors general, to build internal controls and accountability measures in Iraq's ministries."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss GAO\u2019s review of the United  Nations (U.N.)

We met with U.N. officials  following the transfer of the program to the CPA and with numerous U.S.  officials representing the CPA, the Departments of Defense and State, and  the U.S. Agency for International Development, to examine current  program management, the status of the food distribution system, and  current and future food security challenges.", "We conducted our review from November 2003 through June 2004 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, and the United Nations imposed  sanctions against Iraq. Security Council resolution 661 of 1990 prohibited  all nations from buying and selling Iraqi commodities, except for food and  medicine. Security Council resolution 661 also prohibited all nations from  exporting weapons or military equipment to Iraq and established a  sanctions committee to monitor compliance and progress in implementing  the sanctions. The members of the sanctions committee were members of  the Security Council. Subsequent Security Council resolutions specifically  prohibited nations from exporting to Iraq items that could be used to build  chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons. In 1991, the Security Council  offered to let Iraq sell oil under a U.N. program to meet its peoples\u2019 basic  needs. The Iraqi government rejected the offer, and over the next 5 years,  the United Nations reported food shortages and a general deterioration in  social services.", "In December 1996, the United Nations and Iraq agreed on the Oil for Food  program, which permitted Iraq to sell up to $1 billion worth of oil every 90  days to pay for food, medicine, and humanitarian goods. Subsequent U.N.  resolutions increased the amount of oil that could be sold and expanded  the humanitarian goods that could be imported. In 1999, the Security  Council removed all restrictions on the amount of oil Iraq could sell to  purchase civilian goods. The United Nations and the Security Council  monitored and screened contracts that the Iraqi government signed with  commodity suppliers and oil purchasers, and Iraq\u2019s oil revenue was placed  in a U.N.-controlled escrow account. In May 2003, U.N. resolution 1483  requested the U.N. Secretary General to transfer the Oil for Food program  to the CPA by November 2003. (Appendix I contains a detailed chronology  of Oil for Food program and sanctions events.) The United Nations  allocated 59 percent of the oil revenue for the 15 central and southern  governorates, which were controlled by the central government; 13  percent for the 3 northern Kurdish governorates; 25 percent for a war  reparations fund for victims of the Iraq invasion of Kuwait in 1990; and 3  percent for U.N. administrative costs, including the costs of weapons  inspectors.", "From 1997 to 2003, the Oil for Food program was responsible for more  than $67 billion of Iraq's oil revenue. Through a large portion of this  revenue, the United Nations provided food, medicine, and services to 24  million people and helped the Iraqi government supply goods to 24  economic sectors. Despite concerns that sanctions may have worsened the  humanitarian situation, the Oil for Food program appears to have helped  the Iraqi people. According to the United Nations, the average daily food  intake increased from around 1,275 calories per person per day in 1996 to  about 2,229 calories at the end of 2001. Malnutrition rates for children  under 5 fell by more than half. In February 2002, the United Nations  reported that the Oil for Food program had considerable success in  several sectors such as agriculture, food, health, and nutrition by arresting  the decline in living conditions and improving the nutritional status of the  average Iraqi citizen.", "Since 1997, Iraq has imported almost 2.7 million metric tons of wheat  annually. During the 1980s, Australia was Iraq\u2019s primary wheat supplier  with 38 percent of the market, and the United States was the second major  supplier at 29 percent. By 1989, Iraq was the twelfth largest market for U.S.  agricultural exports, including rice. Since 1997, however, Australia has  dominated Iraq\u2019s Oil for Food wheat trade with a 73 percent market share,  and Vietnam has become a major supplier of rice to Iraq.  The U.S. market  share for wheat dropped to 6 percent during that time.

We updated our  estimate to include (1) oil revenue and contract amounts for 2002, (2)  updated letters of credit from prior years, and (3) newer estimates of illicit  commissions from commodity suppliers. Appendix II describes our  methodology for determining illegal revenues gained by the former Iraqi  regime.", "Oil was smuggled out through several routes, according to U.S.  government officials and oil industry experts. Oil entered Syria by  pipeline, crossed the borders of Jordan and Turkey by truck, and was  smuggled through the Persian Gulf by ship.  Jordan maintained trade  protocols with Iraq that allowed it to purchase heavily discounted oil in  exchange for up to $300 million in Jordanian goods.  Syria received up to  200,000 barrels of Iraqi oil a day in violation of the sanctions.  Oil  smuggling also occurred through Turkey and Iran.", "In addition to revenues from oil smuggling, the Iraqi government levied  surcharges against oil purchasers and commissions against commodity  suppliers participating in the Oil for Food program. According to some  Security Council members, the surcharge was up to 50 cents per barrel of  oil and the commission was 5 to 15 percent of the commodity contract.", "In our 2002 report, we estimated that the Iraqi regime received a 5-percent  illicit commission on commodity contracts. However, a September 2003  Department of Defense review found that at least 48 percent of 759 Oil for  Food contracts that it reviewed were potentially overpriced by an average  of 21 percent. Food commodity contracts were the most consistently  overpriced, with potential overpricing identified in 87 percent of the  contracts by an average of 22 percent. The review also found that the use  of middlemen companies potentially increased contract prices by 20  percent or more. Defense officials found 5 contracts that included \u201cafter- sales service charges\u201d of between 10 and 20 percent.", "In addition, interviews by U.S. investigators with high-ranking Iraqi regime  officials, including the former oil and finance ministers, confirmed that the  former regime received a 10-percent commission from commodity  suppliers. According to the former oil minister, the regime instituted a  fixed 10-percent commission in early 2001 to address a prior \u201ccompliance\u201d  problem with junior officials.

At that time, the Secretary General  proposed that the United Nations, an independent agent, or the  government of Iraq be given the responsibility to negotiate contracts with  oil purchasers and commodity suppliers. The Secretary General concluded  that it would be highly unusual or impractical for the United Nations or an  independent agent to trade Iraq\u2019s oil or purchase commodities.

The agents were  authorized to stop shipments if they found irregularities. OIP hired a  private firm to monitor Iraqi oil sales at exit points. However, the  monitoring measures contained weaknesses. According to U.N. reports  and a statement from the monitoring firm, the major offshore terminal at  Mina al-Basra did not have a meter to measure the oil pumped nor could  onshore storage capacity be measured. Therefore, the U.N. monitors could  not confirm the volume of oil loaded onto vessels. Also, in 2001, the oil  tanker Essex took a large quantity of unauthorized oil from the platform  when the monitors were off duty.  In December 2001, the Security Council  required OIP to improve the monitoring at the offshore terminal.  As part  of its strategy to repair Iraq\u2019s oil infrastructure, the CPA plans to install  reliable metering at Mina al-Basra and other terminals, but no contracts  have been let.", "OIP also was responsible for monitoring Iraq\u2019s purchase of commodities  and the delivery of goods. Security Council resolution 986, paragraph  8a(ii) required Iraq to submit a plan, approved by the Secretary General, to  ensure equitable distribution of Iraq\u2019s commodity purchases.

OIP officials told the Defense Contract Audit Agency  they performed very limited, if any, pricing review. They stated that no  U.N. resolution tasked them with assessing the price reasonableness of the  contracts and no contracts were rejected solely on the basis of price.   However, OIP officials stated that, in a number of instances, they reported  to the sanctions committee that commodity prices appeared high, but the  committee did not cite pricing as a reason to place holds on the contracts.  For example, in October 2001, OIP experts reported to the sanctions  committee that the prices in a proposed contract between Iraq and the Al- Wasel and Babel Trading Company appeared high. However, the sanctions  committee reviewed the data and approved the contract.  Subsequently,  the Treasury Department identified this company as a front company for  the former regime in April 2004.

As early as June  1996, the Maritime Interception Force, a naval force of coalition partners  including the United States and Great Britain, informed the sanctions  committee that oil was being smuggled out of Iraq through Iranian  territorial waters. In December 1996, Iran acknowledged the smuggling  and reported that it had taken action. In October 1997, the sanctions  committee was again informed about smuggling through Iranian waters.

Also, fewer drivers are willing to  work in this environment, thereby reducing the movement of food from  the borders and ports to the food warehouses.  This situation is  exacerbated by congestion at the major port of Umm Qasr, which is  operating at 50 percent of its capacity due to inadequate fuel and power  supply, off-loading delays, dredging activity, inadequate storage capacity,  and security concerns.", "Initial planning and management problems, combined with security and  port congestion issues limiting the movement of food, have resulted in the  drawing down of warehouse food stocks.

Moreover, these commodities are not being reserved as a buffer  stock, but are immediately used as operating stocks.", "U.S. officials are concerned that, as the Iraqi government assumes full  responsibility for food distribution on July 1, 2004, it will find it difficult to  manage the food distribution system given low food supplies. According to  U.S. and WFP officials, the Ministry of Trade implemented the food  distribution system during the Oil for Food program under more favorable  conditions.  For example, the Ministry was able to maintain at least a 6- month food inventory and operate in a more secure environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Food Distribution System Essential for Current Food Security But May Not Be Sustainable", "paragraphs": ["The Oil for Food program facilitated the operation of the Public  Distribution System run by Iraq\u2019s Ministry of Trade. Under this system,  each Iraqi is eligible to receive a monthly \u201cfood basket\u201d that normally  consists of a dozen items.", "After the CPA transfers responsibility for the food distribution system to  the Iraqi provisional government in July 2004, the government will have to  decide whether to continue, reform, or eliminate the current system.  Documents from the Ministries of Finance and Planning indicate that the  annual cost of maintaining the system is as high as $5 billion, or about 25  percent of total government expenditures. In 2005 and 2006, expenditures  for food will be almost as much as all expenditures for capital projects.  According to a September 2003 joint U.N. and World Bank needs  assessment of Iraq, the food subsidy, given out as a monthly ration to the  entire population, staved off mass starvation during the time of the  sanctions, but disrupted the market for food grains produced locally. The  agricultural sector had little incentive to produce crops in the absence of a  promising market.", "However, the Iraqi government may find it politically difficult to scale back  the food distribution system with an estimated 60 percent of the  population relying on monthly rations as their primary source of nutrition.  WFP is completing a vulnerability assessment that Iraq could use to make  future decisions on food security programs and better target food items to  those most in need.  WFP\u2019s preliminary assessment results found that 10  percent of the population was extremely poor and needed food aid in  addition to the Public Distribution System.  WFP is also developing an  emergency operation plan to meet the needs of vulnerable populations.  In  addition, in April 2004, a USAID contractor submitted a strategy for a  short-term plan to stabilize the agricultural sector by providing agricultural  supplies, re-establishing domestic wheat markets, rehabilitating irrigation  systems, and rehabilitating Ministry of Agriculture facilities.  The strategy  also includes a medium-term plan to create appropriate agricultural  policies, provide capacity building for market-led agriculture, and  strengthen the agricultural sector through national programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Addressing Corruption", "paragraphs": ["In the absence of significant reforms, the history of inadequate oversight  and corruption in the Oil for Food program raises questions about the Iraqi  government\u2019s ability to manage the import and distribution of food  commodities and the billions in international assistance expected to flow  into the country. The CPA and Iraqi ministries must address corruption to  help ensure that the food distribution system is managed with transparent  and accountable controls. Building these internal control and  accountability measures into the operations of Iraqi ministries will also  help safeguard the $18.4 billion in fiscal year 2004 U.S. reconstruction  funds and $13.8 billion pledged by other countries.", "To address these concerns and oversee government operations, the CPA  administrator appointed inspectors general for Iraq\u2019s 26 national  ministries. At the same time, the CPA announced the establishment of two  independent agencies to work with the inspectors general\u2014the  Commission on Public Integrity and a Board of Supreme Audit.

Coalition personnel have provided Iraqi staff with guidance on  working with suppliers in a fair and open manner and determining when  changes to letters of credit are appropriate. In addition, according to  center staff, coalition and Iraqi staff signed a code of conduct, which  outlined proper job behavior. Among other provisions, the code of  conduct prohibited kickbacks and secret commissions from suppliers. The  center also developed a code of conduct for suppliers. In addition, the  center has begun implementing the steps needed for the transition of full  authority to the Iraqi ministries. These steps include transferring contract- related documents, contacting suppliers, and providing authority to amend  contracts.

The remaining oil was smuggled through  Turkey, the Persian Gulf, Jordan, and Syria (oil smuggling to Syria  began late 2000).

We discounted this price by 67 percent for smuggling to Jordan and by  33 percent for smuggling through Turkey, the Persian Gulf, and Syria.  According to oil industry experts, this is representative of the prices  paid for smuggled oil.", "To estimate the amount Iraq earned from surcharges on oil, we  multiplied the barrels of oil sold under the Oil for Food program from  1997 through 2002 by 25 cents per barrel. According to Security  Council members, the surcharge varied, but Iraq tried to get as much  as 50 cents per barrel.

According to  Security Council members, the commission varied from 5 percent to 10  percent.  This percentage was also confirmed in interviews conducted  by U.S. officials with former Iraqi regime ministers of oil, finance, and  trade and with Saddam Hussein\u2019s presidential advisors.", "GAO did not obtain source documents and records from the former regime  about its smuggling, surcharges, and commissions.  Our estimate of illicit  revenues is therefore not a precise accounting number. Areas of  uncertainty in our estimate include:", "GAO\u2019s estimate of the revenue from smuggled oil is less than the  estimates of U.S. intelligence agencies.

However, the average  surcharge could be lower. U.N. Security Council members and oil  industry sources do not know when the surcharge began or ended or  the precise amount of the surcharge.  One oil industry expert stated  that the surcharge was imposed at the beginning of the program but  that the amount varied. Security Council members and the U.S.  Treasury Department reported that surcharges ranged from 10 cents to  50 cents per barrel.  As a test of reasonableness, GAO compared the  price paid for oil under the Oil for Food program with a proxy oil price  for the period 1997 through 2002.  We found that for the entire period,  the price of Iraqi oil was considerably below the proxy price. Oil  purchasers would have to pay below market price to have a margin to  pay the surcharge.", "GAO\u2019s estimate of the commission on commodities could be understated.   We calculated commissions based on the commodity contracts for the 15  governorates in central and southern Iraq (known as the \u201c59-percent  account\u201d because these governorates received this percentage of Oil for  Food revenues).  We excluded contracts for the three northern  governorates (known as the \u201c13-percent account\u201d). However, the former  Iraqi regime negotiated the food and medical contracts for the northern  governorates, and the Defense Contract Audit Agency found that some of  these contracts were potentially overpriced.
