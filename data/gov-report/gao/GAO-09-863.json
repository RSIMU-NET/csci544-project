Using a case study approach, this report (1) describes the key IP protection and enforcement issues at four posts in China, India, and Thailand; (2) assesses the extent to which the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) IP attach?s and the Department of Justice (DOJ) IP Law Enforcement Coordinator (IPLEC) effectively collaborate with other agencies at the posts; and (3) evaluates the extent to which each of the posts has undertaken interagency planning in collaborating on its IP-related activities. GAO examined U.S. government documents and interviewed headquarters and post agency officials as well as U.S. private-sector and host-country representatives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. government has identified weak enforcement as a key IP issue in the three case study countries; however, weaknesses also persist in their IP laws and regulations. According to the U.S. government, enforcement of existing IP laws and regulations and adjudication of suspected infringements are limited and inconsistent, and penalties are not typically sufficient to serve as an effective deterrent. U.S. government documents and U.S. officials we interviewed cited several factors that contribute to this limited and inconsistent enforcement, including flawed enforcement procedures; a lack of technical skills and knowledge of IP among police, prosecutors, and judges; a lack of resources dedicated to IP enforcement efforts; and the absence of broad-based domestic support for strong IP enforcement. The USPTO IP attach?s were generally effective in collaborating with other agencies at the four posts, primarily by acting as IP focal points, while the DOJ IPLEC collaborated with both post agencies and agency headquarters via IP forums. The IP attach?s shared common characteristics that made them effective, such as IP expertise, the ability to work full time on IP, and having roles and responsibilities for which there was general agreement among post agencies and leadership. At two posts, several agency officials stated that the IP attach?s were instrumental in establishing and maintaining interagency IP working groups to share ideas and coordinate on activities, enabling the agencies to speak with one voice on IP. The IPLEC collaborated through country and regional IP forums that provided technical assistance to foreign law enforcement agencies and judges on IP law enforcement issues and facilitated a network among U.S. and foreign government officials for sharing information on IP criminal investigations. The IPLEC also collaborated on case work for an array of mostly non-IP criminal activities, including money laundering, fraud, human trafficking, and child exploitation, in fulfilling his other duties as DOJ attach?. While the four posts have adopted several practices to collaborate effectively on IP, three out of the four have not adopted interagency plans to address key IP issues. Current policy guidance on IP at the posts, such as the annual Special 301 report and embassy mission strategic plans, is high level and not generally used for planning agencies' day-to-day IP efforts. Posts could potentially enhance collaboration by developing joint strategies to translate the key IP issues identified by the U.S. government into specific objectives and activities. One post, the U.S. embassy in New Delhi, has developed a joint strategy in the form of an interagency IP work plan with specific objectives and prescribed activities for addressing key IP issues. Joint strategies can help agencies prioritize existing efforts, avoid duplication of efforts, formulate a common IP message to foreign governments, and maintain focus on IP given competing issues and personnel changes at posts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Intellectual property (IP) is an important component of the U.S. economy,  and the United States is an acknowledged global leader in its creation. The  protection and enforcement of IP rights is inadequate in some parts of the  world, making U.S. goods subject to substantial counterfeiting and piracy  activity abroad. Transnational IP crimes have been increasing, with  infringers attracted by high-profit potential, ease of market entry, and  relatively low risk of detection and prosecution. U.S. government efforts to  protect and enforce IP rights overseas are crucial to preventing significant  losses to U.S. industry and IP rights owners resulting from the trade in  counterfeit and pirated goods. Additionally, many IP-violating products,  such as counterfeit pharmaceuticals, have the potential to threaten public  health and safety in the United States and abroad. However, federal IP  protection and enforcement is complex and cuts across a wide range of  functions and U.S. agencies. Federal agencies are placing new emphasis  on IP protection\u2014improving countries\u2019 IP laws and regulations\u2014and on  enforcement of those laws and regulations. For instance, the U.S. Patent  and Trademark Office (USPTO) created eight IP attach\u00e9 positions and the  Department of Justice (DOJ) created two Intellectual Property Law  Enforcement Coordinator (IPLEC) positions in U.S. embassies overseas.", "Congress is concerned about the effectiveness of U.S. government efforts  to protect and enforce IP rights overseas and recently passed the  Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property Act of  2008. Title III of that legislation created a new interagency intellectual  property enforcement advisory committee composed of representatives of  specified departments and agencies involved in IP enforcement. It  authorizes the President to appoint an Intellectual Property Enforcement  Coordinator position within the Executive Office of the President to chair  the new advisory committee. Among other things, the new Coordinator is  to lead the committee in the development of a joint strategic plan to  reduce counterfeiting and other types of IP infringement, and to assist in  the implementation of the joint strategic plan when requested by advisory  committee members.", "At your request, to help the new Coordinator assess the resources  available to promote and protect IP rights overseas, we issued a report in  February 2009 that describes the federal agencies that have personnel  posted overseas who conduct activities related to IP enforcement and  protection and their respective roles and responsibilities. As the second  part of that same request, this report examines U.S. government efforts to  enhance protection and enforcement of IP overseas by focusing on four  posts in three countries: Beijing and Guangzhou, China; New Delhi, India;  and Bangkok, Thailand. The U.S. government has identified each of these  countries as having significant IP problems and each is an area of focus for  U.S. IP efforts overseas. Specifically, this report (1) describes the key IP  protection and enforcement issues that the U.S. government has identified  in China, India, and Thailand; (2) assesses the extent to which the USPTO  IP attach\u00e9s and the DOJ IPLEC effectively collaborated with other  agencies at posts in China, India, and Thailand to improve IP protection  and enforcement; and (3) evaluates the extent to which each of the four  posts has undertaken interagency planning in collaborating on their IP- related activities.", "To address these objectives, we interviewed U.S. government officials and  obtained and reviewed documentation on overseas U.S. government  personnel and their IP activities from the Departments of Commerce  (Commerce), Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security  (DHS), Justice (DOJ), and State (State), and from the Office of the U.S.  Trade Representative (USTR). We also collected and analyzed  documentation from these agencies that discussed key IP protection and  enforcement issues around the world and that identified those countries  where the U.S. government believes IP problems are most acute, including  the Special 301 reports for 2008 and 2009. We also reviewed other  documents discussing key IP issues, including the 2008 and 2009 National  Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers, talking points from  presentations, internal U.S. government IP newsletters, agency reports to  their headquarters offices, and materials produced to assist U.S.  businesses. Our discussion on foreign laws and regulations is based  primarily on interviews with U.S. officials and U.S. government  documentation. Determining that a case study approach was the best way  to focus our work, we selected three case study countries using a set of  criteria that included: the extent to which the U.S. government has  identified the country and its region as having significant IP problems, the  types and range of IP problems that exist in the country, and the presence  of U.S. government personnel posted in the country involved in IP  activities, including USPTO IP attach\u00e9s; CBP, ICE, and FBI attach\u00e9s; and  DOJ personnel, particularly the IPLEC in Asia. Based upon our criteria, we  conducted fieldwork at posts in Beijing and Guangzhou, China; Bangkok,  Thailand; and New Delhi, India, in March 2009.", "In each location, we met with those U.S. government personnel from  Commerce, HHS, DHS, DOJ, State, USTR, and the Department of  Agriculture (USDA) that were present at the post and performed IP-related  functions. We held these meetings to learn about the types of IP activities  they undertake, the factors that drive their work, and how the USPTO IP  attach\u00e9s and the DOJ IPLEC collaborated with their counterparts at the  post and in headquarters, with the private sector, and with their host  government. We also met with representatives from various industry  associations and individual companies in each location to obtain their  perspectives on the key IP issues in the country and to learn about how  they seek to protect their IP, including through collaboration with the U.S.  government and the host government. Finally, in each location, we met  with foreign government officials to learn about the challenges they face in  improving IP protection and enforcement and to obtain their perspectives  on the effectiveness of their collaboration with the U.S. government on IP  issues. We also obtained and reviewed documents from each post that  outlined IP problems in the countries, strategies and plans for addressing  the problems, and the types of IP-related activities that are being  undertaken. Using the information from our interviews and the  documentation we collected at each post, we evaluated the extent to  which the USPTO attach\u00e9s and DOJ\u2019s IPLEC have adopted good practices  to collaborate with other agencies at the posts on promoting IP protection  using the following GAO criteria: agreeing upon agency roles and  responsibilities; establishing compatible policies, procedures, and other  means to operate across agency boundaries; identifying and addressing  needs by leveraging resources; and establishing mutually reinforcing or  joint strategies. We broke out the last criteria\u2013establishing mutually  reinforcing or joint strategies\u2013to evaluate the extent to which the posts  have undertaken interagency planning to guide their IP collaboration  efforts. This report covers only the IP attach\u00e9s\u2019 activities in the three case  study countries\u2013China, India, and Thailand\u2014and not their regional  responsibilities. Because we utilized a case study approach, our findings  cannot be generalized and do not necessarily apply to countries or posts  other than those we visited. We solicited comments from all the key  agencies discussed in the report and incorporated their comments as  appropriate.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2008 through  September 2009 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

USPTO added an attach\u00e9  in Beijing, China, in 2006; and an attach\u00e9 in Guangzhou, China, in 2007.  During 2006 and 2007, USPTO also expanded the program to five other  countries: Egypt, Thailand, Russia, Brazil, and India. Since then, the Egypt  position has been eliminated and a new position in Doha, Qatar, is in the  planning stages.

According to USPTO, the IP  attach\u00e9 in Guangzhou helped manage the office in Beijing in the absence  of an IP attach\u00e9 there; and from December 2008 through August 2009, on a  regular basis, USPTO headquarters sent attorneys with expertise and  experience on China IP matters from the Office of IP Policy and  Enforcement to Beijing on short-term assignments to manage the office. In  March 2009, USPTO officials told us that a candidate had been selected to  fill one of the vacant attach\u00e9 positions. The new attach\u00e9 arrived in early  September 2009.

A range of U.S. officials and private-sector representatives we met  with made the point that all three countries are increasingly looking to be  centers of innovation and that there is a growing awareness that domestic  production of IP is important for their economic development. As this  process occurs, various U.S. officials and private-sector representatives  we interviewed believe that the three countries will have a greater  incentive for strong IP enforcement. At this point though, various U.S.  officials and private-sector representatives noted that the three countries\u2019  continue to not be fully committed to strong and sustained enforcement  efforts. For instance, in the 2009 Special 301 Report, the U.S. government  reported that during the 2008 Beijing Olympics, China took unprecedented  steps to crackdown on the unauthorized retransmission of broadcasts and  other infringing activities over the Internet; however, the report also noted  the need for China to demonstrate this type of resolve more generally in  combating piracy and counterfeiting on the Internet. Additionally, the U.S.  government reported in the 2009 Special 301 Report that an innovative  agreement brokered by the Beijing municipal courts between IP rights  holders and the landlord of a commercial center that was a well-known  source for an array of violating goods has not been enforced despite initial  optimism. In India, 23 states have created specialized IP units within their  police forces, but U.S. officials we interviewed stated that only a few of  these units are currently operational. Furthermore, the officials noted that  even these specialized units have other priorities, with IP not always being  at the top of the list. Thailand has set up a specialized IP court, but the U.S.  embassy in Thailand has reported that the court is not living up to its full  potential with most convictions resulting in minimal sentences, such as  small fines or required community service. The U.S. embassy in Thailand  has also reported that Thai authorities have labeled parts of Bangkok and  other Thai cities that are well-known retail centers for infringing products  as \u201cred zones;\u201d however, the embassy noted that since the designations,  there have not been any sustained efforts to reduce the availability of  pirated and counterfeit goods in these zones."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Flawed Enforcement Procedures", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. government has identified a variety of problems with the  countries\u2019 IP enforcement procedures and subsequent judicial proceedings  that limit the effectiveness of actions against infringers.

With an  administrative enforcement action, the violator is ordered to stop  performing the infringing activity and is levied a fine. The 2009 Special 301  report states that administrative fines are not consistently levied in China  and are too low to be an effective deterrent for infringers with most seeing  the fines simply as part of the cost of doing business. In the 2009 National  Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers, the U.S. government  reported that documentary and procedural requirements in India have  created impediments to the prosecution of IP violators.

Increased enforcement is also at times viewed as  contributing to economic harm and as being counter to local interests.

According to a U.S. official in  India, this is problematic because much of the pharmaceutical innovation  that occurs today is incremental in nature and builds upon existing  patents. U.S. officials also cited problems with the structure of India\u2019s  system for challenging patent applications. According to these officials,  under India\u2019s current system, patents cannot be granted until all  challenges made by parties are resolved and India\u2019s patent law and  implementing regulations do not set a specific time frame in which such  challenges can be brought against a patent application.

First, agreement on roles and responsibilities of the IP attach\u00e9s  particularly vis-\u00e0-vis the State economic section and post leadership, while  challenging, was achieved in most posts. Prior to the creation of the  attach\u00e9 position at the four posts, State economic officers had primary  responsibility for IP; now, they are the most involved in IP issues after the  IP attach\u00e9s. Thus, it was important that State officials and the IP attach\u00e9 at  each post agree on their respective roles. State economic officers in  Guangzhou and Beijing raised some challenges regarding such agreement,  but they and the IP attach\u00e9s have successfully worked out their  appropriate roles on IP, including dealing with the Chinese government.", "For example, in Guangzhou, the economic officer said that he gathered  information and applied diplomacy to convince the Chinese to improve  their IP protection and that IP attach\u00e9 played a similar role, but also  offered the host government practical means, such as technical assistance.  The economic officer in Beijing said it took some work, but he was able to  balance his role with the subject matter expertise of the attach\u00e9, for  example, deciding when the IP attach\u00e9 should use his expertise to support  the economic officer\u2019s diplomatic efforts and when the IP attach\u00e9 should  work directly with the Chinese government. However, at the post in  Thailand, the lack of consensus between the IP attach\u00e9 and the economic  section and post leadership on the attach\u00e9\u2019s role negatively affected  collaboration. For instance, a State economic officer expressed the view  that the IP attach\u00e9 should primarily provide training and technical  assistance on IP and should have little involvement in policy and  diplomacy matters as the economic section was the primary U.S. face to  the Thai government on IP. According to USPTO officials, the regional role  of the IP attach\u00e9 may have contributed to the perception that the attach\u00e9  was not intended to be the IP focal point at the post. Although the IP  attach\u00e9 was able to promote IP protection and enforcement through  technical assistance programs, the attach\u00e9 wanted to be more fully  included in the embassy\u2019s IP policy considerations, such as more  opportunities to provide her expertise during all phases of the Special 301  process. As a result, one private-sector representative and another U.S.  agency official at the post with whom we spoke expressed confusion  about who to contact on IP at the embassy.", "Another element that contributed to the IP attach\u00e9s\u2019 ability to serve as  effective focal points was that they imparted their subject matter  expertise. For example, IP attach\u00e9s pro-actively shared their IP expertise  among the other agencies such as providing updates on IP laws and  regulations, which had increased awareness of the issue at the posts. A  Foreign Agricultural Service official in Bangkok said that with the IP  attach\u00e9\u2019s expertise, he was able to identify and address IP violations of  agricultural products. He gave an example where an agricultural  cooperator contacted him about the packaging and labeling of one of its  products being copied and sold on host country grocery shelves. The  Foreign Agricultural Service official said that without the IP attach\u00e9\u2019s help,  he would have sent a sample to Washington where it likely would have  been considered a labeling issue rather than the more accurate  designation of counterfeiting.", "In addition, the IP attach\u00e9s had the advantage of working full time on IP.  Several agency officials from all four posts said that they had multiple  responsibilities required by their broad portfolios, and some officials in  some posts said they spent relatively little time on IP. In particular, the  officials from the law enforcement agencies, such as ICE and FBI, at the  posts where they had a presence, stated that IP was not a top priority  given all the other issues they address such as counterterrorism and  internet fraud. A State economic officer in Beijing said that the IP attach\u00e9  compelled agency officials at the post to make time for IP despite other  competing demands, while a State economic officer in New Delhi said that  having the IP attach\u00e9 take the lead on IP had been very helpful and an ICE  official said that the arrival of the IP attach\u00e9 had energized the same post  on IP issues.", "Finally, agency officials cited working with other agencies as a team and  fostering trust and support among U.S. agency and host country  government counterparts as key elements contributing to the attach\u00e9s\u2019  successful role as focal points. For instance, two agency officials at one  post said that the IP attach\u00e9 was a team player who really encouraged  communication on IP with the agencies at the posts. At another post, an  agency official said that the IP attach\u00e9 was very effective in building  relationships with the host government, which, in turn, gave other U.S.  agencies entr\u00e9e to state their case on IP with the host government  officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some IP Attach\u00e9s Created IP Working Groups as Mechanisms for Collaboration", "paragraphs": ["At the embassies in New Delhi and Beijing, the IP attach\u00e9s played a key  role in creating interagency IP working groups soon after their arrival.  Several agency officials at these two posts said that the multiple duties,  heavy demands in terms of official visitors, and the large number of  personnel at the post made it difficult to rely solely on informal  communications to address IP. Accordingly, the IP attach\u00e9s facilitated the  formation of IP working groups for agencies to meet and share  information on IP and update each other on their respective IP activities.  The meetings were usually led by the IP attach\u00e9 and might include  attendees from USTR, the State economic section, the Foreign Agricultural  Service, and the FCS as well as enforcement agencies such as ICE, CBP,  FBI, and DOJ, depending on the agencies located at the two posts.", "Several agency officials in New Delhi and Beijing said that the working  groups provided several advantages. For instance, the working group  meetings allowed agencies to learn, on a regular basis, of each other\u2019s  upcoming activities on IP, hear about news and trends in IP, and  complement each other\u2019s efforts such as arranging to attend each other\u2019s  training programs to lend their particular expertise. One agency official  said that when she first arrived at the post in Beijing, the working group  helped her get up to speed on the IP issues and priorities and take  advantage of opportunities to raise them in her meetings with the host  government.", "The importance of the IP working group and the role of the attach\u00e9 in  Beijing was demonstrated when the working group became inactive after  the attach\u00e9 left the post in August 2008 and the position became vacant.  Two agency officials at the post said that presently without these  meetings, there was less focus on IP at the post. One of these two officials  said that although agency officials had actively exchanged emails since the  attach\u00e9\u2019s departure, a more formal collaborative process would be useful  to ensure that the embassy spoke with one voice on IP. In addition, the  same official said that the meetings were particularly important to  maintain connection with the enforcement side, which he said tends to be  more reluctant to share information with other agencies at the post. At the  consulate in Guangzhou, one agency official said that he had participated  in the embassy\u2019s working group meetings in Beijing by phone until they  were discontinued with the departure of the IP attach\u00e9; he hoped that the  embassy working group meetings would be resumed when the IP attach\u00e9  vacancy was filled, saying that the meetings kept him informed of IP  events at the capital.", "In Thailand, IP issues are covered in two regular, large interagency  meetings at the post: the Economic Cluster and the Law Enforcement  Working Group. In addition, according to the IP attach\u00e9, for the past  couple of years, the attach\u00e9 held periodic informal meetings on IP with  officials from State, DOJ, and DHS to discuss IP issues. The IP attach\u00e9 said  that although participants\u2019 regional responsibilities and travel schedules  prevented regularly scheduled meetings, this group met at least 10 times  from October 2006 to the end of 2008. In late 2008, the IP attach\u00e9 worked  with the Deputy Chief of Mission to establish a more formal IP working  group. The first meeting of the IP working group was in January 2009,  chaired by the Deputy Chief of Mission, and coordinated by the IP attach\u00e9.  As of June 2009, USPTO had instituted a new requirement that the IP  attach\u00e9s and State Department embassy staff in all the posts where IP  attach\u00e9s are posted form an \u201cIPR task force\u201d that meets on a regular  basis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The IP Attach\u00e9s also Leveraged Resources through Joint Activities", "paragraphs": ["The IP attach\u00e9s complemented the efforts of other agencies to enhance IP  protection and enforcement at all four posts by leveraging resources  through joint IP activities with other agency officials.

For example, the attach\u00e9 explained  host country IP regulations to U.S. companies in order to avoid customs  related delays, and produced educational materials on IP for industry  trade shows. In China, an FCS official and the IP attach\u00e9 from Guangzhou  said these efforts helped avoid situations that would lead to more WTO  dispute settlement cases down the road.

In revising the  plan, he said that he expected that the working group would maintain the  original objectives in the plan, which are long term in nature, but that  there would likely be some minor modifications to the approach outlined  for meeting them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Using Joint Strategies to Collaborate on IP at the Posts Can Have Several Benefits", "paragraphs": ["While agencies at the four posts have undertaken IP activities that are  relevant and support U.S. interests, joint strategies such as interagency  work plans can potentially assist posts in prioritizing among their various  demands and help ensure that their activities are part of a strategic  approach to address key IP issues identified by the U.S. government.  Various U.S. officials and private-sector representatives stated that the  level of IP activity has increased at the posts in recent years in large part  due to the arrival of the IP attach\u00e9s and the attention they bring to IP  issues. However, agency officials generally noted that on a day-to-day  basis their activities were not undertaken as part of the implementation of  particular plans to address key IP issues. For example, one agency official  in China stated that his strategy for IP was to simply \u201cjuggle\u201d issues as they  arose.", "The development of interagency work plans can also help to encourage  sustained attention to key IP activities. Some agency officials noted that  the long-term nature of many IP efforts\u2014such as implementing optical  disk laws, developing public outreach to convince consumers of the  importance of IP rights, or building the relationships with foreign law  enforcement officials necessary to conduct joint IP investigations\u2014require  sustained and focused attention over time. In the absence of such  sustained attention, the impacts of U.S. efforts can be diminished. For  instance, an official at one post noted that he had observed a cycle where  the post would exert pressure on the host country\u2019s police to more  aggressively enforce IP laws, and enforcement would increase; however,  after a time, pressure would ease and previous enforcement levels would  return. An official in Beijing noted the challenges to staying focused on  particular issues at such a large post. Whereas, a written plan has helped  the embassy stay on target and not loose focus on IP issues, according to  an official in New Delhi. A different official in New Delhi stated that the  plan would allow the post to keep up momentum on IP and helped ensure  that all the relevant agencies were engaged. Post-level plans can also  minimize the reduction in focus on IP as agency officials transfer in and  out of posts. For instance, one U.S. official in Beijing noted that the IP  attach\u00e9 had driven the post\u2019s day-to-day IP activities, and that when he left  the post, there was no plan to consult to help ensure that agencies  continued to focus on key IP issues. In addition, new personnel can  consult joint strategies to help them more quickly contribute to IP issues.", "Given the cross-cutting nature of IP, interagency post work plans may also  assist agencies in identifying opportunities to avoid redundant activities or  divergent messages, particularly given the multiple agencies at each of the  posts we visited that play some role in IP activities. For example, we  identified over 10 agencies or agency sections that perform IP-related  work at the embassy in Beijing. An agency official in Beijing stated that  there was not a cohesive embassy strategy on IP, with agencies tending to  pursue their individual projects. In addition, we found evidence of  disagreement among agencies in Thailand regarding the appropriate  strategy for working with the host government and upon what issues to  focus. An agency official in Thailand stated that an IP work plan for the  post would help ensure that agencies at the post were knowledgeable  about what was happening on IP and would reduce the risk of duplicative  efforts or inconsistent messages to the host government. An agency  official in India stated that, through the work plan, the post hoped to  maintain a common message on IP."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Improving IP protection and enforcement overseas is challenging because  IP issues are complex and multifaceted. Many IP issues are symptoms of  broader problems the countries face such as weak government institutions  or the lack of a strong historical respect for the rule of law. Addressing the  many challenges associated with improving countries\u2019 IP laws and  regulations and strengthening their enforcement efforts requires extensive  knowledge of a country\u2019s IP regime and the ability to influence a complex  web of policies and procedures under an array of legislative,  administrative, and judicial authorities. The best ways for the United  States to motivate change are not always obvious, particularly while  seeking to preserve good relations and pursue other foreign policy goals.  Adding to the complexity, multiple U.S. agencies are involved in IP and  most of their overseas personnel do not consider IP their primary mission  because they have numerous and more pressing responsibilities.", "U.S. agencies at the four posts are generally collaborating effectively and  have adopted certain key practices to enhance and sustain collaboration,  with the exception of developing joint strategies such as interagency IP  work plans. Such plans can further improve collaboration and maximize  the effectiveness of U.S. government IP efforts at posts by bringing  agencies together to develop and commit to specific objectives and  activities that address the key IP issues. Interagency IP work plans  increase the likelihood that interagency efforts will be sustained  throughout the inevitable shifts in key IP personnel at overseas posts, and  despite the competing demands placed on many agencies for which IP is  not their main mission. By acting as focal points, IP attach\u00e9s have already  spearheaded collaboration among the agencies by facilitating joint U.S.  agency IP efforts and, in some cases, generating mechanisms like IP  working groups for sharing ideas and planning IP events. Recognizing the  importance of such mechanisms, USPTO has recently required that all  posts with IP attach\u00e9s form such working groups. However, currently,  neither the IP attach\u00e9s nor any other post agency official has the  responsibility for facilitating post-wide planning on IP. Instead, planning to  address the key IP issues is dependent on the individual initiative of post  personnel and, thus, to date has been limited to only one of the four posts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To more effectively ensure that activities at U.S. posts with USPTO IP  attach\u00e9s consistently address the key IP protection and enforcement  issues identified by the U.S. government, we recommend that the  Secretary of State direct post leadership in countries with USPTO IP  attach\u00e9s to work with the USPTO IP attach\u00e9s to take the following action:    Develop annual IP interagency work plans to be used by the post IP  working groups with input from relevant agencies, which set objectives  and identify activities for addressing key IP protection and enforcement  issues defined by the U.S. government, taking into account the range of  expertise of responsible agencies, available resources, and agency specific  IP goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Secretaries of Commerce, Health  and Human Services, Homeland Security, and State; the Attorney General;  the U.S. Trade Representative; and the Director of the U.S. Patent and  Trademark Office.

Specifically, this report  (1) describes the key IP protection and enforcement issues that the U.S.  government has identified in China, India, and Thailand; (2) assesses the  extent to which the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) IP  attach\u00e9s and the Department of Justice (DOJ) Intellectual Property Law  Enforcement Coordinator (IPLEC) effectively collaborated with other  agencies at posts in China, India, and Thailand to improve IP protection  and enforcement; and (3) evaluates the extent to which each of the four  posts has undertaken interagency planning in collaborating on their IP- related activities.", "Overall, to determine the scope of our work, we obtained documentation  and interviewed cognizant officials from the Departments of Commerce  (Commerce), Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security  (DHS), Justice (DOJ), and State (State); and from the Office of the U.S.  Trade Representative (USTR). We reviewed documentation on overseas  U.S. government personnel and their IP activities, including which  countries had personnel dedicated to IP issues. We collected and analyzed  documentation that discussed key IP protection and enforcement issues  around the world and that identified those countries where the U.S.  government believes IP problems are most acute, such as documents  related to the Special 301 process, and other agency assessments of  countries\u2019 IP laws and regulations. We determined that our scope would  focus on IP efforts at the embassy/post level and that we would utilize a  case study approach, focusing on selected countries. To select the case  study countries, we used a set of criteria that included: the extent to which  the U.S. government has identified the country and its region as having  significant IP problems, the types and range of IP problems that exist in  the country, and the presence of U.S. government personnel posted in the  country involved in IP activities, including USPTO IP attach\u00e9s and  coverage by a DOJ IPLEC. Based upon our criteria, we chose China, India,  and Thailand. We then conducted fieldwork in Beijing and Guangzhou,  China; Bangkok, Thailand; and New Delhi, India; in March 2009. Because  we utilized a case study approach, our findings cannot be generalized and  do not necessarily apply to countries or posts other than those we visited.", "To address all three objectives, we met with U.S. government personnel in  all four locations who perform IP-related functions to learn about the  types of activities they undertake, the factors that drive their work, and  how they collaborate with their counterparts at the post and in  headquarters, with the private sector, and with their host government.  Table 3 lists the agencies and agency sections we met with at each post.", "We also met with representatives from various industry associations and  individual companies in each location to obtain their perspectives on the  key IP issues in the country and to learn about how they seek to protect  their IP, including through collaboration with the U.S. government and the  host government. Finally, in each location, we met with foreign  government officials to learn about the challenges they face in improving  IP protection and enforcement and to obtain their perspectives on the  effectiveness of their collaboration with the U.S. government on IP issues.", "To address the first objective, we reviewed U.S. government documents  identifying key IP protection and enforcement issues in each of the case  study countries, including each embassy\u2019s Special 301 submission for 2009  and also the final Special 301 reports for 2008 and 2009. Additionally, we  reviewed the 2009 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade  Barriers. We also reviewed other post documentation discussing key IP  issues, including talking points from presentations, internal U.S.  government IP newsletters, agency reports to their headquarters offices,  and materials produced to assist U.S. businesses. Additionally, we  interviewed U.S. government personnel and private-sector representatives  in each of the countries to obtain their perspectives on the key IP  protection and enforcement issues. Our discussion on foreign laws and  regulations in the objective is based primarily on interviews with U.S.  officials and U.S. government documentation, rather than GAO analysis of  those laws.", "To address the second objective, we used information from our interviews  and documentation we collected at each post to evaluate the extent to  which the USPTO attach\u00e9s and DOJ\u2019s IPLEC have adopted good practices  to collaborate with other agencies at the posts on promoting IP protection.  Documents included attach\u00e9 activity summaries, IP seminar agendas, the  IPCEN agendas, IP working group minutes, and technical assistance work  plans. In evaluating the collaboration practices at the four posts, we relied  upon past work that GAO has done that identified key practices that  agencies can adopt in order to sustain and enhance collaboration. For this  objective, we examined select key practices and assessed the extent to  which agencies followed them in carrying out their IP activities at the  posts. Specifically, we evaluated the extent to which agencies at the four  posts had identified and addressed needs by leveraging resources, agreed  on role and responsibilities, and established compatible policies,  procedures, and other means to operate across agency boundaries.", "To address the third objective, we reviewed the 2008 and 2009 Special 301  Reports to determine the extent to which they provide guidance to posts  on IP activities to undertake. We also reviewed each embassy\u2019s fiscal year  2010 Mission Strategic Plan and assessed the extent to which the plans  discuss IP. We assessed the submissions of the embassies in Thailand and  India for the 2009 Special 301 report to determine the extent to which the  embassies had prioritized among various IP issues and set actionable  objectives as well. Additionally, we reviewed the USPTO headquarters  country plans covering the three countries and the USPTO IP attach\u00e9s\u2019  individual work plans and analyzed the types of objectives established in  these plans and the actions that plans call for to address these objectives.  We also reviewed the IPR Working Group Action Plan for the embassy in  New Delhi and assessed the extent to which it serves as a reasonable  guide for the posts\u2019 IP activities. We interviewed U.S. government officials  at all four posts to determine how they select IP activities to undertake  and the extent to which they use interagency planning to guide their  efforts. Based on the information collected through document review and  interviews, we evaluated the extent to which the four posts have utilized  interagency planning on IP to establish mutual reinforcing or joint  strategies. This is a key practice that GAO has identified as contributing to  enhanced and sustained collaboration. Finally, we utilized evidence  collected in our interviews, as well as findings from past GAO work, to  identify potential benefits the posts might achieve by performing  interagency planning to establish joint strategies.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2008 through  September 2009 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.
