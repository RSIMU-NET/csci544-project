Specifically, both programs reimburse SCHs using the greater of either a cost-based amount or the allowed amount under a diagnostic-related-group-based payment system, although each program takes a different approach in implementing these methods. Each program also provides for reimbursement adjustments under specific circumstances. In order to minimize sudden significant reductions in SCHs' TRICARE reimbursements, the revised rules include a transition period during which an eligible SCH is reimbursed using a cost-based ratio that is reduced annually until it matches the SCH's Medicare cost-to-charge ratio, which is calculated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for each hospital. Under TRICARE's revised rules for SCHs, this cost-to-charge ratio will be multiplied by the hospitals' billed charges to determine their reimbursement amounts. Most SCHs\u2014about 74 percent\u2014qualified for a transition to their Medicare cost-to-charge ratios.", "Because most SCHs have just completed the first year of a multi-year transition, it is too early to determine the full effect of the revised reimbursement rules, including any impact on TRICARE beneficiaries' access to care at these hospitals. Nonetheless, early indications show that TRICARE beneficiaries have not experienced problems accessing inpatient care at these facilities. Specifically, Defense Health Agency (DHA) officials reported that they do not think access to inpatient care at SCHs will be an issue because hospitals that participate in the Medicare program are required to participate in the TRICARE program and serve its beneficiaries. Although some of them were not familiar with this requirement, officials from the 10 SCHs GAO interviewed with the highest number of TRICARE admissions, the highest reimbursement amounts, or both, stated that they provide care to all patients, including TRICARE beneficiaries. DHA officials also said that they track access issues pertaining to inpatient care at SCHs through concerns or complaints, and as of February 2015, they had not received any access complaints. They noted that they are still looking at ways to measure changes in access to care at these facilities and will likely focus on the 44 SCHs that had 100 or more TRICARE admissions. In addition, other stakeholders, including representatives of national health care associations and military beneficiary coalition groups, said that they are not aware of TRICARE beneficiaries having difficulty accessing care at SCHs. Moreover, in its analysis of available Medicare data for these facilities (427 of 459 SCHs), GAO found that overall TRICARE reimbursements for SCHs averaged less than 1 percent of SCHs' net patient revenue, with TRICARE beneficiaries making up just over 1 percent of their total discharges for fiscal year 2013. As a result, the impact of TRICARE's revised reimbursement rules may likely be small for most SCHs.", "GAO provided a draft of this report to the Department of Defense (DOD) for comment.

Until recently, TRICARE  exempted sole community hospitals (SCH)\u2014which provide health care in  rural areas or where like hospitals do not exist under certain criteria\u2014 from reimbursement under its DRG-based payment system. Under  Medicare, SCHs qualified for special payment provisions that were based  on historical hospital costs and other factors.

We used these data to  assess the frequency of TRICARE admissions to identify TRICARE  beneficiaries\u2019 utilization of inpatient care at these facilities.

We also  contacted each of the military services to determine whether an SCH was  located near a military hospital that had closed or no longer offered  inpatient care since 2012, and we interviewed officials at these locations  to assess beneficiaries\u2019 reliance on these SCHs and whether their access  had been impaired. We interviewed officials from DHA, the three  TRICARE Regional Offices (North, South, and West), and the three  regional TRICARE managed care support contractors (UnitedHealthcare  Military & Veterans Services, Humana Military Healthcare Services, and  Health Net Federal Services) about changes in the reimbursement rules,  the effect of the changes on SCHs, and the effect on TRICARE  beneficiaries\u2019 access to care at these facilities.

Prime Service Areas are geographically  defined by a set of 5-digit zip codes, usually within an approximate   40-mile radius of a military treatment facility. These civilian provider  networks are required to meet specific access standards for certain types  of TRICARE beneficiaries, such as travel times or wait times for  appointments. However, these access standards do not apply to  inpatient care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TRICARE\u2019s Reimbursement Rules for Hospitals", "paragraphs": ["Since 1987, DHA has reimbursed hospitals for claims using the agency\u2019s  DRG-based payment system, which was modeled after Medicare\u2019s  system. Under this system, claims are priced using an annual standard  amount and a weighted value for each DRG. For example, in fiscal year  2014, the TRICARE annual standard amount was approximately  $5,500.00. Payment weights are assigned to each DRG based on the  average resources used to treat patients. For example, in fiscal year  2014, a lung transplant had a weight of 8.6099, which would be multiplied  by the annual standard payment amount ($5,500.00) for a reimbursement  of $47,354.45. TRICARE\u2019s DRG-based payment system differs from  Medicare\u2019s DRG-based payment system in that each program has  different annual standard amounts and different DRG weights due to  differences in the characteristics of their beneficiary populations. For  example, Medicare\u2019s population, which is generally older and less healthy  than TRICARE\u2019s population, may require more resources and may  require longer inpatient lengths of stay. Also, some services, notably  obstetric and pediatric services, are nearly absent from Medicare, but are  a much larger component of TRICARE\u2019s services.", "SCHs were exempted from DHA\u2019s DRG-based payment system because  they had special payment provisions under Medicare that allowed for  payments based on historical costs as well as certain types of  adjustments, such as additional payments for significant volume  decreases defined as a more than 5 percent decrease in total inpatient  discharges as compared to the immediately preceding cost reporting  period. Instead, DHA generally reimbursed SCHs based on their billed  charges for inpatient care provided to TRICARE beneficiaries. However,  distinctions were made among providers based on network status.  Specifically, nonnetwork SCHs were reimbursed for their billed charges,  and network hospitals were reimbursed based on their billed charges less  any discounts that they negotiated with the managed care support  contractors."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "TRICARE\u2019s Revised Reimbursement Rules for SCHs Approximate Those for Medicare", "paragraphs": ["Under its revised reimbursement rules for SCHs, DHA\u2019s methodology for  TRICARE approximates the rules for Medicare for these hospitals.  Specifically, both programs reimburse SCHs using the greater of either a  cost-based amount or the allowed amount under a DRG-based payment  system. However, each program takes a different approach in  implementing these methods.", "Medicare reimburses each SCH based on which of the following methods  yields the greatest aggregate payment for that hospital: (1) the updated  hospital-specific rate based on cost per discharge from fiscal year 1982,  (2) the updated hospital-specific rate based on cost per discharge from  fiscal year 1987, (3) the updated hospital-specific rate based on cost per  discharge from fiscal year 1996, (4) the updated hospital-specific rate  based on cost per discharge from fiscal year 2006, or (5) the IPPS  hospital-specific DRG rate payment. Medicare\u2019s reimbursement rules  also include payment adjustments that SCHs may receive under special  programs or circumstances, such as adjustments to SCHs that  experience significant volume decreases.", "Beginning January 1, 2014, TRICARE began reimbursing SCHs based  upon the greater of (1) the SCH\u2019s Medicare cost-to-charge ratio, or (2)  TRICARE\u2019s DRG-based payment system. The Medicare cost-to-charge  ratio that TRICARE uses is calculated for each hospital by CMS and is  distinct from the historical hospital-specific rates based on the cost per  discharge that Medicare uses to reimburse SCHs. Under TRICARE\u2019s  revised rules for SCHs, the cost-to-charge ratio will be multiplied by each  hospital\u2019s billed charges to determine its reimbursement amount. Also, at  the end of each year, DHA calculates the aggregate amount that each  SCH would have been reimbursed under TRICARE\u2019s DRG-based  payment system, which it uses to reimburse other hospitals that provide  inpatient care to TRICARE beneficiaries. If an SCH\u2019s aggregate  reimbursement would have been more under this system than it would  have using the Medicare cost-to-charge ratio, DHA pays the SCH the  difference. TRICARE\u2019s revised reimbursement rules also include payment  adjustments that SCHs may receive under special circumstances,  although the specific TRICARE adjustments differ from those available  under Medicare. For example, effective with the revised reimbursement  rules, SCHs may qualify for a General Temporary Military Contingency  Payment Adjustment if they meet certain criteria, including serving a  disproportionate share of active duty servicemembers and their  dependents\u201410 percent or more of the SCH\u2019s total admissions. At the  time of our review, DHA officials did not have an estimate of the number  of SCHs that would qualify for this adjustment.", "Under TRICARE\u2019s revised rules, some SCHs\u2014which were previously  reimbursed at up to 100 percent of their billed charges\u2014will eventually be  reimbursed at 30 to 50 percent of their billed charges. In order to  minimize sudden significant reimbursement reductions on SCHs, DHA\u2019s  revised rules include a transition period to the new reimbursement levels  for most SCHs. Eligible SCHs are reimbursed using an individually  derived base-year ratio that is reduced annually until it matches the  SCH\u2019s Medicare cost-to-charge ratio that CMS has calculated for each  hospital. For each hospital designated as an SCH during fiscal year 2012,  DHA calculated a base-year ratio of their allowed-to-billed charges using  fiscal year 2012 TRICARE claims data. Based on these calculations,  each SCH fell into one of two categories: (1) SCHs with base-year ratios  higher than their Medicare cost-to-charge ratios, or (2) SCHs with base- year ratios lower than, or equal to, their Medicare cost-to-charge ratios.", "Most SCHs fell into the first category with base-year ratios higher than  their Medicare cost-to-charge ratios (339 or 74 percent), which qualified  them for a transition period. For these SCHs, their base-year ratios are  reduced annually based on their network participation status, and their  modified ratios are multiplied by their billed charges beginning January 1,  2014. Specifically, a nonnetwork SCH has no more than a 15 percentage  point reduction each year, while a network SCH has no more than a   10 percentage point reduction as its reimbursement level declines to its  respective Medicare cost-to-charge ratio. The length of the transition  period differs for each SCH and is determined by the difference between  its base-year ratio and its Medicare cost-to-charge ratio, and its network  status. Figure 1 shows an example of the transition for a network SCH  with a 95 percent base-year ratio that is transitioning to a Medicare cost- to-charge ratio of 40 percent. As a network provider, the SCH\u2019s base-year  ratio would be reduced by 10 percentage points to 85 percent during the  first year of implementation of the revised rules and would continue to be  reduced until its reimbursement ratio matches the SCH\u2019s Medicare ratio   5 years later.", "Twenty-four percent (111 of 459) of the hospitals that were designated as  SCHs during fiscal year 2012 with base-year ratios less than or equal to  their Medicare cost-to-charge ratios did not qualify for a transition period  because either their reimbursement increased to their Medicare cost-to- charge ratio, or they continued to be reimbursed at their Medicare cost-to- charge ratio. Similarly, about 2 percent (9 of 459) of the hospitals that  were not designated as SCH in fiscal year 2012 also did not qualify for a  transition period. Instead, these SCHs are now reimbursed using their  Medicare cost-to-charge ratio in accordance with TRICARE\u2019s revised  reimbursement rules.", "Once an SCH reaches its Medicare cost-to-charge ratio, TRICARE  reimburses labor, delivery, and nursery care services at 130 percent of  this ratio. This rule is based on DHA\u2019s assessment that Medicare\u2019s ratio  does not accurately reflect the costs for these services. According to  TRICARE\u2019s fiscal year 2013 claims data, 120 SCHs (approximately   30 percent of all SCHs) were already reimbursed using rates that were   at or below their Medicare cost-to-charge ratios."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Early Indications Show That Access to Care Has Not Been Affected by TRICARE\u2019s Revised Reimbursement Rules for SCHs", "paragraphs": ["Because most SCHs have just completed the first year of a multi-year  transition, it is too early to determine the full effect of the revised  reimbursement rules on SCHs, including any effect on TRICARE  beneficiaries\u2019 ability to obtain care at these hospitals.

See table 1 for TRICARE percentages of net patient revenue and total  discharges for each of these SCHs.", "However, TRICARE beneficiaries\u2019 access to care at SCHs could be  affected if these hospitals reduced or eliminated their inpatient services.  The SCH officials we spoke with told us that they had not reduced the  inpatient services available at their hospitals as a result of TRICARE\u2019s  revised reimbursement rules. However, officials at two SCHs did express  concerns about future difficulties maintaining their current level of  operations as they face further reductions in reimbursements not only  from TRICARE, but also from other sources, such as Medicare and  Medicaid. These officials said that they are concerned about their  facilities\u2019 long-term survival. Given the current environment of decreasing  reimbursements, some SCHs we interviewed reported taking proactive  steps, such as eliminating equipment maintenance contracts, to help  offset the reimbursement reductions. Officials from one facility we  interviewed told us that they are considering an option to partner with  another SCH as a way to increase efficiency.", "TRICARE beneficiaries\u2019 demand for inpatient care at SCHs also may be  affected by the availability of inpatient care from their respective military  installation.

An official with Naval Hospital Camp  Lejeune (North Carolina) told us the hospital relies on local SCHs  because it is either unable to meet their beneficiaries\u2019 demand for certain  services, such as obstetric care, or because the SCHs offer services not  available at the Naval hospital, such as some cardiac care. Naval  Hospital Beaufort (South Carolina) provides limited inpatient services, and  according to an official there, most of that hospital\u2019s beneficiaries obtain  inpatient care at the local SCH, including intensive care, all pediatric care,  maternity and newborn care, and certain types of specialty care not  provided at the Naval hospital (neurology, cardiology, and  gastroenterology).", "We also interviewed officials at two additional military hospitals\u2014Naval  Hospital Lemoore (California) and Naval Hospital Oak Harbor  (Washington)\u2014that had eliminated all or most of their inpatient care and  were within 40 miles of an SCH.
