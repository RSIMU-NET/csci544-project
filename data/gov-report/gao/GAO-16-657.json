GSA administers and revises the FTR\u2014which interprets statutory and other policy requirements to ensure that official travel is conducted responsibly\u2014and minimizes administrative costs. Although GSA does not have the authority to enforce the FTR, it issues FTR amendments and travel bulletins to help federal agencies manage their respective travel programs and achieve travel cost savings through the provisions contained in the amendments and travel bulletins. GSA FTR amendments and travel bulletins issued between fiscal years 2011 and 2015 contained a total of 27 cost-saving provisions. Agency officials at each of the six selected agencies stated that their respective agencies either had policies in place that already addressed the cost-saving provisions; developed new travel policies or issued guidance that reinforced the provisions or updated existing policies related to the provisions; or advised employees to follow the FTR without implementing an agency-specific policy.", "The six agencies reported that GSA's review of the FTR to revise obsolete and outdated policies influenced their actions and resulted in cost savings. However, most of these savings could not be quantified. Only four cost-saving efforts at two agencies\u2014the Departments of Defense and Justice\u2014could be quantified. These agencies reported that a wide range of factors influenced their cost-saving efforts. In addition to FTR-compliance efforts, these agencies reported that administration actions on reducing travel costs, cutting waste, and promoting efficient spending influenced their approaches to managing travel costs. Agency officials also reported that broader efforts to improve operational efficiency, and efforts to responsibly use resources, also influenced their agency-specific policies and practices to promote efficient travel spending.", "According to GSA and officials from the six selected agencies, data limitations existed both within the selected agencies in terms of their ability to quantify travel-related cost savings, and government-wide in terms of comparing and aggregating travel data across agencies. Without standardized reporting practices, the federal government lacks common metrics for identifying, comparing and evaluating travel spending across federal agencies. The Senior Travel Official Council (STOC) was formed in 2015 to identify efficiencies and discuss best practices related to travel cost savings. According to its charter, the STOC allows agencies to work toward more consistent reporting of travel data and share information on cost-saving efforts. Although the STOC has taken some initial action to bring agencies together, additional efforts to facilitate agencies' information sharing and identification of promising practices could further enhance these efforts to encourage and achieve travel cost-saving across the federal government."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Administrator of GSA should work with the STOC to: 1) develop a travel data management approach that would provide GSA with more consistent travel cost data; and 2) as chair of the STOC, identify and implement promising practices to help agencies leverage travel resources and achieve cost savings."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies rely on travel to achieve a broad range of missions such  as the Federal Emergency Management Agency responding to natural  disasters, and the Department of Agriculture inspecting food quality.

Some of the agencies\u2019 cost-saving efforts  involved these agencies updating internal policy statements, issuing  internal guidance, configuring their ETS2 to require justifications for  making a policy exception, and providing in-person and web-based  trainings. For example, Department of Defense (DOD) officials stated that  for half of the travel bulletin provisions (10 of 20) DOD\u2019s related actions  had been in effect since at least 1998. In one instance, DOD included a  provision in the December 1998 Joint Travel Regulations (JTR) that  limited reimbursement of employees buying rental car insurance. This  included the collision damage waiver adjustment and theft protection.  This aligned with the 2014 GSA Bulletin FTR 14-05\u2019s guidance  recommending that travelers decline additional insurance when renting  vehicles. Similarly, the Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) travel  system contained a restriction prompting travelers to provide a  justification for not using a CPP fare, as well as confirmation that the  alternative air fare is greater than the \u201cleast logical airfare plus 75.00  dollars.\u201d In addition, USDA\u2019s internal travel policies state that each  agency and staff office is expected to use the method of travel most  advantageous to the government, including lower-cost airfares."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Agencies Developed New Policies or Guidance to Reinforce or Update Existing Internal Travel Policies", "paragraphs": ["According to officials at the six selected agencies, they were already  taking action to address the issues introduced by FTR amendments and  GSA travel bulletins.

For example, according to officials at the Department  of State (State), while the agency had codified the requirement for using  contract air carriers in its own Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) at least as  early as 2005, the more recent GSA travel bulletin on contract and  noncontract airfares influenced State to reinforce the policy by issuing  departmental notices and cables to all diplomatic and consular posts  outlining the parameters for the use of commercial airfares. Similarly,  DOD officials said that the agency addressed two cost-saving provisions  within the same GSA travel bulletin by taking a new action to augment an  existing policy. One provision addressed the issue of reviewing internal  policies to ensure that the agency\u2019s use of CPP contract and non-contract  air carriers resulted in overall cost savings. The other provision addressed  agencies\u2019 management of their internal procedures to assess risk  associated with using non-contract fares, which officials said they  addressed through the same cost-saving effort. DOD officials stated that  they had already taken a related action prior to the issuance of the  bulletin. However, the travel bulletin resulted in DOD updating the JTR by  strengthening the language related to using restricted fares and requiring  the use of a Decision Support Tool to assist in determining if a restricted  fare may be advantageous to the government.", "In other cases, FTR amendments or GSA travel bulletins prompted the  six agencies to take new actions. In these instances, these agencies took  action as a direct result of the recently-issued GSA provisions for which  they had not previously pursued a related cost-saving effort. This usually  happened through the development of a new agency-specific travel policy  or the issuance of a memorandum to staff reminding them of existing  agency travel policy. For example, one FTR amendment addressed the  use of rental cars that resulted in the Department of Justice (DOJ) issuing  a memorandum advising travelers that pre-paid fueling options for rental  vehicles are not authorized according to the amendment. This was a cost- saving effort that the agency had not pursued prior to the amendment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Agencies Advised and Reminded Employees to Continue Following the FTR in a Variety of Additional Ways", "paragraphs": ["Officials at five of the six selected agencies described a few cases where  their respective agencies took no specific policy action, but either: 1)  advised employees to follow the FTR; 2) asked individual components to  create unique policies that ensured FTR compliance; or 3) provided  approving officials with the discretion to oversee employees\u2019 compliance  with the FTR as appropriate, and determine whether or how to adopt  promising practices from the GSA travel bulletins. For example, according  to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials, employees were  reminded to follow the FTR. However, if any of the agency\u2019s components  needed to clarify or address parts of the FTR not specifically covered by  the agency\u2019s Financial Management Policy Manual (FMPM), DHS  empowered them to do so. For example, FMPM does not have a specific  policy prohibiting reimbursement for purchasing pre-paid fueling options  for rental cars, a GSA requirement. However, DHS officials stated that  employees were asked to \u201cexercise the same care in incurring expenses  that a prudent person would exercise if using his or her personal funds  while on personal business.\u201d According to officials, components and  travelers were still responsible for adjusting their travel actions to remain  compliant with the FTR even when DHS policy could not be promptly  updated. According to DHS officials, \u201cas questions are raised by the  travelers, the policy staff at each component provides the guidance  necessary to maintain FTR compliance.\u201d", "In another example, officials at State refrained from taking a policy action  to address two provisions in GSA Bulletin FTR 13-03 because the  department wanted to provide approving officials with some discretion  over travel decisions on individual trips and vouchers, such as  determining if a rental car is a better option than public transportation for  travelers, and whether travelers should be required to share rental cars  and taxis while on official travel in groups and when public transportation  is not a better option. The cost of transportation is among many factors  approving officials weigh when deciding. Given a wide diversity of factors  across global locations in safe, secure, and available local transportation  options, State officials told us that at that time they did not dictate a  centralized policy on employee sharing of rental cars and taxis in order to  leave this discretion to the traveler\u2019s approving official. Use of public  transportation over rental car usage, remains in the traveler\u2019s approving  official\u2019s discretion. State subsequently updated their FAM on Dec 7th,  2015 with specific provisions for rental cars on official travel. They said  this allows approving officials the discretion to apply the prudent traveler  rule, which in application \u201cshould clearly require employees to share  rental cars while on official travel in groups.\u201d", "We also found that the selected agencies initiated travel cost-saving  efforts that were in addition to provisions recommended by GSA. For  example, a September 2015 Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO)  report\u2014DOD Travel Reform\u2014said that DTMO tracked numerous cost- saving travel reform initiatives for policy simplification that it pursued  outside of the actions taken related to GSA\u2019s bulletins and FTR  amendments. These initiatives include: 1) standardization of  reimbursement rates for privately-owned vehicles into a single rate; 2)  creation of a standard travel rate to ensure that per diem is very limited  for trips in which it takes a day to travel to a temporary duty (TDY) travel  location; and 3) expansion of the definition of incidental expenses to  include miscellaneous expenses.", "In another example, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) officials  stated that in addition to the web-based training material providing for  reduced per diem for long-term TDY, VA had additional requirements that  were beyond the scope of GSA\u2019s bulletins and FTR amendments and that  targeted additional cost savings.

GSA established the STOC in 2015 to  identify consistencies and best practices in the areas of travel policy,  programs, and procurement. According to GSA officials, STOC is  designed to help agencies make better use of their travel cost data to  make informed decisions about internal policymaking and replicate  actions taken by other agencies that implemented successful cost-saving  policies and practices.", "According to STOC meeting minutes, the council has taken some steps  toward information-sharing efforts that could benefit all federal agencies.  For example, in 2015, the council initiated a pilot program involving eight  agencies to share promising practices in five areas: online booking,  airfare savings, hotel reservations, car rentals, and SmartPay usage.  Based on the pilot, STOC will come up with policies and processes that  other agencies can choose and implement. In a December 2015 STOC  meeting, officials from DOJ and the National Science Foundation  provided information on actions they took prior to the pilot, and how those  actions resulted in cost savings at their agencies. DOJ noted that their  cost savings programs had top-down agency support and agency officials  implemented a policy change that required online booking and the lowest  logical airfare. By implementing this policy, DOJ officials claimed a  savings of more than $9.2 million when using lowest logical airfare (non- refundable tickets) and an online booking rate of 68 percent in fiscal year  2015. According to GSA officials, the STOC plans to encourage agencies  to pursue these policies beyond the pilot program.", "However, according to GSA officials and STOC meeting minutes, STOC  members have yet to take full advantage of the STOC to network and  learn about other agency-initiated policies that could lead to potential cost  savings. According to GSA officials, the STOC members had not yet  formally shared much information about other promising practices for  tracking and monitoring savings that could be replicated to benefit other  federal agencies. However, these officials said that the STOC is still in the  early stages, and opportunities for agencies to share information have  been limited. Such practices could help agencies to develop and  implement cost-saving efforts, and quantify those efforts when possible.  Without using the STOC meetings to engage in information sharing about  these practices, agencies have a limited ability to learn from and apply  other agencies\u2019 methods for using E-Gov Travel Service 2 (ETS2) data  reports to track and monitor the impact and effectiveness of their policies  on travel spending reductions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Most Efforts to Reduce Agency Travel-Related Spending Could Not Be Quantified", "paragraphs": ["Only four cost-saving efforts at two of the selected agencies\u2014DOJ and  DOD\u2014could be quantified.

DOD officials also reported quantifiable cost-savings related to a GSA  provision\u2014which promoted implementing a per diem reduction for travel  over 30 days that DOD adopted by mandating a per diem reduction to  75 percent of the locality rate for TDY at a single location that extends  between 31 and 180 days and 55 percent for TDY of 181 or more days\u2014 that resulted in savings of over $56 million between November 2014 and  December 2015.", "Although most cost-saving efforts at the selected agencies were not  quantifiable, agency officials described how cost savings were likely  achieved and what data limitations existed. Officials said that attempting  to quantify many of the cost savings efforts would be a very labor  intensive effort, and would require documenting the cost of decisions  which are not made at the individual travel voucher level. For example, at  VA, a travel policy stipulated that in selecting a particular local  transportation method, the agency should consider, among other things,  the accessibility and availability of public transportation at the TDY  location. Therefore, VA officials said they did not approve car rentals in  areas where public transportation is accessible and available, such as  Washington, D.C. While VA officials stated that this approach likely  resulted in cost savings by having travelers avoid expensive hotels and  city parking fees, they could not quantify these cost savings.", "In other instances, the selected agencies could not provide evidence of  quantifiable cost savings at the aggregate level because travel data were  not available from certain components within their agencies. For example,  many sub-agencies within DHS kept track of and reported some cost  savings through the elimination of non-mission critical travel, and by  maximizing the use of conference calls and web-based training and  meetings. However, DHS did not track such savings at the department  level and could not quantify them for us. According to DHS officials, they  were unable to determine or quantify cost savings at an aggregate level  for most measures because DHS components had a wide variety of ways  to avoid costs that were most appropriate for their unique missions, and  the agency did not have a tracking mechanism to identify costs avoided.  In addition, State officials said that there may be some limitations in their  ability to collect and report data since travel at State is decentralized with  each office authorizing, conducting, and collecting its own travel data.", "Generally, it was not possible for most of the selected agencies to  associate any one description of cost savings with a specific GSA  provision. Officials at the agencies we interviewed told us that a wide  range of factors influenced cost-saving efforts, including, but not limited  to, GSA provisions contained within FTR amendments or GSA travel  bulletins. For example, in addition to responding to GSA provisions at  DHS, officials credited the Secretary\u2019s initiative to cut costs and improve  overall operational efficiency as a reason for taking action on some of the  same issues later recommended by GSA. Officials also cited other  government-wide factors including requirements under Executive Order  13589 and OMB Memorandum M-12-12 that influenced cost saving  efforts at agencies at the same time officials responded to GSA\u2019s cost- saving provisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Travel Data System Limitations Hinder Agencies\u2019 Ability to Identify Cost Savings", "paragraphs": ["According to officials at five of the six selected agencies, a number of  limitations in the travel data system designed by GSA and maintained by  the agencies affected their ability to identify cost savings related to  implementation of cost-saving provisions in FTR amendments and GSA  travel bulletins. GSA officials stated that while most agencies have the  capability via ETS2 to track, monitor, and report on cost savings, this  reporting capability is not being leveraged consistently across the federal  agencies to manage their travel costs. However, because agencies can  customize ETS2 to fit their particular needs, these advances may still not  provide for common reporting of travel information across federal  agencies. Further, officials at GSA confirmed that while ETS2 offers  better tracking and monitoring of travel costs compared to its  predecessor, it still cannot provide for a central means of collecting and  reporting data that would be reliable for the purposes of comparison  across agencies.", "Access to quality travel data is essential to performing key travel  management tasks. The 2015 Government-wide Travel Advisory  Committee (GTAC) final report stated that access to quality data requires  maintaining data from multiple sources in an integrated framework  whether a system, database, or data management tool that would allow  federal agencies to compile and maintain enterprise-level travel data  sufficient to support business decisions, respond to government-wide  data calls, leverage sourcing strategies, and comply with the Government  Performance and Results Act of 1993. However, GTAC found that the  federal government still had not started maintaining data from multiple  sources in a single, centralized, and integrated framework, whether a  system, database, or data management tool. The report\u2019s findings  supported the GSA officials\u2019 statements. According to GSA officials, there  is a need for more standardization in travel management reports to give  GSA the ability to compare travel cost data between agencies that use  either of the two ETS2 vendors, and report government-wide trends.  Agencies\u2019 abilities to customize their reporting options without also  meeting standard reporting requirements hinder GSA\u2019s ability to establish  a common metric for tracking and monitoring federal travel spending.  Agencies are also unable to fully assess the travel costs incurred by their  staff. Thus, they are unable to fully identify areas for potential cost  savings.", "ETS2 allows agencies the option to select between two vendors who can  assist them with the tracking and monitoring of travel cost data. Agencies  can customize and configure their travel data systems to meet their travel  needs in alignment with their policies and business needs. According to  GSA officials, because agencies can customize and configure their travel  data systems, and because of the lack of government-wide standards on  cost savings metrics, it is difficult for GSA to facilitate peer-to-peer  comparisons across the federal agencies. For example, officials said that  while both ETS2 vendors have a standard report to help agencies  determine their hotel attachment rates within the system, one vendor\u2019s  report collects information on hotels booked within the data travel system,  and the other vendor\u2019s report collects information on hotels booked  outside of the data travel system. As a result, it is difficult for agencies  and GSA to determine if travelers at all agencies are taking advantage of  the reduced rates available when booking their lodging along with  transportation.", "Additionally, one of the goals of ETS2 is to help agencies achieve greater  data transparency. The required TRIP reports provide travel spending  information that was previously not tracked in ETS. This includes  breaking out the travel and lodging costs into the five different categories  of federal travel. Because of a standardized template used to generate  the TRIP reports and the increased capacity of ETS2, agencies are now  able to report travel spending in more consistent formats. While this  indicates the potential for a greater level of tracking and monitoring of  travel spending by agencies, GSA officials believe that this may not be  achieved unless agencies adopt common reporting practices.", "According to GSA officials, in late 2015, they began to plan a shared  services model to help agencies better manage their travel programs.  This model would allow agencies to share a wide range of travel services  with each other to reduce both administrative costs and burden to the  government, and enable data-driven decision making. According to GSA  officials, based on the draft business plan the shared services model  would be able offer government-wide data collection, benchmarking, and  reporting standards that agency managers can access and use to inform  decisions. According to officials, under the shared services model, while  the agencies would still be the decision makers regarding agency-specific  travel policies, GSA would be able to advise them on which system  configuration would allow the agencies to obtain the lowest travel costs  relative to mission objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The six selected agencies that accounted for more than three-quarters of  federal travel dollars (Agriculture, Defense, Homeland Security, Justice,  State, and Veterans Affairs) did pursue a variety of efforts aimed at  reducing travel costs that generally aligned with GSA\u2019s amendments to  the FTR and travel bulletins. However, these agencies generally lacked  data to track these efforts. GSA\u2019s efforts to track and monitor travel costs  across federal agencies is similarly limited by a lack of standardized data  as reported by individual agencies. More standardized data reporting  could help GSA advise agencies on how to limit travel costs while still  achieving their agencies\u2019 missions.", "GSA created the STOC to identify efficiencies and discuss practices for  achieving travel cost savings. However, STOC members have not yet  taken full advantage of this opportunity. As the STOC moves forward,  opportunities exist to help agencies share information. Additional attention  to these issues by STOC can help agencies develop, implement, and  share their travel cost-saving efforts. Such additional attention to these  issues could in turn help STOC promote the more efficient use of travel  funds across the federal government without imposing additional  requirements on agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["The Administrator of General Services, in consultation with the STOC,  should develop a travel data management approach, including common  reporting formats that would provide GSA with more consistent travel cost  data allowing GSA to compare travel costs across federal agencies.
