States select a subset of homes as SFFs from a list of the 15 poorest performing homes in each state, but the program is limited to 136 homes nationwide because of resource constraints. CMS guidance directs states to survey SFFs twice as frequently as other homes and to propose more robust enforcement, including termination, for SFFs that fail to improve within about 18 months. GAO was asked to (1) determine the factors states consider in selecting SFFs and how SFFs differed from other nursing homes, (2) evaluate CMS regional office and state adherence to program guidance and the program's impact on homes' performance, and (3) identify other strategies that have been used to improve poorly performing homes. In general, GAO's analysis used CMS data from 2005 through 2009 on SFFs and other homes as well as interviews with officials in 14 states selected based on the number of SFFs in each state and other factors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["When selecting SFFs from the candidate list, state officials considered factors other than rank on that list, such as their own knowledge of each candidate's circumstances. For example, state officials might not select a nursing home as an SFF if the home had a new owner they perceived as committed to addressing the home's quality problems. GAO found that states selected SFFs from among the five worst-ranked candidates about 57 percent of the time from January 2006 through February 2009. State discretion in selecting SFFs is key not only because of states' familiarity with each candidate's circumstances but because the list has limitations. Some officials from the 14 states that GAO interviewed noted that candidate lists included current SFFs, resulting in an insufficient number of homes from which to select new SFFs. The characteristics of SFFs differed from those of other nursing homes in terms of organization type and the number of beds and residents. For example, SFFs were more likely than other homes to be chain affiliated and for-profit and to have more beds and more total residents. GAO found that some states did not consistently follow CMS's basic SFF Program requirements. When CMS began monitoring SFF survey frequency in fiscal year 2008, 8 states did not conduct twice as many surveys for SFFs as required--a significant improvement compared to 26 states in the previous fiscal year. GAO also found that CMS's enforcement guidance is vague and results in inconsistent interpretations. For example, one SFF was assessed no civil money penalties (CMP) even though it was cited for consecutive deficiencies that could have resulted in fines of up to $825 per day of noncompliance while a home with a similar compliance history was assessed CMPs that increased from $300 to $600 per day of noncompliance. Most SFFs did eventually graduate, but not all met CMS's graduation criteria, and some SFFs remained in the program well beyond CMS's expected 18-month time frame for improvement. For example, 17 percent of active SFFs as of February 2009 had been in the program for 25 months or longer--some since 2005. However, most graduates showed significant improvement while in the program but some failed to sustain that improved performance after graduation. CMS and states have used a variety of additional strategies to help address care problems identified at SFFs and other nursing homes. For example, a few CMS regional offices have negotiated agreements requiring SFFs to take specific actions, such as hiring quality improvement consultants. In addition, each year one SFF per state can volunteer to work with an organization under contract with CMS to deal more directly with the root causes of poor quality. Some states have adopted their own quality improvement strategies that offer assistance to both poorly performing and other homes, including on-site technical assistance from nurse consultants or monthly training opportunities for nursing home staff on the most frequently cited care problems. Further, one state charges homes for the cost of additional surveys that it conducts under a program that resembles the SFF Program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The nation\u2019s 1.4 million nursing home residents are a highly vulnerable  population of elderly and disabled individuals who rely on nursing homes  to provide high-quality care. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS) contracts with state survey agencies to conduct  inspections, known as standard surveys, and complaint investigations to  determine whether nursing homes are complying with federal quality  standards. Nursing homes must meet those standards to participate in  Medicare and Medicaid. Our prior reports have found that some nursing  homes are chronically noncompliant; that is, they have been cited  repeatedly by state survey agencies for serious deficiencies such as  residents having preventable pressure sores that harmed them or put them  at risk of death or serious injury. In 1998, CMS developed the Special  Focus Facility (SFF) Program to monitor two poorly performing nursing  homes per state, as one way to address issues of chronic noncompliance  and improve the performance of these nursing homes. CMS\u2019s program  guidance directs states to conduct more extensive oversight of SFFs and  the agency\u2019s regional offices to monitor state implementation of the SFF  Program. CMS expanded the program\u2019s size in 2005 to 136 SFFs and up to  6 per state\u2014less than 1 percent of the nation\u2019s roughly 16,000 nursing  homes\u2014and since then has issued additional guidance to states regarding  the operation of the SFF Program.

Our August 2009 report estimated the  number and characteristics of homes in the United States that could be  considered the most poorly performing. We found that (1) about 580   (4 percent) of the nation\u2019s nursing homes could be considered the most  poorly performing and (2) the homes selected as SFFs are not necessarily  the most poorly performing homes in the nation but rather are among the  poorest performers in each state. To improve the targeting of scarce  resources, we recommended that the Administrator of CMS consider an  alternative approach for allocating the 136 SFFs across states by placing  more emphasis on the relative performance of homes nationally rather  than on a state-by-state basis, which could result in some states having  only one or not any SFFs and other states having more than they are  currently allocated. In response, CMS noted that it would evaluate a hybrid  approach that would assign some SFFs using homes\u2019 performance in each  state and other SFFs on their relative national ranking.", "In this report, we examined the operation of the SFF Program.

States provide additional scrutiny of SFFs by  conducting two surveys per fiscal year for each SFF, which is twice as  frequent as at other nursing homes. CMS measures each state\u2019s  compliance with this requirement annually through state performance  reviews. The state performance reviews emphasize three aspects of  the survey program: survey timeliness, survey quality, and the  enforcement and remedy of problems found during surveys. If a  regional office determines that a state has not conducted two surveys  for every SFF allotted to the state per fiscal year, the state must  develop a corrective action plan.", "Enforcement.

In 2007, CMS  began requiring states to notify the governing bodies, owners, operators,  and administrators that a facility had been designated an SFF. CMS also  issued a press release in 2007 listing those SFFs that had failed to  significantly improve their care; previously, the identity of SFFs was not  provided to the public. In an effort to increase transparency, CMS added  the identity of all SFFs to its Nursing Home Compare Web site during 2008.

Most states we interviewed  specified that they review the details of a nursing home\u2019s overall  compliance with federal quality standards. For example, a state might  review the scope and severity level, type, and repetitiveness of deficiencies  for candidates it considers. When reviewing a nursing home\u2019s history, a  few states indicated that they are likely to select candidates with more  recent poor performance, which is also reflected in the SFF score  beginning in 2008.

First, because of lag times between when surveys are  conducted and when the results are reflected on the SFF candidate list,  some states and regions found that the candidate list may not reflect a  home\u2019s most recent survey. Consequently, some candidates could appear  to have a better or worse score than reflected in the most recent survey, or  homes may be included or excluded inappropriately from the list. Second,  some states told us that the candidate list does not provide them with a  sufficient number of nursing homes from which to select new SFFs.  Specifically, the list includes current SFFs if they are still ranked among  the worst 15 homes in the state, which narrows the state\u2019s selection  possibilities.

This limitation becomes apparent when comparing SFF  scores for nursing homes on the candidate list both across and within  states. As a result of the variation across states, some candidates may have  the worst score in their state and yet not score among the worst homes in  the nation. In addition, wide variation in candidates\u2019 scores is also found  within individual states. For example, on the January 2009 candidate list,  the score of the worst home in Tennessee was about 1,512.

CMS guidance also allows states discretion in  determining significant improvement, and therefore which homes receive  more robust enforcement and which do not. In our interviews with CMS\u2019s  central office, an official stated that CMS\u2019s SFF enforcement guidance  could be more specific and noted that CMS plans to release descriptive  guidance explaining exactly how states and regions should apply more  robust enforcement. In addition, we found that officials in the regional  offices and states we interviewed had inconsistent interpretations of the  guidance. For example, some officials told us that when determining  sanctions, they treat SFFs no differently than they would any poorly  performing nursing home.

For example, about 28 percent  of SFFs had at least one CMP implemented in 2008, compared to about   34 percent of candidates in the same year. In addition, the rates of  implemented CMPs and DPNAs decreased for SFFs relative to candidates  from 2006 to 2008, while the rates of other nursing homes remained low.  (See fig. 4.) We found similar trends in the average CMP values; for  example, SFF candidates received the highest average per day CMPs in  2008\u2014approximately $4,262 per day\u2014compared to approximately $3,969  for SFFs and $1,990 for other nursing homes.

However, both of these  SFFs had immediate sanctions imposed; that is, the state and regional  offices imposed discretionary rather than mandatory DPNAs and  terminations. Discretionary DPNAs and terminations provide nursing  homes with a shorter opportunity to correct deficiencies before the  sanction goes into effect compared to mandatory DPNAs and  terminations.

First, nursing homes may not improve enough to meet  CMS\u2019s criteria for graduation, nor be performing poorly enough to  terminate from Medicare and Medicaid. Second, closing a nursing home  requires the state to transfer residents to another nursing home, and some  residents with special care needs\u2014such as children or those that have  behavioral health issues\u2014may be difficult to relocate. Third, if the SFF  recently had a change in ownership, it may have the potential to improve  and therefore should not be terminated: new management or capital  investment in a poorly performing nursing home may bring about needed  changes in quality. For example, officials in CMS\u2019s New York regional  office described a case in which all three reasons influenced their decision  to allow a nursing home to remain in the program for over 45 months.  The home    had initially demonstrated improvement until two consecutive surveys  resulted in deficiencies at the F level or higher,   had a behavioral health population that was large, making it difficult to  place them in other homes, and    experienced two changes of ownership while in the SFF Program. The  most recent owners invested millions of dollars to improve the physical  environment at the facility and hired a nurse consultant.", "Regional office officials indicated that a more recent survey had shown  improvement with no deficiencies higher than the D level, which they  attributed to the investments made by the most recent owner.", "Conversely, some SFFs were able to improve enough to graduate in less  than 19 months. Our analysis shows that between 2005 and February 2009,  32 states graduated at least one facility in less than 19 months. According  to some state and regional office officials we interviewed, such SFFs  showed improvement after being selected for the program because of  factors such as the home\u2019s ability to establish stable leadership, a  willingness to adopt new improvements, or the hiring of outside  consultants. Some state and regional office officials indicated that homes  might be able to graduate earlier if the graduation criteria were less  stringent. For example, one regional office and one state did not think that  F-level deficiencies in kitchen sanitation should prevent homes from  graduating. Two regions suggested that a more appropriate graduation  criterion would be to allow homes with F-level deficiencies to graduate as  long as the deficiencies were not in SQC areas, rather than the current  criterion of no F-level or higher deficiencies. We found that 27 percent of  the 328 SFFs (90 homes) had at least one instance where one or more F- level deficiency prevented them from graduating and over half of those  SFFs (54 homes) had F-level deficiencies in kitchen sanitation.", "Beginning in 2007, CMS introduced two program changes that may  contribute to a decline in the amount of time that SFFs remain in the  program. For example, CMS began identifying SFFs on its Nursing Home  Compare Web site each month. The majority of CMS regional offices and  states we interviewed believed CMS\u2019s identification of SFFs had a positive  impact on the SFF Program because of the media and public attention.  Florida indicated that there had been little concern by providers about  being in the SFF Program until SFFs were publicly identified. An  additional factor may also have influenced the amount of time SFFs  remain in the program. As noted earlier, CMS began requiring states to  formally notify homes in 2007 that they had been placed in the program,  including each home\u2019s governing body, owner, operator, and  administrator. Michigan has applied a more aggressive notification policy  since 2005, sending a notification letter to each SFF candidate explaining  that they are at risk of being selected as an SFF if they fail to address  performance problems. A copy of the letter is also sent to the owner and  operator of the nursing home the first time the home appears on CMS\u2019s  candidate list. The Michigan official we interviewed believed that this  notification policy has motivated the state\u2019s SFF candidates to improve. In  December 2008, the state of Missouri also began notifying SFF candidates  that they were at risk of being selected as SFFs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most SFFs Improved, but Some Graduates Failed to Sustain Their Performance", "paragraphs": ["While in the program, most SFFs improved their performance, but some  failed to sustain their improved performance after graduation.

Officials from some  CMS regions and states told us that the SFF Program was helping nursing  homes to improve their performance, but others were unsure of the  program\u2019s effectiveness. For example, officials from New York, which  graduated 8 of 13 SFFs from January 2005 to February 2009, told us that  more frequent surveys and the state\u2019s presence at the facilities had a  positive effect on the behavior of SFFs.

SFFs that agreed to SIAs retained their SFF designation and were  still subject to more frequent surveys than other homes.", "SIAs share some common requirements and sometimes describe similar  elements using different terminology. SIAs may differ because regional  offices attempt to craft agreements that reflect each SFF\u2019s particular  circumstances or the specific regional office goals for the home. Common  SIA elements include    hiring an independent consultant to provide technical assistance with  quality improvement activities at the home; requiring the consultant to identify solutions to issues that were  preventing the SFF from attaining or maintaining compliance, often  referred to as a root-cause analysis, and to develop an action plan to  address quality problems; and   providing periodic reports prepared by either the consultant or the home  to the regional office on the status of actions or recommendations to  improve quality.", "Two of the SIAs required the SFFs to commit funds ranging from $850,000  to $956,000 for the improvement of clinical care systems or facility capital  improvements. For example, one SIA required the SFF to dedicate  $956,000, primarily for capital improvements such as a new roof and a  heating and cooling system but also to go into an escrow fund to pay for  quality improvements consistent with the consultant\u2019s root-cause analysis  and action plan.", "In general, regional offices have used SIAs as an alternative to terminating  homes that had been in the program for 18 months. Five of the 10 homes  with SIAs had been in the SFF Program from 27 to 42 months when they  signed SIAs. (See app. IV for a chronological summary of all SIAs as of  August 2009.) One regional office negotiated an SIA to avoid bed shortages  that would have resulted had the SFF been terminated from Medicare and  Medicaid. Another SFF at risk of termination had recently undergone a  change in ownership, and the new owner had made substantial clinical  and capital improvements. With 6 of the 10 SIAs, Dallas is the only regional  office with an SIA that has established specific criteria for the use of the  agreements. Any SFF that has failed to graduate from the SFF Program in  18 months and that has no deficiencies above the F level is given one last  chance by signing an SIA. Dallas regional office officials stressed that in  applying these criteria they have also begun to assess the SFF\u2019s  commitment to improve through the SIA process.", "Whether or not the agreements result in improved nursing home  performance, they have the potential to address the problem of homes that  linger in the SFF Program for years.

The technical assistance provided  by QIOs to a limited number of nursing homes (one per year per state)  from August 1, 2008, through July 31, 2011, under the NHIN initiative  resembles the actions outlined in SIAs. For example, QIOs are required  to conduct an on-site assessment of each home to identify the underlyin causes of poor quality of care, prepare a root-cause analysis based on  those findings, and develop an action plan to address the home\u2019s  problems. Given the voluntary nature of the QIO program, SFFs must  agree to work with QIOs; however, CMS did direct QIOs to contact SFFs  recommended by state survey agencies instead of relying on homes to  request QIO assistance. According to CMS, 44 QIOs assisted one SFF per  state from August 2008 through July 2009, the first year of the NHIN  initiative, and the remaining 6 QIOs assisted other homes, including SFF  candidates.

Specifically, CMS  monitors the improvement in two quality of care measures to determine  the effect of QIO assistance during the initiative\u2014the percentage of long- term residents of a facility who were either physically restrained or were  high risk and had pressure ulcers. An alternative approach would be to  use the measures that CMS uses to evaluate whether homes in the SFF  Program are improving, that is, the number or scope and severity of  deficiency citations.

According to a 2009 HHS OIG  report, by June 2008, 35 nursing home corporations had entered into such  agreements, which are generally in effect for 3 to 5 years. In its report,  HHS OIG examined 15 of these nursing home corporations under quality  of care CIAs, which collectively operated 1,104 nursing homes as of  December 31, 2006. Both SIAs and quality of care CIAs require homes or  corporations to seek outside technical assistance to identify changes that  will help address quality problems. In addition, quality of care CIAs may  require corporations to take other actions to help improve quality, such as  the establishment of corporate-level compliance officers, quality assurance  committees, and quality assurance monitoring committees. The HHS OIG  requires the corporations to hire an independent entity, or monitor, to  assess the quality assurance and quality improvement systems in place in  the corporations\u2019 homes. According to an official with one such entity,  staff members are embedded in the nursing home corporation to help  ensure that planned quality improvements are actually implemented. In  addition, the corporations must provide the HHS OIG with a list of all  homes that belong to the same corporation at the beginning of the CIA and  update the HHS OIG with information on the homes bought and sold; the  independent quality monitor commonly contracts with a data analysis  organization, subject to HHS OIG approval, to analyze state survey results  and quality of care measures across the homes in the corporation. The  2009 HHS OIG report evaluated the extent to which required quality of  care structures and processes were implemented through CIAs. Based on  its review of 15 such CIAs, the OIG found that all 15 corporations had  enhanced their quality of care structures and processes while subject to  these agreements. As of September 2008, an HHS OIG official was aware  of three corporations with quality of care CIAs that had homes that were  also in the SFF Program, and two of these SFFs had SIAs.

Thus, we found that some regional  offices do interact with corporations. One SIA we reviewed was signed by  the Vice President of Clinical Services of a large nursing home chain.  Moreover, officials from two regional offices told us that they are aware of  and monitor problems at chains operating in their regions, such as by  conducting federal monitoring surveys at homes belonging to a problem  chain. In fact, one of these regions indicated that CMS\u2019s central office  had directed closer scrutiny of certain nursing home corporations in the  past. Officials from two regions provided a concrete example of their  interactions with officials from one corporation. These two regions  noticed that several homes with compliance problems had a common  name, and one regional office determined through a Google search that  the homes were part of the same chain; this chain operated almost 50  homes in five states, and some of this chain\u2019s homes were SFFs. In one  instance, regional office officials met with the chief executive officer and  regional operations manager to discuss an improvement plan for one of  the chain\u2019s homes after this home became an SFF.

We found that for  six SFFs with consecutive noncompliance, severe deficiencies did not  consistently result in more severe or immediate sanctions. For example,  one SFF received no civil money penalties even though it was cited for  consecutive deficiencies that could have resulted in fines ranging from  $300 to $825 per day of noncompliance, while a home with a similar  compliance history received CMPs that increased from $300 to $600 per  day of noncompliance, suggesting that CMS\u2019s monitoring of enforcement is  insufficient.", "The significant percentage of SFFs that remained in the program for  considerably longer than CMS\u2019s 18-month time frame for improved  performance or termination is troubling because it prevents other poorly  performing nursing homes from receiving enhanced attention by becoming  SFFs since the program is limited by resources to 136 at a time. For a  limited number of homes that failed to show improvement or where  termination was seen as an option of last resort, 4 of CMS\u2019s 10 regional  offices have negotiated agreements requiring homes to address quality  problems. Although the first SIA was implemented over 2 years ago, CMS  has not disseminated information to the regional offices describing the  elements that should be part of SIAs, or catalogued any lessons learned  from their use. It is probably too early to evaluate the longer-term  effectiveness of SIAs, but they do have the potential to address the  problem of homes that linger in the program for extended periods.", "Other efforts also have the potential to help address performance  problems at poorly performing nursing homes, and some may hold lessons  for improving the operation of the SFF Program.", "Nursing Homes in Need Initiative. QIOs are employing interventions  similar to those used in SIAs at poorly performing nursing homes,  primarily SFFs, at the rate of one home per state each year for 3 years.  However, the QIO measures used to monitor the effect of QIO assistance  are inconsistent with the measures CMS uses to evaluate whether SFFs  are improving.", "Corporate Integrity Agreements. The HHS OIG has considerable  experience negotiating legal agreements with corporations that own  poorly performing nursing homes, agreements that also employ more  direct interventions to address quality problems across the homes in a  chain. Currently, there is little coordination between CMS and the HHS  OIG, even though we found that some regional offices also work with  chain corporate offices and a few homes were subject to both SIAs and  CIAs.", "State Quality Improvement Initiatives. Some states have adopted  quality improvement strategies to address problems at poorly performing  homes. For example, Florida requires homes with serious performance  problems to pay $6,000 to cover the costs associated with more frequent  surveys over a 2-year period. Although SFFs and other poorly performing  nursing homes that frequently harm residents or place them in immediate  jeopardy increase survey costs, CMS does not currently have the authority  to charge them for additional survey activities. Charging such a fee could  improve the linkage between the costs associated with more frequent  surveys and the nursing homes that give rise to these costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To increase the SFF Program\u2019s effectiveness in helping to address quality  of care problems at poorly performing nursing homes, we recommend that  the Administrator of CMS take the following five actions:    Expand the SFF Program\u2019s public disclosure strategy by directing states to  notify nursing homes that have been identified as SFF Program candidates  that they are at risk of being selected as an SFF.", "Revise the SFF candidate list by removing homes that states have selected  as SFFs and including additional homes so that states with a large number  of SFFs have a full complement of candidates to choose from each time  they select a new SFF.", "Ensure that states impose more stringent enforcement, such as higher  CMPs or termination; clarify SFF Program guidance regarding appropriate  sanctions; and monitor SFF sanctions more closely.", "Provide CMS regional offices with a description of the elements that  should be part of SIAs and catalogue any lessons learned from their use.", "Coordinate more systematically with the HHS OIG regarding its  experiences with CIAs.", "To offset the additional costs imposed by SFFs and create incentives for  poorly performing nursing homes to improve resident care more quickly,  we recommend that the Administrator of CMS seek legislative authority to  charge SFFs for the costs associated with conducting additional surveys."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We obtained written comments on our draft report from HHS, which are  reprinted in appendix V. HHS noted its commitment to further  strengthening the SFF Program and indicated that our report would help  to further improve what could work better and reaffirm what is already  working well. HHS agreed fully with four of our six recommendations,  agreed in principle with a fifth recommendation, and indicated that it  would take a sixth recommendation under advisement.", "In its comments, HHS reported on additional analyses it had conducted,  which found that in comparing SFF graduates to candidates, (1) a higher  percentage of graduates had no deficiencies at the F-level or higher both   6 months and 12 months after graduation from the program, and (2) an  average of 21.5 months and 15.6 months, respectively, elapsed before   50 percent of the homes in either group had an F-level or higher  deficiency. HHS concluded that while these analyses did not suggest that  SFF graduates had transformed into high-quality nursing homes, they did  indicate that the greater efforts made by SFF graduates had some lasting  and positive effects on quality of care. Despite the improvements  demonstrated by SFFs, HHS expressed concern about those SFF  graduates that relapse into a pattern of serious deficiencies. HHS noted  that it will re-examine the 18-month time frame for SFFs to demonstrate  improved performance given our finding that a significant percentage of  SFFs remain in the program beyond 18 months.", "HHS fully concurred with the following four recommendations:   (1) directing states to notify SFF candidates that they are at risk of being  selected for the SFF Program; (2) clarifying SFF Program guidance on  appropriate sanctions and monitoring SFF sanctions more closely;   (3) providing CMS regional offices with a description of the elements of an  SIA and cataloguing lessons learned from their use; and (4) coordinating  more systematically with the HHS OIG regarding its experiences with  CIAs. In addition, HHS agreed in principle with our recommendation that  CMS revise the SFF candidate list by removing homes that have already  been selected as SFFs and including additional homes so that states have a  full complement of candidates from which to choose; however, HHS said  that CMS will operationalize the recommendation in a different manner by  sizably increasing the SFF candidate list for most states. If implemented,  CMS\u2019s proposed approach would address our recommendation. Finally,  HHS indicated it would take under advisement our recommendation that  the Administrator of CMS seek legislative authority to charge SFFs for the  costs associated with conducting additional surveys.", "HHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate. We also provided excerpts of the report to the HHS OIG and  the three state survey agencies whose specific quality improvement  strategies we described in the report\u2014Arkansas, Florida, and Missouri\u2014 and incorporated technical comments from those agencies as appropriate.", "As we agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents  of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days  from the date of this letter.

Officials from the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services\u2019s (CMS) central office told us that they do not attempt  to determine whether poor financial performance contributed to the poor  quality of care provided by SFFs. However, three of the four regional  offices we interviewed did not believe that poor financial performance  was more common for SFFs than for other nursing homes. An official from  the remaining regional office did not comment because he told us the  office assesses only quality of care. Regional offices told us that they may  learn about homes\u2019 financial problems on an ad hoc basis. For example,  they might learn that a home failed to meet payroll, that lenders were  unwilling to extend credit to a home, or that a resident\u2019s complaint, such  as a low building temperature or limited food supply, might indicate  financial problems. In addition, regional offices are made aware of  potential financial problems when a home requests a delay or reduction in  payment on civil money penalties (CMP) based on poor financial  condition. CMS guidance provides a suggested list of sources for  information to determine if a CMP should be delayed or reduced due to a  home\u2019s financial condition, but does not indicate how the regional office  should make this determination. Furthermore, two regional offices told us  that requests for delayed or reduced CMPs are rare.", "CMS\u2019s central office also has access to another source of financial  information\u2014annual Medicare cost reports, which nursing homes  receiving Medicare payments are required to submit to Medicare  Administrative Contractors. However, according to the Medicare Payment  Advisory Commission (MedPAC), the financial information provided in  these reports has several limitations for assessing total financial  performance of nursing homes. For example, the cost reports do not  follow the format of standard audited financial statements or receive  serious audit attention. Despite these limitations, the Medicare  Administrative Contractor we interviewed, which processes Medicare  claims in addition to receiving Medicare cost reports, told us that it could  conduct a financial analysis of nursing homes if CMS were to request and  fund this activity, but noted that it would first want to verify their  information.", "We did identify two entities that have initiatives that collect information  about nursing home financial performance. First, Virginia passed  legislation on health care data reporting in 1996, which resulted in the  state\u2019s contracting with Virginia Health Information to report both nursing  home financial information and an assessment of homes\u2019 efficiency and  productivity, among other information, on its Web site. The financial  information that providers, including nursing homes, are required to file  annually includes details about revenue, expenses, and assets. This  information is summarized from either certified audited financial  statements or, if the nursing home is part of a publicly held company,  unconsolidated unaudited financial statements submitted by the home.  Second, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  classifies the financial performance of all facilities that participate in the  Section 232 Mortgage Insurance for Residential Care Facilities program.  According to HUD officials, 12 SFFs as of June 2009 had insured  mortgages and the officials classified 8 of them as financially troubled  based on various criteria, such as the home making a late mortgage  payment or concerns about the home\u2019s ability to make future mortgage  payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["This appendix provides additional details regarding our scope and  methodology.", "State interviews.

Since 2006,  CMS has issued candidate lists quarterly, but it generates additional lists  when necessary.", "To determine the factors that states considered in selecting SFFs from  January 2006 through February 2009, we determined the rank of each  home on the candidate list that was generated before, but closest to, the  date of that home\u2019s selection for the program.", "To determine the factors that states considered in selecting SFFs, we  analyzed the scores of SFF candidates from CMS\u2019s January 2009 candidate  list.", "To determine the SFF Program\u2019s impact on homes\u2019 performance, we  analyzed the scores for each of the three cycles provided on CMS\u2019s  candidate lists from December 2005 to January 2009 by calculating state  average indexed scores. We then created a mean indexed score for all SFF  graduates for three points in time\u2014before the home entered the program,  while the home was in the program, and after graduation\u2014and compared  them to each other. For SFFs that were active in the program as of  February 2009, we also compared the mean indexed score before the  home entered the program to the mean indexed score while the home was  in the program.", "OSCAR survey and deficiency data. We conducted several analyses  using data from CMS\u2019s On-Line Survey, Certification, and Reporting  system (OSCAR) for standard surveys and complaint investigations  generally conducted between January 2005 and July 31, 2009. We analyzed  survey dates, deficiencies cited on standard surveys and complaint  investigations, and any revisits associated with the standard surveys. To be  consistent with the SFF methodology and avoid potential double-counting,  we did not include deficiencies that also appeared on complaint surveys  conducted within 15 days of a standard survey (either prior to or after the  standard survey).", "To determine how SFFs differ from other nursing homes, we calculated  the average number of deficiencies and revisits for certain SFFs compared  to other nursing homes. We identified SFFs that were added to the SFF  Program in 2008 and that also had a 2008 standard survey prior to their  entry into the program. We compared these SFFs to other homes that had  a standard survey conducted in 2008. Our analysis included deficiencies  identified during the 2008 standard survey, deficiencies from complaint  investigations that occurred in the year prior to the 2008 standard survey,  and revisits associated with the standard survey.", "To determine whether states followed CMS\u2019s guidance to survey SFFs  twice a year, we analyzed the dates of the standard surveys conducted  while nursing homes were in the SFF Program. We determined the number  of surveys that should have been conducted each year by multiplying the  state\u2019s SFF allotment by two. We then summed the number of SFF surveys  conducted by each state for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 and determined if  the number of surveys conducted was fewer than the total number of  surveys that should have been conducted. In addition, we calculated the  number of states that did not survey at least one of their SFFs within the  first 7 months after the home entered the program and that had at least  one SFF with more than 10 months between surveys from calendar year  2005 through 2008.", "To determine whether CMS regional offices and the states followed the  agency\u2019s SFF Program graduation criteria, we analyzed survey dates and  data on deficiencies from standard surveys and complaint investigations.  We determined which SFFs did not graduate appropriately because   (1) states conducted standard surveys zero or only one time while the  home was in the SFF Program; (2) the home had deficiencies at the F level  or higher on the two standard surveys preceding their graduation; or   (3) the home had deficiencies at the F level or higher on any complaint  surveys that occurred from the two standard surveys preceding their  graduation through the date of their graduation.", "To determine if SFFs had F-level deficiencies that may have contributed to  the length of time they were in the SFF Program, we determined the  number of SFFs that had various combinations of standard and complaint  surveys that resulted in deficiencies at the F level and lower.", "To determine the program\u2019s impact on SFF graduates, we analyzed  deficiencies from standard and complaint surveys for SFFs after they  graduated from the program. Specifically, we determined the number of  SFFs that after graduation had F-level or higher deficiencies on any  survey, F-level or higher deficiencies on consecutive standard surveys, and  immediate jeopardy deficiencies.", "Nursing home enforcement. To determine whether CMS regional offices  and states followed the agency\u2019s SFF Program enforcement guidance, we  first identified homes that were SFFs as of January 1, 2007, and that had  two consecutive standard surveys, both of which cited at least one G-level  or higher deficiency; we then analyzed Nursing Home Enforcement  History reports and Nursing Home Enforcement Case Profiles for these  homes that we obtained from the regional offices and which summarize  data from CMS\u2019s Automated Survey Processing Environment Enforcement  Manager (AEM).  In addition, we analyzed AEM data on CMPs and denials  of payment for new Medicare or Medicaid admissions (DPNA) that were in  effect for calendar years 2006 through 2008 for each of three categories of  nursing homes\u2014SFFs, SFF candidates, and other nursing homes. We  determined the percentage of homes in each category that had at least one  CMP or DPNA by year. In addition, we calculated mean CMP amounts (per  day and per instance) by home type and year by summing each home\u2019s  CMPs for the year. For SFFs, we included only sanctions that occurred  while the home was in the SFF Program. SFF candidates were those  homes ranked as among the worst 15 homes per state based on the CMS  candidate lists for that same year.", "Termination. To determine the number of SFFs that were terminated\u2014 voluntarily or involuntarily\u2014and later became certified to participate in  Medicare or Medicaid again, we analyzed information available from  CMS\u2019s Provider of Service file dated December 2008. To do so, we  identified the addresses of SFFs that terminated, and then we identified  nursing homes that shared the same physical location as the terminated  SFFs and that later began participating in Medicare or Medicaid.", "Nursing home characteristics data. To determine how SFFs differ from  other nursing homes, we analyzed CMS data that describe the  characteristics of nursing homes: a December 17, 2008, extract of OSCAR  variables, such as type of organization and number of beds; nurse staffing  hours, which were case-mix adjusted by CMS for use in its Five-Star  Quality Rating System and which were dated January 2009; and nursing  home ratings from the Five-Star System available from Nursing Home  Compare, which were dated December 2008. Following are highlights of  how we analyzed certain characteristics:    Nursing homes self-report their ownership type. We created the ownership  type of for-profit by combining for-profit individual, for-profit partnership,  for-profit corporation, and limited liability corporation; the ownership type  of nonprofit by combining nonprofit corporation, nonprofit church-related,  and nonprofit other; and the ownership type of government by combining  the six government designations (state, county, city, city/county, hospital  district, and federal).", "CMS maintains a variable in its data called \u201cmulti-nursing home (chain)  ownership,\u201d which is self-reported by nursing homes and which we refer  to as chain affiliation. According to CMS, multi-nursing home chains have  two or more homes under one ownership or operation. We determined the  percentage of nursing homes that were for-profit and chain affiliated,  nonprofit and chain affiliated, or government-owned and chain affiliated  by combining the ownership types described above with CMS\u2019s  designation of multi-nursing home (chain) ownership.", "We used the number of beds certified for payment for Medicare and/or  Medicaid to calculate the average number of beds per nursing home.", "We calculated the percentage of residents by type (Medicare, Medicaid, or  other) by dividing the number of Medicare, Medicaid, and other patients  by the number of total residents.", "We calculated the occupancy rate of nursing homes by dividing the total  number of residents by the number of certified beds.", "We analyzed the following case-mix adjusted nurse staffing hours:  registered nurse hours per resident per day; licensed practical nurse and  vocational nurse hours per resident per day; nurse aide hours per resident  per day; and total staffing hours per resident per day. We calculated  registered nurse hours as a share of the total. Unadjusted nurse staffing  hours data are collected by CMS, are self-reported by nursing homes, and  represent staffing levels for a 2-week period prior to the state inspection.  CMS case-mix adjusted the staffing data using the average minutes of  nursing care used to care for residents in a given resource utilization  group category as reflected in the Medicare skilled nursing facility  prospective payment system.
