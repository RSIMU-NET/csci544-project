AFAA recommended that the Air Force Materiel Command delay procurement of current and future spare parts requirements, valued at $388 million, that were available for reclamation and initiate screening of excess aircraft and engines containing parts that could satisfy spare parts requirements. In a February 1996 follow-up report, AFAA found that Air Force personnel did not release excess aircraft for programmed reclamation screening as recommended. Additionally, the Air Force Materiel Command did not initiate screening of excess aircraft and engines for serviceable spare parts. As a result, timely reclamation was not scheduled for 816 aircraft classified as having no future operational use.", "Air Force management has initiated action to correct this problem. However, the changes are not reflected in the fiscal year 1997 budget request. Therefore, Congress could reduce the Air Force\u2019s fiscal year 1997 budget request by $388 million to reflect the value of reclaimed spare parts that could be used to satisfy other requirements.", "The Air Force, in determining its spare and repair parts budget request, does not consider parts on hand at the depot maintenance facilities as an offset to spare and repair parts requirements. Although Congressional Committees have made several attempts to change this policy, the Air Force continues to exclude depot-level assets in its requirements data and budget computations. Our analysis showed that the Air Force overstated its fiscal year 1996 spare parts budget request by $72 million because parts on hand for depot maintenance were not offset against budget requirements.", "In our March 1996 report, we also reported that the Navy spare parts requirements and budget request for fiscal year 1997 were overstated by at least $60 million. This occurred because the Navy duplicated depot maintenance requirements in its requirements and budget computations. The depot-level assets were included once as recurring demands, based on past depot maintenance usage, and again in a planned program requirements category that is not based on recurring demands. As a result of these duplications, the Navy\u2019s fiscal year 1997 requirements and budget estimates were overstated by at least $60 million.", "The Air Force and the Navy overstated their spare parts budget requests because inaccurate lead times, demand rates, due-out quantities, and inventory on hand and on order were used in the requirements determination process. The use of inaccurate data resulted in overstated requirements of $8 million and $7 million for the Air Force and the Navy, respectively.", "The Army budget stratification reports that are used to determine spare and repair parts budget requests are based on inaccurate data. When an item\u2019s available inventory is not sufficient to meet the requirements, the item is considered to be in a deficit position and the aggregate value of items in a deficit position is the basis for determining the budget request.", "Our review of 258 items with a reported deficit value of $519 million showed that the deficit position for $211 million of the items was incorrect. If accurate requirements and inventory data had been used, the inventory deficit for these items would have been $23 million rather than the $211 million reported. As a result, the fiscal year 1996 budget request included $188 million ($211 million minus $23 million) for items that were not in a deficit position.", "Because corrective actions were not taken in time to affect the fiscal year 1997 budget request, we believe the fiscal year 1997 request is also overstated.

Of this, $4.01 billion was to be used to buy fuel from the Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC), with the remaining $107 million used to buy fuel from commercial sources.

Service officials stated that the unobligated balances were needed to satisfy upward adjustments to obligations that were incurred in the specific fiscal year but have not yet been liquidated.", "Our analysis shows that unobligated balances have been increasing rather than decreasing and that the average annual increase over the last 4 years has been $200.24 million for the Army, $150.42 million for the Navy, and $151.57 million for the Air Force. The reason for the increasing balances is that the amount of the liquidations is generally less than the amount initially obligated.", "Our analysis showed that the average annual increase in unobligated balances was $502 million.

In a recent report, we suggested that instead of upgrading the bombers, the Air Force should retire them. We reported that upgrading the bombers will only marginally increase combat interdiction when compared to total interdiction capabilities that already exist. On the other hand, retiring the aircraft could save the Air Force about $1 billion annually in operating costs, including approximately $366.7 million in O&M costs.", "The Air Force currently assigns attrition aircraft to active and reserve units where they are flown and maintained as combat designated aircraft. In fiscal year 1997, the Air Force plans to have 126 attrition attack and fighter aircraft in the active force inventory.", "In 1995, we reported that storing attrition aircraft could be a money-saving alternative to assigning aircraft to active units. A 1992 Air Force study concluded that the costs to store and reconstitute F-15 and F-16 aircraft were 1.9 percent and 2.1 percent of the aircraft\u2019s operation and maintenance costs, respectively. In addition, the Navy found that storing excess aircraft was the most cost-effective way of managing them. Historical attrition rates indicate that some of the attrition aircraft will not be needed until the year 2002. Therefore, Congress may want to reduce the Air Force\u2019s fiscal year 1997 budget by $9.5 million ($75,000 multiplied by 126 aircraft) to encourage the Air Force to store its attrition aircraft.

According to an Army official, the Army requested the pass-through rather than having to pass the costs on to its customers through increased surcharge rates. For fiscal year 1997, the Army changed its policy regarding unutilized plants. The change in policy is intended to encourage DBOF activities to put unused plants and equipment into standby, idle, or layaway status. Prior to fiscal year 1997, the Army could pass the costs of unutilized plants on to customers through increased DBOF rates.", "We have previously reported that we do not agree with the practice of using the O&M appropriation process to finance DBOF losses. Doing so fails to focus on DBOF\u2019s actual results of operations, diminishes its incentive to operate efficiently, and makes it more difficult to evaluate and monitor DBOF operations. Our long-standing position has been that DBOF managers should be required to request funds for and justify the need to recover the prior years\u2019 losses to Congress rather than covering such losses with an O&M pass-through to DBOF.", "In view of our long-standing position that DBOF managers be required to request supplemental appropriations to cover losses associated with Air Force and Army DBOF activities, Congress may want to reduce the Air Force\u2019s O&M budget request by $194.5 million and the Army\u2019s O&M budget request by $58.9 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Civilian Personnel Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The Army\u2019s, the Navy\u2019s, the Air Force\u2019s, and DOD\u2019s fiscal year 1997 budget requests for civilian personnel could be reduced by $245.5 million because (1) the projected civilian personnel levels at the beginning of fiscal year 1997 will be less than those the services used to determine their budget requests ($185.5 million) and (2) the amount requested in the budget submission differs from the amount shown in the budget justification documents ($60 million).", "Based on the number of Navy and DOD personnel onboard as of April 1996, and Army and Air Force personnel onboard as of May 1996, we estimate that the actual end strength at the end of fiscal year 1996\u2014the beginning figure for fiscal year 1997\u2014will be 7,331 personnel less than the number used by the services to determine their fiscal year 1997 budget request.
