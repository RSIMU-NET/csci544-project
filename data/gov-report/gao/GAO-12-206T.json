For this testimony, GAO was asked to report on (1) the status of the L.A. courthouse project, (2) challenges GAO has identified affecting federal courthouses nationwide, and (3) the extent to which these challenges are applicable to the L.A. courthouse project.

In GAO-10-417 , GAO recommended that (1) GSA ensure that new courthouses are constructed within their authorized size or, if not, that congressional committees are notified, (2) the Judicial Conference of the United States retain caseload projections to improve the accuracy of its 10-year-judge planning, and (3) the Conference establish and use courtroom sharing policies based on scheduling and use data.

However, project delays, unforeseen cost escalation, and low contractor interest had caused GSA to cancel the project in 2006 before any construction took place. GSA later identified other options for housing the L.A. Court, including constructing a smaller new courthouse (36 courtrooms) or using the existing courthouses--the Spring Street Courthouse and the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building and Courthouse. As GAO also reported, the estimated cost of the 36-courthouse option as of 2008 was over $1.1 billion, significantly higher than the current appropriation. The challenges that GAO has identified in recent reports on federal courthouses include increasing rent and extra operating, maintenance, and construction costs stemming from courthouses being built larger than necessary. For example, in 2004, the judiciary requested a $483 million permanent, annual exemption from rent payments to GSA due to difficulties in paying for its increasing rent costs. GAO found in 2006 that these increasing rent costs were primarily due to increases in total courthouse space--and in 2010, GAO reported that more than a quarter of the new space in recently constructed courthouses is unneeded. Specifically, in the 33 federal courthouses completed since 2000, GAO found 3.56 million square feet of excess space. This extra space is a result of (1) courthouses exceeding the congressionally authorized size, (2) the number of judges in the courthouses being overestimated, and (3) not planning for judges to share courtrooms. In total, the extra space GAO identified is equal in square footage to about 9 average-sized courthouses. The estimated cost to construct this extra space, when adjusted to 2010 dollars, is $835 million, and the estimated annual cost to rent, operate and maintain it is $51 million. Each of the challenges GAO identified related to unnecessary space in courthouses completed since 2000 is applicable to the L.A. courthouse project. First, as GAO reported in 2008, GSA designed the L.A. Courthouse with 13 more courtrooms than congressionally authorized. This increase in size led to cost increases and delays. Second, in 2004, GAO found that the proposed courthouse was designed to provide courtrooms to accommodate the judiciary's estimate of 61 district and magistrate judges in the L.A. Court by 2011--which, as of October 2011, exceeds the actual number of such judges by 14. This disparity calls into question the space assumptions on which the original proposals were based. Third, the L.A. court was planning for less courtroom sharing than is possible. While in 2008 the judiciary favored an option proposed by GSA that provided for some sharing by senior judges, according to GAO's 2010 analysis, there is enough unscheduled time in courtrooms for three senior judges to share one courtroom, two magistrate judges to share one courtroom, and three district judges to share two courtrooms. In 2011, the judiciary also approved sharing for bankruptcy judges. Additional courtroom sharing could reduce the number of additional courtrooms needed for the L.A. courthouse, thereby increasing the potential options for housing the L.A. Court."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here to discuss our recent work on federal  courthouse construction issues and on the Los Angeles (L.A.) courthouse  in particular. Since the early 1990s, the General Services Administration  (GSA) and the federal judiciary (judiciary) have undertaken a multibillion- dollar courthouse construction initiative that by June 2010 had resulted in  66 new courthouses or annexes, with 29 additional projects in various  stages of development. However, rising costs and other federal budget  priorities threaten to stall the initiative. The L.A. courthouse is one of the  projects that has not been constructed, even though in fiscal year 2000,  the judiciary ranked Los Angeles, California, as its first priority for  courthouse construction. Currently, in downtown Los Angeles at one of  the nation\u2019s busiest federal district courts (L.A. Court), the judiciary\u2019s  operations are split between two buildings\u2014the Spring Street Courthouse  and the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building and Courthouse. In 1996, the  judiciary concluded that the split created operational inefficiencies, that it  needed additional space in downtown Los Angeles, and that the Spring  Street building had obsolete building systems and poor security  conditions. The split court was a significant factor in the high priority  ranking given to the L.A. courthouse project. For example, according to  GSA officials, inefficiencies occur because the court\u2019s operations are split  between these two buildings. GSA agreed in 2000 that the existing  buildings did not meet the court\u2019s expansion and security requirements,  among other things. Accordingly, the judiciary requested and GSA  proposed building a new courthouse in downtown Los Angeles.", "In July 2000, GSA was congressionally authorized to begin designing a  new courthouse in Los Angeles, and from fiscal year 2001 through fiscal  year 2005, Congress appropriated about $400 million for the project.", "GSA initially estimated in 2000 that the L.A.

However, there is no statutory requirement  to notify congressional committees about size overages. According to our  analysis, a lack of oversight by GSA, including not ensuring its space  measurement policies were understood and followed, and a lack of focus  on building courthouses within the congressionally authorized size,  contributed to these size overages.", "For example, all 7 of the courthouses we examined in case studies for  this 2010 report included more building common and other space\u2014such  as mechanical spaces and atriums\u2014than planned for within the  congressionally authorized gross square footage.

Although GSA officials emphasized that open  space for atriums would not cost as much as space completely built out  with floors, these officials also agreed that there are costs associated with  constructing and operating atrium space.

Furthermore, no event (case related or otherwise) was  scheduled in courtrooms for half the time or more, on average. Using the  judiciary\u2019s data, we designed a model for courtroom sharing, which shows  that there is enough unscheduled time for substantial courtroom sharing.  (For more information on our model, see app. I). Specifically, our model  shows that under dedicated sharing, in which judges are assigned to  share specific courtrooms, three district judges could share two  courtrooms, three senior judges could share one courtroom, and two  magistrate judges could share one courtroom with time to spare. This  level of sharing would reduce the number of courtrooms the judiciary  requires by a third for district judges and by more for senior district and  magistrate judges.", "In our 2010 report, we found that dedicated sharing could have reduced  the number of courtrooms needed in courthouses built since 2000 by 126  courtrooms\u2014about 40 percent of the total number\u2014accounting for about  946,000 square feet of extra space.

In 2008 and 2009, the  Judicial Conference adopted sharing policies for future courthouses under  which senior district and magistrate judges are to share courtrooms at a  rate of two judges per courtroom plus one additional duty courtroom for  courthouses with more than two magistrate judges. Additionally, the  conference recognized the greater efficiencies available in courthouses  with many courtrooms and recommended that in courthouses with more  than 10 district judges, district judges also share.", "Our model\u2019s application of the judiciary\u2019s data shows that still more  sharing opportunities are available. Specifically, sharing between district  judges could be increased by one-third by having three district judges  share two courtrooms in courthouses of all sizes.

Such changes would reduce construction, operations and  maintenance, and rent costs. We recommended, among other things, that  GSA ensure that new courthouses are constructed within their authorized  size or that congressional committees are notified if authorized sizes are  going to be exceeded; that the Judicial Conference of the United States  retain caseload projections to improve the accuracy of its 10-year-judge  planning; and that the Conference establish and use courtroom sharing  policies based on scheduling and use data.

The design of a new courthouse in Los Angeles  was congressionally authorized in 2000 and later funded based on a 41- courtroom, 1,016,300-square-foot GSA prospectus. GSA decided instead  to design a 54-courtroom, 1,279,650-square-foot building to meet the  judiciary\u2019s long-term needs. A year and a half later, after conducting the  environmental assessments and purchasing the site for the new  courthouse, GSA informed Congress that it had designed a 54-courtroom  courthouse in a May 2003 proposal. However, the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) rejected this proposal, according to GSA, and did not  include it in the President\u2019s budget for fiscal year 2005. GSA then  designed a 41-courtroom building, but by the time it completed this effort,  the schedule for constructing the building had been delayed by 2 years,  according to a senior GSA official involved with the project.", "With this delay, inflation pushed the project\u2019s cost over budget, and GSA  needed to make further reductions to the courthouse in order to procure it  within the authorized and appropriated amounts. However, GSA and L.A.  Court officials were slow to reduce the project\u2019s scope, which caused  additional delays and then necessitated additional reductions. For  example, GSA did not simplify the building-high atrium that was initially  envisioned for the new courthouse until January 2006, even though the  judiciary had repeatedly expressed concerns about the construction and  maintenance costs of the atrium since 2002. In our 2010 report, we found  that large atriums contributed to size overages in several courthouses  completed since 2000. Moreover, according to GSA officials in 2010,  GSA\u2019s current policy on how to count the square footage of atriums and  its target for the percentage of space in a building that should be used for  tenant space (which does not include atriums) should make it difficult, if  not impossible, for a courthouse project to include large atriums spanning  many floors\u2014although relatively modest atriums should still be feasible.", "Second, overestimates of how many judges the L.A. Court would need led  to the design of a courthouse with more courtrooms than necessary.  Specifically, we reported in 2004 that the proposed L.A. courthouse was  designed to include courtrooms for 61 judges (47 current district and  magistrate judges and 14 additional judges expected by 2011), but in 2011,  the L.A. Court still has 47 district and magistrate judges\u2014and none of the  14 additional judges that were expected. This outcome calls into question  the space assumptions that the original proposals were based on.", "Third, in 2008 we reported that in planning for judges to share  courtrooms, the judiciary favored an option proposed by GSA that  provided for sharing by senior judges, but our 2010 analysis indicated that  further sharing was feasible and could reduce the size and cost of the  L.A. courthouse project. Specifically, GSA\u2019s proposal to build a 36- courtroom, 45-chamber building and add 4 courtrooms to Roybal\u2019s  existing 34 courtrooms\u2014which GSA estimated at the time would cost  $1.1 billion, or $733.6 million more than Congress had already  appropriated\u2014would have provided the L.A. Court with 74 courtrooms in  total\u201436 district courtrooms in the new building and 38 courtrooms (20  magistrate and 18 bankruptcy) in Roybal. The judiciary supported this  proposal in part, it said, because, with more chambers than courtrooms  included in the plan, it could fulfill its need for a larger building through  courtroom sharing among senior judges who would occupy the extra  chambers in the new building. In this option, the district and senior judges  would be housed in the new courthouse, while the magistrate and  bankruptcy judges would be housed in the Roybal building. As described  above, our model suggested that additional courtroom sharing would be  possible in a courthouse such as the L.A. courthouse, which could reduce  the number of courtrooms needed for this project, broadening the  potential options for housing the L.A.

Altogether, there were 23 randomly selected  districts and 3 case study districts, which included 91 courthouses, 602  courtrooms, and every circuit except that of the District of Columbia. The  data sample was taken in 3-month increments over a 6-month period in  2007 for a total of 63 federal workdays, by trained court staff who  recorded all courtroom usage, including scheduled but unused time.  These data were then verified against three independently recorded  sources of data about courtroom use. Specifically, the sample data were  compared with JS-10 data routinely recorded for courtroom events  conducted by district judges, MJSTAR data routinely recorded for  courtroom events conducted by magistrate judges, and data collected by  independent observers in a randomly selected subset of districts in the  sample. We verified that these methods were reliable and empirically  sound for use in simulation modeling.", "Working with a contractor, we designed this sharing model in conjunction  with a specialist in discrete event simulation and the company that  designed the simulation software to ensure that the model conformed to  generally accepted simulation modeling standards and was reasonable  for the federal court system. Simulation is widely used in modeling any  system where there is competition for scarce resources. The goal of the  model was to determine how many courtrooms are required for courtroom  utilization rates similar to that recorded by FJC. This determination is  based on data for all courtroom use time collected by FJC, including time  when the courtroom was scheduled to be used but the event was  cancelled within one week of the scheduled date.", "The completed model allows, for each courthouse, user input of the  number and types of judges and courtrooms, and the output states  whether the utilization of the courtrooms does not exceed the availability  of the courtrooms in the long run. When using the model to determine the  level of sharing possible at each courthouse based on scheduled  courtroom availability on weekdays from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., we established  a baseline of one courtroom per judge to the extent that this sharing level  exists at the 33 courthouses built since 2000. In selecting the 8 a.m. to 6  p.m. time frame for courtroom scheduling, we used the courtroom  scheduling profile that judges currently use, reflecting the many uses and  flexibility needed for a courtroom. Judges stated that during trials  courtrooms may be needed by attorneys before trial times in order to set  up materials. This set up time was captured in the judiciary\u2019s data; other  uses of a courtroom captured by the judiciary are time spent on  ceremonies, education, training, and maintenance. We differentiated  events and time in the model by grouping them as case-related events,  nonjudge-related events, and unused scheduled time, and we allotted  enough time for each of these events to occur without delay. Then we  entered the number of judges from each courthouse and determined the  fewest number of courtrooms needed for no backlog in court proceedings.", "This is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the  United States.
