However, the process for making decisions about what  technology may be transferred under the program is not readily  understood. As part of a broad request to review the Foreign Military Sales  program, you asked us to look at how the program safeguards technology  and arms transfers. Specifically, we (1) identified the process for deciding  what technology may be transferred as part of a sale through the program,  (2) assessed the controls for ensuring that technology transfer  considerations have been weighed when reviewing requests and  agreements, and (3) examined the Department of Defense\u2019s proposals to  improve technology transfer procedures."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The United States generally exports military items and services either  through (1) U.S. government sales under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS)  program or (2) direct commercial arms sales by individuals and business  entities. The Arms Export Control Act authorizes the President to control  the export of all defense articles and services and to designate items that  are to be controlled under the U.S. Munitions List. The President delegated  the control of exports of Munitions List items to the Secretary of State and  the implementation of the FMS program to the Secretary of Defense. As  part of its responsibilities, the State Department regulates direct  commercial arms sales through export licenses and reviews and approves  arms sales under the FMS program. Within the Department of Defense  (DOD), the Defense Security Cooperation Agency is responsible for overall  administration of the FMS program, while the military departments  implement individual sales under the program. The Arms Export Control  Act generally excludes sales under the FMS program from the requirement  for munitions export licenses.", "Specific policies and controls have been established for the transfer of  classified military intelligence and critical military technology and defense  articles. A presidential executive order prescribed a uniform system for  classifying, safeguarding, and declassifying national security information.  The National Disclosure Policy was established to provide a framework for  the approval or denial of the transfer of classified military information to  foreign governments and international organizations. A decision to  disclose or transmit information must satisfy several criteria. These include  that the transmission of information be consistent with U.S. foreign policy  and U.S. military and security objectives and result in benefits to the United  States. In addition, the foreign recipient must afford the information  substantially the same degree of protection as the United States provides it,  and the information must be limited to what is necessary to fulfill the  prescribed purpose. Although the policy prohibits the transmission of  certain classified information, technology, and defense articles to foreign  countries, it provides a process by which exceptions may be granted.  Procedures established under the National Disclosure Policy are also used  to consider the release of unclassified military information to foreign  entities.", "The United States and other nations have agreed to limit the spread of  certain types of arms and technologies by establishing various international  agreements, or regimes. For example, in 1987 the United States and several  major trading partners created the Missile Technology Control Regime  (MTCR) to control the proliferation of missiles and related technology. This  regime, implemented through national legislation in each of the member  countries, consists of common export policy guidelines that include a list  of controlled items. There are two categories of controlled items. Category  I items are rarely approved for export. They include complete missile  systems and subsystems such as rocket engines and guidance sets.  Category II items comprise a wide range of commodities, including test  equipment and propellants. These items are evaluated on a case-by-case  basis and typically denied for sale if destined for use in weapons of mass  destruction. The U.S. government controls the two categories of items  through the U.S. Munitions List or through the Commerce Control List. The  Missile Technology Export Control committee is a U.S. interagency  working group that reviews proposed U.S. exports of missile technology  and evaluates them in terms of MTCR and U.S. nonproliferation policy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FMS Program Relies on the Disclosure Process to Determine What Technology May Be Transferred", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. government has a complex process with many participants to  determine what technology may be transferred as part of a proposed sale.  An interagency committee oversees the National Disclosure Policy and  considers exceptions to the policy when classified military information is  involved in the proposed transfer. The committee does not approve actual  foreign military sales but provides authority to transmit the classified  information associated with sales. In addition, military departments with  responsibility over certain weapon systems and technologies have  administrative processes to make disclosure decisions within their  jurisdictions. Each military department has its own process for making  disclosure decisions within its authority and for preparing proposed FMS  agreements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Disclosure Process Involves Multiple Agencies", "paragraphs": ["The National Disclosure Policy Committee is responsible for formulating,  issuing, administering, and monitoring the implementation of the National  Disclosure Policy, as well as considering exceptions to the policy. Although  the committee is responsible for determining what classified military  information may be transmitted to a foreign government, it does not  approve the actual sale that transfers the information. The committee may  discuss actual sales in the context of considering exceptions to the policy.", "The committee consists of general members and special members who  represent heads of various federal agencies, DOD components, and each  military department. General members vote on all issues and include the  Secretaries of State, Defense, Army, Navy, and Air Force and the Chairman  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Special members usually vote only on those  issues in which they have a direct interest. The committee is co-chaired by  the State Department and DOD.", "The committee has a process for reviewing exceptions to the National  Disclosure Policy. As illustrated in figure 1, the committee\u2019s executive  secretary distributes any request for an exception to policy to all relevant  members. The committee\u2019s procedures allow a 30-day time frame for  reaching final decisions. The members present a position within 10 working days. If there is not unanimous agreement on the proposed  exception, the committee members work on achieving consensus. If they  are unable to do so, the committee chairman formulates a position and  informs the members within 10 working days. The chairman\u2019s decision  becomes final unless appealed to the Secretary or the Deputy Secretary of  Defense by the cognizant department or agency within 10 working days.", "Unlike in earlier times, when the FMS program was often favored over  commercial sales as the method of transfer for some sensitive weapon  systems, some committee representatives told us that today they typically  do not recommend that systems be sold through the FMS program and  often do not address the method of sale. According to several officials, both  methods of sale are equally secure in protecting technology. For example,  in early 1999 the committee agreed to change a long-standing policy that  required an advanced missile system to be sold through the FMS program.  The revised policy allows the system to be sold either through the FMS  program or directly by the contractor with State Department approval.  Irrespective of the method of sale, the purchasing country must agree to  security requirements, such as inventory of the equipment, and U.S.  government verification that the requirements have been met.", "DOD\u2019s policy is to remain generally neutral regarding the method of sale.  However, the policy allows for exceptions to permit FMS-only  recommendations based on criteria such as presidential directives,  legislation, and national or military department policies. While military  departments have recommended that certain weapon systems be sold only  through the FMS program, military officials we met with had widely  varying opinions about whether the FMS program affords greater control  than direct commercial sales. Some officials prefer selling sensitive items  through the FMS program because DOD officials are involved in  implementing every aspect of the sale under that program. Other officials  stated that defense contractors have strong incentives to adhere to export  control laws and will ensure that sensitive items are properly controlled  when sold directly by the contractor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Military Departments Have Separate Disclosure and FMS Agreement Processes", "paragraphs": ["Each military department has its own process for implementing the  National Disclosure Policy and for preparing FMS agreements. The  Secretary of Defense has delegated authority to implement the National  Disclosure Policy to military departments and other defense agencies for  information originated by or under the control of their organizations,  provided such information is in compliance with disclosure policy. The  military departments, in turn, have delegated some disclosure authority to  the heads of commands, agencies, and major staff elements within their  organizations. Major military commands we visited have delegated certain  authority to disclosure officers who work with weapon program offices on  international sales. Appendix I provides additional information on the  differences between military departments\u2019 disclosure and FMS agreement  preparation processes. For example, the Army generally handles FMS  agreement preparations at the command level with higher level approval,  while the Air Force prepares FMS agreements at the Secretary level with  input from other headquarters and program offices. The Army maintains  disclosure as a security policy function held by the Deputy Chief of Staff for  Intelligence, while the Air Force and the Navy consider disclosure an  international function located with the Deputy Under Secretary of the Air  Force for International Affairs and the Navy International Programs Office,  respectively.", "DOD organizations prepare Delegation of Disclosure Authority Letters or  component regulations to provide authority to disclosure officers to  transmit classified military information to foreign nationals as part of  weapon sales or other military activities. The disclosure letter explains  classification levels, categories, scope, and limitations on information,  including unclassified technical data, that may be disclosed to a foreign  recipient. Some FMS program officials, in consultation with disclosure  officers, refer to the disclosure letter as guidance when preparing FMS  agreements. Each military department has a mechanism for verifying that  the agreements do not exceed disclosure authority before referring them to  the Defense Security Cooperation Agency and State Department for final  approval.", "Disclosure letters can be subject to interpretation. In matters that require  interpretation, disclosure officers contact program managers or engineers  for technical assistance. At military commands we visited, the disclosure  officers were in separate organizations from the FMS program  management offices. For weapon systems programs that had large  international sales, the disclosure officers were co-located in the program  offices to facilitate decisions.

The Defense Security Cooperation  Agency is responsible for raising issues, through appropriate channels,  when higher decision-making authority is required. It relies on the military  departments, as well as other DOD organizations, to identify technology  transfer concerns. A DOD directive requires certain DOD components to  conduct policy reviews, technical evaluations, operational and military  impact assessments, and intelligence assessments of all proposed  technology transfer cases. However, Defense Security Cooperation Agency  officials said they do not assess whether the military departments have  complied with this directive for controlled technology.", "As required by policy, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency refers FMS  requests and agreements for major defense equipment to the Director,  Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition and Technology. Joint Staff, in coordination with  the unified commands and the military departments, provides operational  and military mission impact assessments on technology transfers. DOD\u2019s  Acquisition and Technology office is responsible for ensuring that the  proposed technology to be transferred does not threaten U.S. weapon  superiority. Security assistance policy requires coordination with these  organizations for all new security assistance requests and FMS agreements  for major defense equipment, including requests and agreements that are  expected to result in a notification to Congress or determined to be of a  sensitive nature. Defense Security Cooperation Agency country managers  determine whether or not to refer FMS requests and agreements that meet  major defense equipment criteria to the Joint Staff and the Acquisition and  Technology office. Items that do not meet the criteria are only occasionally  referred to these organizations.", "The Defense Security Cooperation Agency is also responsible for notifying  the State Department of all requests for purchases through the FMS  program and for obtaining the Department\u2019s approval for FMS agreements.  The State Department must provide its approval before any arms can be  transferred, including arms sold under the FMS program, but it relies on  DOD to provide information describing the proposed sale and the  sensitivity of the technology.", "The Defense Security Cooperation Agency refers FMS requests and  agreements to the Defense Threat Reduction Agency on an ad hoc basis.  The Director of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency stated that the  Agency does not generally review FMS requests or agreements. However,  Defense Threat Reduction Agency officials told us they should be given the  opportunity to respond officially on all FMS major defense equipment or  sensitive items. Currently, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency does  not formally refer FMS requests or agreements to the Defense Threat  Reduction Agency and furnishes information copies on a limited number of  cases. Because one of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency\u2019s principal  functions is to provide DOD\u2019s recommendations on license applications, it  utilizes technical experts and intelligence sources to determine the  advisability of exporting a particular controlled item. The Defense Threat  Reduction Agency, in reviewing licenses, will examine the legitimacy of  foreign companies involved in the sale by using intelligence sources as well  as the State Department\u2019s Watch List of export violators. Defense Security  Cooperation Agency officials stated that they informally discuss  intelligence assessments about FMS cases with Defense Threat Reduction  Agency officials. Defense Security Cooperation Agency officials told us  that they have an opportunity to review the Defense Threat Reduction  Agency\u2019s intelligence assessments because most FMS cases have  associated commercial sales components that require an export license.  The export license review process identifies foreign companies that may be  involved in the sale.", "The Defense Security Cooperation Agency also does not routinely refer  FMS requests or agreements to intelligence organizations such as the  Defense Intelligence Agency for review.

For example, MTCR-controlled equipment has been  transferred under the FMS program without proper review and approval  for MTCR concerns. The State Department and DOD have no assurance  that MTCR-controlled items are routinely being reviewed for  nonproliferation concerns. As a result, both departments have begun  discussions to improve the review of MTCR items. The State Department  and DOD have organizations with expertise in reviewing MTCR-controlled  technology for export licenses but are not fully using them to review  proposed FMS agreements.", "The State Department must provide its approval before any arms, including  those sold under FMS agreements, can be transferred. The Defense  Security Cooperation Agency submits proposed FMS agreements or  summaries to the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs,  Office of Regional Security and Arms Transfer Policy (Regional Security  Office), for approval. When an FMS agreement involves missiles or  components that may fall under the MTCR, the Regional Security Office  refers the agreement to the State Department\u2019s Office of Chemical,  Biological, and Missile Nonproliferation for review. However, because the  Regional Security Office does not have technical experts and may not know  which items are MTCR-controlled, officials told us that they rely on DOD to  identify whether or not MTCR-controlled items are included in an  agreement.", "State Department Regional Security Office officials identified a deficiency  in the FMS review process for MTCR-controlled items in May 1999, when  reviewing a follow-on FMS agreement to a co-production agreement to  produce the M1A1 tank with a foreign government. The U.S. government  sold equipment under a series of FMS agreements beginning in 1989,  including a filament winding machine controlled by the MTCR, to this  foreign government to build a tank factory. Regional Security Office  officials reviewed this follow-on agreement and forwarded it to the MTCR  experts within the State Department for review. The MTCR experts initially  denied approval of the FMS agreement because they thought it was for the  sale of the filament winding machine. Because this machine is controlled  under category II of the MTCR, they were concerned that this export could  contribute to the foreign government\u2019s missile production capabilities.  However, when State Department officials learned that the agreement was  for the sale of spares for a filament winding machine that had already been  exported, they approved the sale of the spares. State Department officials  told us that the original FMS agreements were not referred to the missile  experts for review because the filament winding machine was not  specifically listed in the information provided by the Defense Security  Cooperation Agency and was identified as test and support equipment.  Information was not provided that would have allowed a missile  technology expert to know that the agreement involved MTCR-controlled  technology.", "State Department officials told us that several years ago there was another  incident involving a sale to the same country under the same series of FMS  agreements. The U.S. government sold an MTCR-controlled item, an  accelerator, without proper review by MTCR experts. According to State  Department officials, a subsequent export license application to sell an  accelerator to the same country was denied by the State Department  because the item was MTCR-controlled. The contractor questioned the  denial because the U.S. government had already sold an accelerator to the  same country. The State Department advised DOD officials about the  problem but does not know what corrective measures DOD took at that  time to ensure that MTCR-controlled items under FMS agreements were  being properly reviewed. DOD officials responsible for the M1A1 tank FMS  agreements said they were not contacted or made aware of the problem.", "Sufficient information about weapon system components and equipment in  FMS agreements is necessary to identify MTCR-controlled items. Many  MTCR-controlled items may not be obvious- even to a technical expert- unless the items in an agreement are reviewed against the list of MTCR- controlled equipment. Some MTCR-controlled items are dual-use and  controlled by the Commerce Control List, resulting in confusion over who  is responsible for identifying and controlling these items.  Regional  Security Office officials assumed that DOD had identified all of the  technology issues in FMS agreements- including whether or not the  agreements covered MTCR-controlled technology. Although State  Department officials have discovered two such cases, they do not know  how many MTCR-controlled items may have been transferred under the  FMS program without proper review because there are no procedures in  place to identify such items. In addition to missile-related technology  proliferation concerns, State Department officials are concerned about the  transfer of sensitive technologies, such as medical testing equipment that  can be used to develop biological weapons, that are controlled by other  nonproliferation regimes.", "Technical experts in the military departments, however, told us that they do  not review FMS agreements specifically for compliance with the MTCR.  Officials at various military departments, commands, and program offices  told us that they do not compare items to be transferred under FMS  agreements against the list of MTCR-controlled items. They stated that  MTCR compliance is the responsibility of either the State Department or  the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. According to State Department  and Defense Security Cooperation Agency officials, the military  departments also have technical experts who know what a particular item\u2019s  capabilities are and exactly what equipment is being transferred under an  FMS agreement.", "Defense Security Cooperation Agency officials said their agency does not  have the technical experts to identify sensitive technologies such as those  controlled by the MTCR. Since the Defense Security Cooperation Agency  learned of this coordination deficiency for missile-related technology, it has  taken steps to have military departments identify missile-related items in  proposed FMS agreements. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency sent  draft guidance to the military departments, in August 1999, advising them  of their responsibility to identify missile-related technology that is included  in proposed agreements and to certify that MTCR concerns have been  resolved. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency also plans to amend an  internal coordination document to ensure that agreements have been  properly reviewed for MTCR issues.", "The State Department routinely reviews proposed FMS agreements that  meet the dollar threshold for congressional notification. However, State  Department officials said that many MTCR-controlled items are valued  below this dollar threshold. The State Department uses a list of FMS  agreements that the Defense Security Cooperation Agency provides and  that gives a general description of the item being sold as the basis for  approving the low dollar value agreements. The current process for  approving low dollar value agreements does not identify MTCR-controlled  items unless the State Department requests additional information to  identify such items.", "The State Department and DOD currently do not fully utilize their  organizations that have expertise in reviewing MTCR-controlled items. For  example, the State Department established the Missile Technology Export  Control committee, an interagency working group, to review export license  applications involving MTCR-controlled items. However, while the State  Department committee representative reviews FMS agreements referred  by the Regional Security Office, the full committee does not review FMS  agreements for nonproliferation concerns. Defense Threat Reduction  Agency reviewers have technical expertise in weapon systems, as well as  knowledge of the types of items controlled by the MTCR, but they generally  do not identify MTCR-controlled items in agreements because the Defense  Security Cooperation Agency does not formally refer FMS agreements to  the Defense Threat Reduction Agency."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Reinvention Initiatives Focus on Shortening Technology Transfer Approval Time", "paragraphs": ["DOD has several ongoing reinvention initiatives that attempt to address  foreign customer and industry complaints about the FMS program,  including the perception that the technology transfer review process takes  too long.

One of the group\u2019s proposals is to encourage  National Disclosure Policy Committee members to make decisions in a  timely manner when acting on exception cases. Although aware of DOD\u2019s  initiatives to make disclosure decisions more quickly, some committee  representatives said they need to research a case and assess the merits of a  proposed transfer from a national security perspective. Some officials  responsible for disclosure and releasability decisions also told us they have  been asked to make decisions more quickly.", "Some of the initiatives address the need to improve information to support  technology transfer decisions. For example, the DOD and industry working  group is proposing more rigorous implementation of current requirements  to prepare weapon systems program documents that include technology  transfer assessments. This proposal is aimed at addressing technology  transfer considerations early in the development of the weapon system to  facilitate decision-making when export requests are received. In addition,  the Navy recommended pursuing an electronic policy distribution and  coordination system to facilitate the work of its internal technology  transfer review board and speed disclosure processing. The Army is also  sponsoring an initiative to develop an integrated classified database of  relevant records and documents such as the National Disclosure Policy and  weapon-specific program protection plans to support technology transfer  decisions. Air Force headquarters officials told us the Air Force recently  reviewed its approximately 800 Delegation of Disclosure Authority Letters  to ensure disclosure guidance for all Air Force programs was current. They  said one benefit of the review was to reduce the need to consult  headquarters staff when making disclosure decisions related to Air Force  programs, since officials in the field have current guidance.", "The DOD and industry working group proposes that DOD conduct a  technical review of the U.S. Munitions List to identify items and  technologies that should be decontrolled because they are low-risk or  already widely available. However, the State Department has authority over  the U.S. Munitions List and, with DOD concurrence, is responsible for  determining what items are to be controlled.", "Beside the FMS reinvention initiatives, DOD has chartered three high-level  advisory groups to study international industrial base issues in the context  of U.S. national security. These studies are ongoing, but the findings are  likely to have an impact on technology transfer policy and procedures.", "To date, none of DOD\u2019s initiatives specifically addresses the gaps in the  FMS technology transfer review process.
