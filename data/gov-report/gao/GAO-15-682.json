GAO found that for fiscal years 2011 through 2013, internal controls were designed and implemented to reasonably assure that damage claim expenses were appropriately disbursed from the Fund.", "Oil removal. GAO identified several internal control deficiencies, which demonstrated that NPFC was unable to reasonably assure that oil removal disbursements were appropriately disbursed from the Fund. GAO's statistical tests of oil removal disbursements less than or equal to $500,000 identified design and implementation control deficiencies involving invoices that lacked required certifications, high visibility spills that were not identified, and missing supporting documentation for some costs. Also, GAO identified other issues, including that NPFC lacked policies and procedures for tracking and reconciling cash advances to EPA.", "NPFC has established a system of internal controls for the designation and billing, as appropriate, of responsible parties.

During the period, not including the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, NPFC billed $272 million to responsible parties and collected $39 million. GAO found that NPFC was unable to bill for a large percentage of the damage claim and oil removal disbursements over $500,000 because the responsible party had reached its limit of liability, not all elements of liability were established, or the source of the spill could not be identified.", "OPA authorizes using the Fund for immediate response costs and when responsible parties cannot be identified or pay. GAO analyzed the Fund's sources of income and found the 8-cent per-barrel tax on petroleum products is relied on as the primary, consistent source of funding because the Fund has disbursed more funding than it has been able to recover. This is because the Fund is not reimbursed for certain damage claim and oil removal costs, as noted above. The average amount of the Fund's revenue from the per-barrel tax was 60 percent of the total revenue for fiscal years 2011 through 2013. The per-barrel tax is set to expire at the end of 2017, creating uncertainty with regard to future revenue sources for the Fund. As of September 30, 2014, the Fund's balance was about $4.6 billion, which reflects approximately $1.3 billion in fines from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

Since amounts collected are not applied  to individual items, such as disbursements on the bill, we were unable to  determine whether individual disbursements were fully reimbursed if the  bill was not paid in full. Our analysis found that 32 of the 122  disbursements were fully reimbursed by the responsible party.  Additionally, 2 of the 122 disbursements were not fully reimbursed as the  responsible party filed bankruptcy and settled with NPFC for a lesser  amount; these were excluded from our review, as NPFC recognized  these 2 disbursements as paid in full.

The key  controls include verifying that transactions are properly authorized,  processed for payment, and recorded. For damage claims, the testing of  key controls included  reviewing controls to reasonably assure that claimants presented their  claims to the responsible party before submitting them to NPFC;  reviewing controls related to the processing of claim reconsiderations  and reviewing controls related to NPFC\u2019s coordination efforts with the  Federal On-Scene Coordinators (FOSC) in adjudicating the claims  and identifying responsible parties;  reviewing controls to reasonably assure that where applicable,  responsible parties were identified and recorded; and  reviewing controls to reasonably assure that claim determinations  were appropriately reviewed and approved by an appropriate  individual, payments were authorized, and each claimant signed a  release letter accepting the payment as full and final within the  allowable time frame.", "For oil removal costs, the testing of key controls included  reviewing NPFC\u2019s internal controls related to the review and  authorization of oil removal activities;  reviewing controls around the FOSC\u2019s certification of the  appropriateness of oil removal activities;  reviewing NPFC\u2019s coordination efforts with the FOSCs in identifying  responsible parties; and  reviewing controls to reasonably assure that where applicable,  responsible parties were identified and recorded and that payments  for removal cost activities were appropriately authorized and recorded  in the agency\u2019s accounting records.", "We analyzed the results of these tests to determine if the internal controls  in place were effective.", "To assess the design of internal controls for reasonably assuring that  responsible parties were designated and billed, as appropriate, for all  disbursements, we (1) reviewed NPFC\u2019s policies and procedures for  designating and billing the responsible parties, (2) evaluated potential  risks and the effectiveness of NPFC\u2019s controls to mitigate those risks,   (3) interviewed NPFC officials and staff, and (4) obtained billings and  receipt data for fiscal years 2011 through 2014.
