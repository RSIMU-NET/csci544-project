This presented several challenges for Zika virus disease surveillance and research efforts, such as challenges related to establishing a national definition for reporting cases. Knowledge about Zika virus epidemiology has increased in the past year, including information about Zika virus disease incidence and distribution of cases, and its associated adverse health outcomes. Most of the 5,197 Zika virus disease cases reported by April 5, 2017 in the United States were associated with travel from affected areas outside the continental United States. Only two states had disease cases of local, mosquito-borne transmission\u2014216 were in Florida and 6 in Texas. While much has been learned about the epidemiology of the Zika virus, many unknowns remain, including the actual number of infections and the full spectrum of outcomes.", "The 16 Zika virus diagnostic tests authorized during the outbreak varied in their performance and operational characteristics. For example, they varied in their ability to detect the virus and provide accurate results. In developing the diagnostic tests, manufacturers faced challenges in several areas, including access to clinical samples and other authorized diagnostic tests for comparison purposes. Users of the tests also encountered challenges, including determining the most accurate test to use, and obtaining equipment needed to conduct the tests. Some manufacturers raised concerns about the difficulty in developing diagnostic tests that met the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) requirements for Emergency Use Authorization and some users expressed concerns about selecting tests amongst those authorized. GAO also determined that CDC and FDA did not follow some of their guidance in communicating with users of diagnostic tests, including providing clear information that would have enabled users to more easily compare performance across different tests.", "Mosquito control programs in the United States are implemented at state and local levels and are critical to mitigating the risks associated with the Zika virus. Control methods include applying pesticides, reducing available water sources for breeding, and using personal protection. Each method has its strengths and limitations. For example, some control methods are more effective at reducing mosquito populations while others help prevent individuals from mosquito bites. Similarly, each method has some limitations, for example, there is varied public opposition to the use of certain pesticides. CDC supports state and local mosquito control activities primarily by providing guidance on mosquito control methods and funding to support certain mosquito control efforts. Challenges federal agencies faced in supporting these activities include sustaining staff expertise in mosquito control during periods when there are no outbreaks, funding constraints, and effectively communicating information about the geographical distribution of mosquitoes that transmit the Zika virus."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations to FDA and CDC, including that CDC establish a transparent process for providing test manufacturers access to diagnostic tests and FDA and CDC provide information to help ensure that users of diagnostic tests can compare performance.

According to CDC, the data collected through  this registry will be used to update recommendations for clinical care, to  plan for services for pregnant women and families affected by Zika virus,  and to improve prevention of Zika virus infection during pregnancy. The  Puerto Rico Department of Health and CDC developed the Zika Active  Pregnancy Surveillance System (ZAPSS)/Sistema de Vigilancia Activa de  Zika en Embarazos (SVAZE) to evaluate the association between  possible Zika virus infection during pregnancy and adverse outcomes  during pregnancy, birth, and early childhood up to 3 years of age.  Pregnant women in Puerto Rico with laboratory evidence of possible Zika  virus infection (positive or equivocal test results, regardless of whether  they have symptoms) and prenatally or perinatally exposed infants born  to these women will be actively monitored.

In comparison, 35,375 disease cases were reported in Puerto  Rico from January 1, 2015 through April 5, 2017, according to a CDC  Zika virus disease case count update report. The Puerto Rico blood donor  study authors concluded that results from blood donation screening  during arboviral outbreaks can supplement routine clinical and  surveillance data for improved targeting of prevention efforts.", "Second, limitations in Zika virus diagnostic testing can also affect the  accuracy of the number of Zika virus cases reported in disease  surveillance due to inaccurate laboratory test results. Some Zika  diagnostic tests can determine that a recent flavivirus infection has  occurred, which may or may not be caused by Zika virus.

The  reason is that related flaviviruses such as dengue, yellow fever, West  Nile, and Japanese encephalitis, which can be caused by a previous  natural infection or vaccination, can give a positive Zika virus IgM result  by a serology test. This has proven to be an issue in South America,  Central America, Mexico, and Puerto Rico, where multiple flaviviruses are  circulating, according to FDA officials.", "Another limitation is that positive results need to be confirmed by using  the CDC algorithm, which can include the plaque reduction neutralizing  testing (PRNT) that is performed only at CDC or one of CDC\u2019s designated  confirmatory testing laboratories (currently there are five designated state  public health laboratories, according to HHS officials). The PRNT  requires about six days to complete, and the logistics of specimen  shipment can further extend the time, according to HHS officials.  According to CDC officials, CDC typically takes three weeks to send  PRNT results but reporting time may be longer during the summer.

The test requires mixing patient serum with live Zika virus to  determine how effective the serum is at neutralizing the virus in cell  culture. However, neutralizing antibodies may still react to related  viruses. According to FDA officials, the PRNT is a well-recognized,  established standard laboratory technique and therefore did not have to  go through FDA approval or authorization. However, as mentioned above,  only a few laboratories are able to perform the PRNT for the Zika virus.  According to a CDC document, PRNT is considered the \u201cgold-standard\u201d  for confirmatory testing for Zika virus infection.

Serology testing could be used to detect IgG antibodies;  however, the United States has no EUA test for detecting Zika virus  specific IgG at this time. The associations between the Zika virus and  adverse health outcomes in newborns and the ability to detect infections  older than 12 weeks could be relevant to family planning and clinical care  of patients, if such tests were available. However, IgG is typically highly  cross-reactive to other flaviviruses and can remain elevated for years  following an infection or vaccination, so it is difficult to determine when a  patient has an elevated IgG if it is elevated for a recent infection, a prior  flavivirus infection (possibly years earlier) or both."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overall Limitations of Diagnostic Testing Can be Addressed Through the Use of Algorithms", "paragraphs": ["As discussed above, different types of diagnostic tests for the Zika virus  have different strengths and limitations.

Information is still evolving about antigens that are unique to the Zika  virus and how long the virus persists in various bodily fluids, making it  difficult to develop diagnostic tests for the virus.", "Second, the lack of well characterized clinical samples for diagnostic test  development was identified as a major challenge for developing Zika virus  diagnostic tests, according to the federal agency officials and  manufacturers we interviewed, and all the experts who participated in our  meeting. However, several manufacturers told us that obtaining samples  for testing was difficult because of high costs, potential cross-reactivity  with other flaviviruses, and an insufficient number of samples. For  example, one manufacturer had to pay more than $200,000 to acquire  samples from commercial vendors. According to another manufacturer  we interviewed, a single clinical sample for the Zika virus can cost around  $450. Manufacturers told us they requested, but were not able to obtain,  samples from CDC in the early stages of the outbreak and one  manufacturer stated this was because not enough samples were  available. One manufacturer stated that this delayed the development of  its test. According to HHS officials, to help address the lack of samples for  test development, BARDA, a component of ASPR, provided  characterized samples to test manufacturers, once the samples became  available in midsummer 2016. However, HHS officials stated that no test  manufacturer received enough samples from BARDA for the EUA testing  requirements and had to acquire samples from other sources to support  the EUA application.", "BARDA officials told us they have worked closely with CDC and  manufacturers to collect and characterize clinical samples that can be  used to develop and validate diagnostic tests to detect Zika virus  infection. Manufacturers also had issues with clinical samples, since  samples sourced from Central and South America were not well  characterized, because other circulating flaviviruses could cause cross- reactivity, creating uncertainty in the outcome of a given test.", "Third, FDA recommends that manufacturers perform clinical evaluation  studies that compare their tests to another \u201ccomparator\u201d assay that is  laboratory developed, an in-house assay, or an EUA test. The selection  and quality of the comparator assay directly affects the measurements of  the test performance. A CDC document states that CDC rarely has the  resources needed to fully respond to public health emergencies but  should provide a consistent, fair, and transparent review process for all  public-private initiatives. However, according to CDC officials, they did not  make their EUA test available to some commercial manufacturers for use  as a comparator assay. One manufacturer we interviewed said its request  to CDC for reagents to perform the Trioplex test was denied since it was  a commercial manufacturer. Another manufacturer told us it attempted to  purchase an EUA test from another manufacturer but was unable to  because the other manufacturer refused to sell the EUA diagnostic test.  According to HHS officials, in order to obviate this challenge, FDA allows  manufacturers to use laboratory developed tests as comparator tests. An  expert at our meeting, stated a manufacturer had to establish their own  assay because commercial manufacturers cannot purchase the Trioplex  test or create it since it is unpublished.", "Two of the 12 authorized molecular diagnostic test labels have CDC\u2019s  Trioplex listed as their comparator assay. CDC was the first manufacturer  to receive an EUA and therefore the Trioplex test was the first authorized  molecular test that other tests attempting to get EUA could be compared  to. According to CDC officials, diagnostic tests CDC created are  distributed only to public health laboratories performing Zika virus clinical  diagnoses because in the early stage of the response, CDC did not have  the capacity to adequately support public health laboratories and also  supply commercial manufacturers with CDC tests for performance testing.  CDC officials also stated that issues with intellectual property rights, such  as patents, or material transfer agreements, may prevent sharing  reagents, individual components and technology. An expert from our  meeting stated that this could have been overcome by publishing the test  protocol with specific details about the test. However, CDC distributed its  tests to four manufacturers through technology transfers, when no  shortage of reagents was experienced by September 2016. CDC officials  we spoke with were unclear of how the process to transfer authorized  CDC tests to manufacturers originally started. Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government state that agencies should document  their operational processes to ensure that the organization meets its  objectives. Without a clear and transparent process for distributing CDC  diagnostic tests, the agency may not be able to develop the capacity of  the commercial sector during an outbreak.", "Fourth, interacting with international entities to obtain samples and  perform testing presented some challenges. Some foreign countries have  laws that must be followed when collecting samples. A manufacturer we  interviewed faced import challenges trying to perform a diagnostic test in  another country. One manufacturer told us it took 6 weeks for diagnostic  manufacturers to ship materials to another country for testing, and the  import tax was $30,000. An expert from our meeting also stated that  obtaining CDC import permits was challenging.", "Fifth, manufacturers had mixed opinions on the effectiveness of  communication from FDA. Specifically, representatives of some  manufacturers said that FDA did a good job communicating with them  throughout the EUA process during the recent outbreaks while some said  that communication with FDA could be improved. FDA interacts with  manufacturers about potential EUA products to help ensure that  manufacturers submit complete EUA applications and thereby enhances  FDA\u2019s ability to review and ultimately authorize the EUA. FDA stated  that its review expertise is scarce, making it imperative to prioritize efforts  to move the best diagnostic tests forward first (that is, the test that is most  effective in addressing an unmet public health need). However, one  manufacturer we interviewed stated that the longer time for  communication and time to receive authorization from FDA were  challenging in developing diagnostic test for Zika virus. According to FDA,  the average time between pre-EUA, a time when FDA begins review of  fact sheets and other documentation before the submission and EUA  submission is 87.6 days, with a range of 14 to 178 days for Zika  diagnostic tests. The average time once an application was submitted to  the authorization date was 7.4 days, with a range of 1 to 26 days. A  manufacturer suggested an improvement would be to shorten the time to  respond to inquiries.", "FDA developed templates for molecular and serology diagnostic tests and  sent them to manufacturers in order to support obtaining an EUA.  According to FDA officials, templates provided transparency in terms of  the studies required for a successful EUA submission and streamlined  submission for the manufacturers. FDA officials stated that updates to  studies were communicated to manufacturers as new information became  available during the Zika outbreak, including by direct communication with  manufacturers and through FDA\u2019s webpages. As new information on Zika  virus became available, FDA instituted changes to the EUA to ensure that  manufacturers were demonstrating adequate performance for their  diagnostic tests. However, some manufacturers requested greater clarity.  Some manufacturers we interviewed stated that FDA changed its  requirements for authorization throughout the process. HHS officials  stated that they had to incorporate new information about the Zika virus  into their review process as it became available throughout the outbreak,  consequently changing the required amount of analytical and clinical data  requested from manufacturers before they could make EUA  authorizations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Diagnostic Test Users Faced Challenges Acquiring Equipment and Determining the Most Accurate Test", "paragraphs": ["Zika virus diagnostic test users we interviewed faced challenges because  they had to purchase new equipment to be compliant with the EUA label  on a test they wanted to use. It was difficult to determine the most  accurate test because information on the EUA labels of the performance  characteristics of tests were not comparable or not available on the CDC  website.", "First, although CDC officials stated that all states had at least one public  health laboratory that had the equipment to run the CDC MAC-ELISA  test, representatives from several laboratories we interviewed stated that  they had to acquire new equipment to be able to perform a certain EUA  diagnostic test. For instance, implementation of serological testing within  another federal laboratory was delayed because additional equipment  was needed to perform the authorized test. CDC officials stated that the  agency is working to expand diagnostic testing capacity within both public  health and commercial laboratories in the United States.", "Second, diagnostic test users also faced challenges in determining the  most accurate test because information on the labels was not easily  comparable. An FDA document states that the agency should share  information that is up-to-date, understandable, and easily accessible so  diagnostic test users has some basis for choosing medical products to  purchase and use. Moreover, according to this document, posting  compilation or analysis of data can benefit users since all users may not  have the ability or resources to independently analyze raw data. By  comparing the diagnostic test labels, we found that the labels had units  listed differently for key performance characteristics, data had to be  extracted from each product insert, and some of the information could not  be readily compared with other data. We also found that performance  characteristics are listed on the diagnostic test labels, but it is not  available in a consolidated format.", "According to FDA officials, the agency began collecting information using  FDA Reference Materials because different manufacturers were using  different samples and potentially different methods to determine the limit  of detection of their tests. Using common samples across  manufacturers allowed FDA to directly compare the limits of detection  across different molecular diagnostic tests. However, the FDA Reference  Materials were available only after certain diagnostic tests were already  authorized under EUA. Therefore, those diagnostic test labels did not  initially list the limit of detection using the FDA Reference Materials until  their labels were updated.", "FDA officials stated that if manufacturers had not previously performed  the limit of detection using the FDA Reference Materials, they would need  to perform those tests and provide results to FDA. This would allow users  to compare limits of detection for tests that were performed using the  same samples and procedures. FDA officials stated that they were  waiting to receive all the results from all the manufacturers with an  authorized diagnostic test before considering consolidating information  about performance characteristics, since this information was already  publically available in the updated product labels of the individual tests.  All authorized molecular test manufacturers had submitted limit of  detection data using the FDA Reference Materials to FDA by March 6,  2017.", "Until limit of detection data have been extracted and summarized from all  the diagnostic test labels, it may be difficult and time-consuming for users  to compare the performance characteristics and results of diagnostic  tests. By waiting until FDA has all the information before compiling  information about performance characteristics, it will be time-consuming  for users to compare the limit of detection across the authorized  molecular diagnostic tests. This will become especially important with  the mosquito season approaching and public health laboratories making  decisions about which tests to use.", "Another challenge users faced was related to the lack of information on  comparator assays. An FDA document recommends that there should be  a clear description of all methods used and how and what data were  collected when performing comparison testing, including a description of  the comparator assay \u201cnonreference standard.\u201d Experts at our meeting  agreed that identifying the comparator assay would make it easier to  compare the risks and benefits of different Zika virus diagnostic tests.  The selection and quality of the comparator assay directly affects the  legitimacy of the comparison of the test performance. When we  compared product labels for different molecular tests, we found that 6 of  12 product labels did not identify the comparator assay and that the  comparator assay could fall into one of three types: (1) another EUA test,  (2) a laboratory developed test, or (3) an in-house assay (see appendix  V).", "FDA officials stated that the comparator assay for authorized diagnostic  tests can be either another authorized test or a validated reference  method and manufacturers are allowed to decide if they will identify the  comparator assay. However, the manufacturers are not required to do so.  According to FDA officials, comparison studies for EUA diagnostic tests  are based on a relatively low number of clinical specimens, and the levels  of viral RNA in a number of specimens can be low. In addition, FDA  officials stated that these two factors preclude definitive conclusions  regarding the comparative performance of devices, and FDA staff are  concerned that studies using comparator assays in labeling may be used  to make inappropriate claims and could be misinterpreted by end users.  The use of FDA Reference Material allows for a more rigorous analysis of  the comparative sensitivities of the assays from the various  manufacturers, according to FDA officials.", "However, without knowing the identity of the comparator assay, it is more  difficult for users to compare performance characteristics across different  diagnostic tests and determine the most appropriate test to use.  According to an expert at our meeting, this information would be helpful  for laboratories in determining what test to use in the face of multiple  approved tests. Although the criteria for procuring diagnostic tests can  vary, for most laboratories the paramount focus is on test performance.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  agencies are to communicate quality information externally through  reporting lines so that external parties can help an entity achieve its  objectives and address related risks. CDC did not make publically  available data comparing the performance characteristics of different  CDC diagnostic tests that it distributed during the outbreak. CDC\u2019s  website has information about the performance of its two authorized  diagnostic tests and the PRNT technique, but not the laboratory- developed test it distributed, called the Singleplex laboratory developed  test (Singleplex).", "According to a HHS report, CDC did not provide information about one of  its diagnostic tests because it could potentially create confusion and could  have caused public health laboratories to discontinue use of the Trioplex  test, and it had not done a comprehensive comparison of the Trioplex and  Singleplex assay. Because CDC did not publically provide performance  information about its laboratory developed test\u2014which was distributed to  some public health laboratories\u2014questions arose regarding the sensitivity  of the two CDC tests (Singleplex and Trioplex, see text box).", "A CDC scientist (who later became a whistleblower) alleged that  the Emergency Operation Center at CDC endangered public  health when it failed to disclose that an emergency use authorized  CDC test used to detect Zika virus\u2014called the Trioplex Real-time  RT-PCR assay (Trioplex)\u2014was substantially less sensitive than  another CDC laboratory developed test (Singleplex). After raising  concern about the test\u2019s sensitivity, an Office of Special Counsel  (OSC) investigation was conducted.", "The CDC investigation into the whistleblower\u2019s claims did not  attempt to gather additional information on comparing the tests  from public health laboratories using the Singleplex test.  According to CDC officials, they could not do a direct comparison  of the two tests because the equipment required for both tests did  not exist at either location. The agency acknowledged that the  original Trioplex test was authorized only a smaller input volume  while the Singleplex is not subject to such limitation because it  had never been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) for review and was used only as a laboratory-developed  test.", "OSC encouraged CDC to promote scientific debate on this issue  and said that whistleblowers should be encouraged to speak out  on matters of public concern. OSC also requested the Department  of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct an independent  investigation about the allegations made and CDC\u2019s Associate  Director of Laboratory Science and Safety, who conducted the  investigation, found that the evidence did not support the  allegations. OSC found the CDC investigation reasonable. CDC  had three sources of data to compare the different tests\u2019  sensitivities. One was from the whistleblowers\u2019 laboratory, another  from the creator of the Trioplex test that was alleged to be less  sensitive, and the third was an independent laboratory that  compared the Singleplex and Trioplex tests.", "CDC submitted a substantial amendment to the Trioplex test for  FDA\u2019s authorization to increase the input volume of the test in  August 2016, and in January 2017 the authorization was  amended again to allow laboratories to use a singleplex reaction  on the Trioplex assay. According to CDC, the larger input volume  has been demonstrated to increase the sensitivity of the Trioplex  assay. According to a CDC website, a \u201chead-to-head comparison  of the Trioplex test and the Zika-only assay\u201d has not been  conducted. In HHS\u2019 technical  comments they stated that a \u201chead- to-head comparison of the Trioplex and the Singleplex laboratory  developed test\u201d has been performed and showed equivalent  performance.", "A journal article later showed that the original Trioplex test was  less sensitive than the Singleplex test. Increasing the input  volume of the test increased the limit of detection of the Trioplex  test approximately 20 to 50 times.", "Representatives of three scientific professional societies told us that  information about the development and verification of CDC\u2019s diagnostic  test should be made available to the scientific and medical communities.  Access to such data would provide transparency and allow for optimal  patient care, according to these representatives. According to these  societies\u2019 representatives, the lack of access to data on test performance  prevented users from making informed decisions about which test to  adopt or recommend during the outbreak. Without including information  on the performance characteristics of tests it is distributing, CDC cannot  ensure that healthcare providers and the public have the information they  need to make informed decisions about which test is best for their use."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Mosquito Control Methods Have Strengths and Limitations, and Federal Agencies Face Several Challenges Assisting These Efforts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Mosquito Control Methods in the United States Are Often Combined Under Integrated Vector Management", "paragraphs": ["Types of mosquito control methods available in the United States include:  (1) physical control, or nonchemical mosquito control, (2) larval mosquito  control, (3) adult mosquito control, and (4) personal protection. Mosquito  control entities and literature identified available methods that may control  mosquitoes in general. However, not all methods presented in this report  specifically apply to Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, in part because not all  such entities we spoke with had Aedes aegypti in their area. For example,  HHS identified ditching as irrelevant for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.  These methods can be combined with surveillance of the mosquito  population, using integrated vector management (IVM) to optimize the  application of multiple methods, depending on knowledge of mosquito  biology and distribution.", "Different mosquito control methods target different stages of the mosquito  lifecycle. The mosquito\u2019s lifecycle has two stages\u2014an aquatic stage in  which eggs develop into larvae and pupae and a terrestrial stage in which  the mosquito leaves the water, can fly, and can transmit pathogens and  lay eggs. Figure 7 depicts major lifecycle steps encompassing these  stages.", "Physical control, or the use of physical or mechanical means to remove  water sources serving as larval development sites or prevent mosquito  entry into buildings, includes (1) controlling water sources needed for  mosquito breeding and (2) using barriers, such as window screens, to  keep mosquitoes away from people. A National Science and  Technology Council (NSTC) report stated that physical control includes  removing standing sources of water, such as from containers, old tires, or  blocked drains, and using well-fitted and intact screens on all house doors  and windows.", "Mosquito control entity officials we interviewed told us that they use a  variety of physical control methods. For example, one told us that his  mosquito control program still benefits from ditching projects completed in  the 1960s and is continuing to use excavators to ditch areas to enhance  water run-off. Another official told us that his program includes a \u201cdrain  and cover\u201d community outreach approach, asking residents to drain  standing water, use window screens, and wear long-sleeved clothing. A  third official we interviewed included a program for swimming pool  management by helping identify and fill in abandoned swimming pools.", "Each of these physical control methods has strengths and limitations.  Specifically, officials from mosquito control entities told us that water- source control such as by large-scale ditching is very effective and avoids  the use of chemicals for certain types of mosquitoes. However, a  mosquito control entity official also said that this method is probably  challenged in the current regulatory environment. According to a NSTC  report, large-scale outdoor water source control may have limited  effectiveness against Aedes aegypti mosquitoes because breeding  requires only small volumes of water (for example, one tablespoon, under  certain conditions). Another mosquito control entity stated that inspections  of property by mosquito control personnel may be effective but are time- consuming. According to a NSTC report and mosquito control entity  officials we interviewed, such property inspections can be challenged by  privacy and property rights.", "In addition, while physical control of larval development sites can reduce  or eliminate mosquito larvae, the local environment may not be suited to  such measures if extensive water bodies are present. It may be  impractical or impossible to remove or move volumes of water.

Mosquito control entity officials we spoke  with all told us they use larviciding, such as with Bti, or with mosquito fish  that eat mosquito larvae.", "Using larvicides has strengths and limitations. Specifically, using  biologically based larvicides may be more accepted by the public than  adult pesticides, but is limited by cost and effectiveness. Officials from  mosquito control entities we spoke with told us that residents are more  accepting of biologically-based larvicides because they consider them  more natural. However, a mosquito control entity official added that  larviciding tends to be more expensive than other techniques. A mosquito  control official told us that mosquito-borne diseases have not been  successfully controlled by using larvicide alone because, while it reduces  the population by 70 percent to 80 percent, controlling a disease such as  the Zika virus disease requires a population reduction greater than 80  percent to 90 percent. Even very few mosquitoes can lead to an  outbreak or epidemic.", "A mosquito control entity official told us that larvicide also needs to be  applied within a limited window of opportunity and that larvicide  application is delayed in its effect.

Mosquito control entity officials we spoke with said they disperse a variety  of adulticides using a variety of methods, including handheld units,  helicopters, fixed wing aircraft, and trucks.

Specifically, officials  from mosquito control entities told us that adulticide spraying can be  effective in controlling mosquito populations. One mosquito control  professional noted that mosquito-borne diseases such as West Nile virus  disease have historically been controlled by adulticides. However, we  identified several limitations with adulticide spraying. One limitation  mosquito control entity officials and CDC staff identified is public  resistance to pesticides. Another limitation is that adulticiding  effectively requires control over droplet size; mosquito control entity  officials we spoke with told us they required special equipment to control  the dispersal rate and properties of the adulticides. Other limitations  include limited effectiveness under certain weather conditions and the  potentially deleterious effect of broad-spectrum adulticides on other  insects such as bees.", "Additionally, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are primarily daytime biters,  requiring spraying during certain times for optimal effectiveness.  However, one mosquito control entity official was reluctant to spray during  commuting hours, including times when schoolchildren go to or return from schools. Further, increasing resistance of mosquitoes to existing  active ingredients decreases the effectiveness of adulticiding and creates  the need for new control methods.

Mosquito control entity officials we spoke with agreed, noting the  importance of public education and outreach. For example, mosquito  control entity officials sometimes use a variety of approaches for such  efforts, such as going door to door, attending meetings and conferences,  holding public events at schools, buying radio time, and communicating  online. Mosquito control entity officials told us that two major challenges  that mosquito control efforts face are educating the public and ensuring  public compliance.

However, the state where the  mosquito control entity is located is entirely within the potential range  identified by the CDC map. An expert from our meeting told us that the  CDC map showed regions painted with a broad brush, and such  information could spread fear.", "To illustrate some differences between CDC\u2019s estimated potential range  of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and locations with reported occurrence of  the mosquito, we compared the CDC map to a map of historical mosquito  data compiled from multiple sources and published in a recent article  written by CDC scientists. The map from the article shows a different,  much sparser, pattern of recorded presence than CDC\u2019s estimated  potential range (figure 8).", "Experts identified limitations with both maps. For example, one expert  from our meeting told us that the CDC map may extend the potential  mosquito range too far north in some locations. Another expert stated that  the CDC map does not account for all the factors that affect mosquito  distribution. In addition, one expert told us that the data for the map on  the right in figure 8 may be incomplete, and a mosquito control official told  us that the map did not convey whether an area reporting no mosquitoes  had performed mosquito surveillance.", "CDC officials told us that their map was generated with data ranging as  far back as 1995, and was sourced from a combination of published  records and an understanding of species ecology and U.S. geography.", "However, the detailed information was not posted on the CDC website or  in documentation associated with the map. As a result, the map may  not be useful for all of its intended purposes. According to Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government, management should use  quality information to achieve the agency\u2019s objectives and should select  appropriate methods to communicate externally. Additionally, the  standards state that agency management should externally communicate  necessary quality information to achieve those objectives. This includes  selecting appropriate methods to communicate externally, considering  factors such as the intended recipients and the nature of the information  being communicated. With regards to the information presented on CDC  maps, experts suggested including more details, such as (1) collection  records, (2) measures of the stability of the mosquito populations  (showing how long populations of such mosquitoes would be expected to  persist in a given location), and (3) areas of risk for transmission of  mosquito-borne diseases. Additionally, understanding the date range and  sources of the data can help place map information in context. Without  such context, CDC\u2019s maps could generate confusion about mosquito  presence, resulting in concern among residents and public relations  challenges, among other things."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges in Linking Mosquito Control Efforts to Disease Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["CDC faced challenges in determining whether mosquito control efforts  are associated with the reduction of mosquito-borne disease. For  example, mosquito control entity officials told us the entity\u2019s mosquito  control efforts are not directly linked to disease reduction. An official from  another mosquito control entity told us that it links mosquito control only  to the mosquito population. Another said that it links mosquito control to  the presence of West Nile virus in sentinel chickens. Additionally, West  Nile virus, CDC officials told us, is a bird disease, so CDC can surveil for  West Nile virus and detect this virus 2 weeks before it can affect  people. However, Zika virus lacks this environmental component and  enters a country with human travelers. Zika virus is thus picked up by  human surveillance before mosquito surveillance and lacks a similar 2- week delay.", "Other challenges to analyzing the relationships between mosquito control  methods and disease reduction include the dependence of reported  disease cases on weather, human susceptibility and immunity. According  to CDC officials, data were insufficient to create an analogous link for the  Zika virus, in part because the specific data needed to demonstrate the  effect were not available, due to privacy considerations for individuals\u2019  health records. Therefore, it will be difficult to tease out the effect of  mosquito control methods on disease reduction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CDC had Limited Information on Mosquito Control Entities", "paragraphs": ["CDC\u2019s capacity to develop a national strategy for mosquito control is  limited and depends on its knowledge of mosquito control entities and  their capabilities.

CDC staff told us that this list is likely to  capture the larger, well-funded entities but may miss some smaller ones.", "Further, mosquito control capabilities in the United States are variable.  According to an assessment by the National Association of County and  City Health Officials, 68 percent of the responding mosquito control  entities in 10 priority jurisdictions were rated as \u201cneeds improvement.\u201d  A mosquito control official we interviewed agreed that variability in  mosquito control entity capacities is significant.

A mosquito control professional told us  that his program discontinued applying pesticides partly as a result of  NPDES permitting, but since the program still supplies pesticides, they  know that the use of pesticides has increased.
