Of the nine leading practices, the Coast Guard met three, partially met three, and did not meet three. For example, the Coast Guard generally has not employed models for predicting the outcome of maintenance investments and optimizing among competing investments, as called for in leading practices. In one instance, the Coast Guard used a model to optimize maintenance for its aviation pavement and, according to Coast Guard officials, found that it could save nearly $14 million by accelerating investment in this area (e.g., paving runways) sooner rather than deferring such maintenance. Coast Guard officials told us that such modeling could be applied within and across all of its shore infrastructure asset types, but the Coast Guard did not implement the results of this model and does not require their use.

To help carry out these and other missions, the Coast  Guard owns or leases more than 20,000 shore facilities, such as piers,  docks, boat stations, air facilities, and housing units at more than 2,700  locations. This infrastructure is often positioned along the nation\u2019s  coastlines where it can be vulnerable to damage from extreme weather.  All Coast Guard missions begin and end at a shore facility, and over 80  percent of Coast Guard personnel work onshore, according to the Coast  Guard. In June 2017, Coast Guard officials testified that the agency had  a $1.6 billion backlog of projects for recapitalization of its shore  infrastructure, as well as new construction. The replacement value of this  infrastructure was about $20 billion as of 2017. Being located along the  U.S. coastlines has resulted in some facilities requiring unexpected repair  and recapitalization, such as those impacted by superstorm Sandy, and  hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Matthew. In July 2018, we reported  that the Coast Guard had not been able to address shore infrastructure  projects, primarily due to lack of funding, longstanding acquisition  management challenges, and that previous Coast Guard leadership  prioritized the acquisition of new operational assets to replace aging ships  and aircraft, over maintaining and repairing shore infrastructure.", "According to the National Research Council (NRC), public sector  buildings are assets acquired through the investment of tax dollars, and  underfunded maintenance can affect public health and safety, reduce  productivity, and cause long-term financial losses.

However, Coast Guard officials  stated that funding for maintenance projects cannot be disaggregated  from overall OLM funding. The Coast Guard\u2019s 2017 shore infrastructure  annual report states that industry studies establish that the most effective  maintenance organizations spend about 17 percent of their staff labor  effort on corrective maintenance (i.e., repairs) and 83 percent on  preventative maintenance (e.g., activities such as changing buildings  systems\u2019 filters and oil, resealing pavement surfaces, or repainting  buildings). However, Coast Guard\u2019s analysis of OLM records indicated  that 66 percent of their facilities\u2019 staff labor effort was used for corrective  maintenance. This imbalance indicates that fewer funds are available for  preventative maintenance than industry studies suggest, which could  increase costs and affect service lives if preventative maintenance cannot  be performed to the extent necessary. The annual report further stated  that the significant investment needed for corrective maintenance reflects  the state of the Coast Guard\u2019s aging infrastructure and the strain it places  on maintenance personnel. Moreover, Coast Guard officials testified to  Congress in June 2017 that aging infrastructure adversely affects  operational efficiency. Further, in July 2018 Congressional testimony by  the Coast Guard Deputy Commandant for Mission Support stated that the  agency needs to rebuild shore infrastructure readiness with sound  investments in operations and maintenance, but budget realities result in  deferred maintenance, fewer spare parts, and infrastructure reliability and  security concerns."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Coast Guard\u2019s Process for Managing Its Shore Infrastructure Does Not Fully Meet 6 of 9 Leading Practices, Resulting in Management Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard\u2019s process to manage its shore infrastructure  recapitalization and deferred maintenance backlogs does not fully meet 6  of 9 leading practices we have previously identified for managing public  sector maintenance backlogs.

We have previously reported that the eventual need to address deferred maintenance and repair could  significantly affect an agency\u2019s future budget resources. The Coast  Guard has made limited progress and partially met this leading practice  by disposing of some unneeded assets, but it has not consistently or  extensively aligned its property and mission needs. For example, in 2017,  the Coast Guard\u2019s Civil Engineering Units and facility engineers reviewed  all projects on its $1.77 billion PC&I project backlog and removed 132  projects from it because, according to officials, they were either no longer  valid as a result of mission changes, a non-PC&I alternative/solution was  found to be more beneficial, or the need was met through another  project. This validation effort was a positive step toward aligning  property and mission needs, but it raises questions about whether and to  what extent the PC&I backlog is routinely and consistently managed to  ensure that projects reflect mission needs.", "The Coast Guard made some progress aligning property and mission  needs through the sale of some assets. For example, in 2017, it sold 189  of its 2,961 housing assets through use of an initiative to divest itself of  some housing assets\u2014an effort which garnered $26.8 million in total  sales proceeds over the life of the program. However, the Coast  Guard\u2019s ability to dispose of unneeded assets has been limited in some  instances. For example, in 2013, the Coast Guard identified 18  multimission stations with duplicative coverage that could be permanently  closed, using a process based on criteria that reflected mission needs. In  October 2017, we reported that closing these stations could potentially  generate $290 million in cost savings over 20 years; however, as of  September 2018, the Coast Guard had taken no action to close these  stations or establish time frames for their closure, although Coast Guard  agreed with our recommendation that they do so. Moreover, our  analysis of Coast Guard planning documents found that 5 of the 18  multimission stations recommended for closure in 2013 have projects on  the Coast Guard\u2019s current PC&I backlog. For example, Station Shark  River, in New Jersey, was recommended for recapitalization in fiscal year  2017, despite Coast Guard recommendations to close the station in 1988,  1996, 2007, and 2013. Notably, the Coast Guard has made multiple  attempts in previous years to close stations that it deemed suitable for  closure but was unable to close them due to congressional intervention,  and subsequent legislation prohibiting closures. Given the Coast  Guard\u2019s competing acquisition, operational, and maintenance needs, and  PC&I backlog that will cost at least $1.77 billion to address, difficult trade- off decisions to align real property needs by disposing of unneeded  assets may help to mitigate some resource challenges."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Coast Guard Did Not Meet 3 of 9 Leading Practices for Managing Shore Infrastructure Backlogs", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard did not meet 3 of 9 leading practices for managing  shore infrastructure backlogs, including establishing clear maintenance  and repair investment objectives, employing models for predicting the  outcomes of investments and analyzing trade-offs, and structuring  budgets and related information to address maintenance backlogs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Establish Clear Maintenance and Repair Investment Objectives and Set Priorities among Outcomes to Be Achieved", "paragraphs": ["Agencies with maintenance and repair responsibilities should determine  what outcomes are most important to achieve and set priorities among  them, according to leading practices. Coast Guard provided guidance for  central DLM planning boards, which calls for stakeholders to identify  which projects will be reviewed by the planning boards, for board  members to consider project trade-offs and to make recommendations on  which projects to fund, and for stakeholders to then review the results.  However, Coast Guard headquarters did not provide documented  guidance to the six CEUs responsible for administering regional DLM  planning boards\u2014a process intended to establish clear objectives or  priorities among outcomes to be achieved for approximately 70 percent of  the Coast Guard\u2019s DLM funds. Coast Guard headquarters officials told  us that they instead rely on each CEU to hold their respective regional  planning boards in accordance with locally established practices.  However, only 1 of the 6 CEUs has developed and implemented written  guidance for its DLM planning board process, and it is not clear how  these boards set objectives or priorities among outcomes to be  achieved.", "The Coast Guard provided some documentation detailing how regional  DLM planning board inputs and subsequent decisions were linked to  decision-making criteria for one regional DLM planning board meeting  hosted by one of its nine Districts. Table 7, among other things, shows  the limited extent of documentation to substantiate Coast Guard  decisions. However, the Coast Guard did not meet this leading practice  because it could not demonstrate, with documentation, how decisions  were linked to criteria for its PC&I planning board meetings, central DLM  planning board meetings, or any other regional DLM planning board  meeting. Without the full range of information on which planning board  decisions were made, neither we, nor the Coast Guard, could  substantiate the extent to which the Coast Guard followed its processes  or evaluate whether its processes for managing shore infrastructure  projects were sound.", "OMB guidance calls for agencies to use information to support decision- making, such as whether an asset is continuing to meet business needs  and contribute to goals, and whether there are smarter or more cost  effective ways to deliver the function. This guidance is comparable to  the leading practice discussed above, which calls for agencies to  establish clear maintenance and repair investment objectives and set  priorities among outcomes to be achieved. Additionally, according to  OMB, agencies are to have a plan for periodic, results-oriented  evaluations of program effectiveness, and agencies should discuss the  results of these evaluations when proposing reauthorizations.  Establishing guidance for planning boards to document project  prioritization decision-making, as well as the impact of trade-off decisions,  would allow agency decision makers, and Congress, to better understand  Coast Guard priorities and how shore infrastructure project priorities  might potentially affect other priorities. The Coast Guard was unable to  provide documentation showing how it prioritized projects for a number of  reasons, including that they didn\u2019t have written guidance, documentation  to verify the use of standardized meeting inputs such as presentations,  and meeting minutes. Furthermore, officials could not explain why certain  documentation was not maintained to demonstrate how the Coast Guard  had made and prioritized funding decisions. Such documentation may  allow the Coast Guard to show, for example, why repairing a station they  previously wanted to close is a higher priority than fixing a station they  appear to need to perform maintenance on certain assets (see fig. 3).", "To ensure that investment decisions are aligned with agency missions  and goals, agencies should employ models to predict the future condition  and performance of its facilities as a portfolio, according to leading  practices. Performance-prediction models predict the deterioration of  building components over time and are important because certain facility  components are particularly prone to deterioration or failure, thus  requiring more frequent maintenance or repairs. A 2015 review of the  Coast Guard\u2019s asset management framework identified the benefit of  analyzing tradeoffs between reactive and preventative maintenance and  described how preventative maintenance efforts could translate into cost  savings.", "Coast Guard officials provided one example of its efforts to model  outcomes, but it did not meet this leading practice because it has not  properly used the results of this model to optimize competing investments  for that asset line or any other asset line or provided documentary  evidence verifying that it properly applied it. In December 2017, a Coast  Guard Aviation Pavement Study employed a model that found that the  Coast Guard could more efficiently prioritize investment in aviation  pavement. It also identified strategies to achieve a long-term sustainable  pavement condition. A proposed fiscal year 2018 to 2020 Coast Guard  aviation pavement maintenance and recapitalization plan proposed using  the study results and recommended actions that it said could save the  Coast Guard $13.8 million by accelerating investment in aviation  pavement sooner rather than deferring such maintenance and  recapitalization. According to Coast Guard officials, the analytical  approach outlined in its 2017 study could be applied to all 13 of its shore  infrastructure asset lines. However, the Coast Guard has not properly  implemented a maintenance and recapitalization strategy based on the  results of its aviation pavement plan, nor has it applied the analytical  approach from this plan to other asset lines. Coast Guard officials told us  they have not fully acted on the aviation pavement plan nor developed  models for other asset lines. Specifically, a Coast Guard official described  actions the agency is taking as piecemeal; 1 of 5 PC&I projects identified  by their plan has been prioritized and funded. According to Coast Guard  officials, the other pavement projects continue to be a priority for the  asset line, but funding decisions have been deferred due to resource  constraints and other competing priorities. As a result of not properly  implementing its plan, it is unclear if the Coast Guard will achieve the cost  savings it projected. By not employing similar models across its asset  lines for predicting the outcome of investments, analyzing trade-offs, and  optimizing decisions among competing investments, the Coast Guard is  missing opportunities to potentially identify and achieve cost savings  across other asset lines."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Structure Budgets to Identify Funding Allotted (1) for Routine Maintenance and Repair and (2) to Address Any Backlog of Deferred Maintenance and Repair Deficiencies Because Insufficient Levels of Such Funding Can Cause Agencies\u2019 Backlogs to Increase", "paragraphs": ["According to leading practices, agencies should structure maintenance  and repair budgets to differentiate between funding allotted for routine  maintenance and repairs, and funding allotted to addressing maintenance  and repair backlogs, to help ensure that underfunding does not affect the  health and safety or reduce the productivity of employees, among other  things. We found that Coast Guard budget requests did not provide  Congress with accurate information about its funding needs. Specifically,  we found that the Coast Guard did not meet this leading practice as its  budget requests (1) have not clearly identified funding allotted for routine  shore infrastructure maintenance needs, and (2) have not generally  addressed deferred maintenance and repair deficiencies, resulting in  increases to its backlogs. In addition, the Coast Guard has not included  information in its Unfunded Priorities Lists and other related reports that  clearly articulated trade-offs, or aligned with its requirements-based  budget targets for shore infrastructure. Coast Guard officials were not  able tell us why they have not requested maintenance and repair funding  to adequately address their shore infrastructure backlog of deferred  maintenance and repair deficiencies.", "First, we found that Coast Guard budget requests did not clearly identify  funding allotted for routine shore infrastructure maintenance needs to  address backlogs. Specifically, we found that budget requests related to  shore infrastructure for fiscal years 2012 through 2019 did not provide  Congress with required and complete information, as previously noted,  necessary to inform decision-makers of the risks posed by untimely  investments in maintenance and repair backlogs. While major  maintenance and repair funding can be tracked within the Coast Guard\u2019s  budget, funding for routine recurring maintenance for shore infrastructure  is embedded in a budget account that is used for both maintenance and  operational expenses. As a result, the Coast Guard could not  disaggregate expenditures from this account or determine how much  funding goes towards routine maintenance.", "Second, we found that Coast Guard budget requests did not generally  identify funding to address any backlogs of deferred maintenance or  recapitalization, except for one fiscal year\u20142012\u2014when the Coast Guard  requested $93 million to recapitalize deteriorated/obsolete facilities and  address the highest priority Shore Facilities Requirements List backlog  items. The 2012 budget request also noted that the health and  maintenance of its shore facilities are foundational for the safe and  effective execution of Coast Guard missions. However, the Coast Guard  reported on some challenges to completing maintenance projects. For  example, Coast Guard officials we interviewed stated that the annual  Congressional Budget cycle has contributed to infrastructure  management challenges because they are prohibited from signing  contracts for maintenance projects during continuing resolutions. For  example, since the fiscal year 2018 budget was not passed until March  2018, they had to rush during the summer, their busiest time of year, to  establish contracts and work orders to ensure projects were funded  before the end of the fiscal year on September 30th.", "Third, we found that the Coast Guard\u2019s annual Unfunded Priorities Lists  and other reports, including their 5-Year CIP, did not clearly describe  trade-offs. In July 2018, we reported that by continuing to manage its  operational asset acquisitions through its annual budget process and 5- year CIP, the Coast Guard creates constant churn as program baselines  must continually realign with budget realities, instead of budgets being  formulated to support program baselines. Coast Guard officials said that  prioritization and trade-off decisions are made as part of the annual  budget cycle, and that the shore infrastructure projects on its Unfunded  Priorities List reflect the highest priorities for the department within the  given top level funding. However, the annual Unfunded Priorities List  does not clearly articulate prioritization decisions, including information  about trade-offs among competing project alternatives, as well as the  impacts on missions conducted from shore facilities in disrepair that had  not been prioritized in previous years. According to Coast Guard officials,  and as we previously reported, such information is not included in the 5- Year CIP or Unfunded Priorities List because it is not statutorily  required. These information shortcomings are consistent with previous  findings and recommendations that the DHS Office of Inspector General  has made.", "Finally, we found that Coast Guard budget requests have not been  aligned with its requirements-based budget targets for shore  infrastructure. For example, we found that Coast Guard budget requests  have not identified appropriations sufficient to meet its DLM maintenance  and repair targets, which call for annual expenditures equal to two  percent of plant replacement value. According to the Coast Guard,  meeting its target for DLM would require allocating about $260 to $392  million annually for these repairs. Coast Guard officials told us that they have made difficult decisions to postpone necessary facility maintenance  and construction projects in order to address other competing priorities  related to mission execution, such as maintaining, operating, and  recapitalizing its aging surface and air fleets. Between fiscal years 2012  and 2017, the Coast Guard reported that it expended an average of $208  million per year on DLM, and officials stated that the Coast Guard never  met its target during this time period. Similarly, Coast Guard budget  requests have not been in alignment with its PC&I targets for  recapitalization. For example, Coast Guard recapitalization targets show  a far greater need for funding than the allotments from the appropriations  it requested between fiscal years 2012 and 2019. Specifically, Coast  Guard targets for recapitalization of shore assets indicate that $290 to  $392 million in PC&I funding is needed annually. However, the Coast  Guard budget requests for fiscal years 2012 through 2018 have ranged  between about $5 million and about $99 million annually, as shown in  Table 8.", "Notwithstanding the mismatch between Coast Guard budget requests  and its requirements-based budget targets, allotments for Coast Guard  shore PC&I from its appropriations in fiscal years 2016 through 2018  exceeded the Coast Guard\u2019s requests. For example, in fiscal year 2016,  the Coast Guard\u2019s allotment of $130 million was almost three times the  nearly $47 million requested. In 2018, the almost $45 million allotted was  more than four times the $10 million requested. Explanatory materials on  the annual appropriations act for fiscal year 2018 indicated that the  appropriated funding above requested amounts was to be used for  modernization and recapitalization of facilities, and facility improvements,  among other things.

We also reviewed Coast Guard documentation and data on its shore  infrastructure inventory to describe the condition and costs of managing  these assets. To measure the size of the Coast Guard\u2019s total backlog, we  examined the Coast Guard\u2019s shore Acquisition, Construction, &  Improvements (AC&I)  backlog of projects the Coast Guard has  identified as necessary to fulfill its missions (i.e., its Shore Facilities  Requirements List) from fiscal years 2012 through 2018, as well as its  depot-level maintenance backlog as of March 2018. We also reviewed  planning and budget documents to determine how the backlog has  changed over time. To identify the appropriation targets the Coast Guard  identified as needed to address these backlogs, we reviewed guidance  and budget data for the three appropriations related to shore  infrastructure, reviewed planning and budget documents such as Coast  Guard\u2019s annual Unfunded Priorities List\u2014which are lists of projects the  Coast Guard would undertake if funding were available\u2014and the Coast  Guard\u2019s annual Congressional Budget Justifications for fiscal years 2012  through 2019, to demonstrate how the backlog has changed over time  relative to budgeted funds.

Specifically, we interviewed Coast Guard officials and  discussed the mechanisms they use to assess the quality of their data  and the extent to which Coast Guard employs quality control  mechanisms, such as automated edit checks. Additionally, in August  2018, the Coast Guard informed us that its data on its shore infrastructure  may not be complete if field inspectors did not identify problems at the  facilities they inspected. Coast Guard officials also told us in July 2018  that not all projects on the Coast Guard\u2019s PC&I backlog have cost  estimates. As a result, the amount of funding needed to address the  Coast Guard\u2019s backlog of shore infrastructure projects could be  understated because the Coast Guard has not identified all deficiencies  that exist at its facilities nor estimated the cost to fix all of the deficiencies  it knows about. Despite these limitations, we determined that the Coast  Guard\u2019s data are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of reporting on the  Coast Guard\u2019s overall portfolio of shore infrastructure assets and the  minimum amount of money the Coast Guard identified as needed to  complete deferred repair and PC&I projects.", "To identify leading practices for managing backlogs of deferred  maintenance projects, we reviewed our prior work and the literature on  deferred maintenance and repair as it pertains to federal real property  portfolios. In our prior work, we identified nine leading practices based on  studies conducted by the National Research Council (NRC) of the  National Academy of Sciences between 1998 and 2012. These  studies were (1) Stewardship of Federal Facilities: A Proactive Strategy  for Managing the Nation\u2019s Public Assets (1998); (2) Investments in  Federal Facilities: Asset Management Strategies for the 21st Century  (2004); (3) Predicting Outcomes from Investments in Maintenance and  Repair for Federal Facilities (2012).
