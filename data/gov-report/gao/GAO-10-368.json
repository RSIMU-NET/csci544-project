This focus on providing farmers with alternatives to growing opium poppy lasted through 2008. In 2009, the Administration shifted the focus of its agricultural strategy in Afghanistan from counternarcotics to counterinsurgency, noting that economic growth and new job creation were critical to U.S. efforts in Afghanistan because they provide alternatives to narcotics- and insurgent-related activities. USAID's Automated Directives System established planning, monitoring, and evaluation procedures that USAID was expected to follow in Afghanistan. USAID planning efforts prior to 2009 largely follow these procedures. However, since the end of 2008, USAID has operated without a required Mission performance management plan for Afghanistan. In addition, USAID did not approve all implementing partner monitoring plans for the eight USAID agricultural programs, which represented about 75 percent of all USAID agricultural awards since 2002. USAID also did not assure all indicators had targets. USAID undertook efforts to monitor agricultural programs, but due to security concerns could not consistently verify reported data. USAID did not consistently analyze and interpret or document program performance for these eight programs, active between 2007 and 2009, on which our review focused. In the absence of this analysis, USAID did not document decisions linking program performance to changes made to the duration or funding of programs. USAID conducted one evaluation covering three of the eight programs, but the extent to which or whether USAID used the evaluation to enhance current or future programs is unclear. We found that the eight agricultural programs we reviewed did not always establish or achieve their targets for each performance indicator. USAID requires implementing partners to submit information on indicators, targets, and results. We measured performance for the eight programs by comparing annual results against annual targets and determining the extent to which targets were met. Six of the eight programs did not meet their performance targets in the most recent year for which targets were reported. For the two programs that met all their targets, we found they failed to establish targets for several indicators and, thus, we could not fully assess performance for those indicators. We also found that the three longest-running programs in our review showed declines in performance from fiscal years 2006 to 2008. USAID faces several challenges to implementing its agricultural programs in Afghanistan, such as the security environment, and has taken steps to mitigate other challenges, such as working to improve Afghan government capacity. However, while USAID's lack of documentation and high staff turnover have hampered USAID's ability to maintain institutional knowledge, the agency has not taken steps to address this challenge."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the USAID Administrator take a number of steps to enhance performance planning, monitoring and evaluation, and knowledge transfer procedures.

The United States considers agricultural assistance a key  contribution to Afghanistan\u2019s reconstruction and stabilization. Moreover,  promoting sustainable development is a priority of the Afghanistan  National Development Strategy and other donor countries. Since 2002, the  U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has awarded about  $1.4 billion toward agricultural programs to increase agricultural  productivity, accelerate economic growth, and eliminate illicit drug  cultivation.

In Afghanistan, we also met with officials from the  United Nations and the governments of Afghanistan and the United  Kingdom to discuss agricultural-related efforts. We traveled to the  provinces of Badakhshan and Farah in 2009 to meet with U.S. and Afghan  officials, implementing partners, and aid recipients to discuss several U.S.- funded projects. We analyzed program budget data provided by USAID to  report on program funding, as well as changes in USAID\u2019s program  monitoring officials over time. We analyzed program data provided by  USAID and its implementing partners to track performance against targets  over time. We took steps to assess the reliability of the budget,  performance, and attack data and determined they were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report. We focused our analysis on the  eight USAID agricultural programs that were active between 2007 and 2009  and had total awards greater than $15 million. These programs represent  about 75 percent of all USAID agricultural awards since 2002. We did not  address agriculture-related projects carried out independently by other  U.S. government agencies, such the Department of Defense\u2019s Commander\u2019s  Emergency Response Program, or those carried out by multilateral  institutions to which the United States contributes, such as the United  Nations Development Programme.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2009 through July 2010  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The survey also found that agricultural activities provided the  Afghan population\u2019s primary livelihood; 55 percent of households were  engaged in farming and 68 percent had livestock. According to the World  Bank, the agricultural sector accounts for 30 percent of Afghanistan\u2019s gross  domestic product.

Over the 2-year period, the United States provided over 60 percent  of all international food assistance received by Afghanistan. According to  the World Food Program, the food assistance provided by the United States  and the international community helped avert famine in Afghanistan.", "As we previously reported, from 2002 through 2004, increased opium poppy  cultivation spread and drug trafficking grew as a threat to Afghanistan\u2019s  security and stability. During that time, the United States supported  Afghan- and United Kingdom-led counternarcotics efforts. These efforts  reportedly had little effect on the illicit narcotics industry because of  limited security and stability across Afghanistan. In response, the U.S.  government made counternarcotics a top U.S. priority and developed a  strategy in 2004 to reduce poppy cultivation, drug production, and  trafficking, shifting the emphasis of the United States\u2019 agricultural  assistance programs in Afghanistan from food security programs to  counternarcotics-related ADP. This part of the U.S. counternarcotics  strategy was intended to offer incentives to stop opium poppy production  by helping farmers and farm laborers obtain other ways to earn a living.  The strategy also called for strong disincentives such as forced eradication,  interdiction, and law enforcement, while at the same time spreading the  Afghan government\u2019s antinarcotics message. The United States\u2019 efforts also  were expected to build the Afghan government\u2019s capacity to conduct  counternarcotics efforts on its own. As part of its counternarcotics efforts,  beginning in 2005, USAID awarded most of its new agricultural funds to  alternative-development programs (ADP)\u2014to (1) increase agricultural  productivity, (2) accelerate economic growth, and (3) eliminate illicit drug  cultivation. As figure 3 shows, between 2005 and 2008, $494 million, or 71  percent of new awards were for ADP.", "During this time period, USAID funded ADP, as well as other large  agricultural programs. Figure 4 provides a brief description of the goals  and objectives of the eight programs included in this review including,  beginning in 2005, ADP-Northeast, ADP-South, and ADP-East; beginning in  2006, the Accelerating Sustainable Agriculture Program; beginning in 2008,  ADP-Southwest, the Afghanistan Water, Agriculture, and Technology  Transfer program, and the Afghanistan Vouchers for Increased Production  in Agriculture program; and beginning in 2009, the Incentives Driving  Economic Alternatives-North, East and West, as a follow-on program to  ADP-East. USAID identified six of the eight programs as ADP, excluding the  Accelerating Sustainable Agriculture Program and the Afghanistan  Vouchers for Increased Production in Agriculture. Appendix III specifies  the provinces where the eight agricultural programs included in our review  operated and gives examples of the range of projects that these programs  implemented.", "In 2009, under the direction of the President and the Special Representative  for Afghanistan and Pakistan, the United States shifted the focus of its  agricultural strategy in Afghanistan from counternarcotics to  counterinsurgency efforts. This shift de-emphasized eradication. According  to the Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, eradication  unduly punished and alienated farmers for making a \u201crational economic  decision,\u201d while ignoring the profits gleaned by traffickers and insurgents  from the sale of processed opium and heroin. Further, the Administration  noted that economic growth and new job creation were critical to U.S.  counterinsurgency efforts in Afghanistan because they provide licit  alternatives to narcotics- and insurgent-related activities and connect  people to their government. As a result, the Administration integrated  agricultural programs with other U.S. efforts, including military operations,  and directed more resources to the agricultural sector. For example, the  Afghanistan Vouchers for Increased Production in Agriculture program,  which originally operated outside of the southeastern portion of  Afghanistan, was expanded to Helmand and Kandahar in 2010, where  according to Department of Defense officials, the United States and  Afghanistan have begun military operations to break the momentum of the  insurgency. Furthermore, the Administration increased the involvement of  the U.S. Department of Agriculture and aligned U.S. efforts with the current  agricultural priorities of the Afghan government, as laid out in the Ministry  of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock\u2019s National Agriculture  Development Framework. The strategy focuses on the following four areas:  1. increasing agricultural productivity by increasing farmers\u2019 access to  quality inputs, such as improved seeds and fertilizer, and effective  extension services; 2. regenerating agribusiness by increasing linkages between farmers,  markets, credit, and trade corridors; 3. rehabilitating watersheds and improving irrigation structure; and 4. increasing the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock\u2019s  capacity to deliver services and promote the private sector and farmer  associations through direct budget and technical assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Gaps Exist in USAID\u2019s Efforts to Plan, Monitor, and Evaluate Agricultural Programs in Afghanistan", "paragraphs": ["USAID\u2019s Automated Directives System establishes performance  management and evaluation procedures that USAID expects its staff to  follow in planning, monitoring, and evaluating its agricultural assistance  programs in Afghanistan.

USAID expects the new PMP to be completed  by the end of fiscal year 2010. The Mission attributed the delay in creating  the new PMP to the process of developing new strategies in different  sectors and gaining approval from the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan and  from agency headquarters in Washington.", "Overall, the 2006-2008 Mission PMP incorporated key planning activities.  For example, the PMP identified indicators, established baselines and  targets, planned for data quality assessments, and described the frequency  of data collection for four high-level objectives for all USAID programs in  Afghanistan, including its agricultural programs. The eight agricultural  programs we reviewed all fell under one of these four high-level objectives  identified in the Mission PMP\u2014\u201cdeveloping a thriving licit economy led by  the private sector.\u201d In addition, the PMP described regular site visits,  random data checks, and data quality assessments as the means to be used  to verify and validate information collected. Furthermore, the Mission PMP  noted that the PMP was developed to enable staff to actively and  systematically assess their contributions to the Mission\u2019s program results  and take corrective action when necessary. It noted that indicators, when  analyzed in combination with other information, provide data for program  decision making. The Mission PMP did not include plans for evaluations  and special studies for the high-level objective that the eight programs  included in this review supported; but according to USAID, the agency has  planned evaluations for seven of the eight agricultural programs included  in this review during fiscal year 2010.

To keep its performance-management system cost-effective,  reduce its burden, and ensure implementing partner activities and USAID  plans are well-aligned, USAID requires its implementing partners to  integrate performance-data collection in their performance-management  activities and work plans. In fulfilling this requirement, the implementing  partners submitted monitoring and evaluation plans for the eight programs  included in our review to USAID for approval. The implementing partners\u2019  plans, among other things, generally contained goals and objectives,  indicators, and targets. However, we found that USAID had not always  approved these plans and did not require implementing partners to set  targets for each of their indicators, which are needed to assess program  performance.

The USAID officials we spoke with were uncertain as to why their  predecessors did not require this of the implementing partners. In addition,  several of the other programs, such as the Afghanistan Water, Agriculture,  and Technology Transfer and the Afghanistan Vouchers for Increased  Production in Agriculture programs did not establish targets for all of their  indicators.

From 2006 to 2008, the percentage of targets met declined for  indicators, such as the number full-time equivalent jobs; Afghans trained in  business skills; and hectares of improved irrigation as a result of  infrastructure works. Appendix V has details on the indicators, targets, and  results for the latest year where performance data was available for each of  the eight programs in our review. Based on our assessment, on average, the  percentage of targets met declined from 2006 to 2008 across these three  programs.", "The longest-running program in our review that is currently active, the  Accelerating Sustainable Agricultural Program, showed improvements in  fiscal year 2008, but declined in fiscal year 2009 in the number of targets  met. For example, the program met 0 percent of its targets in fiscal year  2007, 100 percent of its targets in fiscal year 2008, and 67 percent of its  targets in fiscal year 2009.", "As shown in figure 8, trends in targets met could not be determined for the  most recent programs\u2014Afghanistan Water, Agriculture, and Technology  Transfer, ADP-Southwest, Afghanistan Vouchers for Increased Production  in Agriculture, and Incentives Driving Economic Alternatives-North, East  and West\u2014because sufficient data was not available to establish trends. In  addition, as noted earlier, most of these programs failed to establish targets  for all of their indicators and, thus, we could not assess performance for all  indicators. For example, even though recent performance data show that  Afghanistan Water, Agriculture, and Technology Transfer and Afghanistan  Vouchers for Increased Production in Agriculture programs met all targets  for fiscal year 2009, both programs did not set targets for all indicators. In  fiscal year 2009, the Afghanistan Water, Agriculture, and Technology  Transfer program set targets for 3 out of 5 indicators, while Afghanistan  Vouchers for Increased Production in Agriculture set targets for 2 out of 10  indicators.

In November 2009,  we reported that while U.S. and international development projects in  Afghanistan had made some progress, deteriorating security complicated  such efforts to stabilize and rebuild the country. And as we reported in  May 2010, the lack of a secure environment has continued to challenge  reconstruction and development efforts. Specifically, USAID has cited the  security environment in Afghanistan as a severe impediment to its ability to  monitor projects. For example, USAID noted that solely traveling by road  to visit alternative development, food assistance, and environmental  projects in rural areas of northern and eastern Afghanistan is normally not  allowed due to security constraints, and must, consequently, be combined  with some air travel. However, air service in much of the north and east is  limited during the winter months, which has complicated oversight efforts.  Similarly, USAID officials are required to travel with armored vehicles and  armed escorts to visit projects in much of the country. Consequently, as  USAID officials stated, their ability to arrange project visits can become  restricted if military forces cannot provide the necessary vehicles or  escorts because of heightened fighting or other priorities. We experienced  similar restrictions to travel beyond the embassy compound when we  visited Afghanistan in July 2009. For example, we were initially scheduled  to visit agricultural sites in Jalalabad, but could not due to security threats.  Instead, implementing partners traveled to Kabul to meet with us.  According to USAID, limited monitoring has heightened the risk of fraud,  waste, and mismanagement of USAID resources.", "In addition to increasing challenges in overseeing programs, the security  environment has also challenged USAID\u2019s ability to implement programs,  increasing implementation times and costs for projects in nonsecure areas.  In particular, U.S. officials cited poor security as having caused delays,  disruptions, and even abandonment of certain reconstruction projects. For  example, according to implementing partner officials, in ADP-Southwest,  some 15 to 20 illegal security checkpoints run by the Taliban and criminals  near major trade centers have increased costs to and endangered the lives  of farmers they support.", "USAID predicated the success of its agricultural programs on a stable or  improving security environment. In preparing its 2005-2010 strategic plan,  USAID assumed that security conditions would remain stable enough to  continue reconstruction and development activities. Likewise, several  implementing partner documents included this assumption, and USAID  officials affirmed that this assumption remains true today. Furthermore,  the commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization-led International  Security Assistance Force and U.S. forces in Afghanistan testified in his  June 2009 confirmation hearing that improved security was a prerequisite  for the development of local governance and economic growth in  Afghanistan.

In 2009, USAID rated the capability of 14 of 19 Afghan ministries  and institutions it works with as 1 or 2 on a scale of 5, with 1 representing  the need for substantial assistance across all areas and 5 representing the  ability to perform without assistance. For example, the Ministry of  Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock was given a rating of 2\u2014needing  technical assistance to perform all but routine functions\u2014while the  Ministry for Rural Rehabilitation and Development was given a rating of  4\u2014needing little technical assistance. Although USAID has noted overall  improvement among the ministries and institutions in recent years, none  was given a rating of 5. USAID officials noted that a key Afghan official was  recently moved from the Ministry for Rural Rehabilitation and  Development to enhance the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and  Livestock\u2019s capacity. As a result, USAID officials also said that they have  recently begun to work more closely with Ministry of Agriculture,  Irrigation, and Livestock.", "According to the Afghanistan National Development Strategy, Afghanistan\u2019s  capacity problems are exacerbated by government corruption, a significant  and growing problem in the country. Transparency International\u2019s 2009  Corruption Perception Index ranked the country 179 out of 180. Similarly,  in April 2009, USAID published an independent report, Assessment of  Corruption in Afghanistan, that found that corruption, defined as \u201cthe  abuse of public position for private gain,\u201d is a significant and growing  problem across Afghanistan that undermines security, development, and  democracy-building objectives. According to USAID\u2019s assessment,  pervasive, entrenched, and systemic corruption is now at an  unprecedented scope in the country\u2019s history. The causes of corruption in  Afghan public administration, according to the Afghanistan National  Development Strategy, can be attributed to a lack of institutional capacity  in public administration, weak legislative and regulatory frameworks,  limited enforcement of laws and regulations, poor and nonmerit-based  qualifications of public officials, low salaries of public servants, and a  dysfunctional justice sector. Furthermore, the sudden influx of donor  money into a system already suffering from poorly regulated procurement  practices increases the risk of corruption and waste of resources. However,  the assessment also noted that Afghanistan has or is developing most of the  institutions needed to combat corruption, but these institutions, like the  rest of the government, are limited by a lack of capacity, rivalries, and poor  integration. The assessment also noted that the Afghan government\u2019s  apparent unwillingness to pursue and prosecute high-level corruption was  particularly problematic.", "USAID moved to address this lack of capacity and growing corruption by  including a capacity-building component in its more recent contracts. For  example, the Afghanistan Water, Agriculture, and Technology Transfer  program was designed to, among other things, improve the capabilities of  Afghan ministries and universities by partnering with them on research- based decision making and outreach projects, and to identify water and  land-use policies and institutional frameworks that encourage individuals  and local, provincial, and the national governments to increase sustainable  economic development. Likewise, the Assessment of Corruption in  Afghanistan report noted that \u201csubstantial USAID assistance  already  designed to strengthen transparency, accountability, and effectiveness\u2014 prime routes to combat corruption\u2014in the most critical functions of  national and subnational government.\u201d For example, the assessment points  to alternative-development and agricultural efforts to create incentives to  not grow poppy, but also notes that these efforts should be coordinated  with enforcement efforts supported by the Departments of Defense,  Justice, and State.", "The Administration has further emphasized capacity building by pursuing a  policy of Afghan-led development, or \u201cAfghanization,\u201d to ensure that  Afghans lead efforts to secure and develop their country. At the national  level, the United States plans to channel more of its assistance through the  Afghan government\u2019s core budget. At the field level, the U.S.-assistance  plan is to shift assistance to smaller, more flexible, and faster contract and  grant mechanisms to increase decentralized decision making in the field.  The new U.S. government agricultural strategy, linked to the U.S. effort to  counter insurgency, stresses the importance of increasing the Ministry of  Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock\u2019s capacity to deliver services and  promote the private sector and farmers\u2019 associations through direct budget  and technical assistance. However, USAID also recognized that, with the  move toward direct assistance to government ministries, USAID\u2019s  vulnerability to waste and corruption is anticipated to increase. According  to USAID officials, direct budget assistance to the Ministry of Agriculture,  Irrigation, and Livestock is dependent on the ability of the ministry to  demonstrate the capacity to handle the assistance. These officials noted  that an assessment of the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock\u2019s ability to manage direct funding was being completed.

For example, when we inquired about changes  in the results and performance data reported, USAID officials in  Afghanistan were not able to comment on the performance data or why  changes were made to the data and noted that they were either not present  when the changes took place or were too recently staffed to comment on  performance data reported.

In addition, the State Department Office of Inspector  General noted in its recent inspection of the entire embassy and its staff,  including USAID, that 1-year assignments coupled with multiple rest-and- recuperation breaks limited the development of expertise, contributed to a  lack of continuity, and required a higher number of officers to achieve  strategic goals.

In addition to relying  on implementing partners to execute its programs, a key part of the U.S.  oversight and accountability efforts involves a reliance on the collection  and analysis of implementing partner data. These implementing partners  are expected to and have reported routinely on the performance of USAID\u2019s  agricultural programs. However, USAID has not always approved  performance indicators established by its implementing partners, allowing  one program to operate for almost 5 years without approved performance  indicators. Additionally, USAID did not ensure that its implementing  partners had established targets for each performance indicator, and  USAID did not consistently analyze and interpret implementing partner  performance data, which is vital to making program adjustments, higher- level decisions, and resource allocation. Without a set of agreed-upon  indicators and targets, and analysis and interpretation of reported  performance data, it becomes more difficult to accurately assess the  performance of USAID agricultural programs. It is also unclear whether or  how USAID has used evaluations to further institutional learning, inform  current programs, and shape future planning. Best management practices  have demonstrated that routine evaluations enable program managers to  identify program vulnerabilities, implement lessons learned, help program  managers understand program weaknesses and make needed  improvements. Moreover, a lack of documentation of key programmatic  decisions and an insufficient method to transfer knowledge to successors  have contributed to the loss of institutional knowledge and the ability of  the U.S. government and others to build on lessons learned.

In addition, we  analyzed financial information on USAID\u2019s programs in Afghanistan and  reported on the financial status of its agricultural programs.", "To assess USAID\u2019s agricultural programs in Afghanistan, including changes  in focus, we met with officials from USAID, the Departments of  Agriculture, Defense, and State\u2014including the Special Representative for  Afghanistan and Pakistan\u2019s office\u2014and implementing partners in  Washington, D.C., and Kabul, Afghanistan. In Kabul, we also met with  officials from the United Nations, the governments of Afghanistan and the  United Kingdom, and a local research group to discuss agricultural efforts.  We traveled to the provinces of Badakhshan and Farah to meet with U.S.  and Afghan officials and discussed various U.S.\u2013funded projects. For  example, in Farah, we met with the local Afghan officials and beneficiaries  of U.S. assistance to discuss the progress of USAID\u2019s agricultural projects,  visited a project site, and met with U.S. contractors implementing the  projects. In Badakhshan, we also met with local officials and beneficiaries  to discuss USAID agricultural efforts and how U.S. assistance was being  used. In addition, we reviewed past GAO work and reports from other  agencies in the U.S. accountability community and nongovernmental  organizations on Afghanistan\u2019s current situation and the challenges it faces.  We reviewed U.S. government documents concerning the U.S. agricultural  strategy and efforts in Afghanistan, as well as USAID funding data.  Beginning in fiscal year 2005, USAID began financing agricultural projects  as part of the U.S. government\u2019s counternarcotics strategy. These were  initially referred to as alternative-livelihood programs, but were later called  alternative-development programs (ADP). To track this strategy over time,  we reported the share of annual obligated and disbursed funds for ADP and  for other agriculture activities. We focused our review on the eight USAID  agricultural programs that were active between 2007 and 2009 and had total  awards of more than $15 million; however, our analysis of financial  information included all USAID agricultural programs. None of the  agricultural programs included in GAO\u2019s review were Office of Transition  Initiatives (OTI) and the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA)  programs. We did not address agriculture-related projects carried out  independently by other U.S. government agencies, such the Department of  Defense\u2019s Commander\u2019s Emergency Response Program, or those carried  out by multilateral institutions to which the United States contributes, such  as the United Nations Development Programme or World Food Program.", "To assess USAID\u2019s performance management and evaluation efforts, we  reviewed the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 and  pertinent GAO evaluations of performance management practices to  identify best practices. In addition, we examined USAID\u2019s Automated  Directives System and USAID performance management and evaluation  documents to identify the agency\u2019s procedures, requirements, and  guidance. The Government Performance and Results Act and USAID\u2019s  Automated Directives System establish requirements or provide guidance  at a level higher than the program level; the former operates at the agency  level and the latter directs most of its performance management and  evaluations procedures to the bureau or mission level. Nevertheless,  effective planning for results at the agency, mission, and bureau level is a  function of effective planning for results at the program level. We view  results-oriented management tools, including the setting of indicators and  targets, as important at all levels of an agency, including the program level.  Consequently, we determined that the Government Performance and  Results Act criteria, which is operationalized for USAID through its  Automated Directives System, is applicable at this level as well. We  reviewed USAID and implementing partner planning, funding, and  reporting documents for their agricultural programs in Afghanistan, as well  as those addressing evaluations. Our review of these documents provided  us with information regarding the programs\u2019 performance management  structure, goals, objectives, indicators, and targets. We examined these and  other documents to determine the extent to which the Mission followed  requirements, guidance, and best practices.", "To assess the extent to which performance was achieved, we reviewed all  quarterly and annual reports, implementing partner PMPs, and annual work  plans for the eight agricultural programs under review. The data were  primarily compiled from implementing partner quarterly reports from April  2005 though September 2009. When data were not available, we used the  PMPs and other documents to fill in gaps. USAID could not provide all the  needed documents; we, therefore, requested missing documents from the  implementing partners. To determine the validity and reliability of the data  reported in the quarterly reports, we requested USAID\u2019s completed data  quality assessments. We received one USAID data quality assessment  completed for all agricultural programs from November 2008, and one  program data quality assessment completed by USAID monitoring officials,  also from November 2008. We also checked the data for inconsistencies  and questioned USAID officials and implementing partners about any  inconsistencies. We found the data in the quarterly reports to be  sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "The data collected were organized in a spreadsheet on a quarterly basis for  the eight programs. To track program performance over time, we collected  all reported quantitative data on indicators, targets, and results. For each  reported indicator, we measured performance achieved as the ratio of  results against established targets. We found that implementing partners  were inconsistent in reporting on targets, by either not setting targets, or in  two cases, retroactively setting or revising targets. In addition, two  programs shifted reporting time frames between fiscal and calendar years.  Some of the changes resulted from implementing partner audits or a USAID  Regional Inspector General audit of the data collected and reported to  USAID. Although USAID encourages and permits changes to targets over  the life of a program in response to new information, these factors  complicated attempts to determine performance. Furthermore, in some  cases, in addition to targets, the results were also updated retroactively. We  captured changes in target levels and reported results by inserting  additional lines in a spreadsheet. This process allowed us to determine  changes in targets, results, and performance achieved over time.", "In general, data reported in quarterly reports were presented cumulatively;  however, we found this presentation masked performance achieved in a  specific year. Therefore, once all cumulative data were entered into the  spreadsheet, we calculated the numbers to show annual targets, results,  and performance. The performance data collected were categorized into  eight categories: (1) met or exceeded target, (2) achieved 76 to 99 percent  of target set, (3) achieved 51 to 75 percent of target set, (4) achieved 26 to  50 percent of target set, (5) achieved 1 to 25 percent of target set, (6)  achieved zero progress toward target set, (7) number of indicators used to  assess performance, and (8) no target set. Based on the categorical  assessment, we were able to determine the number of indicators reported  annually and over the life of the program in each of the categories noted  above. We are reporting program performance achievements on the annual  percentage of indicators that met or exceeded the target. For example, if  there were 15 indicators and 9 indicators had met or exceeded the target,  than annual program performance was 60 percent (9/15). We decided this  measure of performance was appropriate because implementing partners  are allowed to adjust and revise target levels to better reflect available  information in the field. Further, we found that the percentage of indicators  meeting their targets could increase or decrease for a variety of reasons,  including changes in measures, the types of measures or the targets set, as  well as changes in actual underlying performance. A review of all those  factors was beyond the scope of this report.", "To examine the challenges faced by agricultural efforts in Afghanistan, we  reviewed U.S. strategy documents and USAID documents addressing the  status of and challenges faced by U.S. efforts in Afghanistan, including  security, Afghan capacity and corruption, and USAID staffing and  workspace concerns.

This report contains cumulative  financial information for individual projects that may be funded through a  contract, cooperative agreement, or grant. We received pipeline reports for  all USAID projects in Afghanistan as of the end of fiscal years 2004-2009  and March 31, 2010, and for selected agriculture projects, we received  quarterly pipeline reports from fiscal years 2005-2009. The March 31, 2010,  pipeline report contains financial information on USAID projects in  Afghanistan from fiscal year 2002 to March 31, 2010, for 254 projects of  which 41 were agriculture projects. We also checked the data for  inconsistencies and questioned USAID officials about any inconsistencies.  To describe the financial status of the USAID agriculture program, we used  three financing concepts: award, unliquidated obligation, and  disbursement. These are related to, but not exactly the same as budget  concepts. Award refers to the dollar amount of the award in a signed  contract, cooperative agreement, or grant. The signed document indicates  the period of time over which the project is expected to be implemented.  The amount of the award, the time frame, and other elements of the  contractual agreement may be changed through a formal amendment  process. Unliquidated obligations represent the current amount of  obligations remaining to be disbursed. Disbursements are those funds that  have been released from the U.S. Treasury. Cumulative obligations is the  total of unliquidated obligations plus disbursements.", "The e-supplement presents information on Afghanistan for select  indicators, including poverty rates by province and region, and the number  of households that produced crops during the summer and winter seasons  during 2007/2008.

GAO modified the report to reflect the new Automated Directives  System Guidance on Monitoring in High Threat Environments.  However, GAO would note that the Mission to Afghanistan that GAO  was directed to for all inquiries was not aware of the December 2009  guidance until June 2010. In addition our application of the Automated  Directives System criteria was consistent with the new guidance and  required only minor technical revisions.  2. None of the agricultural programs included in GAO\u2019s review were  Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) or Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster  Assistance (OFDA) programs. 3. USAID\u2019s Automated Directives System generally requires the same  procedures for a conflict zone that it requires elsewhere or else  documentation specifically describing when those procedures are not  followed. The new guidance does not provide any exemptions with  regard to approval of monitoring and evaluation plans and the  establishment of indicators and targets, which USAID did not  consistently approve. 4. Without approved indicator targets, it is unclear how performance can  be reviewed or assessed. 5. GAO acknowledges that USAID is currently developing a PMP on   page 14 of the report. 6. At the time of our review, USAID had completed a one midterm  evaluation covering three of the eight programs we reviewed. USAID  staff, however, were unable to indicate how the findings of the  evaluation were used to inform the design of subsequent programs.  Additionally, the midterm evaluation included recommendations for  improving the three programs, but USAID staff were unable to  comment on how the recommendations of the evaluation were  implemented. 7.
