Therefore, you asked us to (1) describe the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\u2019s (SAMHSA) efforts to estimate drug abuse treatment need on a national basis, including estimates of subpopulations, and possible limitations of these efforts and (2) obtain state estimates of drug abuse treatment need.", "To conduct our work, we interviewed and obtained documents from officials in SAMHSA\u2019s Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), the Office of Applied Studies (OAS), and the Office of the Administrator. We also held discussions with officials at the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors and the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and with experts in the substance abuse research community. In describing states\u2019 efforts to estimate need, we reviewed needs assessment information submitted by states as part of their 1997 Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment block grant applications; we also examined selected studies and reports provided to CSAT from 10 states under its State Treatment Needs Assessment Program (STNAP). In addition, we attended a CSAT-sponsored workshop that included all states with current STNAP contracts in which states reported on their needs assessment studies. We did not independently verify the accuracy of the information provided by CSAT nor did we evaluate the effectiveness of SAMHSA\u2019s efforts to estimate treatment need.

SAMHSA received more than half ($944 million) of HHS\u2019 drug treatment budget. Approximately 80 percent of SAMHSA\u2019s total budget, which includes funding for both drug prevention and treatment, is distributed to states through block grants and formula grant programs. SAMHSA also supports activities that include the administration of NHSDA and STNAP.", "Since 1972, NHSDA has provided national estimates of the prevalence of drug use in the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population aged 12 years and older. NHSDA, administered by OAS, is an ongoing survey of members of households in the United States on their use of illicit drugs, their nonmedical use of prescription drugs, and their use of alcohol and tobacco products. NHSDA is currently the nation\u2019s most comprehensive survey of drug use. It provides annual information on national trends in the use of substances and data that can be used to analyze patterns of substance use, the size and characteristics of substance use among various special populations, and the populations needing treatment.", "To determine the need for treatment, SAMHSA combines various measures of symptoms, problems, and patterns of use included in the NHSDA questionnaire. This information is intended to approximate clinical criteria for drug dependence and to supplement it with other data that indicate treatment need. SAMHSA calculates the number of persons in need of treatment as those who met at least one of the following criteria in the past year: dependence on any illicit drug; heavy drug use (that is, used heroin at least once, used marijuana daily, or frequent use of some other drug); injection drug use of heroin, cocaine, or stimulants; or received drug abuse treatment.", "States are also expected to develop estimates of treatment need on a statewide and local basis and report them to CSAT in their block grant applications and through STNAP. Under the 1992 Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration Reorganization Act (P.L. 102-321), states are required to use needs assessment data in developing and implementing the plans submitted as part of their block grant applications. Specifically, states are required to develop and report in their block grant applications estimates of treatment need by age, sex, and race or ethnicity for the state as a whole and for each substate planning area. Through STNAP, CSAT provides states with funding and technical assistance to conduct studies to determine the need and demand for substance abuse treatment in relation to the states\u2019 resource availability.", "The Government Performance and Results Act was enacted in 1993 in part to improve performance measurement by federal agencies. It requires agencies to set goals, measure performance, and report on their accomplishments. The legislation was enacted to increase program effectiveness and public accountability by having federal agencies focus on results and service quality. SAMHSA developed several performance goals as part of HHS\u2019 1999 Results Act performance plan. These goals include providing estimates of the prevalence of substance abuse in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia and increasing to 80 percent the proportion of block grant applications that include needs assessment data developed from STNAP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NHSDA Limitations Affect the Accuracy of National Estimates of Drug Abuse Treatment Need", "paragraphs": ["Although OAS relies primarily on NHSDA to make national estimates of drug abuse treatment need for the general population and certain subpopulations, the survey has limitations that can lead to underestimates of treatment need. These limitations include the survey\u2019s use of self-reported data; the exclusion of certain high-risk populations; and a sample for some subpopulations, such as pregnant women, that is too small to produce valid estimates. To improve the accuracy of its estimates, OAS adjusted the NHSDA data with data from other sources that are presumed to be more reliable. For example, with this adjustment, OAS estimates of treatment need in 1995 increased by nearly a third. This adjusted estimate, however, is still considered conservative and does not provide subpopulation estimates of treatment need. OAS plans to expand NHSDA (effective in 1999) to further improve the accuracy of drug use and treatment need estimates."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NHSDA Data Can Result in Underestimates of Treatment Need", "paragraphs": ["Several limitations of NHSDA can result in underestimates of treatment need for the general population and subpopulations, such as pregnant women. HHS and the Institute of Medicine have reported on a number of these limitations. For example, NHSDA data are based on self-reports, which rely on respondents\u2019 truth and memory. Although NHSDA procedures were designed to encourage honesty and improve recall, SAMHSA and others assume some degree of underreporting; however, SAMHSA has not adjusted NHSDA data to account for this limitation.", "NHSDA also excludes certain populations at high risk for drug use. NHSDA was initially designed as a survey to determine the rate of drug use within U.S. households and as such has excluded drug use by individuals in institutional settings, such as prisons and residential treatment centers, and by those with no permanent residence, including homeless and transient people. As a result, the survey does not include population groups known to have high rates of drug use who are often not in a household environment.", "In addition, NHSDA\u2019s sample size for some subpopulations is too small to produce valid estimates. For example, for the 1994-95 survey, OAS reported that the number of women who were pregnant at the time of the interview\u2014770\u2014and reported using illicit drugs\u201428\u2014was too small to make certain estimates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OAS\u2019 Adjusted NHSDA Data Provide a Higher Estimate of Treatment Need by Compensating for Some Undercounting", "paragraphs": ["To partially account for NHSDA\u2019s undercoverage of hard-to-reach populations and underreporting of drug use by survey respondents, OAS developed a methodology that substitutes data from sources presumed to be more reliable. Using this methodology, OAS estimated that in 1995, about 8.9 million people in the United States needed drug abuse treatment compared with the 6.9 million estimate\u2014including 2.6 million women\u2014derived solely from NHSDA. While this adjustment results in a treatment need estimate that is about 29 percent higher than the estimate based on only NHSDA data, it still results in conservative estimates of treatment need.", "In addition, while OAS\u2019 ratio adjustment was designed to improve the national estimate of treatment need for the general population, it does not estimate treatment need for women and other subpopulations. The ratio adjustment replaces some NHSDA data with information from Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) and the National Drug and Alcohol Treatment Unit Survey (NDATUS), now known as the Uniform Facility Data Set, to estimate treatment need. These data sources provide information on the number of persons arrested, treated for drugs, or both and are presumed to be more reliable. UCR, compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation from administrative records of police departments nationally, contains information on arrests and is adjusted for nonresponse and underreporting. NDATUS is a 1-day annual census of all specialty drug abuse and alcohol treatment units nationally. To obtain data on persons treated for drug abuse, approximately 11,800 specialty providers are surveyed on the number and type of patients treated and services received.", "This adjustment categorizes NHSDA responses into one of four arrest and treatment groups: arrested and treated, treated but not arrested, arrested but not treated, and not arrested and not treated. According to OAS, the NHSDA estimates appear to significantly underestimate the number in each of the first three categories; to compensate, numbers from UCR and NDATUS are substituted for NHSDA data. The methodology provides only a partial adjustment because any underreporting in the not arrested and not treated category is not affected by the adjustment. Also, the adjustment is still subject to NHSDA limitations. Therefore, according to OAS, the ratio-adjusted estimates represent improved, but conservative estimates of treatment need."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expanded NHSDA Expected to Produce More Accurate National and State Estimates of Treatment Need", "paragraphs": ["OAS is expanding NHSDA\u2019s sample from 18,000 to 70,000 respondents each year and modifying its methodology to obtain state-level data and better national and subpopulation prevalence estimates. The expanded NHSDA will capture larger samples of youth, racial and ethnic minorities, pregnant women, and hard core drug users, which are expected to result in more accurate subpopulation estimates. The expanded NHSDA is expected to produce comparable state estimates of need annually; however, the sample sizes are not large enough to produce annual substate estimates. According to SAMHSA officials, it will be possible to generate substate estimates by combining multiple years of NHSDA data. While the additional data are expected to result in more precise estimates, treatment need will likely still be underestimated due to the survey\u2019s continued exclusion of certain high-risk populations and reliance on self-reported data.", "A major component of the expansion is to allow for estimates for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. A regression model OAS developed in 1996 uses NHSDA sample data and local area indicators to estimate state-level drug prevalence and treatment need. However, because of sample size requirements, this methodology only generated estimates for 26 states and 25 metropolitan areas. (See the appendix for a description of this methodology and individual state and metropolitan area estimates.) The expanded sample uses a similar methodology but has been designed to produce direct estimates for the 8 most populous states with smaller samples drawn for the other 42 states and the District of Columbia. The smaller samples will support model-based estimates that use information from the national sample, local indicators derived from the Census Bureau and other sources, and state samples.", "The method for collecting information and the content of the NHSDA questionnaire will also be modified under the expansion. Specifically, NHSDA will employ computer-assisted interviewing in 1999, which is expected to minimize respondent errors and partially increase the reliability of self-reporting by building in greater privacy for the respondent. The content of the questionnaire will also be augmented to obtain income and insurance data, national mental health statistics, data on treatment and prevention, and information on crime and other deviant behaviors. The projected annual cost for the expansion is $34 million.", "According to SAMHSA officials, the expanded NHSDA will help them identify states with serious drug abuse problems and help target technical assistance and discretionary funds. SAMHSA expects the expanded NHSDA to improve its prevalence estimates of drug abuse in the 50 states and the District of Columbia\u2014one of the goals included in its 1999 performance plan. SAMHSA officials also said that the expanded NHSDA will provide data to monitor the performance of various federal and state agencies engaged in efforts to reduce the supply and demand of illicit drugs. For example, the expanded NHSDA is expected to allow for measurement of the national goal of reducing past month use of illicit drugs among 12- to 17-year-olds by 35 percent by the end of year 2002.", "Some experts question the additional cost associated with expanding NHSDA\u2019s sample size to provide state-level estimates. They state that less costly alternatives using modeling techniques that rely on currently available estimates, such as synthetic estimation, could achieve similar goals at a significantly reduced cost. However, SAMHSA officials believe that the approach used in the expanded NHSDA will result in more accurate estimates than those produced using a purely synthetic estimation methodology. They also pointed out that the methodology used for the expanded NHSDA has been tested and validated.

According to SAMHSA, this is due, in part, to states\u2019 lack of sufficient data and resources to complete the extensive amount of data required in block grant applications. While some states have reported complete information, our review showed that about 25 percent (14 states) did not report on the total population needing treatment and about a third (18 states) did not report information on the total population seeking treatment. In addition, a number of states did not provide information on subpopulations. For example, about 25 percent of states did not report information on women needing treatment, and almost 60 percent did not report information on children and adolescents aged 17 and under needing treatment. We also found inaccuracies in the data reported by states. For example, the number of males and females under age 11 reported needing treatment in one state was greater than the state\u2019s entire population.", "Our review of 1997 applications also revealed inconsistencies in states\u2019 reporting of needs assessments, both within a state and across states.

As of June 1998, 23 states and territories had been awarded new contracts, totaling approximately $24 million, to continue activities under a second round of contract awards.", "STNAP was designed to develop and maintain a data collection and analysis infrastructure to assist states in surveillance, planning, budgeting, and policy development. STNAP has three primary objectives: (1) assist states in better allocating treatment funds, (2) enhance and sustain states\u2019 in-house capabilities to assess need, and (3) improve states\u2019 reporting in block grant applications. The program has had limited success in meeting its objectives.", "According to some state officials, STNAP has been useful in helping states target resources and enhance service delivery. For example, New Jersey reported using prevalence estimates, developed from an STNAP contract, in its allocation formula for distributing alcohol treatment money to better reflect the distribution of need at the county level. Iowa reported using its results to allocate funds based on objective estimates of need, which helped them target outreach efforts that offer the most potential for success. Iowa officials also reported that they used STNAP data to redesign the state\u2019s approach for providing tailored outreach and treatment services for women. Data generated in New Mexico were reportedly used to initiate substance abuse recognition and counseling training in public health offices and create specialized counseling for health care providers to create smoking and alcohol cessation programs for pregnant women.", "However, states have been slow in developing in-house capacity to assess need\u2014one of STNAP\u2019s objectives. According to CSAT, most states have been unable to develop sufficient capacity due to inadequate state-level resources and expertise and, as a result, have relied on outside consulting firms, local universities, or both. CSAT officials characterize these relationships as mixed and said that effective contracts with consultants and universities is dependent on the quality of state oversight. While contracts with consultants and universities can limit the development of in-house expertise and result in a lack of continuity and a sustained data infrastructure, they have allowed some states to establish and maintain a knowledge base and network. For example, while Texas and South Carolina used universities for data collection, they used in-house staff expertise for analyses and reporting. To further assist states in developing their in-house capacity to assess need, CSAT contracted with the National Technical Center (NTC) at Harvard Medical School to provide technical assistance.", "According to CSAT officials, states\u2019 reporting of results developed under STNAP in block grant applications\u2014the third objective of the program\u2014has not yet been fully realized because most states have not completed their planned data collection and analyses.
