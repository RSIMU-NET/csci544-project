HHS has traditionally treated these children as  unaccompanied alien children (UAC)\u2014children who (1) have no lawful  immigration status in the United States, (2) have not attained 18 years of  age, and (3) have no parent or legal guardian in the United States or no  parent or legal guardian in the United States available to provide care and  physical custody.", "The Attorney General\u2019s April 2018 memorandum, also referred to as the  \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, directed Department of Justice (DOJ) prosecutors  to accept all referrals of all improper entry offenses from DHS for criminal  prosecution, to the extent practicable. According to DHS officials, in  implementing the April 2018 memo, DHS\u2019s U.S. Customs and Border  Protection (CBP) began referring a greater number of individuals  apprehended at the border to DOJ for criminal prosecution, including  parents who were apprehended with children. In these cases, referred  parents were placed into U.S. Marshals Service custody and separated  from their children because minors cannot remain with a parent who is  arrested on criminal charges and detained by U.S. Marshals Service. In  cases where parents were referred to DOJ for criminal proceedings and  separated from their children, DHS and HHS officials stated they treated  those children as UAC. In such cases, DHS transferred these children to  the custody of HHS\u2019s Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) and ORR  placed them in one of their shelter facilities, as is the standard procedure  for UAC.", "The President\u2019s executive order issued on June 20, 2018, directed,  among other things, that the Secretary of Homeland Security maintain  custody of alien families during any criminal improper entry or immigration  proceedings involving their family members, to the extent possible. This  order stated that the policy of the administration is to maintain family  unity, including by detaining alien families together where appropriate.

To assess the suitability of  potential sponsors, including parents, ORR care providers collect  information from potential sponsors to establish and identify their  relationship to the child. For example, the screening conducted of  potential sponsors includes various background checks and in June 2018,  ORR implemented increased background check requirements that were  outlined in an April 2018 memorandum of agreement with DHS. These  changes required ORR staff to collect fingerprints from all potential  sponsors, including parents, and all adults in the potential sponsor\u2019s  household and transmit the fingerprints to ICE to perform criminal and  immigration status checks on ORR\u2019s behalf.

In  addition, the ORR shelter and field staff we interviewed at four ORR  facilities in Arizona and Texas told us they started noticing an increase in  the number of children separated from their parents in late 2017 and early  2018, prior to the April 2018 memo. The DHS officials we interviewed  stated that, in some locations across the southwest border, there was an  increase in the number of aliens CBP referred to DOJ for prosecution of  immigration-related offenses after an Attorney General memo issued in  April 2017. This memo prioritized enforcement of a number of criminal  immigration-related offenses, including misdemeanor improper entry.

In  response, DHS officials stated that DHS did not have an official policy to  separate families, according to ORR officials. A few months prior to the  April 2018 memo, ORR officials said they saw a continued increase in  separated children in their care. ORR officials noted that they considered  planning for continued increases in separated children, but HHS  leadership advised ORR not to engage in such planning since DHS  officials told them that DHS did not have an official policy of separating  families.", "From July to November 2017, the Border Patrol sector in El Paso, Texas  conducted an initiative to address an increase in apprehensions of  families that sector officials had noted in early fiscal year 2017.   Specifically, Border Patrol officials in the sector reached an agreement  with the District of New Mexico U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office to refer more  individuals who had been apprehended, including parents who arrived  with minor children, for criminal prosecution. Prior to this initiative, the  U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in this district had placed limits on the number of  referrals it would accept from Border Patrol for prosecution of immigration  offenses.

For those parents placed  into criminal custody, Border Patrol referred their children to ORR\u2019s care  as UAC. According to a Border Patrol report on the initiative, the El Paso  sector processed approximately 1,800 individuals in families and 281  individuals in families were separated under this initiative.

Specifically, prior to April 2018, CBP\u2019s and ORR\u2019s data  systems did not include a designated field to indicate that a child was  unaccompanied as a result of being separated from his or her parent, and  ORR officials stated that such information was not always provided when  children were transferred from DHS to HHS custody. According to agency  officials, between April and August 2018, the agencies made changes to  their data systems to help notate in their records when children are  separated from parents.", "Regarding DHS, CBP\u2019s Border Patrol and OFO made changes to their  data systems to allow them to better indicate cases in which children  were separated from their parents; however, ORR officials told us in  September 2018, that they had been unaware that DHS had made these  systems changes.", "According to Border Patrol officials, Border Patrol modified its system  on April 19, 2018, to include yes/no check boxes to allow agents to  indicate that a child was separated from their parent(s). However,  Border Patrol officials told us that information on whether a child had  been separated is not automatically included in the referral form sent  to ORR. Rather, agents may indicate a separation in the referral notes  sent electronically to ORR, but they are not required to do so,  according to Border Patrol officials. While the changes to the system  may make it easier for Border Patrol to identify children separated  from their parents, ORR officials stated ORR may not receive  information through this mechanism to help it identify or track  separated children.

OFO officials have access to the UAC Portal but typically  email this information to ORR as part of the referral request.  According to OFO officials, prior to that time, OFO designated children  separated from their parents as unaccompanied.", "ORR updated the UAC Portal to include a check box for indicating that a  child was separated from his or her parents.

According to ORR  officials, prior to July 6, 2018, the UAC Portal did not have a systematic  way to indicate whether a child was designated as unaccompanied as a  result of being separated from a parent at the border. The updates allow  those Border Patrol agents with direct access to the UAC Portal to check  this box, and Border Patrol issued guidance on July 5, 2018, directing its  agents to use the new indicator for separated children in the UAC Portal  and provide the parent\u2019s alien number in the UAC Portal when making  referrals to ORR as of July 6, 2018. However, ORR officials also said  that DHS components with access to the UAC Portal are not yet utilizing  the new check box consistently.", "Staff at three of the four shelters we visited in Arizona and Texas in July  and August of 2018 said that in most, but not all cases during the spring  of 2018, DHS indicated in the custody transfer information that a child had  been separated. Staff at one shelter estimated that for approximately 5  percent of the separated children in its care there was no information from  DHS indicating parental separation. In these cases, shelter staff said they  learned about the separation from the child during the shelter\u2019s intake  assessment. Staff at the same shelter, which cares for children ages 0 to  4, noted that intake assessments for younger children are different from  intake for older children, as younger children are unable to provide  detailed information on such issues as parental separation.", "While the updates that OFO and ORR have made to their data systems  are a positive step, they do not fully address the broader coordination  issues we identified in our previous work. Specifically, we identified  weaknesses in DHS and HHS\u2019s process for the referral of UAC. In 2015,  we reported that the interagency process to refer and transfer UAC from  DHS to HHS was inefficient and vulnerable to errors because it relied on  emails and manual data entry, and documented standard procedures,  including defined roles and responsibilities, did not exist. To increase  the efficiency and improve the accuracy of the interagency UAC referral  and placement process, we recommended that the Secretaries of DHS  and HHS jointly develop and implement a documented interagency  process with clearly defined roles and responsibilities, as well as  procedures to disseminate placement decisions, for all agencies involved  in the referral and placement of UAC in HHS shelters. In response, DHS  officials told us DHS delivered a Joint Concept of Operations between  DHS and HHS to Congress on July 31, 2018, which provides field  guidance on interagency policies, procedures, and guidelines related to  the processing of UAC transferred from DHS to HHS. DHS submitted the  Joint Concept of Operations to us on September 26, 2018, in response to  our recommendation. We are reviewing the extent to which the Joint  Concept of Operations includes a documented interagency process with  clearly defined roles and responsibilities, as well as procedures to  disseminate placement decisions, for all agencies involved in the referral  and placement of unaccompanied children, including those separated  from parents at the border, in HHS shelters.

HHS officials told us that there were no specific procedures to reunite  children with parents from whom they were separated at the border prior  to the June 2018 court order. Rather, the agency used its standard  procedures, developed to comply with the William Wilberforce Trafficking  Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA), to consider  potential sponsors for unaccompanied children in their custody; if a parent  was available to become a sponsor, reunification with that parent was a  possible outcome.", "DHS and HHS Efforts to Identify Potential Class Members. To create  the list of potential class members (that is, those parents of a separated  child covered under the lawsuit) eligible for reunification per the June  2018 court order, DHS and HHS officials told us that they generated the  list based on children who were in DHS or HHS custody on that date. As  a result, DHS and HHS officials told us that a parent of a separated child  would only be a class member if his or her child was detained in DHS or  HHS custody on June 26, 2018. After developing the class list, DHS and  HHS officials told us that they next determined whether class members  were eligible for reunification, as a class member could be determined  ineligible for reunification if it was determined that the parent was unfit or  presented a danger to the child.", "Parents of children who were separated at the border but whose children  were released by ORR to sponsors prior to the June 2018 court order  were not considered class members, and according to HHS officials, the  department was not obligated to reunite them with the parent or parents  from whom they were separated. Further, HHS officials told us that they  do not know how many such children separated from parents at the  border were released to sponsors prior to the order and that the court  order does not require the department to know this information.", "Because there was no single database with information on family  separations, HHS officials reported using three methods to determine  which children in ORR\u2019s custody as of June 26, 2018, had been  separated from parents at the border:  1.  Data Reviewed by an Interagency Data Team. An interagency team  of data scientists and analysts\u2014led by HHS\u2019s Office of the Assistant  Secretary for Preparedness and Response with participation from  CBP, ICE, and ORR\u2014used data and information provided by DHS  and HHS to identify the locations of separated children and parents,  according to HHS officials.  2.

Review of Information Provided by Shelters. According to HHS  officials, shelter staff were asked to provide lists of children in their  care who were known to be separated from parents based on the  shelter\u2019s records.", "On the basis of its reviews, as of September 10, 2018, the government  had identified 2,654 children of potential class members in the Ms. L. v.  ICE case. Of the 2,654 children, 103 were age 0 to 4 and 2,551 were  age 5 to 17. As previously discussed, the number of children of potential  class members does not include those who were separated from parents  but released to sponsors prior to the June 2018 court order or the more than 500 children who were reunified with parents by CBP in late June  2018, because these children were never transferred to ORR custody.", "As of September 10, 2018, 2,217 of the 2,654 identified children had  been released from ORR custody, according to a joint status report filed  in the Ms. L. v. ICE case. About 90 percent of the released children  were reunited with the parent from whom they were separated and the  remaining children were released under other circumstances. Children  released under other circumstances could include those released to  another sponsor such as a parent already in the United States, another  relative, or an unrelated adult, or children who turned 18. Staff at one  ORR facility we visited told us they planned to release some children  under these circumstances. As of December 11, 2018, the government  had identified additional possible separated children of potential class  members for a total of 2,816. It had released 2,657 and 159 remained in  ORR custody. However, the government has also reported that 79 of  the children it initially identified as separated had not been separated from  a parent. Excluding those 79 children from the 2,816 total would bring  the total number of children separated to 2,737.", "Plan for Reunifying Children with Class Member Parents Within and  Outside ICE\u2019s Custody. The process used to reunify separated children  with their class member parents in the Ms. L. v. ICE case evolved over  time based on multiple court hearings and orders, according to HHS  officials. After the June 2018 court order, HHS officials said the agency  planned to reunify children using a process similar to their standard  procedures for placing unaccompanied children with sponsors. However,  according to agency officials, the agency realized that it would be difficult  to meet the court\u2019s reunification deadlines using its standard procedures  and began developing a process for court approval that would expedite  reunification for class members. As a result, from June 26, 2018 to July  10, 2018, the reunification process was refined and evolved iteratively  based on court status conferences, according to HHS officials. ORR field  and shelter staff we interviewed noted the impact of the continually  changing reunification process; for example, staff at one shelter told us  there were times when they would be following one process in the  morning but a different one in the afternoon.", "On July 10, 2018, the court approved reunification procedures for the  class members covered by the June 2018 court order. In the July 10,  2018 order that outlined these procedures, the court noted that the  standard procedures developed by ORR pursuant to the TVPRA were  meant to address \u201ca different situation, namely, what to do with alien  children who were apprehended without their parents at the border or  otherwise\u201d and that the agency\u2019s standard procedures were not meant to  apply to the situation presented in the Ms. L. v. ICE case, which involves  parents and children who were apprehended together and then separated  by government officials. The reunification procedures approved in the  Ms. L. v. ICE case apply only to reunification of class members with their  children and included determining (1) parentage and (2) whether the  parent is fit to take care of the child or presents any danger to the child.  Specifically:  1.  Determining Parentage. Before July 10, 2018, to determine  parentage for children ages 0 to 4, HHS officials said they initially  used DNA swab testing instead of requiring documentation, such as  birth certificates, stating that DNA swab testing was a prompt and  efficient method for determining biological parentage in a significant  number of cases. On July 10, 2018, the court approved the use of  DNA testing \u201conly when necessary to verify a legitimate, good-faith  concern about parentage or to meet a reunification deadline.\u201d HHS  officials told us that at that point, to determine parentage, ORR relied  on the determinations made by DHS when the family was separated  and information ORR shelter staff had already collected through  assessments of the children in their care. Unless there were specific  doubts about the relationship, ORR did not collect additional  information to confirm parentage, according to HHS officials.  2.  Determining Fitness and Danger. To reunify class members, HHS  also followed the procedures approved by the court on July 10, 2018  for determining whether a parent is fit and whether a parent presents  a danger to the child. HHS used the fingerprints and criminal  background check of the parent conducted by DHS when the  individual was first taken into DHS custody rather than requiring the  parent and other adults living in the household to submit fingerprints  to ORR, as potential sponsors were typically required to do for  unaccompanied children. According to HHS officials, ORR  personnel also reviewed each child\u2019s case file for any indication of a  safety concern, such as allegations of abuse by the child. HHS did not  require fingerprints of other adults living in the household where the  parent and child will live. HHS also did not require parents to complete  an ORR family reunification application as potential sponsors are  typically required to do for unaccompanied children.", "The specific procedures for physical reunification varied depending on  whether the parents were inside or outside of ICE custody. DHS and HHS  took steps to coordinate their efforts to reunify children with parents who  were in ICE custody, but experienced challenges. Generally, for parents  in ICE custody, DHS transported parents to a detention facility close to  their child and HHS transported the child to the same facility. At the  facility HHS transferred custody of the child to ICE for final reunification.  HHS officials said that in some instances children had to wait for parents  for unreasonably long amounts of time and parents were transported to  the wrong facilities. In one case, staff at one shelter told us that they had  to stay two nights in a hotel with the child before reunification could occur.", "According to HHS officials, for families in which the parent was released  into the interior of the United States, the reunification process involves  ORR officials and shelter staff attempting to establish contact with the  parent and determining whether the parent has \u201cred flags\u201d for parentage  or child safety. These determinations are based on DHS-provided  criminal background check summary information and case review of the  child\u2019s UAC Portal records. In cases where no red flags are found, HHS  transports the child to the parent or the parent picks the child up at the  ORR shelter.
