In 2017, we found that FDA allowed 99 percent of the  requests under its expanded access program to proceed. We also found  that the agency and other stakeholders had taken steps to simplify and  improve the expanded access process. For example, FDA shortened the  form required for individual patient requests, and it partnered with the  Reagan-Udall Foundation to develop a website\u2014referred to as the  Expanded Access Navigator\u2014to help physicians and patients locate drug  manufacturers\u2019 expanded access policies.", "The other pathway for obtaining investigational drugs outside of clinical  trials\u2014the federal RTT Act\u2014was established by law in May 2018.

A clinical trial can take  place in a variety of settings (e.g., research hospitals, universities, and  community clinics) and geographic locations, and is led by a principal  investigator that is typically a physician.", "Manufacturers establish clinical trial eligibility criteria to define the patient  population to be studied, and only patients who meet those criteria can  participate. These criteria can vary depending on the drug being studied  and its intended use. Patient eligibility criteria consist of both inclusion  and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria specify the characteristics of the  patient that are required for participation, such as the stage or  characteristics of a disease, and typically identify a patient population in  which it is expected that the manufacturer can demonstrate the effect of  an investigational drug. In comparison, exclusion criteria specify the  characteristics that disqualify patients from clinical trial participation and  can include factors that could mask the effect of an investigational drug,  such as the presence of comorbidities or simultaneous use of other  drugs. Certain patient populations, such as children and pregnant  women, may also be excluded from clinical trial participation because of  ethical reasons.", "Drug manufacturers, FDA, and IRBs each have responsibilities as part of  the clinical trial process. In order to test an investigational drug on human  volunteers in clinical trials, a manufacturer must first submit an  investigational new drug application (IND) to FDA. FDA is responsible for  reviewing the IND, which includes various components such as the  clinical trial protocol that describes the patient eligibility criteria, the  medications and dosages to be studied, and other details. In turn, an IRB  is responsible for reviewing and approving the clinical trial protocol as well  as reviewing the informed consent form for the study. In general, clinical  trials that involve human volunteers can begin after FDA has reviewed  and allowed the IND to proceed and the IRB has given its approval.", "An investigational drug typically goes through three phases of clinical  trials before an application is submitted to FDA for marketing approval.  At any point during the clinical trials, FDA could issue a clinical hold on  the existing IND that would delay the proposed clinical trials or suspend  the ongoing clinical trials. When a proposed or ongoing study is placed on  a complete clinical hold, the investigational drug cannot be administered  to any human volunteers. Traditionally, the three clinical trial phases are  the following:", "Phase I: This clinical trial phase generally tests the safety of the drug  on about 20 to 80 healthy volunteers. The goal of this phase is to  determine the drug\u2019s most frequent side effects and how it is  metabolized and excreted.

The treating physician is responsible for  requesting access to the investigational drug for the patient and for  obtaining written informed consent from or on behalf of the patient if the  manufacturer agrees to provide access. Eligibility of an investigational  drug for patient use through this pathway is based on certain criteria,  including that the drug has completed phase I clinical trials, the  manufacturer has not discontinued clinical development of the drug, and  the drug has not been placed on a clinical hold.

In April 2018,  FDA held a public workshop with stakeholders\u2014including drug  manufacturers, patient advocacy groups, and government agencies\u2014to  discuss ways drug manufacturers and other investigators could safely  broaden eligibility criteria for clinical trials and to inform FDA guidance on  this topic. In July 2018 FDA publicly released a report summarizing the  workshop, in accordance with FDARA. According to the report,  stakeholders at the meeting emphasized the importance of broadening  clinical trial eligibility, when appropriate, to include more patients who will  likely use the drug if it is approved. Stakeholders recommended that  investigators ensure that the eligibility criteria for each of their clinical  trials are scientifically justifiable, rather than, for example, \u201ccopying and  pasting\u201d a narrow set of criteria from a prior study without considering if  the exclusions are valid for scientific reasons. According to the report, this  practice can unnecessarily limit eligibility for certain patients. While  stakeholders commented that assessing whether eligibility criteria are  scientifically justifiable may require additional time and resources, they  emphasized it could lead to the removal of unnecessarily restrictive  eligibility criteria and thereby increase participation among patient  populations that have been typically excluded from clinical trials, such as  pediatric patients and patients with compromised liver and kidney  function.", "FDA guidance on eligibility criteria. In March 2019, FDA issued four  new draft guidance documents and finalized one guidance document with  recommendations for drug manufacturers to broaden clinical trial eligibility  criteria for drugs that treat cancer. The guidance recommends that  manufacturers include certain patient populations that have typically been  excluded from participation. The patient populations are adolescents;  pediatrics (children and adolescents); patients with human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus  (HCV) infections; patients with brain metastases (i.e., cancer that has  spread to the brain); and patients with compromised kidney, heart, or liver  function, or who have a history of (or concurrent) cancer. According to  FDA, the guidance documents are intended to help drug manufacturers  and other investigators broaden cancer trial eligibility criteria. This will  help improve patient access to investigational drugs and ensure that the  results from the clinical trials are generalizable to patients likely to use the  drugs once they are approved. In addition, FDA officials have noted that  including broader patient populations in clinical trials can lead to new  information in a drug\u2019s labeling, which will help communicate the safe and  effective use of these drugs. Table 1 provides a summary of each of the  five guidance documents.", "In June 2019, FDA issued draft guidance for manufacturers on  broadening clinical trial eligibility criteria, in accordance with FDARA.  The guidance applies to a wider range of clinical trials beyond cancer  trials and includes recommendations to broaden eligibility criteria and  considerations for the use of clinical trial designs and other  methodologies to help facilitate patient participation. For example, FDA  recommends that manufacturers examine each exclusion criterion to  determine if it is needed to help assure the safety of trial participants or to  achieve the study\u2019s objectives. If not, the manufacturer should consider  eliminating or modifying the criterion to expand the study population as  well as tailoring the exclusion criteria as narrowly as possible to avoid  unnecessary restrictions to the study population.", "Two manufacturers\u2019 efforts to broaden eligibility criteria. Officials  from one of the 10 drug manufacturers we interviewed told us they  broadened their clinical trial eligibility criteria and another manufacturer  we interviewed reported that it was taking steps to do so. These two  manufacturers told us they were taking these steps in part because both  believe it will facilitate the drug approval process. Officials from one  manufacturer stated that they broadened their eligibility criteria by  removing exclusions after determining they were not critical to clinical trial  designs, including exclusions related to liver function, infections (e.g.,  HIV), and the use of other medications (e.g., steroids). The officials  explained that, since 2015, they have systematically evaluated their  eligibility criteria to ensure that they do not unnecessarily exclude patient  populations from their clinical trials. Officials from the second  manufacturer told us they have begun evaluating whether to remove  certain exclusion criteria that they typically use in clinical trials, and added  that their efforts are partially in response to FDA\u2019s 2018 public workshop  report, as described above. For example, the manufacturer is reviewing  its exclusion of adolescents in prior clinical trials and officials told us they  will likely include adolescents in an upcoming study if they determine that  patient safety would not be compromised.", "Officials from both manufacturers stated that broader eligibility criteria will  allow more patients to access investigational drugs through clinical trial  participation. It can also, officials said, help them obtain FDA approval for  a drug that extends to a wider range of patients, if the drug is found to be  safe and effective. Further, officials from one of the two manufacturers  noted that broader eligibility criteria, such as criteria that include patients  with infections, could help streamline the process for conducting clinical  trials\u2014for example, by eliminating the need to conduct clinical testing to  screen for the presence of infections.", "Although most drug manufacturers in our review did not report efforts to  broaden their eligibility criteria, many noted efforts to address other  barriers to clinical trial participation. For example, to address geographic  barriers, officials from six of the 10 manufacturers told us they help cover  costs for patients to travel to clinical trial sites, such as by reimbursing  transportation and hotel costs for patients who travel long distances. In  addition, officials from one manufacturer said they completed a pilot  clinical trial on diabetes in 2019 that used decentralized trial locations in  three states, such as retail health clinics and patients\u2019 homes, to help  patients overcome challenges with obtaining transportation to trial sites.  Similarly, within the next 2 years, another manufacturer is planning to  conduct a pilot clinical trial that is fully remote and expects the design to  improve patient participation in rural communities.", "To address the lack of information about upcoming and ongoing clinical  trials that is available to and tailored to patients, two manufacturers  launched clinical trial registries in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Officials  from one of the manufacturers stated they designed their registry to  bridge the gap between the information that patients want about clinical  trials (e.g., information targeted to medical conditions that uses basic  terminology), and what is available in ClinicalTrials.gov, a federal  database that includes information on privately and publicly funded  clinical trial studies. Officials explained that ClinicalTrials.gov is, in  general, more targeted to physicians.", "In addition, to address barriers associated with the mistrust of research  stemming from historical events among African-Americans and other  communities, one manufacturer has several ongoing efforts to increase  the participation of racially and ethnically diverse populations in its clinical  trials. For example, the manufacturer conducts workshops to train  minority investigators who conduct clinical trials and requires certain  clinical trial sites to be located in areas with minority patient populations of  more than 25 percent.", "Challenges with broadening eligibility criteria. Officials from four of  the 10 drug manufacturers we interviewed\u2014including the two taking steps  to broaden their clinical trial eligibility criteria\u2014told us broadening  eligibility criteria is challenging. They stated that broader criteria must be  carefully balanced with the need to collect evidence from a well-defined  population. Officials from one manufacturer explained that removing  standard exclusion criteria, such as excluding patients who use other  medications, could interfere with the success of their clinical trial if those  medications make it difficult to identify the effects of the studied drug.

According to  FDA officials, the updated process will help reduce the potential burden  for physicians, who are responsible for obtaining IRB approval, while still  protecting patients.", "In addition, to further simplify its expanded access process for individual  patient requests, in June 2019 FDA launched a pilot program called  Project Facilitate for oncologists and other health care professionals that  treat patients with cancer. According to FDA officials, the pilot program  is focused on oncology because the agency receives a large number of  individual expanded access requests from oncologists. Under the pilot  program, FDA established a new call center that provides a single point of  contact where FDA staff are available to answer questions, assist in filling  out appropriate paperwork, and facilitate the overall process for  requesting and obtaining access to investigational drugs. For example,  FDA officials told us that FDA staff may assist oncologists in locating an  IRB, if needed. As part of the pilot program, FDA will follow up on  individual requests and gather data, such as how many patients received  investigational drugs, and if not, why the requests were denied by  manufacturers.

In response, we recommended  that FDA clearly communicate how the agency will use adverse event  data from expanded access use when reviewing drugs and biologics for  approval.", "FDA\u2019s updated guidance states that FDA is not aware of instances in  which adverse event information prevented the agency from approving a  drug, and that it is very rare for FDA to place a clinical hold on an  investigational drug due to adverse events observed during expanded  access treatment. The guidance also explains that several factors make  it difficult for FDA to link an adverse event to the expanded use of a drug  being considered for approval. For example, the guidance acknowledges  that the use of investigational drugs though the expanded access  program generally occurs outside of a controlled clinical trial setting and  patients receiving such drugs may be sicker than patients participating in  a clinical trial, making it more difficult to determine whether the use of the  investigational drug has led to the adverse event.", "In responding to questions about increased FDA communication about  the expanded access program, 19 of the stakeholders we interviewed  were familiar with FDA\u2019s updated expanded access web pages, and of  those, 16 told us they were an improvement.

Officials from two of the 10 manufacturers told us  they believe that FDA\u2019s potential use of adverse event data from  expanded access use, but not efficacy data, would be unfair. Officials  from one of these two manufacturers cited FDA\u2019s updated guidance on  adverse events as contributing to their view, referring to FDA\u2019s statement  that it is unlikely that FDA\u2019s program would yield data that is useful to  FDA in considering an investigational drug\u2019s effectiveness.", "However, FDA officials told us that efficacy and safety data from the  expanded access program have been used to support drug approvals in  several instances. For example, in January 2018 FDA approved the drug  Lutathera to treat rare tumors in the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract  using efficacy and safety data the manufacturer submitted to FDA from a  subset of the roughly 1,200 patients who received the drug through the  expanded access program. Officials from four of the 10 manufacturers  expressed interest in discussing further with FDA how the agency would  evaluate efficacy and safety data from the expanded access program and  use these data to help support a drug\u2019s approval and other regulatory  decisions.", "FDA\u2019s communication about the federal RTT Act. In November 2018,  FDA launched a new federal RTT web page that outlines both the  eligibility requirements for patients interested in seeking access to  investigational drugs and the criteria that must be met for an  investigational drug to be eligible for use through this pathway. For  example, the web page states that patients must be diagnosed with a life- threatening disease or condition to be eligible to access investigational  drugs under the federal RTT pathway. Further, the agency plans to issue  proposed regulations in September 2019 to implement the federal RTT  Act requirement for manufacturers to submit an annual summary to FDA  on any use of their investigational drugs under this pathway. The  regulations will include a due date for manufacturers to submit the annual  summaries as well as information on what they are to contain, according  to FDA.", "Fourteen of the stakeholders we interviewed were familiar with FDA\u2019s  new web page on the federal RTT Act, and among those, eight stated  that it communicated useful and balanced information for physicians and  patients. Officials from the remaining six stakeholders told us they did  not find it helpful for physicians or patients. For example, officials from  two stakeholders (including one drug manufacturer) commented at the  time of our review that the web page could be misleading to some  patients if they interpret the federal RTT Act to mean that manufacturers must provide access to their investigational drugs. Both added that FDA  should more clearly communicate on the web page that there is no such  requirement. In addition, officials from another stakeholder stated at the  time of our review that FDA should explain on the web page the agency\u2019s  role in implementing the federal RTT Act. In May 2019 FDA clarified on its  web page that the federal RTT Act does not require manufacturers to  provide patients access to their investigational drugs and that FDA\u2019s role  includes posting a consolidated annual summary report on the use of  investigational drugs through the federal RTT pathway."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Most Selected Manufacturers Communicated Whether They Consider Requests for Access to Investigational Drugs Outside of Clinical Trials and Conditions for Approval", "paragraphs": ["Most of the 29 drug manufacturers in our review used their websites to  communicate to patients and physicians whether they would consider  individual requests for access to their investigational drugs outside of  clinical trials.

These factors included the following:", "Ten stated that the supply of their investigational drugs was a  consideration. That is, a manufacturer must have a sufficient  supply of the investigational drug to support the drug\u2019s clinical  development before granting access to patients outside of clinical  trials.", "Five referred to specific drugs to which they would consider  granting access when describing the conditions under which they  would consider reviewing requests. For example, one  manufacturer stated that it would consider requests to access  three of its investigational drugs (intended to treat bladder cancer,  influenza, and HIV).", "One manufacturer communicated that after its initial review of  individual requests, it uses an external advisory committee to further  evaluate certain requests and ensure they are evaluated in an ethical  and fair manner. The committee, which includes bioethical experts,  physicians and patient representatives, makes recommendations to  the manufacturer about providing access to individual patients.", "Many of the 19 manufacturers that communicated they were willing to  consider individual requests for access stated that after they have  approved a request they also required external entities to review the  request. These included the following:", "Thirteen stated they require the relevant regulatory authority to  review requests. Of these, six specified that they require FDA to  review requests for access in the United States. One of these six  explained that it required a review by FDA to ensure all available  safety data for the investigational drug were considered, and  added that FDA is uniquely aware of such safety data.", "Five stated they require the review of a research ethics committee  or an IRB.", "Information communicated by manufacturers that do not consider  requests. Among the four manufacturers that communicated on their  websites they were not considering requests for access to investigational  drugs outside of clinical trials at the time of our review, two provided  reasons for their decision. Both cited safety concerns; for example, one  explained that it wanted to ensure its investigational drugs were  administered to patients only through clinical trials where safety could be  closely monitored.
