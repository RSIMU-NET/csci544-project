The reserve can store up to 727 million barrels of crude oil, and currently contains enough oil to offset 59 days of U.S. oil imports. GAO answered the following questions: (1) What factors do experts recommend be considered when filling and using the SPR? (2) To what extent can the SPR protect the U.S. economy from damage during oil supply disruptions? (3) Under what circumstances would an SPR larger than its current size be warranted? As part of this study, GAO developed oil supply disruption scenarios, used models to estimate potential economic harm, and convened 13 experts in conjunction with the National Academy of Sciences."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The group of experts recommended a number of factors to be considered when filling and using the SPR. They generally agreed that filling the reserve by acquiring a steady dollar value of oil over time, rather than a steady volume of oil over time as has occurred in recent years, would ensure that more oil will be acquired when prices are low and less when prices are high. Experts also suggested allowing oil producers to defer delivery of oil to the reserve at times when supply and demand are in tight balance, with oil producers providing additional oil to the SPR to pay for the delay. Regarding use of the SPR, experts described several factors to consider when making future use decisions, including using the reserve without delay when it is needed to minimize economic damage. During oil supply disruptions, releasing oil from the SPR could greatly reduce damage to the U.S. economy, based on our analyses and expert opinions. Particularly when used in conjunction with reserves in other countries, the SPR can replace the oil lost in all but the most catastrophic oil disruption scenarios we considered, lasting from 3 months to 2 years. DOE uses one model to estimate the optimal size of the SPR and another to estimate the economic effects of oil supply disruptions. Both models predict positive effects from using the SPR, but the magnitude of such benefits differ. The substantial differences between the results of these two models could lead DOE to provide inconsistent advice about expanding and using the reserve. Furthermore, factors beyond the SPR's ability to replace oil affect the extent to which the SPR can protect the U.S. economy from damage. For example, SPR crude is not compatible with all U.S. refineries. During a disruption of heavy sour crude oil, refineries configured to use this type of oil would have to reduce production of some petroleum products when refining the lighter oil in the SPR, decreasing the reserve's effectiveness at preventing economic damage. If demand for oil increases as expected, a larger SPR would be necessary to maintain the existing level of protection for the U.S. economy. The Energy Information Administration recently projected increases in U.S. demand for petroleum of approximately 12 percent by 2015 and 24 percent by 2025, compared with the 2005 level. In this regard, a 2005 study prepared for DOE found that the benefits of expanding the reserve to 1.5 billion barrels exceed the costs over a range of future conditions. However, many factors that influence the SPR's ideal size are likely to change over time. For example, although projections show increasing oil demand, the level of demand depends on many factors, including rates of economic growth, the price of oil, policy choices related to alternatives to oil, and technology changes. Consequently, periodic reassessments of the SPR's size in light of new information could be helpful as part of the nation's energy security planning."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Oil is the world\u2019s most important energy resource. The world consumes  approximately 83 million barrels of oil per day, accounting for nearly   40 percent of world energy consumption. In 2004, the most recent year for  which data are available, 40 percent of the energy used in the United States  and 96 percent of the energy used in the U.S. transportation sector were  derived from oil, the majority of which was imported. In 2004, the United  States imported 65 percent of its crude oil supply, or approximately 10  million barrels per day. Supply and demand for oil are in tight balance  today, with only about 1 million barrels per day of spare oil production  capacity, meaning that even small disruptions in supply can cause large  increases in prices. Unusually high prices for petroleum products due to a  strike at Venezuela\u2019s national oil company in 2002 to 2003 and Hurricanes  Katrina and Rita in 2005 demonstrated this effect.", "Because of the central role that oil plays in the U.S. economy, sudden  increases in its price can cause economic damage. Increases in crude oil  price are reflected in the prices of products made from crude oil, such as  gasoline, diesel, home heating oil, and petrochemicals such as fertilizer.  Furthermore, because petroleum products are an important part of the  production of many goods and services, the prices of these goods and  services also increase. These price increases can reduce the total amount  of goods and services that consumers can afford, thus reducing economic  activity. Past studies have shown that oil price shocks can cause hundreds  of billions of dollars of damage to the U.S. economy.", "To help protect the U.S. economy from damage caused by oil supply  disruptions, Congress authorized the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in  1975, following the Arab oil embargo of 1973 to 1974. The SPR is owned by  the federal government and operated by the Department of Energy (DOE).", "It can store up to 727 million barrels of crude oil in salt caverns located at  sites in Texas and Louisiana. Since 1976, the United States has spent about  $45.2 billion in 2005 dollars to build, maintain, fill, and manage the SPR. In  addition, the United States and 25 other nations that are members of the  International Energy Agency have agreed to maintain reserves of oil or  petroleum products equaling 90 days of net imports and to release these  reserves and reduce demand during oil supply disruptions. In June 2006,  the SPR contained about 689 million barrels, equal to 59 days of U.S. oil  imports. In addition to government reserves, private industry inventory  varies over time, but DOE estimates that private inventory contains an  amount equal to an additional 59 days of U.S. oil imports. Thus, at the  current level of oil demand, the SPR combined with private industry  holdings contains enough oil to exceed the United States\u2019 90-day reserve  requirement.", "Under conditions prescribed by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as  amended, the President and the Secretary of Energy have discretion to  authorize release of the oil in the SPR to minimize significant supply  disruptions. In the event of an oil supply disruption, the SPR can provide  supply to the market\u2014by selling stored crude oil or trading this oil in  exchange for a larger amount of oil to be returned later. When oil is  released from the SPR, it flows through commercial pipelines or on  waterborne vessels to refineries, where it is converted into gasoline and  other petroleum products, then transported to distribution centers for sale  to the public.", "Refineries are configured to refine specific types of crude oil. Crude oil is  generally classified according to two parameters: density and sulfur  content. Less dense crudes are known as \u201clight,\u201d while denser crudes are  known as \u201cheavy.\u201d Crudes with relatively low sulfur content are known as \u201csweet,\u201d while crudes with higher sulfur content are known as \u201csour.\u201d In  general, heavier and more sour crudes require more complex and  expensive refineries to process the oil into usable products, but are less  expensive to purchase than light sweet crudes. Many refiners in the United  States have upgraded their facilities in recent years to process heavy sour  crude. The SPR contains about 40 percent sweet crude and 60 percent sour  crude, stored in separate caverns. Both crude types in the SPR are  considered \u201clight.\u201d", "Oil markets have changed substantially in the 31 years since the  establishment of the SPR. At the time of the Arab oil embargo, price  controls in the United States prevented the prices of oil and petroleum  products from increasing as much as they otherwise might have,  contributing to a physical oil shortage that caused long lines at gasoline  stations throughout the United States. Now that the oil market is global, the  price of oil is determined in the world market primarily on the basis of  supply and demand. In the absence of price controls, scarcity is generally  expressed in the form of higher prices, as purchasers are free to bid as high  as they want to secure oil supply. In a global market, an oil supply  disruption anywhere in the world raises prices everywhere. Releasing oil  reserves during a disruption provides a global benefit by reducing oil prices  in the world market.", "Use of the SPR during an oil supply disruption mitigates damage to the  economy by replacing the oil lost, thereby reducing the price spike and the  resulting economic damage. Such damage is typically reflected in a  temporary reduction in gross domestic product (GDP), the total market  value of all goods and services produced in the U.S. economy in a given  year, compared with what it would have been without the disruption. The  reduction in GDP caused by an oil supply disruption and the resulting price  increases depends on several factors, including the size and duration of the  disruption; the availability of oil market \u201ccushions,\u201d such as excess oil  production capacity and private inventories; and the importance of oil to  economic activities. Severe oil supply disruptions in the past, such as the  Arab oil embargo, caused sudden spikes in oil prices accompanied by  economic losses of billions of dollars in the United States and other major  oil-consuming economies. More recent disruptions, such as the Venezuelan  strike in 2002 to 2003, have involved smaller quantities of oil for shorter  durations and caused less economic damage. Two offices within DOE\u2014the  Office of Petroleum Reserves and the Energy Information Administration  (EIA)\u2014use models to analyze the effects of oil supply disruptions and SPR  use on the economy. The Office of Petroleum Reserves is in charge of the  day-to-day operations of the SPR, and it uses a model to calculate the  effects of oil supply disruptions and SPR use as part of a study of the net  benefits of expanding the reserve. EIA is a statistical agency that uses a  separate model to estimate the impact of oil supply disruptions and to  advise officials about their potential consequences.", "From 1977 to 1992, Congress appropriated money to purchase oil from the  market to fill the SPR. Since 1999, oil for the SPR has been obtained  through the royalty-in-kind program. Through this program, the  government receives oil instead of cash for payment of royalties on leases  of federal land in the Gulf of Mexico. Because oil produced in the Gulf  generally does not meet the specifications to be stored in the SPR, DOE  trades this oil with contractors who provide oil that can be stored in the  SPR. Recently, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 directed DOE to increase the  SPR inventory to 1 billion barrels and required DOE to select sites for the  expansion to accommodate the inventory no later than 1 year after  enactment, or by August 2006.", "Historically, DOE has added oil to the SPR in response to specific concerns  about oil supply security. For example, when DOE acquired oil for the SPR  after the Arab oil embargo of 1973 to 1974 and the Iranian revolution in  1979, the goal was to rapidly create a reserve large enough to be useful in  case of a severe oil supply disruption. During the mid- to late-1990s when  oil prices were relatively low, there were no significant oil security  concerns and little oil was added to the SPR. In contrast, following the  terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the President directed that oil be  added to the SPR, even though it already contained enough oil to meet  potential near-term supply disruptions. The stated goal was to maximize  long-term protection against oil supply disruptions. Some have criticized  filling the SPR at that time because they believe doing so increased the  price of oil.", "The President has the primary authority to decide when to use the SPR.  Additionally, the Secretary of Energy is authorized to carry out exchanges  from the SPR and test drawdowns to evaluate SPR procedures. Presidents  have twice ordered that oil be sold from the SPR in response to oil supply  disruptions: that is, in response to the 1990-1991 Persian Gulf War and  Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Additionally, the SPR has sold or exchanged oil  on several other occasions, including providing small quantities of oil to  refiners to help them through short-term localized oil shortages.", "In conducting our review, we answered the following questions: (1) Based  on past experience, what factors do experts recommend be considered  when filling and using the SPR? (2) To what extent can the SPR protect the  U.S. economy from damage during oil supply disruptions? (3) Under what  circumstances would an SPR larger than its current size be warranted?", "In addressing these questions, we developed six hypothetical oil supply  disruption scenarios. These scenarios are set in today\u2019s oil market, with  global crude oil demand of approximately 83 million barrels per day and  U.S. demand of approximately 21 million barrels per day. The scenarios are  as follows:  A hurricane in the U.S. Gulf Coast disrupts oil supplies by up to   1.5 million barrels per day for 6 months, similar to the disruptions  caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.", "A strike among oil workers in Venezuela disrupts oil production by up to  2.2 million barrels per day over 5 months, similar to a strike that  occurred in 2002 to 2003. Production then remains 0.2 million barrels  per day below its prestrike level for an additional 19 months.", "Iran stops exporting oil for 18 months, removing 2.7 million barrels per  day from the market.", "A terrorism event at an oil facility in Saudi Arabia disrupts up to   6 million barrels per day over 8 months.", "Closure of the Strait of Hormuz, which is a vital oil shipping lane located  at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, disrupts 17 million barrels per day  for 1 month. Supply then recovers over the next 2 months.", "Saudi Arabia stops oil production, removing 10 million barrels per day  from the market for 18 months. Production then recovers over the  following 6 months.", "We selected these hypothetical scenarios to illustrate the potential benefits  of strategic reserves in a wide range of different situations, not because we  consider these scenarios likely.", "To collect expert opinions on the impacts of past SPR fill and use and  recommendations for the future, we convened a group of experts in  conjunction with the National Academy of Sciences and interviewed  experts from industry and academia. We convened the group to allow the  experts to exchange and challenge ideas, but the group was not designed to  reach consensus on the issues discussed. We also reviewed records and  reports from DOE and the International Energy Agency and interviewed  officials from these agencies and other oil industry experts.", "To analyze the ability of the SPR to reduce economic damage caused by oil  supply disruptions, we reviewed the economic literature on the impact of  oil supply disruptions and used two DOE simulation models to estimate the  reduction of harm to U.S. GDP that would result from releasing oil from the  SPR and international reserves during our oil supply disruption scenarios.  These two models estimate the increase in oil prices and the reduction in  GDP that are likely to occur during an oil supply disruption of a given size.  Although the models provide useful information, they make assumptions  and do not include some factors that could influence the reserve\u2019s  operation, such as the compatibility of SPR oil with U.S. refineries.  Therefore, we interviewed oil industry experts, members of our group of  experts, and representatives from companies that comprise 76 percent of  the refining capacity of the United States to learn about issues with SPR  operation not included in the models that affect the extent to which the  SPR can protect the economy.", "To learn about the circumstances under which a larger SPR would be  warranted, we reviewed U.S. stockholding obligations to the International  Energy Agency, estimates of future U.S. oil demand, and a 2005 study  performed by a contractor for DOE that analyzed the expected costs and  benefits of expanding the SPR. We also reviewed studies and interviewed  members of our National Academy of Science group of experts and other  oil market experts about factors that influence the ideal size of the SPR.  Our intent was to present useful information and discussion of key  considerations about expanding the SPR, not to make recommendations  about whether the SPR should be expanded.", "We did not independently verify information about security, drawdown  rates, or other operational factors reported by the Office of Petroleum  Reserves, nor did we analyze or verify strategic reserves held by other  countries that belong to the International Energy Agency. A more detailed  description of our scope and methodology is included in appendix I. We  performed our work between March 2005 and July 2006 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Oil is vitally important to the world and U.S. economy, accounting for  nearly 40 percent of world primary energy consumption. As shown in  figure 1, although world oil consumption has increased significantly over  the past 20 years, oil\u2019s share of primary energy consumption has remained  fairly constant. EIA projects similar trends for the next 20 years, with total  world energy consumption increasing 2 percent annually through 2025 and  oil comprising about 38 percent of all energy consumption in 2025.", "Oil is also the largest primary source of energy in the United States,  accounting for about 40 percent of all energy consumed in 2004. As shown  in figure 2, two-thirds of the oil consumed in the United States is used for  transportation. About 96 percent of energy used for transportation in the  United States comes from oil. The transportation sector is almost  exclusively dependent on oil because there are no significant competitive  alternatives. EIA projects that transportation will comprise an even larger  part of U.S. oil use in the future, about 72 percent in 2030, because it  expects the growth in demand for transportation to far exceed increases in  fuel efficiency.", "As shown in figure 3, the United States\u2019 demand for imported crude oil  increased rapidly after 1970, when domestic crude oil production peaked.  Although the percentage of imported crude oil decreased from about   45 percent in 1977 to about 26 percent in 1985 due to a reduction in demand  for oil, imported crude oil increased again to 65 percent by 2004 due to a  combination of increases in consumption and decreases in domestic  production.", "The United States created the SPR because the country\u2019s reliance on oil  imports makes it vulnerable to disruptions in oil supply. Strategic oil  reserves like the SPR are particularly important now because oil market  cushions, such as excess oil production capacity and private inventories,  have decreased in recent years. Although estimates of spare production  capacity are uncertain, experts believe that spare production capacity  dropped to around 1 million barrels per day in 2004, close to a 20-year low.  Additionally, private inventories of oil and oil products have been on a long- term declining trend, in part because of a trend toward just-in-time  inventory. The absence of these market cushions means that less oil is  available in the market to mitigate price spikes during oil supply  disruptions. Thus, a supply disruption that takes even a small amount of oil  off the market could cause the price of oil to rise dramatically.", "One factor limiting excess oil production capacity is recent steep increases  in world consumption of oil. Together, the United States and Western  Europe accounted for 44 percent of the 80 million barrels of oil per day of world oil consumption in 2003. The United States is the world\u2019s largest oil  consumer, accounting for about 25 percent of the world\u2019s oil consumption,  despite having only 5 percent of the world\u2019s population. In addition to the  high levels of consumption in the United States and Western Europe, oil  consumption has also been rising rapidly in Asia and Oceania, as shown in  figure 4. For example, according to a recent study by the International  Monetary Fund, China and India accounted for 35 percent of incremental  oil consumption between 1993 and 2003, even though they accounted for  only 15 percent of world economic output over the period. China has  overtaken Japan as the second largest oil consumer in the world, second to  the United States.", "Since 1976, the United States has spent about $26.3 billion\u2014$45.2 billion  when valued in year 2005 dollars\u2014to build, maintain, fill, and manage the  SPR. The largest cost has been the cost of filling the reserve. Since filling  began in 1977, $20.0 billion has been spent to obtain oil ($35.1 billion in  2005 dollars). This amount includes $15.7 billion of oil purchased with  funds appropriated from 1977 through 1992, and $4.3 billion of oil received  in lieu of government royalty payments since 1999.", "Since 1999, oil for the SPR has been obtained through the royalty-in-kind  transfer program, in which royalties from government oil leases in the Gulf  of Mexico are taken in the form of oil, rather than in cash. The Department  of the Interior\u2019s Minerals Management Service, which collects the royalties,  contracts for delivery of the royalty oil to designated market centers.  Because the oil delivered to these market centers often does not meet SPR  quality specifications and is distant from the SPR storage sites, DOE  awards complementary contracts to exchange royalty oil at the market  center for SPR-quality oil delivered to the SPR facilities. However, the  logistics of Gulf of Mexico oil production from federal leases limits the rate  at which royalty oil can be economically delivered to the SPR sites.", "The SPR oil is stored in salt caverns at the following four facilities: Bayou  Choctaw and West Hackberry in Louisiana, and Big Hill and Bryan Mound  in Texas. These caverns range in size from 6 million to 35 million barrels  and were created by solution mining, in which water injected into an  underground salt formation dissolves the salt and creates a cavern.  According to DOE, salt caverns offer the lowest cost, most environmentally  secure way to store crude oil for long periods of time. Storing oil in  aboveground tanks generally costs 5 to 10 times as much. Also, because the  salt caverns are 2,000 to 4,000 feet below the surface, geologic pressure will  seal any crack that develops in the salt formation, ensuring that no crude  oil leaks from the cavern. An additional benefit is the natural temperature  difference between the top of the caverns and the bottom, which keeps the  crude oil continuously circulating in the caverns, ensuring that the oil in the  cavern is of consistent quality.", "Areas near the Gulf of Mexico were a logical choice for locating the SPR. In  addition to the more than 500 salt domes concentrated along the Gulf  Coast, many U.S. refineries and distribution points for tankers, barges, and  pipelines are available. The four SPR storage areas are connected via  pipelines to the Gulf Coast and the Midwest refining regions. Oil can be  transferred via tanker to the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, which is a major  facility in the Gulf of Mexico that is connected via pipeline to over 50  percent of the United States refining capacity. The location of the SPR is  less advantageous for distributing oil to or receiving it from the western  United States.", "Past drawdowns of the SPR have occurred for a wide variety of reasons.  The SPR has sold oil twice under emergency conditions, 17.3 million  barrels in 1991 at the beginning of Operation Desert Storm and 11.0 million  barrels in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina. In response to problems ranging  from a blocked pipeline to a potential shortage of commercial heating oil  stocks, exchanges of crude oil from the SPR with private companies have  occurred eight times, ranging in size from 500,000 barrels to 30 million  barrels. The largest exchange occurred in the fall of 2000 in response to  concerns about low inventories of heating oil in the Northeast. In these  exchanges, the borrowing parties returned the amount of oil borrowed plus  additional volumes of oil as interest. In two cases, conducted for  operational reasons, the SPR exchanged 11.0 million barrels of lower  quality oil for 8.5 million barrels of higher quality oil and 2.7 million barrels  of crude oil for 2.0 million barrels of heating oil. DOE has also conducted  two test sales to demonstrate the readiness of the SPR, in 1985 and 1990. In  addition, sales to reduce the federal deficit occurred mainly in 1996."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Based on Historical Experience, Experts Suggested Alternative Practices for SPR Fill and Points to Consider for Use", "paragraphs": ["Recent concerns about filling the SPR and long-standing concerns about its  use can be addressed in ways that improve SPR effectiveness, according to  numerous energy and oil market experts.

Others have  expressed concerns that the SPR has not been used in disruptions where its  use was warranted and, when used, has not been used early enough after a  disruption has occurred.

Experts suggested SPR fill practices that could reduce the cost  of filling the SPR. They recommended that DOE acquire a fixed dollar value  of oil per time period, rather than a fixed volume of oil per time period, and  allow industry more flexibility in the timing of oil deliveries to the SPR."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Early Fill Activity Was Generally Focused on Making the SPR Large Enough to Respond to Disruptions", "paragraphs": ["Prior to 1984, several pieces of legislation set forth minimum fill rates for  the SPR, in an effort to increase the volume of the reserve to a level large  enough to be useful during an oil supply disruption. However, the actual  rate of fill often fell short of these goals. Several studies completed around  this time reported that, given the SPR\u2019s small size, it should be reserved for  severe disruptions since it is a one-time source of crude oil, which must be  replenished after a drawdown. They advised that only after the SPR  contained a minimum of 250 million to 500 million barrels of oil would it be  advisable to use it. In a September 1981 report, we echoed this concern,  believing that DOE should not suspend SPR fill, except during severe  disruptions, until the SPR reached a minimum threshold size.  Furthermore, we stated that, given the importance of the SPR, filling it  should be considered a part of U.S. base demand and should not be cut  back under tight market conditions.", "Figure 5 shows the progress in filling the SPR since its inception in 1975.  Fill was suspended from September 1979 to September 1980 when oil  supplies were disrupted following the Iranian Revolution. The SPR reached  a volume of about 500 million barrels in 1985, and filling the reserve slowed  considerably after that time. SPR fill was again suspended in 1990 after the  Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The size of the SPR did not significantly increase  again until after the September 11 terrorist attacks, when the President  ordered DOE to fill the SPR to its 700 million barrel capacity to maximize  the long-term protection against potential oil supply disruptions. The  President\u2019s statement accompanying the fill order indicated that, although  current strategic inventories in the United States and other countries were  sufficient to meet any potential near-term supply disruption, filling the SPR  to capacity would strengthen the long-term energy security of the United  States. The President directed that the SPR be filled in a deliberate and  cost-effective manner, principally through royalty-in-kind transfers. From  April 2002 to August 2005, DOE added 138 million barrels to the SPR at a cost of $4.3 billion. The SPR received oil from the royalty-in-kind program  at average rates varying from about 60,000 to 116,000 barrels per day,  although fill was suspended twice during this period, including January to  April 2003 in response to the disruption of crude oil supplies from  Venezuela.", "The President\u2019s directive to fill SPR in 2001 became controversial. Several  oil analysts and experts believe that filling the reserve at that time caused  the world price of oil to increase by several dollars per barrel. Most of the  oil experts with whom we spoke, however, believe that filling the SPR had  minimal impact on oil prices, because the volume of oil going to the SPR  was very small, less than one-quarter of 1 percent of total world demand.", "To decrease the cost of filling the SPR, many experts recommend changes  in SPR practices, including more flexible timing of oil acquisition.  Generally, all fill options must balance the cost of adding oil to the SPR  now against the benefits that the additional oil will provide in the future.  During the initial filling of the SPR, it was clear that the benefits of adding  oil outweighed the immediate costs of doing so. However, now that the SPR  holds nearly 700 million barrels of oil, there is a greater interest in finding  ways to reduce the acquisition costs.", "Several experts suggested that DOE should use a predictable, transparent  long-term process to acquire oil for the SPR. For example, some experts  suggested a dollar-cost-averaging approach, where DOE would acquire a  steady dollar value of oil per time period (e.g., day or month) instead of a  relatively steady volume, as has generally been the case in recent years. A  dollar-cost-averaging approach would take advantage of fluctuations in oil  prices, since the same dollar amount will purchase more oil when prices  are low than when prices are high. To evaluate the effect of a dollar-cost- averaging approach on SPR fill cost, we estimated the potential savings of  this approach had it been used from October 2001 through August 2005.  Our results showed that if DOE had followed a dollar-cost-averaging  approach when filling the SPR during that time, it could have saved  approximately $590 million while acquiring the same amount of oil. We also  ran simulations to estimate potential future cost savings from using a  dollar-cost-averaging approach over 5 years. The simulations showed that  dollar cost averaging is likely to save money over a range of plausible paths  of future oil prices, whether prices are rising or falling and whether price  volatility is small or large. The savings due to dollar cost averaging were  generally greater when oil prices were more volatile.", "As an additional measure, some experts suggested that DOE exercise  flexibility and react to market conditions when filling the SPR. They said  that DOE should not fill the SPR when the oil market is tight or when doing  so would significantly tighten the market. DOE officials told us that the  department has approved some delivery deferrals that contractors have  requested, in particular after the oil workers\u2019 strike in Venezuela, but DOE  has also turned down some requests. In return for these deferrals, DOE  received additional barrels of oil as a premium. From October 2001 through  August 2005, payment for deferrals added 4.6 million barrels of oil to the  SPR, with a value of approximately $110 million. Some experts suggested  that DOE could expand the use of deferrals by allowing oil producers to delay oil delivery to the SPR when they believe that supply and demand are  in tight balance and current prices are higher than expected future prices.  Under these conditions, it is financially advantageous for oil producers to  delay delivery, and producers could provide additional oil to the SPR to pay  for the privilege of delaying delivery. Experts noted that there may be  considerations beyond the oil market, such as national security concerns,  that would necessitate the delivery of oil to the SPR at a particular time,  therefore, DOE would want to exercise its authority to disallow deferrals at  times when it is in the national interest that oil deliveries not be delayed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Experts Suggested Several Points to Consider When Deciding on SPR Use", "paragraphs": ["The law allows broad presidential discretion and provides only general  guidance for the SPR\u2019s use, making use of the SPR a matter of judgment by  the President.

These amendments allow for only limited use of the  SPR\u2014no more than 30 million barrels may be sold over 60 days, and no  sales may be made if the SPR is below 500 million barrels.", "In addition to presidential authority, the Secretary of Energy is authorized  to carry out test drawdowns and sales or exchanges from the SPR to  evaluate the drawdown and sale procedures. The Secretary may not release  more than 5 million barrels of oil during such a test. DOE officials pointed  out that they follow a series of progressive steps in responding to a  disruption. They can (1) identify relevant inventories and evaluate market  impacts (with the help of EIA); (2) defer any ongoing deliveries to the SPR,  thereby making this oil available to the market; (3) make exchanges in  response to requests from individual companies facing problems; and   (4) arrange for competitive exchanges, whereby companies bid for oil from  the SPR by promising to replace it with a greater volume of oil at a  specified date in the future.

Members of our expert group pointed out that today\u2019s larger  reserve diminishes the value of holding oil back during a disruption as a  hedge against possible future disruptions, and they noted greater  willingness to use reserves in response to disruptions now than in the past.", "Second, more extensive experience with the SPR during past disruptions  may enable better understanding of the unique features of future oil  disruptions that warrant a release of oil from the SPR. In a 1993 report, we  stated that U.S. policy emphasized initially relying on free market forces in  oil supply disruptions. However, the report observed that this policy  provides little specific guidance on how long market forces should be  allowed to operate before the SPR is used or what conditions should  dictate its use. Experts in our group agreed that the SPR should be used to  supply oil during disruptions where the market cannot make up for lost  supply. Experts also identified a variety of specific features of disruptions  that could help determine when SPR use is warranted. These features  included the volume of oil disrupted, the type of oil disrupted, the  availability of spare oil production capacity, the source of the disruption  and its distance from the United States, and the time of year that the  disruption occurs (with implications for gasoline supplies in the summer  and heating oil in the winter).", "Economic experts have described additional points to consider when  making decisions about using the SPR during a disruption.", "Experts noted that not all oil price increases are equally damaging to the  economy. Economic research shows that rapid oil price increases, or  price shocks, are much more harmful to the economy than oil price  increases along a steady upward path. For example, one expert noted  that although average world crude oil prices increased by more than   $30 per barrel between 2001 and 2005, there was no price shock, and the  U.S. economy remained strong, growing at about 3.5 percent annually  during this period.", "Under some conditions, decision makers could use monetary policy to  partially offset economic damage from an oil price shock. The Federal  Reserve might be able to prevent some economic damage by allowing a  one-time increase in the money supply to stimulate spending and spur  GDP growth. However, not all economists agree that monetary policy  would be effective, or that monetary policy could offset the impacts of a  disruption without having other negative impacts on the economy.", "Third, avoiding delay in using the SPR when its use is warranted will  minimize economic damage. Expert group members encouraged early use  of the SPR as a first line of defense against oil supply disruptions, noting  that recent changes in the oil industry\u2014including diminished spare crude  oil production capacity, refining capacity, and product inventories\u2014have  removed sources of supply security that have covered short-term supply  losses in the past. Additionally, some experts believe that much of the harm  to the U.S. economy occurs in the early phases of a disruption, before the  economy has a chance to adjust to higher prices.", "Avoiding delay in SPR use is also important because even when spare  production capacity is available in the world to take the place of disrupted  oil supply, this oil will take time to reach the United States. EIA estimates  that the majority of the world\u2019s spare oil production capacity is located in  Saudi Arabia and takes about 30 to 40 days to reach the United States.

If the SPR is drawn down more slowly, it could  release a million barrels of oil per day for nearly 1\u00bd years, or at smaller  rates for an even longer period.", "In addition to the reserves in the United States, members of the  International Energy Agency have about 2.7 billion barrels of public and  industry reserves, of which about 700 million barrels are government- controlled for emergency purposes. These government-controlled  reserves can release a maximum of about 8.5 million barrels of oil and  petroleum products per day, diminishing quickly to about 4.5 million  barrels per day after 30 days, about 3.5 million barrels per day after 60 days,  and slightly more than 1 million barrels per day after 90 days.

The six scenarios are (1) a hurricane in  the U.S. Gulf Coast, (2) a strike among oil workers in Venezuela, (3) an  embargo of Iranian oil supply, (4) a terrorism event at an oil facility in Saudi  Arabia, (5) closure of the Strait of Hormuz, and (6) a shutdown of Saudi  Arabian oil production. For each scenario, we assume that world excess  crude oil production capacity and world fuel-switching capabilities, which  together total 850,000 barrels per day, are available immediately to help  offset a disruption. We also assume that private inventories of crude oil  are neutral during a disruption\u2014holders of private inventory neither draw  down their inventories nor hoard oil. (See app. II for a more detailed  description of our scenarios.)", "As shown in table 1, the SPR is large enough and has enough drawdown  capacity to completely replace the oil lost during our Gulf Coast hurricane  and Venezuelan strike scenarios, which reduce world oil supply by   155 million barrels over 6 months and 307 million barrels of oil over   24 months, respectively. The SPR could eliminate these hypothetical  disruptions by releasing 24 million and 87 million barrels of oil,  respectively, and world spare capacity and fuel switching would make up  the remaining 131 million and 220 million barrels.", "The SPR alone is not large enough to replace all of the oil lost in our Iranian  embargo scenario, and it does not have enough drawdown capacity to  completely replace the oil lost during our Saudi terrorism scenario. Our  Iranian embargo scenario assumes a disruption of almost 1.5 billion barrels  of oil over 18 months. Even if the United States were to release all of the oil  in the SPR and if excess production capacity and fuel switching were  available in the amount assumed here, there would still be a net disruption  of slightly more than 300 million barrels. In our Saudi terrorism scenario,  the drawdown capacity of the SPR would be insufficient to replace the oil  lost during the 1st month of the disruption. For the SPR to replace the oil  during the 1st month with no assistance from international reserves,  maximum SPR drawdown capacity would need to be increased by almost   1 million barrels per day, to a total drawdown capacity of approximately  5.2 million barrels per day. In both of these cases, however, a coordinated  international response could replace all of the disrupted oil.", "Even with a coordinated response, the SPR and international oil reserves  are not adequate to replace the disrupted oil from our catastrophic Strait of  Hormuz closure and Saudi shutdown scenarios. The drawdown capacity of  international reserves is inadequate to replace the very large amount of oil  that could be disrupted if the Strait of Hormuz were closed. We assume that  a closure of the Strait of Hormuz could disrupt 17 million barrels of oil per  day during the 1st month\u2014more than 12 million barrels per day beyond  what the SPR could release on its own and more than 4 million barrels per day beyond what could be released during a coordinated international  response. In contrast, the volume of oil in international reserves is  inadequate to replace the oil lost during our Saudi shutdown scenario.  Even if all of the oil in the SPR were used in a unilateral response, the net  disruption would still be more than 4.9 billion barrels over 2 years, an  amount equal to about 16 percent of the crude oil consumed in the world in  2004.

As previously noted, DOE uses two different economic models to  estimate the impact of oil supply disruptions on oil prices and GDP: one  used by the Office of Petroleum Reserves and one used by EIA. We used  both of these models to estimate the reduction in economic damage  (avoided damage) that could result from releasing oil from the SPR and  international reserves during our six hypothetical disruption scenarios.  (See app. II for additional description of these models and the assumptions  used in our analysis.)", "Table 2 shows the oil price increases that the Office of Petroleum Reserves\u2019  model estimates for our six disruption scenarios if reserves were not used,  if the SPR were used alone, and if the SPR were used as part of a  coordinated international response. This model estimates oil prices each  month during a disruption and assumes that completely replacing the oil  lost in a disruption eliminates the resulting price increase. Thus, this model  predicts no price increase in situations where the SPR or international  reserves can completely replace the disrupted oil, although experts told us  that a price increase would likely occur in this instance due to market  psychology. For those scenarios where some, but not all, of the oil can be  replaced, the model estimates smaller oil price increases than if reserves  were not used. For example, the model estimates that oil prices could rise  by up to $47 per barrel during our Saudi terrorism scenario if reserves were  not used. However, if SPR oil were released into the market, the estimated  maximum price increase would be only $7 per barrel. If oil from  international reserves were also released into the market, the model  estimates there would be no price increase, because the reserve oil would  completely replace the disrupted oil.", "To estimate how much economic damage could be avoided by using the  SPR and international reserves during our oil supply disruption scenarios,  we first estimated the damage that would occur if no reserves were used.  We then estimated the damage to GDP, if any, from the disruptions if the  SPR were used, either alone or in conjunction with international reserves.  The difference between the estimates with and without reserve use is the  avoided damage to GDP resulting from use of the reserve. As shown in  table 3, the Office of Petroleum Reserves\u2019 model estimates that the ability  of the SPR alone to curb rising oil prices reduces damage to GDP by a  range of $7 billion for our 6-month Gulf Coast hurricane scenario to   $142 billion for our 8-month Saudi terrorism scenario. In all but the two  smallest scenarios, the model shows that a coordinated international  response can provide a greater reduction in damage, ranging from $118  billion for the 3-month closure of the Strait of Hormuz to $201 billion for  our 18-month Iranian embargo scenario. In our 24-month Saudi shutdown  scenario, the model shows that economic damage of approximately   $662 billion occurs even if international reserves were used in response to  the disruption.", "The damage caused by each disruption and the portion of that damage that  can be avoided by releasing reserves depend on the nature of the  disruption. For example, the SPR and international reserves cannot  eliminate all of the economic damage that could be caused by our Strait of  Hormuz closure scenario because, even though the duration is short, it  involves a disruption of a very large quantity of oil that the reserves cannot  replace. Additionally, the models show that replacement of a portion of the  oil lost in the Saudi Arabian shutdown scenario results in less benefit to the  economy than completely replacing the oil lost in the smaller Iranian  embargo scenario.", "The way in which oil is released from the reserves also impacts how  effective the reserves are in preventing damage to GDP. In each scenario,  the results previously described include the assumption that release begins  immediately and occurs at a steady rate for the entire length of the  disruption. The results also include the assumption that the rate of release  either completely replaces the oil lost or is the maximum sustainable rate  for the entire disruption. Delaying the release of reserves in response to a  disruption is harmful in every scenario, and the harm is greater the longer  release is delayed. This effect is particularly large in scenarios where more  oil is lost at the beginning of the disruption, such as the closure of the Strait  of Hormuz or the Saudi terrorism scenarios. Replacing the oil lost during  the disruption at the maximum rate possible instead of a steady rate gives a  different result only in our largest disruption scenario, the Saudi shutdown.  The maximum release strategy is advantageous in this scenario because the  model assumes that the economic damage from the disruption is worse at  the beginning, before the economy has had a chance to adjust. Since  international reserves are emptied to respond to this scenario, releasing  more oil at the beginning provides more benefit than releasing at a steady  rate.", "Table 4 shows the oil price increases that the EIA model estimates for our  six oil supply disruption scenarios for the same three circumstances  described for the Office of Petroleum Reserves\u2019 model: if reserves were not  used, if the SPR were used alone, and if the SPR were used as part of a  coordinated international response. The EIA model estimates a range of  price impacts for each quarter of the disruption, rather than a single value  for each month as in the Office of Petroleum Reserves\u2019 model. Both models  consider the amount of oil disrupted when calculating oil price increases,  but the EIA model also estimates the impact of the disruption on market  psychology. For example, an EIA official stated that disruptions caused by  violent events would have larger price impacts than disruptions caused by  peaceful events, such as a strike or natural disaster. Furthermore, the EIA  model assumes that even if reserves can replace all of the oil lost in a  disruption, oil prices may still increase because of\u2018 market psychology. For  these reasons, in some cases, the EIA model predicts larger price increases  when reserves are used than the Office of Petroleum Reserves\u2019 model. For  example, for the Saudi terrorism scenario, the EIA model predicts a price  increase of $18 to $39 if the SPR were used alone (see table 4), while the  Office of Petroleum Reserves\u2019 model predicts a maximum price increase of  only $7 (see table 2).", "As shown in table 5, the EIA model estimates that the ability of the SPR  alone to mitigate increases in oil prices reduces damage to GDP by $0.4  billion to $1.0 billion for our Gulf Coast hurricane scenario up to $15 billion  to $38 billion for our Iranian embargo scenario. As with the Office of  Petroleum Reserves\u2019 model, the EIA model also shows that a coordinated  international response reduces more economic harm in each scenario,  except those where the SPR can replace the oil alone.

The costs of  constructing and filling the additional capacity dominate the analysis until  2020, while benefits of the additional capacity accrue from 2021 through  the end of the analysis in 2050. The study uses EIA forecasts of oil price and  demand through 2025, and a linear extrapolation of these forecasts from  2025 through 2050. Any analysis of costs and benefits so far in the future is  inherently uncertain. However, this study is the only one of its kind to  analyze the future net benefits of SPR expansion.", "The costs of expanding the SPR to 1.5 billion barrels consist of capital costs  to acquire and construct the facilities, the cost of crude oil to fill the new  capacity, and ongoing maintenance and security costs for the additional  facilities. DOE estimates that expanding the physical structure of the SPR  to 1.5 billion barrels would take approximately 18 years and cost  approximately $5.4 billion, in 2004 dollars. DOE assumed that expanding  the reserve to this size would involve purchasing or constructing additional  storage capacity at three existing SPR sites: West Hackberry and Bayou  Choctaw in Louisiana, and Big Hill in Texas. The remaining expansion  would be accomplished by constructing new storage sites at three sites  selected from five potential sites in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The  ORNL study\u2019s authors estimate the cost of filling the additional SPR  capacity at $23.0 billion, in 2004 dollars. This estimate is based on the base- case oil price forecast from the 2005 Annual Energy Outlook because the  2006 volume was not yet published when the ORNL study was completed.  The 2006 Outlook forecasts higher crude oil prices than the 2005 Outlook.  Using the most recent base-case forecast, the ORNL authors estimated a fill  cost of $36.2 billion in 2004 dollars. These calculations assume that the new  SPR capacity is filled as it is completed at a maximum fill rate of 100,000  barrels per day, a fill rate achievable using the royalty-in-kind program.", "The ORNL study does not separately consider the costs and benefits of the  expansion to 1 billion barrels authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  DOE estimates that expanding to this size would take approximately   15 years and cost at least $1.3 billion, in 2004 dollars, based on selection of  the lowest-cost expansion options. This cost includes, as we previously  described, purchasing or constructing additional capacity at three existing  SPR sites and constructing a new storage site at one of the five potential  locations. We estimate that filling the additional capacity would cost  approximately $13.4 billion in 2004 dollars, using the base-case cost  estimate in the 2006 Annual Energy Outlook.", "The ORNL study estimates that the benefits of expanding the reserve to   1.5 billion barrels exceed the costs over a range of assumptions about  future demand and oil prices. Expanding the SPR to 1.5 billion barrels is  estimated to be cost-beneficial for each of the demand and world oil price  forecasts in EIA\u2019s 2005 Annual Energy Outlook. The 2005 Outlook contains  four forecasts of the world oil market: a base-case forecast, a lower-price  forecast, and two higher-price forecasts. A different level of oil demand is  associated with each of these price forecasts. The estimated net benefits of  expanding the SPR are greatest in the EIA forecast when oil demand is  highest and oil prices are lowest, and least when oil demand is lowest and  prices are highest. The ORNL study used the 2005 forecasts because, as we  previously mentioned, it was completed before the 2006 Outlook was  published. The 2005 Outlook forecasts higher oil demand and lower oil  prices than the 2006 edition, but the author of the ORNL study noted that  the highest-price case included in the 2005 report closely resembles the  2006 base case. Thus, SPR expansion appears to be cost-beneficial for the  2006 base-case forecast, but the study does not include oil prices as high as  those in the 2006 high-price forecast, which would tend to decrease the  benefits of a larger reserve.", "Beyond assumptions about future oil demand and price, the ORNL study  makes a number of additional assumptions, including important  assumptions about the probability of disruptions and the impact of oil price  increases on GDP.", "The likelihood of oil supply disruptions in the future is uncertain and  difficult to assess. The ORNL study considers two different estimates of  the probability of oil supply disruptions: one that DOE created in 1990  and a second that the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum created in  2005. The benefits of expanding the SPR to 1.5 million barrels exceed  the costs for both disruption probability estimates, but the benefits are  larger for the 2005 Stanford Energy Modeling Forum estimate because  this estimate (1) considers longer disruptions than those considered in  the 1990 estimate and (2) recognizes that excess capacity will not be  available from a part of the world where supply is disrupted.", "The measure of how much a given increase in oil price reduces GDP is  known as the GDP elasticity of oil price. GDP loss avoided when the  SPR is used during oil supply disruptions is a measure of the benefit of  the SPR. The ORNL study used a range of GDP elasticity estimates and  the results of the model runs indicate that, over that range, expanding  the SPR is cost-beneficial. Some economists, however, believe that the  GDP elasticity is lower than the bottom of the range of elasticity  estimates used by the ORNL study. For example, the model we  described in the previous section that EIA uses to estimate the impacts  of oil supply disruptions uses values for this GDP elasticity derived from  the Global Insight Macroeconomic Model that are one-quarter to one- half the size of the smallest value considered in the ORNL study. A  smaller value for the GDP elasticity would reduce the calculated  benefits of expanding the SPR."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Factors Influencing the SPR\u2019s Ideal Size Are Likely to Change Over Time", "paragraphs": ["Many factors influence the ideal size of the SPR, including world demand  for oil and the probability and potential size of oil supply disruptions.  Although current projections anticipate increasing future demand for oil in  the United States and world, future oil demand conditions are uncertain.  Predicting future demand is difficult because it depends on many factors,  including the rates of economic growth, the price of oil, policy choices, and  technology changes.", "The rate of world economic growth strongly influences oil demand. Strong  economic growth in China has increased its demand for oil and petroleum  products, contributing to rising world oil prices since 2004. In that year,  China became the world\u2019s second largest consumer of oil, behind the  United States, and its demand for oil grew at an annual rate of 15 percent.  Conversely, the financial crisis in Asia in mid-1997 dramatically slowed the  rate of oil demand growth in the region at that time, and oil demand even  decreased between 1997 and 1998 in some countries. This change in  demand contributed to lower oil prices in 1998 and early 1999, according to  some experts.", "Future demand for oil will also depend on its price. As we previously  described, crude oil prices are set in the world marketplace, and are largely  outside the control of U.S. policymakers. High oil prices can encourage  conservation and investment in fuel-efficient technologies and alternative  fuels, reducing demand, while low oil prices can have the opposite effect.", "Members of our group of experts suggested several policy choices that  might diminish growth in U.S. demand for oil. First, they suggested that  research and investment in alternative fuels might reduce the growth of  future U.S. oil demand. Vehicles that use alternative fuels, including  ethanol, biodiesel, liquefied coal, and fuels made from natural gas, are now  generally more expensive or less convenient to own than conventional  vehicles, because of higher vehicle and fuel costs and a lack of refueling  infrastructure. Alternative-fuel vehicles could become more viable in the  marketplace if their costs and fuel delivery infrastructure become more  comparable to vehicles fueled by petroleum products. Second, expert  group members suggested that greater use of advanced fuel-efficient  vehicles, such as hybrid electric and advanced diesel cars and trucks, could  reduce U.S. oil demand. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 directs the  Secretary of Energy to establish a program that includes grants to  automobile manufacturers to encourage domestic production of these  vehicles. Third, several members of our group of experts suggested  improving the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards to curb  demand for petroleum fuels in the United States. After these standards  were established in 1975, the average fuel economy of new light-duty  vehicles improved from 13.1 miles per gallon in 1975 to a peak of 22.1 miles  per gallon in 1987. More recently, the fuel economy of new vehicles in the  United States has stagnated at approximately 21 miles per gallon. New  CAFE standards for light trucks, including minivans and sport-utility  vehicles, were announced by the administration in March 2006, which  include larger vehicles that were not regulated under past standards. Other  experts have questioned the need for enhanced CAFE standards, noting  that today\u2019s higher gasoline prices will bring about more efficient use of  gasoline. Additionally, studies from the Congressional Budget Office  suggest that a tax on gasoline could reduce demand at lower cost to the  economy than enhanced CAFE standards.", "The size of the SPR needed to protect the U.S. economy also depends on  the likelihood of oil supply disruptions. A number of factors in today\u2019s  energy market cause particular concern, including a reduction in global  surplus oil production capacity in recent years, the fact that much of the  world\u2019s supply of oil is produced in relatively unstable regions, and rapid  growth in world oil demand that has led to a tight balance between demand  and supply. However, factors influencing disruption probability are likely to  change over time.", "As we described in the previous section, international reserves augment  the SPR\u2019s ability to replace oil during supply disruptions. Since a release of  oil anywhere in the world during a disruption can lower oil prices  everywhere, strategic reserves in other countries are beneficial to the  United States and influence the SPR\u2019s ideal size. Along these lines, some  members of our group of experts stressed the importance of international  reserves to U.S. oil security and suggested that the United States and the  International Energy Agency should encourage construction of strategic  reserves abroad to be used during oil supply disruptions and should offer  technical assistance to countries that want to construct such reserves.  Officials from DOE and the International Energy Agency described efforts  to support construction of reserves in other countries, including  sponsoring workshops and providing other assistance. Experts pointed out  that encouraging the construction of strategic reserves is particularly  important in developing countries that are significant oil consumers and  that are not currently members of the International Energy Agency, such as  China. EIA forecasts that through 2025, demand in China will increase at a  much faster rate than demand in more developed countries.", "Projections of future oil demand and oil market conditions are inherently  uncertain, but these projections are key to any estimate of the optimal or  necessary size of the SPR. If demand for oil grows as projected, keeping the  SPR at its current size may put the economy at greater risk from the  negative effects of oil supply disruptions. However, the estimates of world  oil demand used in current studies could be too high or too low, resulting in  high or low estimates of the SPR\u2019s optimal size. Therefore, as time passes  and oil markets change, periodic reassessments by DOE of the appropriate  size of the SPR could be helpful as part of the nation\u2019s long-term energy  security planning."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The SPR is a valuable asset for protecting the U.S. economy, providing  benefits as a source of oil during supply disruptions and as a tool of  diplomacy in foreign policy discussions. Our work shows that the SPR,  particularly in conjunction with reserves held by the other countries of the  International Energy Agency, can replace the oil lost during all but the most  catastrophic disruption scenarios and, thus, can reduce the negative  consequences of oil supply disruptions on the U.S. economy. However, our  work also describes issues that could impact the cost and effectiveness of  the SPR, including the conditions under which the reserve is filled, how  DOE estimates the economic impacts of using the reserve, and the type of  crude oil in the reserve. Expanding the reserve makes sense and will be  necessary to maintain the economy\u2019s present level of protection if demand  for oil in the United States increases as expected. However, factors that  influence the ideal size of the SPR are likely to change over time and will  warrant periodic reassessments.", "Since the SPR\u2019s inception, it has been filled and used in response to world  events and changing conditions. Although some experts claimed that  acquiring oil for the SPR after the terrorism events of September 2001  caused substantial increases in oil prices, the majority of experts we talked  with believe that this increase was minimal because the volume of oil going  to the SPR was very small relative to world oil demand. Experts believe  that changes in SPR practices\u2014including following a \u201cdollar-cost- averaging\u201d approach, where the government acquires a fixed dollar value of  oil for the SPR over a specified time period, and allowing oil producers  more flexibility in the timing of delivery for oil acquired for the SPR\u2014could  reduce the future cost of filling the SPR.", "Different parts of DOE have very different opinions on the amount of  economic harm oil supply disruptions can cause and, thus, implicitly about  the ideal size and use of the SPR. The estimates of the effect of price spikes  on GDP that these different parts of DOE use are, respectively, near the  high end and low end of the spectrum of such estimates in the economic  literature. The two models have been used to support different kinds of  decisions\u2014the Office of Petroleum Reserves\u2019 model has been used to  support decisions about whether to expand the SPR, while the EIA model  has been used to advise policymakers about the potential economic  consequences of oil supply disruptions. Clarifying the differences between  these models and how the models are used to provide policy advice would  help ensure that DOE provides consistent transparent advice about the size  and use of the SPR.", "The SPR protects the economy during oil supply disruptions by replacing  the oil lost. For the SPR to be most effective, refiners need to be able to  efficiently use the oil in the reserve in the absence of other sources of  supply. The two types of crude oil currently stored in the SPR can be  effectively used by most refineries during a supply disruption, but the lack  of heavy sour oil in the SPR poses problems to refiners who use this type of  oil. Adding some heavy sour oil to the SPR could provide a source of supply  to these refiners during a disruption, while still leaving enough oil of other  types for other refiners. A 2005 DOE study supports this finding,  concluding that separately storing approximately 10 percent heavy sour  crude in the SPR could provide oil supply to refiners who process heavy  sour oil during a disruption and better protect the economy. Additionally,  adding some heavy sour oil to the SPR could decrease the cost of filling the  SPR, since this oil is generally less expensive than the lighter grades  currently stored in the reserve.", "Although another 2005 study for DOE shows that expanding the SPR could  be warranted, factors influencing the ideal size of the SPR are likely to  change over time. Many factors influence the ideal size of the SPR,  including oil demand levels and the likelihood of oil supply disruptions.  Because these factors are very dynamic, decisions about expanding the  SPR will always be made under uncertainty.

We agree that SPR  oil acquisition decisions must consider cost, market conditions, national  security concerns, and other issues. DOE also stated that dollar cost  averaging as a means to improve the cost-effectiveness of SPR fill could be  employed only when DOE is purchasing oil, and noted that recent oil  acquisition has been accomplished by the transfer of royalty oil from the  Interior Department. However, we believe that dollar cost averaging when  acquiring oil through the royalty-in-kind program is possible, although it  would require that DOE vary the amount of oil it accepts from royalties and  perhaps purchase some oil at times of low prices. Because of the potential  for cost savings, we continue to believe that DOE should study such an  approach. Finally, regarding this recommendation, DOE stated that it  believes that the value of deferring oil deliveries to the SPR during the  period of 2002 to 2004 would have been less than $590 million. To clarify,  we did not attempt to value deferrals that DOE might have approved during  this time period. Instead, the $590 million of potential savings referred to in  the report reflects the potential savings from applying a dollar-cost- averaging approach from October 2001 through August 2005, not to the  savings that could have occurred from deferring oil delivery.", "In response to our recommendation to consider storing heavy sour oil in  the SPR, DOE stated that it does not believe the advantages of holding a  heavier crude stream would justify replacing any of the current inventory.  Instead, it believes that studying and implementing this recommendation  should wait until the SPR is expanded. Neither our work nor DOE\u2019s recent  study explored the costs and benefits of adding heavy sour oil to the SPR.  We believe that DOE should study the costs and benefits of adding heavy  sour oil with and without SPR expansion. Without such analysis, DOE does  not have data to determine whether replacing of any of the current  inventory with heavy sour oil is economically justified.", "Regarding the last two recommendations, DOE agreed that officials will  work together to better articulate the different approaches and  perspectives contained in their modeling of the effects of oil supply  disruptions on the economy, and committed to periodic reassessments of  the SPR\u2019s ideal size.

In addition, we ran  simulations to project potential savings from a dollar-cost-averaging  approach going forward over 5 years. Specifically, we evaluated 12 possible  paths that future oil prices may take. First, starting from an initial price of  $70 per barrel, we allowed prices to increase or decrease on average by  varying degrees\u2014the price paths increased or decreased at average rates of  1, 5, and 10 percent per year. Second, for each of these 6 possible price  paths, we allowed prices to fluctuate to account for potential price  volatility\u2014for each of the 6 possible price paths, we allowed for a low- and  high-price volatility case. Specifically, prices for each month were drawn  randomly from a normal distribution, with standard deviations of $15 for  the low volatility case and $50 for the high case. For each of these 12  scenarios, we then simulated future prices for 60 months and compared the  average price per barrel under dollar cost averaging versus acquiring oil at  a steady rate. We ran 1,000 simulations for each of the 12 scenarios and  found that in all but 10 of the resulting 12,000 simulations, dollar cost  averaging saved money. These simulations are not intended to measure the  magnitude of savings.

EIA estimates that  a supply disruption when the price of oil is around $40 per barrel results in  an oil price increase of between $4 and $6 per barrel for each 1 million  barrels per day of oil that is disrupted. However, if the price of oil is about  $50 per barrel, EIA estimates a price increase of between $5 and $7 per  barrel for each 1 million barrels per day of oil that is disrupted. For a  disruption of a given size, the higher the predisruption oil price, the bigger  the price increase needed to balance supply and demand after the  disruption. Additionally, EIA adds a \u201cmarket psychology price premium\u201d to  the price calculated using the rules of thumb in situations where it believes  market psychology will further increase the price.", "To translate oil price increases into GDP losses, EIA uses \u201ceconomic rules  of thumb,\u201d based on simulations from the Global Insight Macroeconomic  Model of the U.S. economy. These rules estimate that a sustained increase  of 10 percent in the price of oil could result in a 0.05 to 0.l percent  reduction in real U.S. GDP relative to its baseline value (the forecasted  GDP without an oil disruption). EIA states that, for price increases greater  than 10 percent, the GDP impacts would increase linearly with the price  impacts, so that a doubling of the price impacts would result in a doubling  of the GDP impacts. The EIA model\u2019s GDP responsiveness estimates are  derived from the Global Insight model that EIA uses for its long-run  forecasts of energy market and overall economic activity. EIA notes that  additional factors, such as the effect of high oil prices on the rest of the  world\u2019s economy, the reaction of the Federal Reserve to ameliorate the  economic damage of high oil prices, and the change in the value of the  dollar against foreign currencies, may also influence the economic impact  of an oil price spike."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Office of Petroleum Reserves\u2019 Model", "paragraphs": ["Economists at ORNL, under contract to DOE\u2019s Office of Petroleum  Reserves, developed a model to estimate the costs and benefits of  expanding the size and drawdown capability of the SPR. Economists at  ORNL used a portion of this model to estimate the GDP impacts of our oil  supply disruption scenarios. The model estimates the economic impacts of  oil supply disruptions by first calculating the remaining oil shortfall after  world excess oil production capacity has been utilized. Then the model  assumes that world oil price increases sufficiently for world oil demand to  contract enough to equal the now-reduced supply. On the basis of a review  of the literature, the modelers assume a short-run price elasticity of  demand for oil between -0.10 to -0.25. The elasticity gets larger as the duration of the supply shock gets larger and longer. The short-run oil  demand elasticities then are used to determine the increase in the world  price of oil. The GDP elasticity of oil price is then used to infer the losses in  economic output that would follow a sudden, unanticipated oil price shock.  The modelers draw on results from econometric studies of the sensitivity  of the U.S. economy to oil price spikes to select a GDP elasticity, expressed  in percentage terms, of -5.4 percent for a 100 percent spike in oil price.", "To estimate the benefits of expanding the size and drawdown capability of  the SPR, the model simulates the impact of oil supply disruptions against  DOE\u2019s baseline paths for oil prices, world oil demands, U.S oil demands,  and U.S. oil supplies. The primary benefit from the SPR is the GDP loss  avoided when it is used to prevent or lessen the effects of oil price spikes.  Their cost-benefit approach uses a simple model of the oil market and the  U.S. economy to (1) assess the potential causes and likelihood that oil  supply disruptions will occur, (2) account for the size of existing strategic  oil stocks and expected degree of international cooperation on their use,  (3) estimate the cost to the U.S. economy of oil supply disruptions and the  incremental ability of additional SPR stocks and drawdown capability to  reduce these costs, (4) estimate the costs of buying and storing oil in the  SPR, and (5) determine the net benefit and efficient size of the SPR. The  model uses a Monte Carlo simulation of the world oil market over the next  several decades to model the likelihood of future oil supply disruptions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Similarities and Differences between the EIA Model and Office of Petroleum Reserves\u2019 Model", "paragraphs": ["In assessing the economic costs of disruptions, the Office of Petroleum  Reserves\u2019 model makes a number of assumptions similar to those made by  EIA, in particular, assumptions about the responsiveness of oil price to  supply disruptions. However, the Office of Petroleum Reserves\u2019 model  assumes a considerably greater degree of responsiveness of the  macroeconomy to oil price spikes than the EIA model. The Office of  Petroleum Reserves\u2019 model assumes for its base case that a sudden  doubling in the price of oil could reduce GDP in the following year by about  5.4 percentage points below what it otherwise would have been. This  contrasts with the EIA model result that a sudden doubling of the price of  oil would cause about a 0.5 to 1.0 percent reduction in the level of real GDP  relative to its value if an oil price increase did not occur.", "Some experts have suggested that the EIA model and Office of Petroleum  Reserves\u2019 model have assumptions that could be responsible for  differences in their estimates of the responsiveness of GDP to disruptions.  In the Office of Petroleum Reserves\u2019 model, the responsiveness of GDP to  an oil price shock incorporates a controversial assumption, that U.S.  monetary authorities would not intervene and increase the money supply  to accommodate the price shock. Some experts have suggested that, by  increasing the money supply, monetary authorities could restore  consumers\u2019 purchasing power to its predisruption level and eliminate or  moderate the GDP loss. Experts have also suggested deficiencies in the  model that EIA uses for its estimates of the responsiveness of GDP to oil  price shocks. A number of experts believe that large-scale macroeconomic  models, such as the EIA model, underestimate the effects of oil price  shocks on the economy. They question whether these models can  distinguish between a price shock and a more gradual price increase.
