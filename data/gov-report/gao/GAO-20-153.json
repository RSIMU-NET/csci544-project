Enforcement can be challenging, as it can be difficult to identify the source of spoofed calls, and scammers may be based overseas. Nevertheless, GAO found that the agencies prioritize their spoofing-related enforcement actions based in part on the level of harm perpetrated against the public and generally follow key practices identified by GAO for effective collaboration. Additionally, FCC and FTC have proposed changes to law to enhance the effectiveness of their enforcement efforts, such as a change that would allow FCC more time to bring certain enforcement actions.

This system is intended to enable carriers to verify whether a caller has a right to use the caller ID being transmitted with the call. Carriers can use this information to better determine whether to block or warn consumers about the incoming call. Stakeholders cautioned that the system cannot determine whether a caller has fraudulent intentions but only whether the caller is using a spoofed number.

However,  FCC found as voice service providers migrated to Internet Protocol (IP)  networks, these technologies lessened the overall accuracy and reliability  of the information presented to the call recipient. Caller ID allows the  recipient of an incoming call to determine the telephone number of the  caller and, in some cases, the name. This information helps the recipient  make informed decisions about which calls to accept or ignore. While the  number and name displayed on the caller ID may be associated with the  caller, a caller can also deliberately falsify or \u201cspoof\u201d the information  transmitted to the caller ID display to disguise the source of the call.  Under the current telephone system, this information, true or false, is  conveyed to the call recipient unless the caller requests that such  information not be conveyed.", "Caller ID spoofing is widespread. Many instances of spoofing are legal.  For example, spoofing is legally used by professionals such as doctors  who want to use their cell phones to return calls to patients but choose to  transmit their office number instead. Spoofing also often accompanies  robocalls\u2014an automated telephone call which delivers a recorded  message. Certain types of robocalls are illegal, such as robocalls for  sales pitches unless companies have consumers\u2019 express written  permission to call. In addition, telemarketers may not call home or  mobile numbers that consumers have registered in the National Do Not  Call Registry, which was established through legislation and is maintained  by FTC\u2014and they must transmit their telephone number and, if possible,  their name, to the call recipient\u2019s caller ID.", "According to FCC, advancements in technology have made it inexpensive  and easy to make robocalls. As telecommunications systems have  transitioned from traditional wireline services, to IP networks, the cost of  making phone calls has dramatically decreased. IP-based voice  services use existing internet connections to send phone calls, which may  be cheaper than long distance phone charges associated with traditional  phone service. Autodialers can be programmed to dial a long list of phone  numbers in order to deliver millions of calls in a short period of time.  These dialing systems, coupled with IP-based voice services, such as  Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), enable telemarketers and  scammers to make high volumes of calls from anywhere in the world.", "IP-based voice services have also made it inexpensive and easy to spoof  caller IDs. According to an industry stakeholder, historically, the router  systems used to spoof calls were physical devices located on site, which  could be prohibitively expensive. However, software that is available for  free can now be downloaded to enable a computer to function as a  router. According to stakeholders, telemarketers and scammers can,  with minimal cost, configure a router to display either a single spoofed  number or a constantly changing set of numbers, making it appear as  though calls originated in the United States even if they did not. (See fig.  1.)", "FCC, FTC, and DOJ each enforce different rules or laws related to caller  ID spoofing.", "FCC enforces rules prohibiting anyone from causing the transmission  of misleading or inaccurate caller ID information with the intent to  defraud, cause harm, or wrongfully obtain anything of value. FCC  also enforces rules requiring telemarketers to transmit caller ID  information.", "FTC protects consumers against unfair or deceptive business acts or  practices. FTC, similar to FCC, enforces rules requiring  telemarketers to transmit their telephone number, and when available,  the name of the telemarketer to a consumer\u2019s caller ID service.", "DOJ enforces federal fraud statutes under which fines or  imprisonment can be imposed against anyone who uses interstate  telecommunications as part of a fraud scheme. DOJ can also take  civil enforcement actions on FTC\u2019s behalf.", "FCC and FTC each manage consumer complaint databases where  consumers can file complaints about unwanted calls, robocalls, and  violations of the Do Not Call Registry.", "In addition to government efforts, the telecommunications industry,  including voice service providers and third party companies, have taken  steps to counteract illegal spoofing. For example, some of these  companies have developed or deployed applications (i.e., software  programs, often referred to as apps) to defend against robocalls and  other unwanted calls. This includes call blocking devices for landline  telephones and various mobile applications that can label and block  robocalls and other unwanted calls based on call patterns, consumer  complaints or other means. While some carriers provide these services  free, others may charge a fee. In addition, some carriers also work with  analytics providers to analyze traffic on their networks. Beginning in 2017,  FCC authorized voice service providers to block certain categories of  unwanted calls before they reach consumers\u2019 phones. Recently, FCC  clarified that service providers can also, as a default, block calls identified  as likely unwanted based on the provider\u2019s reasonable analysis of call  data unless consumers opt out of this service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Caller ID Spoofing Is Used in a Variety of Financial Fraud and Other Schemes, and Consumer Complaints Suggest a Substantial Increase in Its Use", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Caller ID Spoofing Schemes Seek to Obtain Money or Valuable Financial and Personal Information, Generate Telemarketing Leads, or Harass", "paragraphs": ["Scammers use caller ID spoofing to facilitate a variety of financial fraud  and other schemes, often in combination with robocalling. Based on our  analysis of FCC, FTC, and DOJ enforcement cases and alerts from  federal and state government agencies, as well as interviews with  stakeholders, we identified three types of caller ID spoofing schemes.", "To Obtain Money or Information: Scammers have used caller ID  spoofing to trick consumers into providing their financial or personal  information or sending money such as via a debit or gift card. These  scammers may spoof a name and phone number that looks familiar  and trustworthy, such as that of a government agency, a company  you do business with, or local number. Scams include telling call  recipients they may be arrested or they owe money. For example,  spoofed robocalls have been used as part of a wide-reaching scam in  which callers spoofed IRS phone numbers and impersonated IRS  staff to trick people into sending the scammers money for supposed  unpaid taxes. IRS reported that from October 2013 through March  2019, the agency was contacted more than 2.4 million times by  taxpayers who reported such calls, and more than 15,453 taxpayers  reported losing about $75.1 million. (See fig. 2.)", "To Generate Telemarketing Leads: Unscrupulous telemarketers  have used spoofing as part of an attempt to sell goods or services. In  this scheme, consumers may receive a pre-recorded robocall with a  sales pitch and be instructed to \u201cpress 1\u201d to indicate interest, at which  point the call recipient is transferred to a live operator. In one such  scheme, more than 96-million spoofed robocalls were made over a 3- month period. These calls included pre-recorded messages falsely  claiming to be from Hilton and other well-known travel companies;  once consumers were transferred, live operators attempted to sell  vacations not affiliated with the brands presented during the  prerecorded message.", "To Harass: People have used spoofing to harass others. In some of  these cases, people have used spoofing to cause another person\u2019s  caller ID to display a familiar or trusted phone number. In one case,  an individual apparently placed 31 spoofed calls as part of a personal  campaign to harass and stalk another person. These spoofed  numbers appeared to be from the victim\u2019s child\u2019s school, among  others. Spoofing is also one of several techniques used to place false  calls to emergency response centers to elicit a police response to an  address where no emergency exists. Callers have used spoofing to  make it appear as if their call originated at or near the reported  address. This practice, known as swatting, has resulted in death. For  example, in one swatting case, a man was shot and killed by police  who believed he was holding others at the address hostage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Available Data Suggest That Caller ID Spoofing Is a Growing Issue", "paragraphs": ["FCC and FTC consumer complaint data both show dramatic increases in  recent years in the number of unwanted call complaints that specifically  mention the term spoofing. According to our analysis of FCC and FTC  complaint data, from 2015 through 2018, complaints to FCC that  specifically referred to spoofing more than doubled and those received by  FTC increased by more than four times. (See fig. 3).", "Several industry stakeholders we spoke with noted a growing trend in one  particular type of spoofing, neighbor spoofing. Neighbor spoofing occurs  when the caller ID is manipulated to display a phone number matching  the area code and prefix (the first six digits) of the consumer\u2019s phone  number. Consumers may be more inclined to answer these calls because  they appear to be local\u2014perhaps from someone they know. Among  FCC\u2019s complaints that included both the caller\u2019s and the call recipient\u2019s  phone numbers, the percentage that were indicative of 6-digit neighbor  spoofing increased from 10 percent in 2015 to 15 percent in 2018; for  similar FTC complaints, the percentage increased from 2 percent in 2015  to 16 percent in 2018; and a call blocking provider told us that its  percentage of neighbor-spoofed robocalls increased from 2 percent in  January 2016 to 23 percent in December 2018.", "One analytics provider told us there has been a shift recently from  spoofing the first six digits to spoofing the first four and five, which the  provider believed to be a reflection of scammers adjusting their methods  as more people become aware of the original six-digit form of neighbor  spoofing. From 2015 to 2018, FCC and FTC data show substantial  increases in complaints indicative of four and five digit neighbor spoofing,  with FCC complaints nearly doubling and FTC complaints increasing  more than 10 times during this time period.", "FCC and prior GAO work have described several limitations with using  complaint data as a means of measuring the extent of unwanted calls.  For example, complaints might increase following consumer outreach  regarding how to file a complaint or after news media coverage of a  particular scam. In addition, not all consumers who experience problems  file complaints, and not all complaints are necessarily legitimate or  categorized appropriately. Further, a consumer could submit a complaint  more than once, or to more than one agency, potentially resulting in  duplicate submissions. Finally, while some consumers may use the term  \u201cspoof\u201d when describing the complaint, others may not, either because  they do not know they have been spoofed or are not familiar with the  term. According to our analysis of FCC data, in 2018, 66 percent of all  complaints that were indicative of neighbor spoofing did not include the  term \u201cspoof\u201d in the complaint description. Nonetheless, FCC, FTC, and  DOJ officials told us they use this complaint data to identify specific  trends in types of scams that may help the agencies\u2019 enforcement and  public education efforts, which we discuss later in this report.", "Although we could not find industry data that estimated the total number  of spoofed calls, available industry data suggest that the volume of  unwanted calls and robocalls (of which illegally spoofed calls are a  subset) has increased over the past several years. Using call patterns on  their own networks or other means, voice service providers, call blocking  applications and analytics providers track data on unwanted calls and  robocalls. According to one company, these companies may have  limited ability to detect or isolate spoofed calls, in part, because  scammers may frequently change the numbers they use. In addition,  stakeholders told us, because each of these companies analyzes their  specific user base and may use different methods to identify and label  robocalls and other unwanted calls, the number of unwanted calls each  company estimated may be substantially different. For example, while  one analytics company estimated 26.3 billion robocalls nationwide in  2018, another company estimated the number at nearly 48 billion.  Similarly, one company estimated a 46 percent increase in robocalls from  2017 to 2018, while another estimated a 57 percent increase for the same  time period. Despite these differences, all analytics and call blocking  companies we interviewed reported that their estimates of the number of  unwanted calls and robocalls have increased in recent years.", "Because there is no comprehensive data source on unwanted calls,  robocalls, or spoofed calls, it is not possible to reliably estimate national  trends. FCC has taken steps to seek input from industry and other  stakeholders on how to better measure the extent of the unwanted call  and spoofing problem. In a November 2017 Further Notice of Proposed  Rulemaking, FCC sought comment on, among other things, what  information should be collected to evaluate the effectiveness of efforts to  combat these calls and whether FCC should adopt a reporting obligation  for providers. FCC received numerous comments from voice service  providers, their associations, and other stakeholders in response to this  notice. One commenter expressed concern that a reporting obligation  would be burdensome to providers or of little benefit to FCC, and other  commenters stated the agency should instead continue to monitor trends  in consumer complaints. More recently, in a June 2019 Declaratory  Ruling, FCC adopted a recommendation from 2017 to prepare two  reports\u2014one in 2020 and a second in 2021\u2014to measure the  effectiveness of efforts to combat illegal robocalls. The ruling explicitly  delegates authority to FCC staff to collect any and all relevant information  and data from voice service providers necessary to complete these  reports and states that the report should include authoritative data about  the number of illegal robocalls."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Consider Risk of Harm to Public and Generally Follow Key Collaboration Practices in Their Enforcement Efforts, but Face Significant Challenges Agencies Reported Taking Risk-Based Approach to Prioritizing Spoofing- Related Investigations and Enforcement Actions, but Collecting Evidence Can Be Difficult", "paragraphs": ["FCC, FTC, and DOJ officials all said that their agencies must prioritize  which illegal spoofing activity to investigate and take enforcement action  against because they do not have sufficient resources to pursue all such  activities. FCC and FTC officials stated that while they review complaint  data and other information, it would not be practical to open investigations  related to every complaint. According to officials at all three agencies,  given their limited resources, the agencies prioritize investigations based  on the level of harm being perpetrated and the likelihood of being able to  effectively bring an enforcement case. Such prioritization is consistent  with standards for internal control in the federal government. Those  standards call for agencies to estimate the significance of risks to  achieving agency objectives\u2014in this case objectives related to protecting  the public from harm\u2014and to use those estimates as a basis for  responding to the risks. More specifically:  In a 2015 letter to several members of Congress, the Chairman of the  FCC stated that the agency is more likely to pursue enforcement  action when a problem appears to be pervasive, represents a trend,  involves an agency priority, affects many consumers, reflects  particularly egregious abuse, or presents a security or safety  concern. Focusing specifically on investigations and enforcement  action related to caller ID spoofing, FCC officials told us that the  agency\u2019s three highest priorities are events that (1) threaten public  safety; (2) involve very large numbers of spoofed calls; or (3) involve  malicious scams or threats.", "FTC\u2019s strategic plan for fiscal years 2018 to 2022 calls for the agency  to target its enforcement efforts on those areas that cause the  greatest amount of consumer harm. In line with this objective, FTC  officials told us that the agency decides which consumer complaints to  investigate based on the level of harm being perpetrated, as well as  the likelihood of being able to effectively bring an enforcement case.", "DOJ\u2019s Justice Manual states that serious violations of federal law  must be prosecuted. DOJ officials told us that for fraud schemes  that employ caller ID spoofing, the agency is more likely to charge a  violation of one of the fraud statutes, such as mail fraud, wire fraud,  computer fraud, or conspiracy, as well as the money laundering and  identity theft statutes. Specifically with regard to wire and mail fraud  cases, the Justice Manual states that serious consideration should be  given to the prosecution of any scheme which in its nature is directed  to defrauding a class of persons or the general public with a  substantial pattern of conduct.", "FCC and FTC officials stated that there are significant challenges related  to investigating spoofing cases that can affect which investigations they  choose to pursue and limit the number of enforcement cases they are  able to bring. For example, FTC officials stated that the use of VoIP  technology enables fraudsters to easily change both their physical  locations and the numbers they spoof, making it harder for FTC and other  law enforcement agencies to track them down. An industry stakeholder  said that the use of VoIP technology makes it difficult to determine even  whether the call originated domestically or from overseas. Moreover, FCC  officials stated that when spoofed calls originate wholly from a foreign  jurisdiction, a lack of foreign cooperation can make it exceptionally difficult  to follow a trail back to either the service provider that originated the call  or the person or company making the calls. The officials explained that  foreign cooperation may be lacking when the calls come from countries  with which the United States does not have strong diplomatic  relationships. The officials stated that because of this challenge, they are  less likely to bring an enforcement case when calls originate wholly from  a foreign jurisdiction, due to the low likelihood of successfully resolving  such cases and the heightened use of limited staff resources required by  such cases.", "Regardless of these challenges, FCC and FTC officials stated that their  agencies have taken steps to improve their ability to investigate cases  based overseas. For example, both agencies cited their outreach to the  Indian government and the U.S.-India Business Council as well as their  participation in the Unsolicited Communications Enforcement Network, a  global network of law enforcement authorities and regulatory agencies  that works to combat unsolicited communications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCC, FTC, and DOJ Identified 62 Spoofing or Caller-ID-Blocking-Related Enforcement Cases Brought since 2006", "paragraphs": ["FCC, FTC, and DOJ officials identified 62 enforcement cases that they  said involved spoofing or blocking of caller ID information, though DOJ  officials stated that their list of enforcement cases was not comprehensive  because DOJ\u2019s enforcement database does not include an indicator for  whether spoofing was employed as part of a fraud scheme.

For example, one case involved a company that used spoofed  robocalls to target elderly and low-income individuals to generate  sales of health insurance coverage. The company\u2019s high numbers of  robocalls also disrupted an emergency medical paging service. FCC  issued fines in five of these cases, and one pending case includes a  proposed fine. FCC officials told us that since January 2004, the  agency has initiated approximately 20 additional enforcement cases  and has issued approximately 1,000 warnings, all for robocalling or  Do-Not-Call violations under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act  of 1991.", "FTC officials provided us information on 31 cases\u2014each of which the  officials said involved spoofing\u2014that FTC brought\u2014or that DOJ  brought on FTC\u2019s behalf\u2014from April 2006 to June 2019.

Monetary  judgments were issued in all but one of these cases. FTC officials told  us that as of November 2019 the agency had brought 147  enforcement cases against Do Not Call and robocall violators. FTC  officials also stated that FTC obtains injunctive relief in their Do Not  Call, robocall, and spoofing cases, including court orders prohibiting  the defendants from engaging in similar conduct, and in some cases,  banning defendants from any telemarketing activity. Further, they  stated the injunctive relief also includes reporting and compliance  requirements to help FTC monitor defendants. FTC officials told us  that the agency has obtained injunctive relief in all of its completed  spoofing cases and that these injunctions provide strong deterrence  and help stop illegal spoofing.", "DOJ officials provided us information on 25 cases\u2014each of which the  officials said involved spoofing\u2014that the agency brought from May  2010 to August 2018. Several of these cases involved companies or  individuals that used spoofing as part of a scheme to swindle money  from people. For example, in one case, defendants used spoofing as  part of a scheme to defraud and extort money from victims who were  falsely told they had failed to accept and pay for products they had  never ordered. Twenty cases had judgments that included prison  time; 18 cases had monetary judgements.", "FCC and FTC have collected far less than has been assessed in fines or  monetary judgements, but officials at both agencies stated that the  amounts they have collected still serve both punitive and deterrent  purposes. Specifically, FCC officials stated that thus far, FCC has  collected $25,970 of the approximately $205 million in fines it assessed.  This mostly represents full payment of a $25,000 fine FCC issued in  January 2017, but FCC has yet to collect any portion of the more recent  fines it has issued: a fine of $120 million it issued in May 2018 and a fine  of approximately $82 million it issued in September 2018. FCC has  referred both of these cases to DOJ for collection action. FCC officials  noted that these large fines may not represent the amount that the  defendants are able to pay, and that even payment of a fairly small  fraction of a large fine could be enough to put a scammer out of business  and serve as a substantial deterrent.", "FTC officials said that FTC has obtained a total of about $363 million in  monetary judgments in its 31 spoofing cases. The officials said that many  of these judgements were partially suspended based on the defendants\u2019  ability to pay determined by a defendant\u2019s net worth and assets. Further,  the officials said if the defendant misrepresents his or her financial  position, the entire judgment can become due under a clause that is part  of the judgement. The officials said that as of August 14, 2019, FTC had  collected about $31 million in its spoofing cases, and that this amount  represents all or substantially all of the unsuspended judgments in those  cases.", "Officials with DOJ\u2019s Consumer Protection Branch said that the branch  views monetary judgments as one piece of the deterrence equation for  caller-ID-spoofing offenses.

FTC further  testified that it would like this provision removed so that the agency  could take enforcement action against carriers engaged in illegal  telemarketing activities.", "In 2018, an FCC official publicly stated that a longer statute of  limitations for enforcement of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act  of 1991 would improve the agency\u2019s enforcement efforts against  knowing and willful violators of the act. Currently, that act has a 1-year  statute of limitations, while the Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009 has a  2-year statute of limitations. FCC officials told us that harmonizing  the two acts\u2019 statutes of limitations to 2 years would help FCC\u2019s  enforcement efforts since spoofing often occurs with robocalling and  the agency often uses the two statutes in tandem.", "A February 2019 FCC staff report on robocalls notes that FCC\u2019s  enforcement efforts can be hindered by the requirement that in many  instances FCC must warn a party of apparent robocalling violations  and can only proceed with a monetary penalty if the party  subsequently commits the same type of violation, a requirement in  the Communications Act that applies to the Telephone Consumer  Protection Act of 1991. According to the report, this requirement  enables a warned offender to incorporate under a new name to evade  further detection and begin illegal activity anew. In contrast, the report  notes, the Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009 allows FCC to directly issue a  proposed monetary penalty without first issuing a warning. Similar to  the statutes of limitations just discussed, FCC officials told us that  since spoofing often occurs with robocalling and the agency often  uses the two statutes in tandem, their enforcement efforts would  benefit from the elimination of this statutory requirement.", "In 2019, bills were introduced in Congress that, if passed, would  implement the changes in law that FCC and FTC have recommended and  could potentially help address other challenges faced by FCC and FTC.  For example, in July 2019, a bill was introduced in the Senate that would  remove the provision prohibiting FTC from taking action against common  carriers. Also in 2019, two different bills were introduced, one in the  House and one in the Senate, that would, among other things, address  issues with harmonization of the FCC statute of limitations and eliminate  the FCC pre-penalty warning requirement with respect to illegal  robocalling. In addition, one of these bills, the Telephone Robocall  Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act (TRACED Act), would  require DOJ, in consultation with FCC, to assemble an interagency  working group to study and report to Congress on how to enhance  enforcement against robocalls by examining issues like the types of laws,  policies, or constraints that could be inhibiting enforcement of the Truth in  Caller ID Act of 2009. The interagency working group would also be  tasked with identifying existing and potential international policies and  programs that could encourage and improve coordination between  countries. We have reported in past work that collaborative mechanisms  such as interagency working groups can help the federal government  achieve many of the meaningful results it seeks to achieve, and that such  mechanisms all benefit from certain key features, which raise issues to  consider when implementing these mechanisms.

FCC and FTC officials explained that their close  collaboration helps ensure that they share relevant information and avoid  duplicating efforts. In addition, we found that DOJ\u2019s collaboration with  FCC and FTC aligns with five of the seven key practices. Although we did  not find evidence that DOJ had taken steps in line with the other two key  practices, officials at all three agencies stated that DOJ\u2019s collaborative  efforts were appropriate given its broader jurisdiction and wider focus.", "More specifically, we found that all three agencies have incorporated five  key practices. Our prior work has found that one way agencies can  incorporate three of these practices \u2014 (1) defining and articulating a  common outcome, (2) establishing mutually reinforcing or joint strategies,  and (3) agreeing on roles and responsibilities\u2014is through a memorandum  of understanding. In 2003, FCC and FTC agreed to a memorandum of  understanding that calls for the agencies to cooperate and coordinate to  implement consistent, comprehensive, efficient, and non-redundant  enforcement of federal telemarketing statutes and rules. The  memorandum also calls for the agencies to meet quarterly to discuss  matters of mutual interest, share consumer complaints, and engage in  joint enforcement actions when necessary. Consistent with the  memorandum, FTC officials told us that FTC and FCC hold quarterly  meetings to discuss how they are targeting robocalls and spoofing investigations and enforcement cases to avoid duplication. FTC and FCC  officials stated that in addition, their collaboration with DOJ is enhanced  through the participation of all three agencies in a monthly conference call  hosted by the National Association of Attorneys General to coordinate  efforts to combat illegal robocalls across the government.", "Although DOJ officials told us that DOJ does not have a memorandum of  understanding with FCC or FTC regarding spoofing or robocall-related  enforcement, officials we interviewed at all three agencies identified  collaborative efforts that DOJ engages in that are consistent with the  three key practices cited above. FCC and DOJ officials stated they are  developing procedures to share information on a particular enforcement  case, and that these procedures could be used on other cases as needed  in the future. In addition, officials from all three agencies stated that  DOJ\u2019s participation in the monthly conference calls and additional  informal outreach as needed was sufficient to ensure effective  collaboration.", "With regard to the fourth and fifth key practices (4) identifying and  addressing needs by leveraging resources, and (5) establishing  compatible policies, procedures, and other means to operate across  agency boundaries, FCC and FTC officials described regularly sharing  information from their complaint databases, which is in line with these  practices. FTC officials stated they regularly review FCC\u2019s complaint  information to help their enforcement efforts. Moreover, FTC has  established policies and procedures whereby DOJ and FCC and other  law enforcement entities have access to FTC\u2019s complaint database, and  FCC and DOJ officials stated that they frequently analyze FTC\u2019s  complaint database to inform their investigative decisions. Furthermore,  DOJ officials stated that DOJ recently contributed funds to FTC to  enhance capabilities to analyze the database. FCC and FTC have also  leveraged resources by co-hosting a public event in 2018 on reducing  robocalls and spoofing that included discussions of recent policy changes  and enforcement actions to stop illegal robocalls.", "We found that FCC and FTC follow two additional key practices for  collaborating on spoofing-related investigations and enforcement actions  that DOJ does not: (1) developing mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and  report the results of collaborative efforts, and (2) reinforcing agency  accountability for collaborative efforts through agency plans and reports.  For example, FCC and FTC collaborated on a robocall report published  by FCC in 2019 that discussed both agencies\u2019 enforcement actions  related to robocalls and spoofing, and each discussed their collaborative  efforts related to robocalls in key agency documents related to  accountability and performance. DOJ officials stated that they would be  unlikely to have such materials specifically related to spoofing given the  agency\u2019s focus on fraud itself rather than spoofing or robocalling, which it  views as a means to fraud. DOJ officials stated that DOJ\u2019s general  commitment to interagency collaboration is emphasized in its fiscal year  2020 budget submission to Congress and many press releases related to  its enforcement cases.

According to FCC documentation, the agency has made combatting  illegal robocalls and caller ID spoofing its top consumer protection priority  and uses consumer education as a means to address this priority.  Similarly, according to FTC\u2019s chairman, consumer education is a critical  element of FTC\u2019s efforts to fulfill its consumer protection mission. The  methods that FCC and FTC use\u2014both independently and  collaboratively\u2014to educate consumers on ways to combat caller ID  spoofing and unwanted calls include the following.", "Posting online consumer alerts, videos, blog posts, and other  informative materials: Both FTC and FCC post information and  warnings about caller ID spoofing scams on their websites. FTC, for  example, developed Pass It On, a print- and web-based campaign to  educate seniors about various types of scams that target seniors,  including spoofing. FCC launched an animated video initiative on how  to avoid spoofing scams and also posted a consumer alert about  neighbor spoofing scams. The alert explains that scammers use such  spoofing to increase the likelihood that consumers pick up the phone  and provides tips such as to not answer calls from unknown numbers  and to not provide any personal information to such callers.  Additionally, FCC and FTC post other information, including tip cards  and graphics such as those illustrated in figure 4.", "Visiting vulnerable communities: FCC has conducted speaking  tours, such as tours through rural Appalachia and the Pacific  Northwest in 2018 to educate communities about spoofing, and to  build partnerships to help improve the effectiveness of future outreach  efforts. Similarly, FTC has hosted briefings in underserved  communities with law enforcement, consumers, and community  advocates to place more attention on consumer protection issues  such as spoofing and other types of fraud.", "We found that FCC\u2019s and FTC\u2019s consumer education efforts related to  spoofing and other unwanted calls aligned with nine key practices for  consumer education that we identified in our prior work (see table 1).  For example, FCC and FTC have developed consistent and clear  consumer education messages related to spoofing and unwanted calls:  specifically, consumers:  should not answer unknown calls;  should not push any numbers if directed to do so; and  should hang up immediately once it is clear that the caller is unknown.", "In addition, FCC and FTC officials have worked with credible messengers  to help disseminate consumer education messages, including to  potentially vulnerable populations. For example, since 2017, FCC has  worked with the National Asian American Coalition to train grassroots  volunteers to engage local community members and distribute  educational tip cards printed by FCC in languages such as Mandarin  Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Tagalog. In addition, FTC has  collaborated with AARP to develop three videos for Asian American and  Pacific Islander communities on robocall, IRS, and Medicare scams.", "In addition, we found that, similar to their enforcement efforts, FTC and  FCC\u2019s efforts to collaborate on public education in this area are consistent  with the seven key collaboration practices we discussed earlier in this  report. For example, FCC and FTC agreed to a second memorandum of  understanding in 2015 that states that the agencies will collaborate with  each other on consumer and industry outreach and education efforts, as  appropriate. FCC and FTC also collaborate with other entities, including  federal, local, and private entities, to educate consumers on ways to  combat spoofing. For example, FCC officials told us that beginning in  October 2018, they collaborated with Department of Veterans Affairs  officials to send out three joint emails (from November 2018 through  March 2019) to veterans and veterans\u2019 organizations on ways to protect  themselves against illegal robocalls, including spoofed calls.

As  discussed previously, the system is commonly referred to as  STIR/SHAKEN or SHAKEN/STIR. According to the Alliance for  Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS), which spearheaded this  industry-led effort along with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Forum,  the system is intended to enable voice service providers to verify that a  caller has a right to use the caller ID transmitted with the call. Under the  system, the voice service provider that first initiates the call onto the  network (originating service provider) generates a digital signature that  attaches to the phone call indicating that the caller has this right. This  occurs only when the originating provider knows this information and is  considered the highest level of verification, referred to by the industry as  \u201cattestation.\u201d The signature is transmitted along with the call as it is  routed from one service provider to another. The terminating service  provider, which passes the call onto the call recipient, can verify that the  signature was not tampered with before sending the call to the call  recipient (see fig. 5).", "According to an FCC Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, as of June 2019,  several major providers had deployed or were in the process of deploying  the system on their own networks, and a few had started exchanging  signed calls with a second provider. In addition, ATIS has announced a  number of key steps taken to fully implement the system\u2019s framework. For  example, in September 2018, ATIS launched the system\u2019s governance  authority, whose board consists of representatives from a variety of U.S.  voice service providers and relevant industry associations, and which,  according to ATIS, is overseeing the system to ensure that it is effective  and secure. In August 2019, ATIS issued a press release stating that the  governance authority board had determined the requirements service  providers must meet in order to get certificates to digitally sign calls and  had contracted a private firm tasked with ensuring that only authorized  service providers get these certificates. According to an industry official  who worked on this effort, once most U.S. carriers deploy the system and  are sharing information across their networks, the technical experts who  developed the standards will be able to see how it works and improve and  enhance the system through additional technical developments.", "Because it is not always possible for the originating service provider to  determine whether the caller has a right to use the phone number that will  be displayed, in addition to the top level of verification, the system was  designed with a middle level and a lowest level of verification. The  originating service provider digitally signs the call with the middle level of  attestation when the provider has an established relationship with the  caller but does not know whether the caller has the right to use the phone  number it will display. According to ATIS officials, the originating service  provider may use this level of attestation, for example, when a call comes  from a corporate call center, which displays all outbound calls as  originating from a central number or set of numbers. The originating  service provider signs the call with the lowest level of attestation when it  is responsible for originating the call onto its network but it does not have  a relationship with the caller (such as when the call comes in from  another country). When using either the middle or lowest level of  attestation, the provider cannot determine if the call is spoofed. However,  according to ATIS officials, the information that provided the basis for the  attestation level is still likely to be helpful. For example, this information  may better position the terminating service provider or call blocking and  analytics apps to determine, in combination with other data the  terminating service provider or such apps may have analyzed, whether to  block or warn the consumer about the call.", "According to officials from several carrier associations or voice service  providers, the new system should substantially improve the industry\u2019s  ability to combat spoofing and block unwanted calls by providing carriers  with immediate verification information. These stakeholders, as well as  FCC officials, also stated that enabling voice service providers to instantly  identify the provider that initiated the call onto the network\u2014through the  digital signature attached to the call\u2014 could help facilitate federal  investigations by accomplishing in an instant what can now take  significant time and effort as the call must be traced back from provider to  provider. One stakeholder who played a key role in the development of  the system stated that as some U.S. service providers deploy this system  and more calls are able to be verified, it is likely to incentivize other U.S.  providers to deploy verification systems so that their calls will not stand  out as unverified. This stakeholder said that the hope is that other  countries, including those with many legitimate call centers that send calls  to the United States, such as India, will also implement verification  systems that eventually can be integrated with the U.S. system. And as  more calls are able to be verified, the stakeholder explained that the  system will become more valuable and useful.", "An ATIS representative and other stakeholders identified other examples  of ongoing technical challenges and open issues:  Information provided to consumers: The industry has not reached  agreement about what, if any, information should be presented to call  recipients to inform them that the call has or has not been verified.  Stakeholders we spoke with noted that it is important to educate  consumers on the limitations of any such information. For example,  although a call may be verified, the provider cannot guarantee that the  caller is not trying to defraud the call recipient\u2014just that the caller is  not using a spoofed phone number to do so. Further, if a provider is  unable to verify the caller ID information, it does not necessarily mean  the call is fraudulent or the caller has malicious intent. For these  reasons, several industry stakeholders we spoke with emphasized  that the information provided by this system can be most useful when  combined with other methods service providers use to analyze call  traffic to identify unwanted or illegal calls.", "IP-only system: Several stakeholders also emphasized that the  system only works for calls carried entirely over IP networks, not  those using traditional wireline networks. One industry group  representing smaller providers that may use traditional wireline  networks expressed concerns that its members may need more time  to deploy the caller ID verification system because of the resources  needed to transition to an IP network. This issue was discussed by  industry stakeholders at FCC\u2019s July 2019 summit on the caller ID  verification system. One industry stakeholder stated that when calls  that begin on a traditional wireline network are uploaded to an IP  network, the originating service provider on that IP network will sign  the call with the lowest level of verification, and that that information,  in combination with analytics, will help providers to know whether  these calls can be trusted.", "Verification of certain calls: As of June 2019, ATIS and industry  stakeholders were also working to determine how to ensure that calls  from 911 operators or video relay service calls for deaf and hard of  hearing users are not blocked if providers are unable to verify the  caller is authorized to use the phone number."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FCC Has Actively Encouraged Deployment of the Caller ID Verification System and Been Engaged with Its Development", "paragraphs": ["Since 2013, FCC has taken several steps to encourage the industry\u2019s  caller ID verification initiative.
