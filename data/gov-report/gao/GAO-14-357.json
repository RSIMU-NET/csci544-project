Specifically, TSA does not collect or analyze available data on drills using improvised explosive devices (IED) at the checkpoint that could provide insight into how well screening officers (SO) resolve anomalies, including objects that could pose a threat to an aircraft, identified by AIT systems, because it does not enforce compliance with its operational directive. TSA's operational directive requires personnel at airports to conduct drills to assess SO compliance with TSA's screening standard operating procedures and to train SOs to better resolve anomalies identified by AIT-ATR systems. GAO found that TSA personnel at about half of airports with AIT systems did not report any IED checkpoint drill results on those systems from March 2011 through February 2013. According to TSA, it does not ensure compliance with the directive at every airport because it is unclear which office should oversee enforcing the directive. Without data on IED checkpoint drills, TSA lacks insight into how well SOs resolve anomalies detected by AIT systems, information that could be used to help strengthen existing screening processes. Potential weaknesses in the screening process could be caused by TSA not clarifying which office is responsible for overseeing TSA's operational directive, directing that office to ensure enforcement of the directive in conducting these drills, and analyzing the data. Further, when determining AIT-ATR system effectiveness, TSA uses laboratory test results that do not reflect the combined performance of the technology, the personnel who operate it, and the process that governs AIT-related security operations. TSA officials agreed that it is important to analyze performance by including an evaluation of the technology, operators, and processes and stated that TSA is planning to assess the performance of all layers of security. By not measuring system effectiveness based on the performance of the technology and SOs who operate the technology or taking into account current processes and deployment strategies, DHS and TSA are not ensuring that future procurements meet mission needs.", "TSA completed the installation of ATR software upgrades intended to address privacy concerns for all deployed AIT systems; however, it has not met proposed milestones for enhancing capabilities as documented in its AIT roadmap\u2014a document that contains milestones for achieving enhanced capabilities to meet the agency's mission needs. For example, TSA began operational test and evaluation for Tier II upgrades 17 months after the expected start date. Moreover, TSA did not use available scientific research or information from experts from the national laboratories or vendors on the technological challenges that it faces in developing requirements and milestones, because, according to TSA, it relied on time frames proposed by vendors. Thus, TSA cannot ensure that its roadmap reflects the true capabilities of the next generation of AIT systems by using scientific evidence and information from DHS's Science and Technology Directorate, the national laboratories, and vendors to develop a realistic schedule with achievable milestones that outlines the technological advancements, estimated time, and resources needed to achieve enhanced capabilities as outlined in TSA's roadmap."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that TSA, among other things, clarify which office should oversee its operational directive, better measure system effectiveness, and develop a realistic schedule before procuring future generations.

Instead, TSA used laboratory tests that  did not factor in performance of the entire system that includes  technology, people, and processes. However, AIT-ATR system  effectiveness relies on both the technology\u2019s capability to identify threat  items and its operators to resolve those threat items. Given that TSA is  seeking to procure AIT-2 systems, DHS and TSA will be hampered in  their ability to ensure that future procurements meet mission needs and  perform as intended at airports without measuring system effectiveness  based on the performance of the AIT-2 technology and SOs who operate  the technology, while taking into account current processes and  deployment strategies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "TSA Has Enhanced Passenger Privacy, but Could Take Additional Steps to Enhance AIT Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["TSA has enhanced passenger privacy by completing the installation of  ATR software upgrades for all deployed AIT systems but could do more  to provide enhanced AIT capabilities to meet the agency\u2019s mission needs.

For example, the February 2012 AIT roadmap estimated that TSA  would complete installation of Tier II ATR software upgrades for currently  deployed AIT systems by December 2012. TSA\u2019s updated October 2012  AIT roadmap revised this date to March 2013. According to TSA testing  documentation, during operational testing conducted from May through  June 2012 at an airport test site, the AIT-ATR Tier II system  demonstrated limitations due to noncompliance with certain requirements.", "Accordingly, TSA decided not to pursue fielding of the Tier II system  based on particular deficiencies identified during operational testing. The  vendor of this system submitted a new version of the AIT-ATR system for  laboratory testing to TSL. In September 2013, the new version had  passed laboratory testing and was undergoing operational test and  evaluation. As shown in figure 2, TSA began operational test and  evaluation for Tier II upgrades 17 months after the expected start date  articulated in its October 2012 roadmap. According to TSA, it completed  operational test and evaluation in January 2014. According to the  timeframes in TSA\u2019s revised roadmap, it would take an additional 7  months from January 2014 to complete Tier II upgrades. However, TSA  had estimated that it would provide Tier III capabilities by the end of fiscal  year 2014.", "Although TSA experienced challenges and schedule slippages related to  meeting Tier II requirements for the currently deployed AIT systems, in  September 2012, TSA made contract awards to purchase and test the  next generation of AIT systems (referred to as AIT-2) from three  vendors. These systems are required to be equipped with ATR software  and must be capable of meeting enhanced requirements (qualified at  least at the Tier II level), among other things. The updated October 2012  roadmap contained milestones for testing and acquiring AIT-2 systems,  which TSA has not met. Specifically, TSA is about 9 months behind  schedule for AIT-2 testing and procurement, as depicted in figure 3. For  example, the roadmap indicated that TSA would begin qualification  testing and evaluation for AIT-2 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2013,  would complete that testing by January 2013, and would complete  deployment by March 2014. However, TSA did not initiate qualification  testing until July 2013 (about 9 months behind schedule) because all  three vendors had difficulty providing qualification data packages verifying  that the vendors had met contractual requirements and the systems were  ready to begin testing. Accordingly, as of March 2014, TSA is not on track  to meet the March 2014 deployment milestone and these efforts have not  resulted in enhancing AIT capabilities because currently deployed AIT- ATR systems are qualified at the same Tier I level as the systems  originally deployed in 2009.", "We have reported in the past few years that although AIT systems and  the associated software have been in development for over two decades,  TSA has faced challenges in developing and meeting program  requirements in some of its aviation security programs, including AIT.  Best practices for acquisition programs state that when key technologies  are immature at the start of development, programs are at higher risk of  being unable to deliver on schedule. As we concluded in January 2012,  at the start of AIT development, TSA did not fully adhere to DHS  acquisition guidance, and procured AIT systems without meeting all key  requirements. According to best practices on major acquisitions, realistic  program baselines with stable requirements for cost, schedule, and  performance are important to delivering capabilities within schedule and  cost estimates.", "In its AIT roadmap, TSA describes the time frames as notional and  explains that establishing definitive timelines for reaching defined,  additional tiers is difficult to achieve because of intricate dependencies  that are outside of the program\u2019s control and may vary by manufacturer.  However, TSA officials stated that they did not use available scientific  research or evidence to help assess how long it would take to develop  enhanced capabilities. In setting these time frames, TSA officials told us  that TSA did not seek input from national laboratories that have  conducted technology assessments and explosives research on behalf of  DHS\u2019s Science and Technology Directorate nor did it evaluate vendor  data to determine the capabilities of the technology. According to experts  we interviewed from Sandia National Laboratories, to accurately  determine realistic time frames in which vendors would be able to provide  enhanced capabilities, it would require an evaluation of proprietary vendor  data to understand how well the technology can meet requirements at a  specific tier level. Rather, according to TSA officials, since TSA did not  have access to proprietary data, it relied on notional time frames  proposed by the AIT vendors, which comprised estimates for when the  vendors expected to be able to develop and deliver AIT systems that  would meet TSA\u2019s requirements.", "TSA\u2019s October 2012 AIT roadmap contains one key element of a  technology roadmap\u2014estimated time frames for achieving each  milestone\u2014and does not describe steps or activities needed to achieve  each milestone. Moreover, in April 2012, the vendor for currently  deployed AIT systems provided TSA with a detailed plan for delivering a  system that could meet Tier III requirements that contained proposed  milestones and time frames for achieving each milestone. Although TSA  relied on discussions with this vendor to estimate roadmap time frames,  the agency did not incorporate details from the vendor\u2019s plan into its  roadmap. According to a representative from this vendor, TSA did not  consult with the vendor regarding the risks and limitations of its proposed  time frames, including how long it might take to develop various hardware  or software modifications, nor did it provide feedback to the vendor after  the proposal was submitted. The vendor\u2019s April 2012 plan states that after  the Tier II system has met TSA\u2019s requirements, it would take the vendor  several years to develop and deliver a Tier III system for TSA to test,  followed by an operational test and evaluation system validation phase  that would take several months. In addition, according to experts we  interviewed from the national laboratories that contributed to the  development of imaging technology, the milestones contained in TSA\u2019s  October 2012 roadmap are not achievable because it did not reflect the  time needed to make sufficient improvements to the technology to ensure  that it would be able to meet additional tier levels. TSA did not incorporate  available information from the national laboratories and vendors into its  updated roadmap. As a result, the roadmap underestimated the length of  time it would take to develop and deploy AIT-ATR Tier III systems.discussed later in this report, moving forward, it will be important for TSA  to incorporate scientific evidence and information from DHS\u2019s Science  and Technology Directorate, and the national laboratories, as well as  nonproprietary information and data provided by vendors into the next  revision of its AIT roadmap to ensure that the time frames for achieving  future goals and milestones are realistic and achievable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Faces Technological Challenges in Meeting Future Goals and Milestones", "paragraphs": ["Consistent with the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as amended, the  DHS Science and Technology Directorate has responsibility for  coordinating and integrating the research, development, demonstration,  testing, and evaluation activities of the department, as well as for working  with private sector stakeholders to develop innovative approaches to  produce and deploy the best available technologies for homeland security  missions. Moreover, we have previously identified key practices that can  help sustain agency collaboration and concluded that collaborating  agencies can look for opportunities to address resource needs by  leveraging each others\u2019 resources, thus obtaining additional benefits that  would not be available if they were working separately.

They  explained that they plan to collaborate with DHS Science and Technology  Directorate to determine milestones for the new roadmap that will be  based on a scientific analysis of technology capabilities as well as  ongoing research and development efforts. TSA officials stated that they  plan to update the AIT roadmap using this new approach and expect the  AIT roadmap to be completed by September 30, 2014. A group of experts  moderated by GAO in June 2013 stated that DHS must have personnel  with technical expertise in ATR software for AIT systems and  development who are engaged throughout the developmental process to  ensure that vendors are providing improved capabilities over time.

While there  are various approaches that vendors could take to make needed  improvements to the technology, including hardware modifications,  software developments, or incorporating new imaging techniques to  provide enhanced capabilities, these approaches could take years to  develop, and would require significant investment of resources. Moreover,  according to scientists that we interviewed from the national laboratories,  there are several ways to improve ATR software algorithms to enhance  system capabilities; however, there is little market incentive for existing  vendors to invest in making these improvements or for new vendors to  enter the relatively small airport checkpoint market, since one vendor has  already met TSA\u2019s current requirements. Further, 2 of the 12 experts  identified by the National Academy of Sciences with whom we spoke  stated that establishing clear requirements would incentivize vendors to  improve performance over time. Thus, according to these experts, it is  unlikely that vendors will invest in making the needed improvements to  meet TSA\u2019s mission needs.", "According to a representative from the vendor of currently deployed AIT  systems, moving from Tier II to Tier III presents new technological  challenges because meeting additional tiers will require the development  of more targeted algorithms. Accordingly, to develop these new  algorithms, vendors would have to build new data sets, conduct research,  and invest additional resources before accurately determining realistic  time frames for meeting Tier III and Tier IV requirements. Therefore,  given the current state of the technology as well as the amount of  research that has to be conducted on developing algorithms that can  meet Tier III and Tier IV requirements, neither TSA nor the AIT vendors  can reliably predict how long it will take to meet Tier IV requirements.", "Because TSA revised its requirements over time, scientists from the  national laboratories noted that vendors have little incentive to meet  additional tier levels since they are meeting TSA\u2019s current requirements.  In addition, TSA has not obtained the necessary information to accurately  understand the future state of the technology. Thus, the agency has little  assurance that vendors will provide AIT-ATR systems that meet Tier IV  requirements within TSA\u2019s estimated time frames.

For example, TSA does not enforce compliance with its  operational directive that requires each airport to conduct IED checkpoint  drills each week, nor does it collect or use IED checkpoint drill data on SO  performance. Additionally, TSA is not analyzing available data on the  number of secondary screening pat-downs that SOs conduct when the  system indicates that it has detected an anomaly, which could provide  insight into the number of false alarms that occur in the field and the  extent to which these alarms affect operational costs. TSA could improve  the overall performance of the AIT system and better inform its decision- making process related to checkpoint screening by clarifying which office  is responsible for overseeing TSA\u2019s operational directive, directing that  office to enforce compliance with the directive, and analyzing the IED  checkpoint data to identify any potential weaknesses in the airport  screening process, and also establishing protocols that facilitate capturing  operational data on passengers at the checkpoint to determine the extent  to which AIT-ATR system false alarm rates affect operational costs.", "Although AIT systems and the associated software have been in  development for over two decades, TSA has not used available  information from the scientific community and vendors to understand the  technological advancements that need to be made and determine the  time frames in which AIT systems will meet Tier IV requirements.

Specifically,  In response to the recommendation that TSA clarify which office is  responsible for overseeing TSA\u2019s Improvised Explosive Device  Screening Checkpoint Drills operational directive, instruct the  responsible office to enforce the directive, and analyze the drill data to  identify any potential weaknesses in the screening process, DHS  stated that TSA\u2019s Office of Security Operations will initiate a review of  programs that contribute to assessing screening performance with  consideration of the findings identified in our report. TSA anticipates  that it will complete this review by the end of fiscal year 2014, and by  TSA also stated that by September 30, 2014, the operations directive  will be amended to assign responsibility to one office.

Once implemented, the new reporting  mechanism will address our recommendation, provided that it  captures sufficient information to determine the extent to which AIT- ATR system false alarm rates affect operational costs.", "In response to the recommendation that TSA measure system  effectiveness based on the performance of the AIT-2 technology and  screening officers who operate the technology, while taking into  account current processes and deployment strategies before  procuring AIT-2 systems, DHS stated that TSA considers several  factors when measuring system effectiveness, including documented  deployment strategies, airport needs and conditions such as height  and checkpoint space, TSA security operations processes and  procedures, feedback from transportation security officers who  operate the AIT-ATR systems, as well as concept of operations and  formal operational and functional requirements documents. Further,  DHS stated that TSA\u2019s testing process enables TSA to determine if  technologies meet required standards and are feasible for use in the  airport environment, and that the system evaluation report for AIT-2\u2014 which will document system effectiveness using information from the  laboratory and operational test reports\u2014will state whether or not the  next-generation AIT system has an acceptable operationally effective  and suitable rating for use within an airport environment. While these  are beneficial practices, we believe that it would be preferable for TSA  to measure the AIT-2 system\u2019s overall probability of detection by  including an evaluation of screening officer performance at resolving  alarms detected by the technology in its assessment, as we  recommended, since AIT system effectiveness relies on both the  technology\u2019s capability to detect items and screening officers ability to  correctly resolve alarms. In addition, DHS stated that TSA is currently  implementing the Transportation Security Capability Analysis Process,  which will be used to better understand TSA\u2019s requirements and  better articulate those requirements and needs for acquisition and  requirements documentation. This is an important first step toward  addressing our recommendation, provided that TSA uses this process  to determine the overall effectiveness of its system based on the  performance of the AIT-2 technology as well as the screening officers  who operate the technology and not solely on the capabilities of  current AIT technology as has been done in the past.", "In response to the recommendation that TSA use scientific evidence  and information from DHS\u2019s Science and Technology Directorate, and  the national laboratories, as well as information and data provided by  vendors to develop a realistic schedule with achievable milestones  that outline the technological advancements, estimated time, and  resources needed to achieve TSA\u2019s Tier IV end state, DHS stated that  TSA has initiated an effort to complete a more comprehensive  technology roadmap that forecasts technology progression through  detection tiers, estimates cost to mature the technology, and includes  a timeline with supporting narrative.

For example, we found that 32  of 486 AIT systems had been used less than 5 percent of the days since  their deployment, and that 112 of 486 AIT systems had been used on less  than 30 percent of the days since their deployment. Further, we observed  that at 5 of the 12 airports we visited, AIT systems were deployed but  were not regularly used. For example, at 1 airport we observed that TSA  had deployed 3 AIT systems in an area that typically handles  approximately 230 passengers. TSA officials informed us at the time that  2 of the AIT systems were seldom used because of the lack of  passengers and mentioned that they believed the AIT systems were  deployed based on the availability of space. In addition, we observed  instances in which AIT systems were not being used because of  maintenance problems that affected how often the deployed AIT system  screened passengers. We concluded, on the basis of our observations on  AIT utilization, that there were concerns about how effectively deployed  AIT systems were being used. Accordingly, we recommended that TSA  evaluate the utilization of currently deployed AIT systems and potentially  redeploy AIT systems based on utilization data, so that those systems not  being extensively used could provide enhanced security benefits at  airports. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agreed, and TSA  has taken steps to address our recommendation but has not fully  addressed the intent of our recommendation.

TSA officials we spoke with  in October 2012 stated that they revised TSA\u2019s metric for measuring  utilization based on our January 2012 report to more accurately reflect the  amount of time AIT systems were being used. According to TSA\u2019s field  guide issued in March 2012, TSA measures AIT utilization as the  percentage of passengers that are screened by AIT systems. To track  AIT utilization based on this metric, TSA developed specific targets to  meet that are based on passenger throughput and hours that AIT  systems are in operation at an airport.", "However, the target TSA establishes for an airport is reduced to account  for AIT systems that are not operational because of maintenance  problems or that are not being used because of lane closures, staffing  restrictions, or low passenger volume. Accordingly, the methodology  employed by TSA to measure AIT utilization does not accurately measure  the extent to which AIT systems are being used since the metric tracks  AIT system utilization only when they are being used. Furthermore, to  calculate airport targets and track AIT utilization, TSA relies on data  submitted by airports into its centralized information management system.  However, in September 2013, the DHS Office of Inspector General (DHS  OIG) reported that TSA did not have adequate internal controls to ensure  accurate data on AIT utilization. Specifically, the OIG found that TSA\u2019s  utilization data were unreliable because (1) AIT throughput data recorded  in its centralized information management system were different from  data in the source document, (2) AIT throughput data on the source  document were not recorded in its centralized information management  system, (3) the starting AIT count was different from the previous day\u2019s  ending AIT count, and (4) AIT throughput source documentation was  missing. Further, since airports record and enter AIT throughput in its  centralized information management system manually, this may lead to  inaccurate recording of information and does not provide an audit trail to  validate data accuracy.
