To assess the extent to which the Navy has the knowledge  about resources it needs to develop the UCLASS system, we applied  best practice standards developed by GAO for using key product  knowledge to support program investment decisions, and identified and  reviewed relevant legislation such as the Weapon Systems Acquisition  Reform Act of 2009. We reviewed Department of Defense (DOD)  acquisition policy including DOD Instruction 5000.02 and recent Better  Buying Power memorandums. We analyzed requirements documents  including the initial capabilities document, the draft capability  development document, and relevant Joint Requirements Oversight  Council (JROC) memorandums. We analyzed carrier availability  schedules to identify potential testing schedule challenges.

The Navy analyzed the potential of several  alternative systems to provide these capabilities. In 2012 the JROC\u2014the  requirements validation authority for major defense acquisition  programs\u2014issued a memorandum providing direction and guidance for  the Navy to focus its efforts on delivering a timely, affordable system to  meet the sea-based surveillance requirements. At that time the systems  that would be needed to operate in a highly contested environment were  deemed unaffordable. As a result, the Navy updated its analysis of  alternatives to include more affordable and feasible systems. Navy  leadership approved a draft set of requirements in April 2013 that  emphasized affordability, timely fielding, and endurance, while  deemphasizing the need to operate in highly contested environments.  DOD policy provides that the JROC, as the validation authority for major  defense acquisition programs, will validate the requirements document\u2014 known as the capability development document\u2014prior to releasing  requests for proposals for development contracts and the decision review  that initiates a system development program, known as a Milestone B  review. The JROC has not yet validated these requirements.", "In September 2013, we found that the Navy had taken some positive  steps to scale back requirements to match available resources. Our  primary concern at the time was that the program planned to develop,  manufacture and field operational UCLASS systems before holding a  Milestone B review, which would defer key oversight mechanisms, such  as the establishment of an acquisition program baseline, for these  program activities until after they were over. Without a baseline and  regular reporting on progress, it would be difficult for Congress to hold the  Navy accountable for achieving cost, schedule, and performance goals.  As a result, we recommended that the Navy hold a Milestone B review  sooner than its then-scheduled fiscal year 2020 date in order to provide  for increased oversight and accountability. At the time, the Navy  disagreed, believing that its approved strategy was compliant with  acquisition regulations and laws. Congress subsequently placed  limitations on the number of UCLASS air vehicles that DOD could acquire  prior to receiving Milestone B approval.acquisition strategy was otherwise consistent with the DOD acquisition  process that applies to most weapon system programs, as well as with a  knowledge-based acquisition approach."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "UCLASS Program Has Been Delayed As Requirements Debate Continues", "paragraphs": ["Since our last review in September 2013, the system\u2019s intended mission  and required capabilities have come into question, delaying the Navy\u2019s  UCLASS schedule. DOD has decided to conduct a review of its airborne  surveillance systems and the future of the carrier air wing, and has as a  result adjusted the program\u2019s schedule. The Navy\u2019s fiscal year 2016  budget documents reflect these changes, with award of the air system  contract now expected to occur in fiscal year 2017, a delay of around 3  years. In addition the Navy now expects to achieve early operational  capability\u2014a UCLASS system on at least one aircraft carrier\u2014no earlier  than fiscal year 2022, a delay of around 2 years. Figure 1 shows delays in  dates for several other key program events.", "Congress, DOD, and the Navy continue to debate the primary role of the  UCLASS system. The main options are a largely surveillance role with  limited strike operating in less contested environments, or a largely strike  role with limited surveillance operating in highly contested environments.  Congress has raised concerns about whether UCLASS will be armed and  survivable enough to support U.S. power projection in areas in which  access and freedom to operate are challenged. In addition, Congress has  heard testimony from former DOD and Navy officials expressing concerns  about the ability of UCLASS to help counter the defenses of adversaries  trying to deny U.S. access. Congress has also directed the Navy to  confirm that the program\u2019s key performance parameters\u2014that is, its most  critical requirements\u2014have been validated by the JROC before issuing  the UCLASS development request for proposals, and prohibited the air  system development contract award until after DOD completes a  requirements review.program while DOD conducts airborne surveillance systems and carrier  air wing reviews further indicates that the anticipated role of UCLASS is  not yet settled."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Knowledge about Needed Resources Depends on Final UCLASS Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The resolution of the debate over UCLASS requirements could have  significant design and cost implications, which will determine the  resources the Navy needs and how much knowledge from the Navy\u2019s  previous assessments and estimates can still be applied. In September  2013, we concluded that the UCLASS program should demonstrate that it  has an executable business case that reflects high levels of knowledge  and a match between requirements and available resources before  holding a Milestone B review, establishing an acquisition program  baseline, and initiating system development. Our past work has found  that while a match is eventually achieved on most weapon system  programs, a key distinction between successful programs\u2014which perform  as expected and are developed within estimated resources\u2014and  problematic programs is when this match is achieved. When the match  occurs before system development begins, the weapon system is more  likely to meet objectives.", "The current uncertainty about UCLASS requirements underscores the  need for the program to demonstrate an executable business case,  establish an acquisition program baseline, and hold a Milestone B review,  prior to starting a system development program. At this point, if more  demanding requirements add technical risk, the Navy would likely need to  conduct additional systems engineering work before it could establish an  executable business case and a program baseline. As such, the Navy  would need to revisit its understanding of available resources in the areas  of design knowledge, funding, and technologies as detailed below:", "Knowledge gained through preliminary design reviews may no  longer be applicable: During the four preliminary design reviews that  ended in May 2014, the Navy evaluated contractor designs against a  set of performance specifications issued in July 2013. Those  specifications reflected the requirements that had been approved by  Navy leadership just three months earlier and focused on the need to  conduct mainly surveillance missions in less contested environments  while emphasizing affordability, timely fielding, and endurance. If the  program pursues and the JROC validates requirements that focus on  a strike role and emphasize the need for the air system to operate in  highly contested environments, increase internal weapons payload  capacity, or change how long the air system needs to remain airborne  without refueling, the contractors may have to adjust or redesign their  proposals. This would increase design risk since no preliminary  design reviews have been completed based on these potentially more  demanding requirements. As a result, the Navy may need to conduct  more systems engineering work and update or repeat entirely the  preliminary design review process.", "Program cost estimates and funding needs depend on final  requirements: We found in September 2013, that UCLASS  development cost estimates were varied and uncertain, even at a time  when requirements had been scaled back and appeared to be  relatively stable. As the debate about requirements has progressed,  the uncertainty about the program\u2019s cost has increased. DOD and  contractor officials have noted that if requirements become more  demanding, for example increasing the air system\u2019s weapons payload  or the need for it to operate in a highly contested environment, then  the estimated development costs could increase significantly. Until  requirements are firm, the Navy will not have the knowledge it needs  to develop and present an executable business case or program  baseline containing reliable cost and funding estimates. Because  requirements are still under debate, the Navy reduced the UCLASS  fiscal year 2016 budget from almost $670 million to $135 million.  Despite this near term reduction, annual development funding levels  are projected to reach nearly $850 million in fiscal year 2020, as  shown in figure 2. The projected funding, however, does not reflect  the level of funding that may be needed if the program pursues more  demanding requirements, which some officials in the Office of the  Secretary of Defense believe could be substantially higher.", "Program may need to develop and mature additional  technologies: If the program pursues and the JROC validates a more  demanding set of requirements the contractors may need to develop  and mature additional technologies. Navy officials believe that the  critical technologies for UCLASS are mature based on their  experience with a demonstration program for a carrier-launched  unmanned aircraft, known as the Unmanned Combat Air System  Demonstration. However, if the validated program requirements lead  to the need for new technologies, then the program will likely need  additional time to mature those technologies before beginning system  development. Scheduling for UCLASS is particularly complicated as  the program needs to synchronize its test planning with availability of  aircraft carriers that have had UCLASS modifications installed.  Carriers are periodically unavailable due to scheduled maintenance  needs, and thus air system schedule delays could cause the program  to miss opportunities for testing. The Navy also has the opportunity to  decide whether to add requirements and technologies in a single step  or to add them incrementally using an evolutionary acquisition  approach."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Firm and achievable requirements should form the basis of a business  case for any major weapon system investment. A substantive debate  about the intended mission and required capabilities of UCLASS is taking  place before DOD makes a major resource commitment and holds a  Milestone B review to formally initiate a system development program.  This is a good development, because it will likely help ensure that the  Navy\u2019s UCLASS business case provides a sound foundation for an  acquisition program baseline that is rooted in firm and achievable  requirements at the outset.", "DOD policy requires the Navy to finalize UCLASS requirements, with  validation by the JROC, before issuing the request for proposals for the  development contract. Once the requirements are finalized and before a  development contract is signed, the Navy will need to demonstrate that it  has adequate resources\u2014including design knowledge, funding, and  technologies\u2014available to meet those requirements. Unsettled  requirements will hinder the Navy\u2019s ability to develop and present a  business case with realistic cost and schedule estimates, and establish  an acquisition program baseline. The final requirements and how similar  or different they are to those used for the past preliminary design reviews,  will determine the extent to which the knowledge the Navy gained is still  applicable at this key juncture in the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Once the JROC has validated UCLASS requirements, and in order to  ensure that the Navy has a sound and executable business case and  establishes an acquisition program baseline before awarding a  development contract and committing significant resources, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the  Navy to provide a report to the congressional defense committees and  the Secretary of Defense demonstrating that the Navy has the resources  available and a strategy to deliver those required UCLASS capabilities.
