In May 2013, GAO provided a classified report on readiness trends of DOD forces.

Section 482 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code requires DOD to report on 26 elements including readiness deficiencies, remedial actions, and data specific to the military services in the areas of personnel, training, and equipment. In analyzing DOD's reports, GAO found that DOD addressed 18 of the 26 elements, partially addressed 3 elements and did not report on 5 elements. For the elements partially addressed--personnel stability, training operations tempo, and deployed equipment--reporting was incomplete because some services reported information and others did not report. When all the services reported on an element, they at times did so inconsistently, with varying amounts and types of information. For example, the services all reported information on training commitments and deployments, but used different timeframes when providing information on planned training events in the future. The services reported differently because DOD has not provided guidance on the information to be reported. For the elements that DOD did not address, including borrowed manpower and training funding, GAO found that information may exist in the department but is not being reported to Congress. For example, the Army now requires commanders to report monthly on the readiness impacts of borrowed military manpower and DOD's budget requests include data on training funding. However, DOD has not taken steps to analyze whether this information could be used to meet the related reporting element. Without issuing guidance on the type and amount of information to be included by each service and analyzing alternative information it could provide to meet the required elements, DOD risks continuing to provide inconsistent and incomplete information to Congress.", "DOD has taken steps to improve its quarterly readiness reports to Congress, but additional contextual information would provide decision makers a more complete picture of DOD's readiness. Over time, based on its own initiative and congressional requests, DOD has added information to its reports, such as on operational plan assessments. In its most recent report, DOD added narrative information detailing the impact of readiness deficiencies on overall readiness and a discussion of how the services' budgets support their long-term readiness goals. Federal internal control standards state that decision makers need complete and relevant information to manage risks, and GAO found several areas where DOD could provide Congress with more comprehensive and understandable information if it added some additional context to its reports. For example, in some instances, the services report significant amounts of quantitative data, but do not include information on benchmarks or goals that would enable the reader to determine whether the data indicate a problem or the extent of the problem. For example, the Marine Corps and Air Force report mission capable rates for their specific equipment items, but do not provide information on related goals, such as the percentage of the inventory that should be kept at various capability levels. In other instances, the services have not fully explained any connections between the voluminous data they report on the required elements and the information DOD provides in the report on unit and overall readiness ratings.

Congress first mandated the report in 1996 to  enhance its oversight of military readiness, requiring that DOD describe  each readiness problem and deficiency, the key indicators and other  relevant information related to these problems and deficiencies, and  planned remedial actions. DOD submitted its first quarterly report in May  1996. Since that time, Congress has added additional reporting  requirements. Specifically, in 1997, the initial reporting requirement was  expanded to require DOD to include additional reporting elements in the  quarterly reports. Examples of these additional reporting elements  include historical and projected personnel trends, training operations  tempo, and equipment availability. In 2008, an additional reporting  element was added to require the inclusion of an assessment of the  readiness of the National Guard. For a listing of the 26 reporting  elements currently required by section 482, see table 1.", "Since DOD provided its first quarterly readiness report in May 1996, DOD  and the services have invested significant resources in upgrading the  systems they use to collect and report readiness information. As a result,  the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the combatant  commands, and the services have added numerous new readiness  reporting capabilities such as the capacity to assess the ability of U.S.  forces to meet mission requirements in specific operational plans. In  addition, the services have also refined their respective service-specific  metrics to enhance their ability to measure the readiness of their forces.", "The Quarterly Readiness Report to Congress is a classified report that  includes a summary of the contents of the report and multiple classified  annexes that provide the required information. The report is typically  hundreds of pages long. For example, the July through September 2012  Quarterly Readiness Report to Congress totaled 443 pages and the  January through March 2013 report is 497 pages long. The Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness assembles and  produces the quarterly report to Congress. To do so, it compiles  information from multiple DOD organizations, including the Joint Staff and  military services, and its own information such as a summary of overall  readiness status and prepares a draft report. It then sends the draft report  to DOD components to review it for accuracy, and coordinates any  comments. Once finalized, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness officials provide the report to the congressional  defense committees (see figure 1).", "We have previously examined the extent to which DOD\u2019s quarterly  readiness reports met section 482 reporting elements, and found that  DOD\u2019s reports lacked detail, or in some cases, information required by  law.

We also interviewed officials from the Office of  the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, the Joint  Staff Readiness Division, and each of the military services and obtained  additional information and the officials\u2019 views of our assessments, as well  as explanations of why certain items were not addressed or not fully  addressed.", "To determine what additional information, if any, could make the reports  more useful, we reviewed the types of readiness information DOD uses  internally to manage readiness contained in documents such as the Joint  Force Readiness Review and various service-specific readiness products,  and compared their formatting and contents to the four reports identified  above. We reviewed the content of these reports in the context of federal  internal control standards, which state that decision makers need  complete and relevant information to manage risks. This includes pertinent information that is identified and distributed in an  understandable form. We interviewed officials from the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, the Joint Staff  Readiness Division, and each of the military services and discussed the  procedures for compiling and submitting readiness information for  inclusion in the quarterly readiness reports, changes in the reports over  time, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s process for compiling  the full report. We also identified adjustments DOD has made to its  reports, including changes the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  for Personnel and Readiness made in preparing the January through  March 2013 report, and the underlying reasons for these adjustments, as  well as obtained the views of officials as to opportunities to improve the  current reporting.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2012 through July  2013 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Michael Ferren, Assistant  Director; Richard Burkard; Randy Neice; Amie Steele; Shana Wallace;  Chris Watson; and Erik Wilkins-McKee made key contributions to this  report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
