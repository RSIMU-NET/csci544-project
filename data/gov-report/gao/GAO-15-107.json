Airports are seeking an increase in the PFC cap to $8.50. Airlines, which collect PFCs at the time of purchase and remit the fees to airports, oppose an increase because it could potentially reduce passenger demand.

This report discusses (1) the potential effects of PFC cap increases, (2) how well the current PFC collection process works, and (3) alternative PFC collection methods.

Under all three scenarios, AATF revenues, which totaled $12.9 billion in 2013 and fund Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) activities, would likely continue to grow overall based on current projections of passenger growth; however, the modeled cap increases could reduce total AATF revenues by roughly 1 percent because of reduced passenger demand. These projected effects depend on key assumptions regarding consumers' sensitivity to a PFC cap increase, whether airlines would pass on the full increase to consumers, and the rate at which airports would adopt the increased PFC cap.", "Stakeholders said that the current PFC collection method generally works well, but airport officials said that transparency over PFC collections could be enhanced. Stakeholders universally said that the current method is preferred because the PFC is paid at the time of purchase. Airlines are required to have audits of their PFC collections and FAA provides audit guidance to help provide assurance that collections are accurate. However, the guidance is voluntary and FAA does not know if airlines' auditors use it. FAA relies on airports to alert them of discrepancies but some airports may not be aware they can review audits. FAA could take additional steps beyond what is stated in the guidance to inform airports about their rights, and thus provide reasonable assurance to Congress, airports, and airline passengers about the reliability of those audits and PFCs remitted to airports.", "Stakeholders GAO interviewed generally said that alternative methods to collect PFCs, such as airport kiosks or online or mobile payments, are technologically feasible but they would impose additional steps for passengers, costs for airports, and changes in business processes.

AIP grants have declined in recent years, and the amount of PFCs  that airports can collect per passenger has not changed since 2000, when  it was capped at $4.50. Airports are seeking an increase in the PFC cap  to help fund their planned development projects, such as terminal  rehabilitation and expansion. However, airlines\u2014which collect PFCs at  the time of purchase and remit to airports\u2014oppose an increase, because  they believe that airports have adequate access to outside funding  sources.

About $2.8 billion in PFCs was collected by airlines  on behalf of airports in 2013. Certain categories of passengers and flights  are exempt from paying PFCs. For example, passengers flying on  frequent-flier award coupons are exempt from paying a PFC. The intent  of the PFC program is to further airport development that (1) preserves or  enhances airports\u2019 safety, security, or capacity; (2) reduces noise  generated by airport activities; or (3) enhances airline competition. PFCs  give airports a source of funding for airport development over which they  have greater local control because airlines have more limited say  regarding how PFCs are used than they may have regarding the use of  airport terminal rents or landing fees. This way, if an airport wants to build  additional gates to attract new competition, an incumbent airline cannot  block the project by refusing to fund it. PFCs can be applied to FAA  approved eligible projects, and can be used as a match for AIP grants  or to finance the debt on approved projects.", "Airports must apply to the FAA for authority to collect PFCs for use on  approved projects, and if approved by FAA, airlines are required to collect  PFCs and remit them to appropriate airport recipients. Each airport\u2019s  application must list specific eligible projects that PFCs will fund and the  total amount to be collected. Once PFC applications are approved,  airlines must add any approved PFC to the base fare (along with other  federal taxes and fees) at the point of sale on the ticket by an airline, a  travel agent, or Global Distribution Systems (GDS). Airlines must remit  PFCs to airports on a monthly basis. Airlines are able to keep the \u201cfloat\u201d\u2014 that is, interest accumulated on the fees between the time they are  collected and remitted\u2014as well as 11 cents per PFC collected for  administration costs. Airlines that annually collect at least 50,000 PFCs  are required to have annual independent audits of their PFC collections,  and airports can request and receive the results of audits. FAA has the  authority, though not an obligation, to review the audits. (See fig. 1).", "From 1990 through August 2014, FAA approved airports\u2019 requests to  collect a total of around $89 billion in PFCs. This amount includes future  approved collections\u2014with about a third of collecting airports approved to  collect PFCs to at least 2024 or later. Of the $89 billion, about 34 percent  has been committed for \u201clandside\u201d projects such as terminals; 34 percent  for interest on debt used to pay for projects either in development or  completed; 18 percent for \u201cairside\u201d projects such as runways and  taxiways; 7 percent for airport access such as roads and rail connecting  to airports; 4 percent for noise reduction; and 4 percent for the  construction of Denver International Airport.

In all, 98 of the  top 100 airports have been approved to collect PFCs, with approximately  90 percent of all PFCs (by amount) collected by large and medium hubs.

The  general approach of this analysis was to model airport collections and  passenger traffic under various PFC cap levels. We modeled three  different increases in the PFC cap amount each starting in 2016. Those  three scenarios are:", "PFC cap of $6.47 (which is the 2016 equivalent of $4.50 indexed to  the Consumer Price Index (CPI) starting in 2000 when the cap was  first instituted);", "PFC cap of $8 based on the President\u2019s 2015 budget proposal; and", "PFC cap of $8.50 that would be indexed to inflation based on the  airports\u2019 trade associations\u2019 legislative proposal.", "Assuming that the PFC increase is fully passed on to consumers and not  absorbed through a reduced lower base (before tax) fares, the higher cost  of air travel could reduce passenger demand according to economic  principles. Economic principles and past experience dictate that any  increase in the price of a ticket\u2014even if very small\u2014will have an effect on  some consumers\u2019 decisions on whether to take a trip or not. For example,  an increase in the price by a few dollars may not affect the decision of a  business flyer going for an important business meeting but could affect  the decision of a family of four going on vacation. An increase in the price  will also have different effects depending on the type of air travel, for  example, on short-haul and long-haul flights, and the availability of  substitutes such as driving or taking a train instead of flying. Thus, the  extent to which people decide whether to fly depends on the extent of  consumer sensitivity to changes in the cost of air travel and is referred to  as the \u201celasticity of demand\u201d\u2014the more elastic the demand, the more  passenger air traffic is reduced by increases in price. For our base model analysis, we assumed a demand price elasticity of -0.8. In addition,  to show the potential funding available to airports, we assumed that  airports would adopt the maximum possible PFC cap at the start of 2016,  but in reality, adoption of higher PFC levels would likely be a gradual  process undertaken by individual airports according to their financial  needs. Accordingly, model results in this report should be considered  upper bound estimates of the funds available to airports that were  approved to collect PFCs as of July 31, 2014. A full description of the  model, data sources, and key assumptions appears in appendix II.", "Increasing the PFC cap under the three different scenarios that we  modeled would significantly increase the potential amount of PFC  collections in comparison to what could be available without an increase  in the PFC cap. (See table 1).", "As with any modeling exercise, these projections depend on assumptions  about participants\u2019 behavior, in this case the behavior of consumers,  airlines, and airports. The results presented above reflect three key  assumptions about these behaviors.", "Elasticity of demand. There is uncertainty associated with demand  analysis, because the estimated reductions in air travel are highly  dependent on the assumptions about consumers\u2019 sensitivities to  changes in price. As noted above, to account for this uncertainty, we  used an elasticity rate of -0.8, meaning that a 1 percent increase in  price would result in a 0.8 percent reduction in the quantity of air  travel. This rate is based on the assumption that PFC increase will  affect all routes across the nation and will affect all routes equally. If  PFC increases occur at fewer airports, demand would be more elastic  because consumers could substitute their routing to some extent and  the elasticity rate might be greater. As a result, we modeled three  different elasticity rates drawn from economic literature to test the  sensitivity of our results to these rates and found that for small price  increases, small differences in the elasticity rate have very little  impact. We discussed the selection of this elasticity rate with experts  who have published on aviation economics, and they generally  agreed with the selection. The model results from all three elasticity  rates are shown in appendix II (table 5).", "PFC pass-through. We assumed that the entire PFC increase would  be fully passed on to consumers and not absorbed by the airlines by  adjusting of their base fares downward. Airline statements and  experts with whom we spoke largely support our assumption that  airlines would attempt to pass the PFC increase on to consumers.  However, consumers\u2019 response may vary from market to market and  may not happen all at once, as airlines adjust capacity to respond to  higher fares. For example, in the immediate period when airlines have  fixed capacity, airlines\u2019 may have to absorb all or some of this  increase in order to maximize their revenues.as airlines adjust their capacity, they may gradually pass on the PFC  increase to passengers. In addition, funding airport projects through  PFCs instead of through airline rates and charges could reduce airline  costs in the long run. If such conditions occur, airlines may adjust their  airfares downward so that an increase in the fee is not fully passed  onto consumers. The more the airlines absorb, the less the increase  in the cost of travel for passengers and the lower the adverse effect  on passenger demand. We consider the effect of different pass- through rates in appendix II.", "In the following years,", "Airport adoption. We assumed that airports that currently impose a  PFC would raise it to the maximum allowed amount in the first year.  While it is unrealistic to assume that all airports would immediately  raise their PFC level in the first year, based on near universal  adoption of the current maximum by nearly all of the largest airports, it  is not unrealistic to expect that most airports would be at the  maximum by 2024.  Following the introduction of the PFC in 1991 and  the increase in the level in 2000, airports quickly moved to the higher  PFC level as indicated in figure 3 below. If fewer airports increase  their PFC level that would proportionally reduce PFC collections and  the associated changes to the AATF and allow some consumers to  avoid the PFC making the consumer response more elastic as noted  above. The results of using a scenario with a reduced PFC adoption  rate by airports are shown in appendix II (table 6)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increasing the PFC Cap Could Marginally Slow Growth in Revenues to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund", "paragraphs": ["Increasing the PFC cap under the three different scenarios that we  modeled could marginally slow the growth of AATF revenues compared  to what it could have been without the PFC increase. About 91 percent of  AATF revenues in 2013 were derived from taxes and fees on  passengers. Under all our cap scenarios, AATF revenues from  passengers would likely continue to grow overall based on current  projections of passenger growth; however, passenger growth could be  slower with a PFC cap increase if it results in a higher total cost of air  travel and thus reduces passenger demand. As a consequence of fewer  anticipated passengers flying, the tax base on which these taxes are  levied would be reduced compared to the tax base with no PFC increase.  If the PFC increase is not passed on to consumers but absorbed by  airlines through their adjustment of base fares downward, it would still  reduce the trust fund\u2019s revenues from the ad valorem tax that is levied as  7.5 percent on the base fare. Similarly, when airlines introduced ancillary  fees for such services as checked baggage, there is some evidence that  airlines adjusted their base fares downward to lessen the effect on  passenger demand but not by as much as the amount of the fees.  Because ancillary fees are not taxed, both reduced passenger demand  and reduced base fares resulting from the introduction of fees would have  reduced trust fund revenues. We did not include ancillary fees as part of  our base fare calculation due to the lack of comprehensive ancillary fee   but including ancillary fees would result in higher air-travel costs  data;thereby making any PFC increase a smaller percentage of the total price  and therefore resulting in a smaller loss of passenger demand. Under an  $8 PFC cap and the entire PFC increase passed on to consumers, AATF  revenues could be lower by $161 million to $186 million annually, as  compared to what they could be without a PFC increase, assuming a  demand elasticity of -0.8. This potential loss in AATF passenger revenues  is small relative to total AATF passenger revenues\u2014for example,  between -0.58 and -1.68 percent of the total in 2024 depending on the  size of the cap increase. The extent to which the AATF is affected will  depend on the extent of the reduction in passenger traffic (elasticity  assumption) as well as the extent to which the increase is passed on to  consumers under each scenario (pass through rate).

Thus, larger airports could benefit most from an increase in  the PFC. A hub level analysis of a PFC cap increase shows that large  hub airports could receive nearly three-quarters of all PFCs, while large  and medium hubs together could account for nearly 90 percent of total  PFCs, similar to what they do now. For example, under an $8 PFC, large  hub airports could receive additional PFC revenues of $1.74 to $2.08  billion annually and medium hubs could receive additional PFC revenues  of $372 to $435 million annually from 2016 to 2024. Small and non-hub  airports could receive up to $212 million and $82 million in additional  annual PFC revenues respectively from 2016 to 2024.

As previously  noted, under current rules, large and medium hubs\u2019 apportionment of AIP  formula funds may be reduced, which in fiscal year 2014, resulted in a  redistribution of approximately $553 million. The majority of this funding  (87.5 percent) goes to the Small Airport Fund for redistribution among  small airports. The remaining 12.5 percent became available as AIP  discretionary funds, which FAA uses to award grants to eligible projects  regardless of airport size. Under the President\u2019s 2015 budget proposal, all  AIP formula grants for large hub airports, which FAA estimates to be $80  million in fiscal year 2015, would be eliminated in return for an $8 PFC.", "In addition, the President\u2019s 2015 budget proposal calls for a decrease in  the total amount of AIP funds, a decrease that under current law would  result in automatic changes in how AIP grants are allocated.", "Increasing PFCs also could affect the dynamics of how airports and  airlines can influence airport investment decisions. Airports rely on  several funding mechanisms in order to pay for airport development  projects. These include PFCs, non-aeronautical revenues (e.g., parking  and concession revenue), AIP grants, rates and charges agreements with  airlines, and state and local funds. Generally, PFCs offer airports relative  independence over investment decisions at their airports. While airports  must notify and consult with the airlines on how they spend PFCs, as long  as FAA approves, airlines cannot block these decisions. Airlines can  choose to serve other airports, however, so airports have an incentive to  listen to airline concerns. Airport representatives said that one of the  reasons airports want an increased PFC cap is because airports have  already committed a significant portion of their current PFCs to past and  current projects and have relatively fewer PFC-approved funds available  with the $4.50 cap in place. According to FAA, $30 billion in PFCs was  approved from1992 to September 2014 to pay interest on debt, with some  airports scheduled to service debt for as long as 2058. Some airports  have indicated that an increased PFC would allow them to reduce their  debt costs, which could limit revenues available to those airports to  secure new debt financing. Conversely, airline representatives told us that  in their view, airports have many sources of revenue available and ready  access to debt markets, so there is no need to increase the PFC cap. All  else being equal, lower PFCs can provide airlines with more influence  over airport infrastructure decisions and higher PFCs can provide airports  more control over local capital-funding decisions, including the ability to  decide how to apply PFC revenues to support capital projects and thus  how those revenues might influence airline rates and charges."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Reported That the Current PFC Collection Method Works Well but Lacks Some Transparency for Airports", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Stakeholders Said That the Current PFC Collection Method Works Well", "paragraphs": ["In order to evaluate the current PFC collection method, we used the  following factors that we identified as key considerations for evaluating  passenger fee collection methods in our February 2013 report: passenger  experience, costs to administer, legal issues, customer transparency, and  technology readiness."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Passenger Experience", "paragraphs": ["Industry experts and representatives from airports, airlines, trade  associations, and consumer groups universally said that the current  method of PFC collection has the least impact on passenger experience,  because the PFC is paid as part of the total ticket price and at the time of  purchase.

In addition, airlines and airports have different fee-collection and  remittance systems, and airline code shares mean that the airline  collecting and remitting PFCs may not be the airline transporting the  passenger. Furthermore, airport officials told us that the timing of  collections and remittances can hinder their efforts to track and verify the  accuracy of PFC remittances. Airlines receive PFCs with ticket payments,  while airports receive remittances on a monthly basis. Passengers,  however, may fly on a later date well outside the monthly window.", "To help ensure that airports receive the full amount of the collections they  are due, FAA requires that all airlines that annually collect at least 50,000  PFCs have an annual independent audit of their PFC accounts and  processes. Airports can request a copy of the independent auditor\u2019s  report, but airlines are not required to provide audit reports absent a  request. In addition, FAA may periodically audit or review the collection  and remittance of airline PFC collections under the FAA\u2019s federal  oversight responsibility. To assist airlines, FAA has developed audit  guidance for airlines\u2019 auditors to follow in conducting their audits. This  guidance is comprehensive and includes testing procedures to ensure  that airline systems are properly recording PFC collections. While  adherence to the guidance is voluntary, FAA has determined that using  the guidance will provide sufficient assurance that the airline has met its  PFC regulatory requirements and that additional reports, a government  audit, or other investigations will not normally be needed. FAA\u2019s guidance  expressly underscores the importance of the assurance that using the  guidelines provides, stating that it is reflected in FAA\u2019s approach to  resolving alleged collection and remittance discrepancies raised by  airports to estimate local PFC collections. In cases where the airlines\u2019  auditors did not use the guidance, any allegation of a discrepancy by  airports could trigger additional FAA activities, including additional  reporting or an audit by the Department of Transportation\u2019s Office of  Inspector General.", "FAA officials told us they do not know to what extent airlines\u2019 auditors use  the audit guidance and only review the audit reports if questions are  raised by airports about possible discrepancies. FAA officials also told us  that they generally do not receive airline audits and do not know how  many airlines\u2019 auditors follow the audit guidelines. FAA officials also do  not know how many airports are receiving the audit reports, but explained  that disputes over the accuracy of collections have been rare and have  been generally limited to collections by smaller airlines or those in  bankruptcy. However, as noted above, it would be very difficult for an  airport to know if its PFC remittances were not accurate, and in some  cases, airports are not receiving audit reports and may not be aware they  can be requested. Moreover, although airports have the right to review  audits, our interviews with a limited number of airport officials raise  questions about the extent to which airports are aware of their rights to  review the audits. Three of the five airport managers whom we  interviewed told us that they have received unsolicited copies of audits in  the past, whereas two other airport managers had not received copies.  Absent a request, there is no requirement for airlines to give airports or  FAA the audits, even if there is a qualified or adverse audit opinion. FAA  officials told us that while airports\u2019 rights to review the audits are set forth  in FAA guidance that is available to all airports, they could consider  additional steps to ensure that all airports understand their right to request  copies of the airline\u2019s audits as well as FAA\u2019s reliance on airports to  identify discrepancies. Doing so would be consistent with Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government, which call for agencies to  ensure that there are effective means of communicating with, and  obtaining information from, external stakeholders\u2019 that may have a  significant impact on the agencies achieving its goals. Given that FAA  relies on airports to alert it to potential inaccuracies in PFC collections  and those airports have difficulty determining the accuracy of PFC  collections for the reasons discussed earlier in this report, it is important  that airports are aware of their right to request copies of airline PFC audit  reports and to ask for additional follow-up by FAA, such as an audit by the  Department of Transportation\u2019s Office of Inspector General if the audits or  other information indicate discrepancies. By taking actions to better  educate airports about the importance of obtaining and reviewing airline  PFC audits, such as through notifications or posting this on the FAA\u2019s  website, FAA would better position airports to understand their rights  including the potential for requesting further investigations, as needed.  Thus, both FAA and airports could be better informed about the accuracy  of PFC remittances.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government call for  agencies to design their internal controls to assure that ongoing  monitoring occurs in the course of normal operations. However, as  previously discussed, FAA does not know the extent to which airlines use  its audit guidance or generally review the airlines\u2019 audit reports. Thus,  FAA is not well positioned to provide a reasonable assurance to  Congress, the airports, or airline passengers who pay the PFCs about the  reliability of those audits or the PFCs collected. Determining the extent to  which airlines\u2019 independent auditors use FAA\u2019s guidance could provide  FAA with additional assurance about the reliability of those audits.  Moreover, if the guidance is not being extensively used, then taking  additional actions to assess the soundness of existing airline audits and  the associated costs of airlines following the guidance would better  position FAA to determine if it should make its guidance mandatory.", "Similar to PFCs, TSA imposes a security fee on passengers which is  collected by the airlines; however, unlike PFCs, security fee revenues are  remitted directly to one entity\u2014the TSA.way trip on passengers on each ticket. TSA conducts direct audits of its  fee collections through which it has found remittance discrepancies. This  process suggests that, without adequate assurance that airlines are  following FAA\u2019s audit guidance, some PFCs may not be collected or, if  collected, not accurately remitted to airports. TSA has a compliance office  that performs its own on-site audits of approximately 20 airlines annually.  TSA officials stated that they regularly identify additional funds that should   TSA charges $5.60 per one- have been collected and remitted to TSA, though these unremitted funds  are relatively small when compared to overall collections. According to  TSA officials, the agency identified and collected $2 million in unremitted  funds in fiscal year 2013 from its audits compared to its $2-billion annual  fee collections. TSA\u2019s audit findings have been upheld in court when  challenged by an airline. For example, a TSA audit of Alaska Airlines  found that the airline owed an additional $1 million in security fee  remittances for flights between 2002 and 2006, which Alaska Airlines  unsuccessfully challenged. TSA officials stated that the agency used to  require that all airlines that collect the security fee from at least 50,000  passengers provide an annual audit to TSA. However, this audit  requirement was waived on January 23, 2003, because according to the  federal registry announcement, TSA initiated its own audits of air carriers,  and according to TSA, air carriers have demonstrated a high level of  compliance with TSA\u2019s collection and remittance rules and thus find it  unnecessary for air carriers to expend resources for independent audits."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Alternative Methods of PFC Collection Are Feasible but Would Impose Additional Steps and Costs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Stakeholders Identified Three Alternatives to the Current Ticket-Based PFC Collection but Said They Could Diminish Passenger Experience", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders we interviewed identified three general alternatives to the  current method of PFC collection, alternatives that could be used in  combination or independently."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Kiosks/Counter Payments", "paragraphs": ["An alternative collection method that has been used at a few airports  internationally is the use of a self-service kiosk or payment counter to pay  for airport fees. Departing passengers pay the fee at the airport using a  kiosk or payment counter as part of the check-in process. Connecting  passengers could pay the fee at a facility within the terminal between  departure gates. Payment could be verified prior to departure at check-in,  security, or the boarding gate. We identified few airports around the world  that currently use this method. Those that do include Blackpool Airport in  the United Kingdom, which required passengers to purchase an airport-  development fee ticket at a kiosk or retail outlet at the airport. In addition,  Ireland West Airport Knock in the Republic of Ireland requires passengers  to pay a development fee that can be done at a dedicated desk at the  airport. Both of these are relatively small regional airports and Blackpool  Airport closed on October 15, 2014. Other airports have instituted kiosk  and payment counters but later abandoned the method in favor of  imposing the fee on the ticket at time of purchase. For example,  Vancouver International Airport, Calgary International Airport, and  Montr\u00e9al\u2013Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport (all in Canada)  initially used payment counters to collect airport-improvement fund fees  from passengers following airport privatization in Canada in the 1990s.  However, the payment counter approach was abandoned, and the fee  was added back onto the ticket after payments at the airport became  cumbersome and inconvenient for passengers, according to a Canadian  airport trade association representative. There is some evidence,  however, that in-airport kiosks and payment counters can work. Airlines  use self-service kiosks and counters for their airline check-in processing  and ancillary fee purchases, such as for checked baggage. Some  airports, such as McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, have  implemented common use self-service kiosks in which passengers can  check in to any airline that operates at the airport and make ancillary fee  purchases.

Individual  airports or a group of airports would directly operate or contract with a  third party provider to manage a website to collect required fees directly  from the passenger who would pay via credit card or debit card.  Passengers could also be automatically directed to the website to pay  PFCs after paying for a ticket online, a process that would require airline  and travel agent cooperation. Passengers could go directly to the website  at any time before check-in to pay the fee. In all these cases, airports  would have to establish or contract with a clearinghouse that would  collect and distribute PFCs or perform that function. Payments could be  verified at the airport at a check-in counter, security checkpoint, or the  boarding gate.

Departing passengers could  scan their mobile device or card at kiosks, payment counters, or other  payment stations. Connecting passengers could also use this method to  pay at kiosks or payment counters and stations as they move through the  airport to their next departure gate. Like the other alternative collection  methods, airports could individually or as a group develop and implement  information systems and infrastructure to collect and distribute PFCs on  their own or contract through a third party.

Any alternative collection method implemented by an airport  would require an exemption to the Anti-Head Tax Act or express statutory  authority in order to collect fees. Furthermore, current DOT regulations  require airlines to disclose the total price of airfare, including all taxes and  fees; and would need to be revised if airports directly collect the fee from  passengers.

This estimate was compared to the total enplanements from the TAF  data, and the gap between the two was considered to be the number of  domestic TAF enplanements that were not charged a PFC (10 percent on  aggregate).", "The model assumes that all increases in PFC are passed onto the  consumers and not absorbed by the airlines. When these PFC increases  are passed onto the consumers, it increases their air travel costs. Our  model thus takes into account these effects of raising the total cost of air  travel on passenger demand and the resulting secondary impacts on PFC  and trust fund revenues. Generally an increase in the cost of air travel will  convince some number of passengers to seek other travel arrangements  or to not travel at all. In order to model this potential decrease in  passenger demand, we calculated the increase in the PFC level as a  percentage of both international roundtrip and domestic average gross  fares per enplanement. Data on average gross fares were collected and  summarized from Department of Transportation Origin and Destination  survey data for average annual fares from calendar year 2013. Fares  were adjusted for inflation annually from 2014 onwards using the CPI. In  order to calculate the fare per enplanement, we divided the domestic fare  by the average number of flights per ticket (1.37), which is derived from  U.S. DOT\u2019s non-directional data from calendar year 2013. International  trips are assumed to have only one flight per ticket because other  domestic flights that may be part of the ticket are captured in the domestic  category. We also use roundtrip fares for international enplanements as  that is the relevant cost of travel to which PFCs should be compared  since incoming international flights do not have to pay a PFC. The  increase in the PFC was added to the domestic ticket price per  enplanement and international roundtrip ticket price to calculate the  percentage change resulting from the change in the PFC cap.", "To translate the increase in ticket price into an impact on passenger  demand, an elasticity rate was applied. The elasticity rate is a ratio  representing the percentage change in quantity to a percentage change  in price. Air travel elasticity thus shows the percentage change in trips  demanded by customers as result of percentage change in air fare.  Applying the elasticity rate provides an estimate of the reduction in  passenger demand for enplanements due to the increase in price per  enplanement, which is used to calculate net chargeable enplanements.  The net enplanements are then used to estimate PFC revenues. PFC  revenues are estimated by multiplying these demand- adjusted  enplanements by the maximum allowable PFC under each scenario less  an 11-cent administrative fee kept by the airlines. PFC revenues thus  reflect the collections that the airports would expect to receive if all 362  airports adopted the maximum rate starting in 2016. It is important to note  that adoption of the maximum rate is likely to be a gradual process, and  thus actual collections are likely to be lower than these estimates,  especially in earlier years. The reduction in enplanements due to higher  ticket costs also affects trust fund revenues as it reduces the passenger  tax base that contributes to the trust fund. Our model results show the  projected change in trust fund revenues from passengers under the  various cap scenarios relative to the baseline. Negative estimated  changes in trust fund revenue would likely represent a marginal slowing  of growth in trust fund revenues from passengers rather than an absolute  decline. The impact on the trust fund is calculated by multiplying the  change in domestic enplanements due to demand effects by the $4  segment tax and the change in international enplanements by the $17.50  international arrival and departure tax. We also calculate the loss from  the ad valorem tax based on the fewer number of trips that are taken as a  result of the higher PFC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Assumptions", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Elasticity of Demand", "paragraphs": ["As indicated above, elasticity rates are a measure of the demand  response of passengers to changes in price, and thus, they can have an  impact on passenger demand projections. The higher the demand  elasticity, the more sensitive the demand is to a change in price, and  hence the higher the reduction in enplanements due to a PFC increase.  The elasticity rate we chose for our base model analysis was -0.8, which  was drawn from a 2007 study conducted by InterVISTAS consulting for  IATA and is based on a universal price increase at a national level. We  also examined different elasticity rates of -0.65 and -1.122 to see how it  affected our results. The -0.65 elasticity is drawn from a November 2014  study of demand elasticity also conducted by InterVISTAS Consulting Inc.  for ACI-NA. The -1.122 elasticity comes from a study completed by D.W.

However, if funding airport projects through PFCs  instead of through airline rates and charges would reduce airline costs,  then it would increase the ability and likelihood of airlines absorbing some  of the PFC increase by lowering fares instead of making consumers pay  for it. The more the airlines absorb, the less the increase in travel costs  and the lower the adverse effect on passenger demand. However, under  any PFC increase and pass-through scenario, trust fund revenues from  passengers will be reduced relative to the baseline because even if  airlines lower fares enough to absorb the entire PFC increase, the lower  fares will result in less revenue from the 7.5% excise tax on fares."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Airport Adoption", "paragraphs": ["We assumed that airports that were approved to impose a PFC as of July  31, 2014, would raise their PFC to the maximum allowed amount in the  first year and that airports that do not currently have approval to collect a  PFC would not obtain approval to impose one. Interviews with FAA and  airport representatives indicate that the number of airports charging PFCs  is not expected to change significantly in the future. While it is unrealistic  to assume that all airports that are currently collecting a PFC would  immediately raise their PFC in the first year, based on near universal  adoption of the current maximum by nearly all of the largest airports, it is  not unrealistic to expect that airports would be at or near the maximum by  2024. Following the introduction of the PFC in 1991 and the increase in  2000, airports quickly moved to the higher PFC level as indicated in figure  3 in the report. However, the extent to which airports continually have  projects that fall under the PFC-eligibility criteria and gain FAA approval  will also influence the adoption of higher PFCs by airports over time.  Small airports in particular may not have as many PFC-eligible projects to  justify moving to a higher PFC. If a significant number of airports that  currently collect a PFC do not move to the maximum under a new cap, it  would offer passengers more alternatives as passengers could avoid  paying the higher PFC by substituting a nearby airport that does not  charge at the higher rate. This would result in a higher overall rate of  demand elasticity. Thus the final effect would depend on the specific  pattern of airports that do or do not adopt a higher PFC."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity Analysis", "paragraphs": ["In order to test the sensitivity of the results to changes in the key  assumptions about elasticity and pass-through, changes to PFC and trust  fund revenue from passengers were modeled using a -0.65 and a -1.122  elasticity rate, and a 50 percent pass-through rate. The results are  presented below in table 5. Under these alternative elasticity scenarios  and the $8 cap, estimated changes to PFC revenues vary by less than  1.5 percent from the standard scenario estimated using a -0.8 elasticity.  Similarly, under a scenario that uses an $8 PFC cap, an elasticity rate of - 0.8, and a 50 percent pass-through rate, estimated changes to PFC  revenues varied by less than 2 percent relative to the standard scenario.  Changes in trust fund revenues from passengers showed greater  sensitivity to changes in elasticity rate and pass-through in percentage  terms as these are the only variables in the calculations of these  changes.", "To test the sensitivity of our results to key assumptions about airport  adoption, we developed an alternative adoption scenario based on airport  adoption behavior after the previous increase in the PFC cap in 2000. For  the results located in Table 6, we assume that 50% of airports charge the  maximum rate of $8 from 2016 to 2018, 75% of airports from 2019 to  2021 and 90% of airports from 2022 to 2024. The results show that  additional revenue from the increase in the cap varies proportionally to  the percentage of airports that adopt the higher cap.
