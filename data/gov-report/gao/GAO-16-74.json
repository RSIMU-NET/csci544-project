GAO was asked to review DOL's management of this program.", "GAO examined (1) the extent to which DOL follows its procedures to adjudicate Part E claims, (2) how DOL captures new links between toxic substances and diseases and applies them to adjudication, and (3) what DOL's monitoring indicates about the adjudication process and whether any corrective actions have been taken to address identified problems. GAO reviewed a generalizable stratified random sample of 200 Part E claims filed from 2010 through 2014; reviewed applicable federal laws, regulations, guidance, internal audit reports, and other agency documentation associated with internal monitoring; and interviewed DOL officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Labor's (DOL) adjudication process for compensating Department of Energy contract workers or their survivors for illnesses linked to work in the nuclear weapons industry generally follows guidance and procedures implementing Part E of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (EEOICPA). Although GAO's analysis of a generalizable sample of 200 claims filed by workers from 2010 through 2014 found the adjudication process generally followed DOL's guidance and procedures, GAO identified some inconsistencies in an estimated 10 percent of the claims, including errors in correspondence to claimants and in development of claims. The procedure manual stipulates that written decisions should clearly convey information that led to the decision and that decisions are to be reviewed by the appropriate signatory. GAO found that decisions sometimes contained inaccurate, conflicting, or incomplete information, such as listing the wrong medical condition. DOL also did not always run accurate searches of its Site Exposure Matrices (SEM)\u2014an online electronic database of facilities, toxic substances, and associated illnesses\u2014when processing claims, or responding to requests for reopening claims. In addition, GAO found that supervisory review is at the discretion of each district office and, as a result, recommended decisions on claims were not always reviewed. This may increase the likelihood of poorly written decisions, which is inconsistent with procedures and which, in turn, increases the potential for claimant confusion and delays in adjudication.", "DOL uses the SEM to, among other things, document newly identified causal links between toxins and diseases on the basis of medical research. According to DOL officials, since 2006 the number of such links listed in the SEM has increased from about 300 to over 3,000. They said that due to the large volume of information updates, DOL provides limited notification to claims examiners and the public when they occur. It has issued 10 notices specifically on new links since 2006. Therefore, it is usually incumbent on claims examiners and claimants to make themselves aware of new links by continuously checking the SEM for updates. As a result, new links are applied to claims largely to the extent these checks are performed. However, claims examiners are not always required to document that they checked whether the SEM had been updated prior to issuing a recommended decision to deny a claim. This gap in documentation hinders DOL's ability to monitor program performance, consistent with federal internal control standards.", "According to DOL's monitoring, its process for adjudicating Part E claims is working satisfactorily, but persistent deficiencies remain. DOL conducted reviews from fiscal years 2010 through 2014 based on random sampling and found that the process for adjudicating claims met DOL's acceptability standards in any given year. Nonetheless, DOL consistently found deficiencies in certain adjudication steps across all years, including insufficient use of program resources to fully develop claims and improperly written decisions, as GAO also identified in its claim file review. DOL took corrective actions, such as training for claims examiners, to address deficiencies in 2010 through 2012, but determined that corrective actions were not warranted in 2013 and 2014."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOL take steps to ensure all decision letters receive supervisory review, and require that claims examiners document that they checked whether the SEM had been updated just prior to issuing a decision to deny a claim.

Due to the nature of their work, workers  may not have been properly advised of or protected from workplace  hazards. Over the years, especially early on, many workers were  unknowingly exposed to toxic substances, including radioactive and  hazardous materials, and studies have shown that many of these  individuals subsequently developed serious illnesses. To provide  compensation to these workers, the Energy Employees Occupational  Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (EEOICPA) was enacted.  The Department of Labor\u2019s (DOL) Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation  Programs has primary responsibility for administering Parts B and E of  this legislation, as amended, with assistance from several other federal  agencies. The Part E program, which is the focus of this review, provides  financial compensation to employees of Energy contractors and  subcontractors, as well as their survivors, for wage loss, impairments, and  medical expenses resulting from work-related illnesses linked to exposure  to toxic substances. Since the creation of Part E in 2004, DOL has made  over 33,000 payments totaling about $3.6 billion.", "Within a few years of EEOICPA\u2019s enactment, claimants and members of  Congress began raising questions about the program\u2019s implementation.  Since 2003, GAO has issued a number of reports and testimonies  identifying needed improvements, as applicable, to the program. In our  most recent report in 2010, we found that EEOICPA did not require  external review of the Part E program and, as a result, adjudication of  Part E claims was not informed by any independent expertise outside the  department\u2019s purview. The Advisory Board on Toxic Substances and  Worker Health was subsequently created and was expected to improve  transparency, accuracy, and efficiency of processing claims under  EEOICPA. GAO was asked to review the consistency with which DOL  follows its own procedures to process Part E claims, and the consistency  and transparency of information that claims examiners rely on to identify  new links between toxic substances and diseases.", "Accordingly, we addressed the following questions related to the Part E  program:  1.  To what extent does DOL follow its procedures to adjudicate Part E  claims?  2.  How are new links between toxic substances and diseases captured  and applied in DOL\u2019s adjudication process?  3.  What does DOL\u2019s monitoring indicate about Part E adjudication and  what, if any, corrective actions have been taken to address problems  identified?", "To determine the extent to which DOL followed applicable policies and  procedures in adjudicating Part E claims, we reviewed a stratified random  sample of 200 Part E claims that were filed within the last 5 years,  between January 2010 and December 2014, and assessed consistency  with selected procedures pertaining to the development of the claim  through issuance of a Recommended Decision and Final Decision. Our  overall sample included employee as well as survivor claims, and  accepted as well as denied claims. Our population of claims was stratified  into two groups and 100 claims were selected within each. The first group  consisted of claims associated with three selected medical conditions  that, according to DOL and other sources, were potentially more  challenging to adjudicate\u2014hearing loss, chronic beryllium disease, and  Parkinson\u2019s disease. One hundred claims were randomly selected  across these three conditions, in proportion to their population sizes. The  second group consisted of claims not associated with those three medical  conditions and 100 claims were randomly selected within this group. In  addition, we reviewed the EEOICPA Procedure Manual and other  guidance, such as Bulletins and Circulars, used by claims examiners to  adjudicate Part E claims. We also interviewed DOL officials to obtain a  better understanding of how Part E claims are adjudicated.", "To determine how new links between toxic substances and diseases are  captured and applied in the adjudication process, and to understand what  DOL\u2019s monitoring efforts indicate about the Part E adjudication process,  we interviewed agency officials and reviewed relevant reports. We also  reviewed adjudication guidance issued by DOL, including DOL\u2019s  EEOICPA Procedure Manual, Circulars, and Bulletins. In addition, we  reviewed findings from DOL\u2019s annual Accountability Reviews and other  audits conducted by DOL since 2010. We also reviewed available  corrective action plans and interviewed agency officials to determine how  deficiencies found during these internal audits are resolved. Lastly, during  the course of our work we compared the steps taken during DOL\u2019s  adjudication of Part E claims against federal standards for internal  control.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2014 through February  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

During and shortly after World War II, the United States sponsored the  development and production of nuclear weapons using a network of  facilities. During the Cold War, this network expanded into a complex of  as many as 365 industrial sites and research laboratories throughout the  country that employed more than 600,000 workers in the production and  testing of nuclear weapons. Some of the production sites were owned by  Energy or its predecessor agencies, and in many instances contractors  managed operations at the facilities. Workers in these facilities used  manufacturing processes that involved handling very dangerous  materials, and they often were provided inadequate protection from  exposure to radioactive elements, although protective measures have  increased over time. Because of national security concerns, they also  worked under great secrecy, often facing severe criminal penalties for  breaches of secrecy. Workers were often given minimal information about  the materials with which they worked and the potential health  consequences of their exposure to the materials. In some cases, the  extent of the potential negative effects of the toxins may not have been  fully understood at the time of workers\u2019 exposure. Active production of  nuclear weapons was halted at the end of the Cold War, and federally  sponsored cleanup of some of these sites has been underway since that  time.

Claims examiners rely on the EEOICPA Procedure Manual, among  other resources, to process and develop claims.

In addition, DOL has issued regulations that set forth the  general policies and guidelines governing its administration of  EEOICPA.", "DOL also has 11 resource centers to assist with claims processing. The  resource centers, situated in key geographic locations throughout the  United States, are responsible for providing assistance and information to  the EEOICPA claimant community and other interested parties. They  provide claim development support and program outreach as well as  initial claim intake. While the resource centers gather substantial  information and documentation, and perform certain initial development  and limited follow-up tasks, they do not make any decisions regarding the  claim.

If the claim is filed with  a resource center, a center employee conducts outreach and initiates  actions to verify employment. Once complete, the resource center  forwards the claim to the district office for further development. Upon  receipt of a claim from the resource center, or directly from a claimant, the  district office assigns it to a claims examiner, who develops the claim and  issues a Recommended Decision. During this process, the claims  examiner will often request additional information from the claimant to  verify employment, document a diagnosed claimed illness, and determine  survivor eligibility, as applicable. The claims examiner will also verify the  claimant\u2019s employment history with Energy, the Social Security  Administration, or other organizations.", "After the district office has established that the claimant meets the  employment criteria and has a diagnosed illness, it determines if the  illness was a result of exposure to radiation or other toxic substances  during the claimant\u2019s contract employment with Energy. To do this, the  district office requests and reviews additional information, as applicable,  from NIOSH, medical consultants, the claimant\u2019s treating physician,  certified toxicologists, and industrial hygienists, as well as web-based  information regarding the relationship between the illness and toxic  substances. Based on a review of all the evidence gathered, the claims  examiner\u2014determining if it was at least as likely as not that the exposure  was a significant factor in causing, contributing to, or aggravating the  illness\u2014issues a Recommended Decision to accept or deny the claim.

DOL officials said that  the complex nature of the information associated with the SEM makes it  challenging to ensure absolute completeness, due in part to lack of  consensus about whether there is a link between a specific substance  and an illness. Further, in response to a request by DOL to evaluate the  scientific rigor of the SEM, the Institute of Medicine published a 2013  report that also questioned the SEM\u2019s completeness. The report noted  several examples of potential causal linkages missing from the SEM.

Therefore, it is usually incumbent upon claims  examiners and the public to make themselves aware of new links. DOL  officials said claims examiners typically become aware of new links when  they check the SEM as part of the adjudication of an individual claim.  Since each claim necessitates tailored searches of the SEM based on the  specific facility, toxic substances, and illnesses associated with the  particular claim, the claims examiner will learn of a new link if it is relevant  to that claim during adjudication.", "DOL also conveys information on some new links through notices issued  to claims examiners and posted on its public website. From fiscal years  2006 through 2015, DOL issued six Circulars and four Bulletins pertaining  to new links. Five of these notices announced plans to reopen claims  thought to be potentially affected by the information contained in the  notice. For example, Circular 15-04, issued in fiscal year 2015, informed  claims examiners that the substance trichloroethylene had been linked to  kidney cancer and that Haz-Map had been updated to reflect this new  link. The circular also announced that DOL had compiled a list of  previously denied Part E kidney cancer claims and instructed claims  examiners on the reopening of those claims for reevaluation in light of the  new link. DOL officials told us that such steps are limited to instances in  which it is believed a relatively large number of claims are potentially  affected.", "Other than these notices, claims examiners typically learn of a new link  and apply it to adjudication to the extent they check the SEM for updates.  However, if the SEM is not searched regularly for the latest information on  new links, claims examiners could be rendering decisions using outdated  information. For that reason, DOL\u2019s Procedure Manual instructs claims  examiners to check the SEM for any updates just prior to issuing a  Recommended Decision to deny a claim, however, documentation of that  step is not always required. According to the Procedure Manual, the SEM  will show the latest date it was updated. If that date has changed since  the prior search was conducted, the claims examiner must search the  SEM again and document the results of the query. On the other hand, if  that date is unchanged since the original search was conducted, the  claims examiner will know that no new information was added to the SEM  and, consequently, no new search is required. However, examiners are  not required to document this latter check in which they determined that  no new information was added to the SEM that might affect adjudication.  The absence of such documentation impedes the ability to effectively  monitor whether this critical step is carried out. Since effective internal  controls require monitoring be conducted to assess the quality of program  performance, the need for such documentation is essential. Our file  review showed evidence of some claims in which the claims examiner  clearly documented an updated SEM search just prior to issuing the  Recommended Decision, but we could not assess the full extent to which  claims examiners followed this final step due to the lack of  documentation. In addition, DOL officials said that independent SEM  searches required to be performed by FAB also serve as a check of those  performed by district office claims examiners. As with district offices, FAB  must also ensure the SEM record is the most complete and updated data  available, and that no significant changes have been made before FAB  issues its decision on the claim. Unlike district offices, if an updated SEM  search is not needed, FAB makes an entry in the electronic case  management system to indicate that no significant changes have been  made in the SEM that would alter the Recommended Decision.", "Similarly, claimants must usually rely on repeatedly checking the SEM to  learn of any newly added causal links. The online SEM available to the  public is identical to the one claims examiners use when adjudicating  claims, differentiated only by a time lag of around 6 months, according to  DOL officials. This lag is primarily because Energy needs to review and  approve all SEM information before it is made public. New public versions  of the SEM are announced online, but details accompanying the specific  updates are limited. In its 2013 report on the SEM, the Institute of  Medicine noted that although a SEM record indicates when it was last  updated, there is no indication as to what specific information or field was  updated. The report added that this lack of information makes it  extremely difficult for the user to know if the most current information has  been incorporated. For example, the public SEM version dated May 18,  2015, was accompanied by a notice on the SEM website that data for 29  worksites had changed since the previous update, although details were  displayed for only two of the sites. Moreover, it was not possible to  determine whether any new causal links had been added because this  information was not contained in the notice. Absent a check of the SEM  for specific illnesses or toxic substances, claimants could remain unaware  that a new link had been added that may warrant the reopening of their  claim. This could be a significant issue given that claimants are  authorized to request the reopening of a previously denied claim."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOL\u2019s Monitoring Has Identified Some Ongoing Concerns With Claims Adjudication", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOL Continuously Monitors the Adjudication Process", "paragraphs": ["In general, DOL\u2019s monitoring from fiscal years 2010 through 2014 of how  well EEOICPA Part E claims are adjudicated concluded that the process  is working satisfactorily and meeting DOL\u2019s established acceptability  standards. However, there were also some areas of concern that were  consistent with those we identified during our review. DOL has monitored  the adjudication of EEOICPA Part E claims primarily using its annual  Accountability Reviews. In 2015, it also reviewed referrals to CMC and  Second Opinion Medical Specialists, which focused on the use of  physician opinions during the adjudication process to assist in the  resolution of claims, and deemed both referral processes satisfactory."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Annual Accountability Reviews", "paragraphs": ["DOL conducts Accountability Reviews annually to evaluate its  performance in processing and adjudicating EEOICPA claims under Parts  B and E. According to DOL, the objective of the reviews is to provide  management with an effective means to evaluate program performance  and consider corrective action both program-wide and in individual district  offices. Each year, DOL typically reviews five entities: two selected district  offices, the two corresponding FABs co-located in these offices, and the  national FAB in Washington, D.C. The claims subject to review are  randomly selected from all claims adjudicated by these entities during the  review period, generally a period of 365 days prior to the date of the  review. The Accountability Reviews encompass the entire claims  process, from the time a claim is filed to when benefits are paid. For  example, in addition to claims adjudication, the reviews also look at data  entry accuracy, post-decision actions, calculation of benefits, and  payment processing. (See appendix II for additional information on the  specific areas of focus for the Accountability Reviews for fiscal years  2010 through 2014.)", "While some aspects of adjudication are examined each year, each year\u2019s  review is also targeted to assess areas of the claims process in which  there may be deficiencies based on input from policy personnel from the  national office, district office and FAB representatives, and other DOL  stakeholders. DOL officials told us that focusing on different areas from  year to year allows the reviews to be targeted to areas needing attention  while avoiding re-evaluation of areas that have already shown  improvement. Shifting the focus also helps minimize the predictability of  the review questions, though it precludes the ability to track trends over  time. In addition, the sample size of claims in DOL\u2019s review has also  varied from year to year depending on the area of emphasis for that year.  Because of the changing areas of focus and sample sizes, it was difficult  for us to determine whether the percentage of errors has increased or  decreased over time and, therefore, we did not make comparisons across  years.", "Although DOL\u2019s monitoring concluded that the claims adjudication  process was generally working satisfactorily, DOL identified some  recurring deficiencies among the elements it reviewed each year.  However, many of these recurring deficiencies were deemed by DOL to  be significant only for the Accountability Reviews conducted in fiscal  years 2010 to 2012. The recurring deficiencies identified in all the  Accountability Reviews were primarily in three components of the  adjudication process: claims development, written quality of the  Recommended Decision letter, and written quality of the Final Decision  letter.", "With regard to claims development, DOL found:  Instances in which the claims examiner did not undertake full  development of claimed employment, medical condition, and  survivorship.

These workers were often unaware  of the extreme personal hazards they faced while serving their nation and  many became fully aware only when they were later stricken by illness. In  light of this, it is imperative their claims for compensation be given the due  attention and care they deserve. Though we found DOL\u2019s EEOICPA Part  E adjudication process was generally consistent with the steps outlined in  its procedure manual, we identified the need for improvements in two  areas, one of which DOL also identified through its own monitoring. First,  all decisions are to be clearly written, but without additional actions to  help identify and correct mistakes within claimant correspondence, such  problems may persist and claimants may experience confusion or  processing delays. Second, although claims examiners are required to  check the SEM for updates just prior to issuing a Recommended Decision  to deny a claim, they are only required to document this step if the check  reveals that the SEM had been updated since the examiner\u2019s last check.  This gap in required documentation hinders the ability to monitor,  consistent with federal internal control standards, whether claims  examiners are performing a final check of the SEM to ensure that their  decisions are based on the most up-to-date information.

We derived our sampling universe from Energy  Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program (EEOICP) data  contained in DOL\u2019s electronic case management system. The data were  the most recent available at the time we selected our sampling universe  in March 2015. On the basis of our analysis of these data, and through  discussions with DOL, we determined this data source was sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of identifying a sampling universe.", "Our sampling universe consisted of 15,932 Part E claims filed within 5  calendar years, between 2010 and 2014. Because we wanted to  determine if DOL processes Part E claims in accordance with key aspects  of its adjudication procedures, we excluded certain types of claims that  would not allow us to review all steps. Specifically, we excluded claims  that were still in process and for which a Final Decision had not yet been  issued. We also excluded claims that had already been accepted under  Part B, since such claims are automatically accepted under Part E.  Similarly, we excluded \u201cSpecial Exposure Cohort\u201d claims, which are  associated with certain designated facility locations and do not undergo  typical adjudication. Because the Part E sampling universe is based on  recent calendar years and included only claims that received a Final  Decision, the selected sample may exclude a greater number of claims  from more current years and claims that take longer to adjudicate.", "From our sampling universe, we randomly selected 200 claims. These  200 claims were selected separately within each of two major groups.  One major group contained all claims associated with three selected  medical conditions\u2014hearing loss, chronic beryllium disease, and  Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014defining three substrata, and the second group  contained the remaining universe of claims not associated with these  three medical conditions. We selected the three particular medical  conditions for the first group based on document reviews and interviews  with DOL officials. We determined that although such claims comprise a  relatively small portion of the sampling universe (about 9 percent), they  are potentially more challenging to adjudicate. Due to the possible  unique nature of claims associated with these three medical conditions,  and to ensure our file review included each of these claim types, we  further divided the first group into three separate sub-strata, one for each  specific medical condition (i.e. hearing loss, chronic beryllium disease,  and Parkinson\u2019s disease), and then randomly selected claims for review  within each sub-stratum. We allocated the sample of 100 claims across  these three sub-strata according to their relative frequency. Combining  this sub-sample of claims with selected medical conditions with the  sample of general claims allowed us to address our objectives in a  manner that maximized return on limited resources while still allowing for  an independent and objective analysis of the entire universe of claims  that met our selection criteria.", "Table 1 shows the breakdown of our stratified random sample. The way  we selected our sample size for claims associated with specific medical  conditions increased the likelihood of encountering these types of claims  during our review (known as oversampling). However, we used sampling  weights to ensure that our sample of 200 claims properly reflected the  sampling universe.", "Our sample of claims reflected a variety of characteristics. For example,  approximately two-thirds of the claims (68 percent) were employee  claims, with the remaining third being survivor claims. Just under one-half  (48 percent) of the claimants had applied for benefits for one medical  condition and the rest (51 percent) had applied for benefits for multiple  conditions. In fact, nearly a third (32 percent) of the claims were for three  or more conditions. Across all 200 claims, the number of conditions being  claimed totaled 427. In addition to the claims that were associated with  the three specific medical conditions we selected, the sample contained  claims for a wide variety of medical conditions, including cancer (21  percent of all conditions), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (6  percent), and asthma (4 percent).", "Based on the results of our file review and the use of a weighted sample,  we were able to provide generalizable results for our sampling universe of  Part E claims. We were also able to provide generalizable results within  the two major groups\u2014claims based on selected medical conditions and  claims based on all other conditions\u2014as well as make generalizable  comparisons between the two groups. Due to relatively small sub-strata  sizes within select medical conditions, we cannot generalize results for  claims involving any of the selected medical conditions\u2014hearing loss,  chronic beryllium disease, or Parkinson\u2019s disease.", "Because we used a probability procedure based on random selections,  our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we might have  drawn. Since each sample could have provided different estimates, we  express our confidence in the precision of our particular samples as a 95  percent confidence interval.", "For each claim in our sample, we reviewed the case file materials and  documented whether the claims examiners followed DOL\u2019s EEOICPA  Part E claim adjudication procedures from development to the  Recommended and Final Decisions. We reviewed claim files at all four  DOL district offices. Each office gave us access to the claim files in our  sample that had been adjudicated at that district office. Most of the  claims were in paper form, a few recent claims had been scanned into  electronic format, and some were a combination of paper and electronic  formats. To document our review, we developed and used an electronic  data collection instrument (DCI) that consisted of questions on the many  individual claim development steps outlined in DOL\u2019s current Procedure  Manual. We evaluated older claims based on the policies and procedures  that were in effect at that time. Our review focused only on procedural  steps required by the Procedure Manual and we did not attempt to  evaluate the accuracy of the Recommended or Final Decisions, or the  scientific and medical judgements used to support them. For each  adjudication step noted in the DCI, the reviewer documented whether and  how the step was taken and each reviewer\u2019s DCI responses were  checked and verified by another reviewer. Upon analyzing our DCI data,  we developed a list of 44 claims that we flagged as being potentially  inconsistent. DOL reviewed our list and agreed with our findings for many  claims. DOL also provided an explanation or clarification regarding other  claims that justified their removal from the list. As a result of this  verification step, we removed 11 claims from our list, leaving 33 that we  deemed inconsistent.", "To determine how new links between toxic substances and diseases are  captured and applied in the adjudication process, we reviewed  adjudication guidance, including DOL\u2019s EEOICPA Procedure Manual,  Circulars, and Bulletins.
