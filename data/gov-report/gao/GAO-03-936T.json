As a result of this analysis, in July 2002 NARA issued a  draft proposal for the redesign of federal records management.  Third, based on comments received on the proposal, it is developing  a redesigned records scheduling, appraisal, and accessioning  process, as well as prototype and functional requirements for  automated tools for the redesigned process.

As a result, for these four  agencies alone, over 800 systems had not been inventoried, and the  electronic records maintained in them had not been scheduled.  Scheduling the electronic records in a large number of major  information systems presents an enormous challenge, particularly  since it generally takes NARA, in conjunction with agencies, well  over 6 months to approve a new schedule.", "Failure to inventory systems and schedule records places these  records at risk. The absence of inventories and schedules means  that NARA and agencies have not examined the contents of these  information systems to identify official government records,  appraised the value of these records, determined appropriate  disposition, and directed and trained employees in how to maintain  and when and how to dispose of these records. As a result,  temporary records may remain on hard drives and other media long  after they are needed or could be moved to less costly forms of  storage.

The availability of applications that conform to the  standard may be helpful in encouraging agencies to adopt records  management systems that address electronic records."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NARA Plans Comprehensive Approach to Improving Agency Records Management", "paragraphs": ["In response to its own mission needs and our recommendations of  June 2002 regarding its inspection program, NARA has documented  a new strategy for assessing agencies\u2019 management of records. This  strategy is described in draft documents that describe NARA\u2019s plans  for setting priorities and for conducting inspections and studies. The  new approach is now being piloted with the Department of  Homeland Security; the results of the pilot\u2014expected by September  30, 2003\u2014will determine whether it is extended governmentwide.", "The main features of the draft strategy are as follows:", "NARA will evaluate agencies and work processes in terms of risk to  records, implications for legal rights and accountability, and the  quantity and value of the permanent records; it will focus its  resources on high-priority areas. This process of assessing risks and  priorities will involve NARA staff with subject-matter and agency  expertise, and it will address records management governmentwide.", "NARA plans to use a variety of means to address areas identified for  attention through its risk and priority assessment. Among the means  being considered are targeted assistance, records management  studies, and inspections. The strategy indicates that NARA has  changed its approach to targeted assistance: Rather than using it  only when an agency requests assistance, NARA intends to  recommend that an agency accept targeted assistance when NARA  has identified records management issues at that agency that require  attention. In addition, NARA plans to perform studies on records  management best practices as a means not only to encourage good  records management practices throughout government, but also to  recognize agencies whose records management programs have  exemplary features. According to the strategy, inspections will be  conducted only under exceptional circumstances, when the risk to  records is deemed high, and after other means have failed to  mitigate risks (e.g., targeted assistance, training, and so on).", "NARA intends to focus on the core functions of the federal  government, rather than on individual agencies. It will use as its  starting point the business areas defined in the Business Reference  Model of the Federal Enterprise Architecture. By focusing on the  Business Reference Model\u2019s broad activities and work processes,  which cut across agency lines, NARA may inspect a single agency or  a group of agencies in one line of business.", "Although NARA\u2019s strategy appears to be a reasonably systematic  approach that allows it to focus its resources appropriately and to  use inspections and other interventions to assess and improve  federal records management, it is not yet complete. Specifically, the  draft strategy does not yet include a description of how NARA will  establish an ongoing program. For example, the priority assessment  plan does not indicate whether NARA will revise its risk  identification process as circumstances warrant, or if this a single- time occurrence. NARA officials have said that the agency will  update its priority and risk assessments periodically, but this is not  yet reflected in the plan. Further, the strategy states that the results  of studies may be used to improve guidance, but it does not create a  similar feedback loop for inspection results. While records  management guidance may benefit from the \u201cbest practices\u201d  identified in studies, inspection results could also identify areas  where guidance needs to be clarified, augmented, and strengthened.  Finally, no implementation plan or schedule for this new strategy  has yet been devised.", "Without a strategy that provides for establishing an ongoing  program that includes a feedback cycle, as well as complete  implementation plans that fully reflect that strategy, NARA\u2019s efforts  to assess records management programs may not provide it with the  information that it needs to improve its guidance and to support its  redesign of federal records management."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NARA\u2019s Acquisition of ERA Continues to Face Risks", "paragraphs": ["In addition to its efforts to improve records management across the  government, NARA is also acquiring ERA as a means to archive all  types of electronic records and make them accessible, regardless of  changes to hardware and software over time. However, NARA faces  significant challenges in acquiring ERA. ERA will be a major  information system; NARA has no previous experience in acquiring  major information systems. Further, no comparable electronic  archive system is now in existence, in terms of either complexity or  scale. Finally, technology necessary to address some key  requirements of ERA is not commercially available and will have to  be developed. In light of these challenges, NARA will face significant  difficulties in its ERA acquisition unless it addresses   its information technology (IT) organizational capabilities;", "ERA system acquisition policies, plans, and practices; and its ability to control ERA\u2019s cost and schedule.", "NARA has indicated that it needs to strengthen its IT organizational  capabilities and has been taking steps to do so in three key areas:", "IT investment management provides a systematic method for  agencies to minimize risks while maximizing the return on IT  investments.", "An enterprise architecture provides a description\u2014in useful models,  diagrams, and narrative\u2014of the mode of operation for an agency. It  provides a perspective on agency operations both for the current  environment and for the target environment, as well as a transition  plan for sequencing from the current to the target environment.  Managed properly, an enterprise architecture can clarify and help  optimize the dependencies and relationships among an agency\u2019s  business operations and the underlying IT infrastructure and  applications that support these operations.", "Information security is an important consideration for any  organization that depends on information systems to carry out its  mission. Our study of security management best practices found  that leading organizations manage their information security risk  through an ongoing cycle of risk management.", "NARA has made progress in strengthening these capabilities, but  these efforts are incomplete. For example, NARA has improved its  IT investment management. However, although it is continuing to  develop an enterprise architecture, NARA does not plan to complete  its target architecture in time to influence the ERA system definition  and requirements. In addition, it has completed some elements of an  information security program, but several key areas have not yet  been addressed (such as individual system security plans), and  NARA has not assessed the security risks to its major information  systems.", "In addition, NARA has developed policies, plans, and practices to  guide the ERA acquisition, but these do not consistently conform to  industry standards and federal acquisition guidance. NARA has  chosen to follow Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  (IEEE) standards in developing its policies, plans, and practices.  Examples of these include (1) a concept of operations that  describes the characteristics of a proposed system from the users\u2019  viewpoint and provides the framework for all subsequent activities  leading to system deployment, (2) an acquisition strategy that  establishes how detailed acquisition planning and program  execution will be accomplished, and (3) a risk management plan to  identify potential problems and adjusting the acquisition to mitigate  them. However, key policy and planning documents are missing  elements that are required by the standards and federal acquisition  guidance: for example, the ERA acquisition strategy did not satisfy  15 of 32 content elements required by the relevant IEEE standard.", "Further, NARA is unable to track the cost and schedule of the ERA  project. The ERA schedule does not include all program tasks and  lacks a work breakdown structure, which would include detail on  the amount of work and resources required to complete each task.", "Unless NARA can address these issues, the risk is increased that the  ERA system will fail to meet user expectations, and that NARA may  not have the information required to control the cost of the system  or the time it will take to complete it.", "In light of these risks, our briefing included recommendations to  NARA to address the weaknesses in its acquisition policies, plans  and procedures and to improve its ability to adequately track the  project\u2019s cost and schedule."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
