In particular, the act limits Food Stamp Program participants who are able-bodied adults between the ages of 18 and 50 and without dependents to 3 months of food stamp benefits within a 3-year period unless they (1) meet work requirements or (2) are exempted from these requirements because they live in areas with high unemployment or an insufficient number of jobs. These able-bodied adults can meet the work requirements by (1) working a minimum of 80 hours a month; (2) participating in qualifying state employment and training programs for 20 hours a week; or (3) participating in Workfare, which provides work in a public service capacity in exchange for public benefits, such as food stamps.", "Concerns were raised that some of the able-bodied adults without dependents who were willing to work were not able to find opportunities to meet the Welfare Reform Act\u2019s work requirements. In response, in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Congress increased funding for the Food Stamp Employment and Training Program to a total of $212 million for fiscal year 1998 and specified that 80 percent of the total had to be spent to help able-bodied adults without dependents meet the work requirements. The Balanced Budget Act also gave the states the option of exempting up to 15 percent of all able-bodied adults without dependents not otherwise exempted from the work requirements.", "This report responds to your request for information on (1) the number of able-bodied adults without dependents who are receiving food stamp benefits, the number who are required to meet the work requirements, and the number who are exempted from the requirements; (2) the number of able-bodied adults without dependents participating in qualifying employment and training or Workfare programs; and (3) the amounts of federal grant funds that states spent through the first three quarters of fiscal year 1998 for employment and training or Workfare programs for food stamp recipients.", "The information we developed in response to your request is based in part on our September 1998 survey of state officials administering food stamp employment and training programs. Officials in all the states and the District of Columbia responded to our survey covering participation in the Food Stamp Program by able-bodied adults without dependents for the months of April, May, and June 1998. Most states provided estimates of participation, while a few were able to provide data from their records. Forty-two state agencies\u2014which served just over 90 percent of food stamp participants nationwide\u2014provided sufficient data for reporting on the number of able-bodied adults without dependents who were receiving food stamps and were required to meet the work requirements or who were waived or exempted from those requirements. Only 24 states\u2014which served about half of food stamp participants nationwide\u2014were able to provide sufficient data for reporting on the numbers of able-bodied adults without dependents who were participating in employment and training and/or Workfare."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Food Stamp Program helps low-income individuals and families obtain a more nutritious diet by supplementing their income with food stamp benefits. The average monthly food stamp benefit was about $70 per person during fiscal year 1997. The program is a federal-state partnership in which the federal government pays the cost of the food stamp benefits and 50 percent of the states\u2019 administrative costs. The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) administers the program at the federal level. The states\u2019 responsibilities include certifying eligible households and calculating and issuing benefits to those who qualify.", "The Food Stamp Employment and Training Program, which existed prior to the Welfare Reform Act, was established to ensure that all able-bodied recipients registered for employment services as a condition of food stamp eligibility. The program\u2019s role is to provide food stamp recipients with opportunities that will lead to paid employment and decrease dependency on assistance programs. In fiscal year 1997, the states were granted $79 million in federal employment and training funding and spent $73.9 million, or 94 percent of the grant. In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Congress increased grant funding for the Food Stamp Employment and Training Program to a total of $212 million for fiscal year 1998 and specified that 80 percent of the total had to be spent to help able-bodied adults without dependents meet the work requirements. For fiscal year 1999, the Congress provided $115 million in employment and training funding. These funds remain available until expended.", "Employment programs that the states choose to offer may involve the public and private sectors. For example, Workfare, which qualifies as an employment program under the Welfare Reform Act, requires individuals to work in a public service capacity in exchange for public benefits such as food stamps. Some states also allow participants to meet the work requirements by volunteering at nonprofit organizations. However, under the Welfare Reform Act, job search and job readiness training are specifically excluded as qualifying activities for meeting the act\u2019s work requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Over Half of Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents Are Required to Work", "paragraphs": ["During April, May, and June 1998, a monthly average of about 514,200 able-bodied adults without dependents received food stamp benefits, according to information from the 42 states providing sufficient data for analysis. These adults represented about 3 percent of the monthly average of 17.5 million food stamp participants in the 42 states during that period. Of the 514,200 individuals, about 58 percent, or 296,400 of the able-bodied adults without dependents were required to meet the work requirements; 40 percent, or 208,200, were exempted from these requirements because they lived in geographic areas that had received waivers; and 2 percent, or 9,600, had been exempted by the states from the work requirements. (See app. I for state-by-state information.)", "The number of able-bodied adults without dependents receiving food stamp benefits has apparently declined in recent years, as has their share of participation in the program. For example, in 1995, a monthly average of 1.2 million able-bodied adults without dependents in 42 states participated in the Food Stamp Program, compared with the 514,200 individuals who participated in the period we reviewed. In addition, in 1995, 5 percent of food stamp participants were estimated to be able-bodied adults without dependents, compared with the 3 percent we identified through our survey of the states. FNS and state officials accounted for these differences by pointing out that (1) food stamp participation has decreased overall\u2014from about 27 million per month nationwide in 1995 to about 19.5 million in April, May, and June 1998; (2) some able-bodied adults without dependents may have obtained employment and no longer needed food stamps; and (3) others who were terminated from the program may not have realized that they could regain eligibility for food stamp benefits through participation in state-sponsored employment and training programs or Workfare. Also, the states vary in the criteria they use for identifying able-bodied adults subject to the work requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Relatively Few Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents Participated in Employment and Training and Workfare Programs", "paragraphs": ["During April, May, and June 1998, a monthly average of 23,600 able-bodied adults without dependents filled employment and training and/or Workfare positions in the 24 states that provided sufficient data for analysis. Fifteen of these states offered Workfare positions, 20 offered employment and training positions, and 11 offered both Workfare and employment and training positions. The 23,600 individuals accounted for about half of the 47,000 able-bodied adults without dependents who were offered state-sponsored employment and training assistance and/or Workfare positions. More specifically:", "Able-bodied adults without dependents filled about 8,000 Workfare positions per month, or 34 percent of the 23,700 Workfare positions offered by the 15 states with Workfare positions;", "Able-bodied adults without dependents filled about 15,600 employment and training positions per month, or 67 percent of the 23,300 employment and training positions offered by the 20 states. (See app. I for state-by-state information.)", "These 23,600 individuals accounted for about 17 percent of the 137,200 able-bodied adults without dependents who were subject to the work requirements in those states. Of the remaining 113,600, some may have been within the 3-month time frame for receiving food stamp benefits while not working, others may have met these requirements by finding jobs or Workfare positions on their own, and some may not have met the work requirements, thereby forfeiting their food stamp benefits.", "FNS and state officials said they could not yet explain the limited participation in employment and training and Workfare programs, but FNS officials and some states are trying to develop information on the reasons for low participation. In addition, some suggested that able-bodied adults without dependents participated to a limited extent in employment and training programs and Workfare because they (1) participate sporadically in the Food Stamp Program, (2) prefer not to work, or (3) believe that the relatively low value of food stamp benefits is not enough of an incentive to meet the work requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Spent Less Than Authorized", "paragraphs": ["With only 3 months remaining in fiscal year 1998, the states were spending at a rate that would result in the use of significantly less grant funds for food stamp employment and training recipients than authorized. For the first three quarters of the fiscal year, through June 30, 1998, the states spent only 28.4 percent, or $60.2 million, of the $212 million in grants, according to FNS data. The rate of spending varied widely by state, ranging from 75 percent, or about $230,000 of the $307,000 authorized for South Dakota, to less than 1 percent, or $109,000 of the $13.4 million authorized for Michigan. Twenty-five of the states spent less than 20 percent of their grant funds, 17 spent between 20 and 49 percent, and 9 spent 50 percent or more. Also, according to preliminary fourth-quarter financial data reported to FNS, 43 states spent about $72 million, or 41 percent of the grant funds available to them for fiscal year 1998. (See app. II.)", "To better understand why the states were spending less of their grant funds than authorized, we interviewed food stamp directors and employment and training officials in 10 geographically dispersed states.In general, according to these officials, grant spending has been significantly less than authorized because (1) some states had a limited number of able-bodied adults without dependents who were required to work, (2) some states needed time to refocus their programs on able-bodied adults without dependents, and (3) some states reported that it was difficult to serve clients in sparsely populated areas because of transportation problems or the lack of appropriate jobs. When asked whether spending would change in fiscal year 1999, state officials had differing expectations. Officials from 4 of the 10 states\u2014Georgia, Iowa, Ohio, and West Virginia\u2014said that they anticipate spending about the same or less, and Pennsylvania officials were unsure whether spending would change. In contrast, officials from five states\u2014Illinois, Michigan, Rhode Island, Texas, and Washington\u2014anticipate increases in spending, mostly because of the improvements they have made to their employment and training programs.", "In discussing the rate of grant spending, officials of five states\u2014Georgia, Pennsylvania, Washington, Texas, and West Virginia\u2014said that the requirement to spend 80 percent of funds on able-bodied adults without dependents had caused them to decrease employment and training services to other food stamp participants. For fiscal year 1998, a maximum of 20 percent of the available grant funds\u2014$42 million\u2014was available for employment and training activities for other food stamp recipients, while $79 million had been provided for employment and training activities for all food stamp recipients in fiscal year 1997. State officials explained that prior to fiscal year 1998, most employment and training funds had been spent for food stamp participants who were not able-bodied adults without dependents. With the shift in funds to able-bodied adults without dependents, less has remained for the other food stamp recipients, who typically had constituted the majority of the employment and training participants in the past.
