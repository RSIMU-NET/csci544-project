The difference is primarily due to three reasons. First, the government pays about 80 percent of the housing costs for a family that lives in private housing compared to paying 100 percent for a family in government housing. Second, the government pays significantly less federal school impact aid for military dependents when they live in private housing, which is subject to local property taxes.

But DOD recognized that it could not afford to construct enough housing for all personnel with dependents. Thus, in the mid-1960s, DOD adopted the policy of relying primarily on private-sector housing in areas where affordable housing was available and paying service members allowances to help defray their housing costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of Private Housing Reduces Government Costs", "paragraphs": ["In 1993, CBO issued a report on military family housing in the United States that addressed many issues related to reducing the cost of the family housing program. The report included an analysis comparing the average annual cost of a military housing unit with the cost of a private-sector housing unit obtained by a military family. The comparison showed that in the long run the government spent $5,500 more annually when military housing was provided instead of paying an allowance for a family to live in private-sector housing.", "In response to the report, DOD performed an analysis comparing the same costs. Because of some differences in the assumptions and data used for some cost elements such as long-term capital investment and school impact aid costs, the DOD estimates differed somewhat from the CBO study. However, DOD also concluded that the reduced costs to the government by using private-sector housing was significant\u2014about $3,200 per family annually.", "Key details of the two analyses are shown in table 2.1.", "A primary reason for the cost difference is that military families pay a portion of the housing costs out of pocket when they live in private housing. Families living in private housing typically pay about 20 percent of their housing costs out of pocket because housing allowances cover about 80 percent of average housing costs. CBO estimated that a family\u2019s out-of-pocket cost would be $1,700 annually and DOD estimated the cost would be $1,929. The out-of-pocket amount must be paid from other sources, such as other military compensation or spousal income. Families living in government quarters do not pay out-of-pocket costs because the military pays all housing and utility costs.", "The difference in federal impact aid paid by the Department of Education and DOD is another key factor explaining the difference in the costs to the government. Impact aid is paid to local governments to help cover the cost of educating dependents of military members. The impact aid for each dependent is significantly higher for students that live with their families in government quarters because government housing is not subject to local property taxes. When military families live in private housing, a much smaller amount is paid for each student because the housing unit is subject to local property taxes.", "The CBO analysis found a third factor contributing to the difference in government housing costs. For a variety of reasons, CBO and others have concluded that the private sector can build, operate, and maintain housing more economically than DOD. For example, table 2.1 shows that CBO estimated that the cost of a government housing unit, excluding school impact aid, was $11,100 annually. In comparison, the estimated annual cost of a private housing unit was $9,200. (This amount is the sum of the housing allowance and the out-of-pocket cost.) According to CBO, the difference of $1,900 represents the extra costs that the military incurs to deliver a housing unit and is caused by the government\u2019s long planning and budgeting cycle, project oversight costs, higher labor costs, and detailed regulations and constraints on housing design and construction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Fiscal Year 1995 Housing Costs", "paragraphs": ["We performed a similar analysis using fiscal year 1995 costs.

We based our estimate of the cost of a private housing unit on the reported housing allowances paid in that year and DOD\u2019s estimates of the costs for school impact aid and referral services.", "Similar to the results of the CBO analysis, our analysis also shows that there are three primary causes for the cost difference to the government. First, military families pay a portion of their housing costs out of pocket when living in private-sector housing. We estimated that these costs would amount to $2,016 in fiscal year 1995.

Instead, even at installations where surrounding communities can meet additional military housing needs, the services continue to operate old housing that does not meet suitability standards and, in some cases, improve or replace government housing. As a result, opportunities for reducing housing costs have been lost because DOD has not taken advantage of the significant savings available from use of private housing.", "DOD and the services have not maximized use of private housing for a variety of reasons, including a reliance on housing requirements analyses that often underestimate the private sector\u2019s ability to meet family housing needs; a concern over quality of life, although there is little evidence that family quality of life is better served through use of government housing; a reluctance to designate a greater portion of existing government housing for use by junior personnel who are less able to afford private housing than senior personnel; and a housing allowance system that results in available private housing being unaffordable in some areas.", "Current initiatives to increase housing allowances and to encourage private investors to build housing for military families have the potential for reducing costs while meeting military family housing needs.

The first problem is that the housing analyses match military family housing requirements against government housing units before considering private housing units. Regardless of the private sector\u2019s ability to meet military housing needs, private-sector housing is considered only if housing deficits remain after the government housing inventory is fully used. The second problem is that many housing analyses assume that only a small portion of a community\u2019s vacant rental units will be available for military families to occupy. As a result, the analyses underestimate private housing availability because they exclude from consideration hundreds of suitable vacant units.", "From a requirements determination perspective, matching housing needs against government housing units, including those that DOD considers unsuitable, before available private housing units is inconsistent with DOD\u2019s policy of relying first on the private sector. For example, if all family housing requirements can be met by government housing units, then private-sector housing is not considered, even though private housing may have been sufficient to meet some, or even all, of the military\u2019s requirements. This situation can result in a self-perpetuating requirement for government housing. The following examples illustrate the problem.", "The Army\u2019s housing requirements model estimated that 844 of Fort Eustis\u2019 1,330 family housing units were surplus. If the model had matched housing requirements against private-sector housing before matching them against government housing, the model would have estimated that 1,170 government units were surplus, an increase of 326 surplus units that could be closed rather than replaced when they reach the end of their economic life. Fort Eustis officials stated that most of the installation\u2019s housing was old and did not meet current suitability standards. At the time of our visit in July 1995, Fort Eustis had ongoing projects to demolish 367 housing units constructed in the 1950s and to upgrade 8 senior officer quarters.

During our visit in April 1996, Fort Knox officials stated that most of the installation\u2019s housing was old and did not meet current suitability standards. They stated that they planned a net reduction of 812 government units by the year 2000 and would like to bring the remaining government housing inventory up to current standards at a cost of about $127 million.", "Army headquarters officials stated that they have decided to change their model so that military requirements are matched first against private-sector housing. The officials stated that the change will result in reporting a greater number of surplus government housing units and will help Army officials identify installations where old government housing units could be closed to save operating costs. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps officials did not indicate that they planned to change the requirements determination process to consider private-sector housing first.", "The second problem in the requirements determination process that can understate the private sector\u2019s ability to meet military housing needs is the methods that are used to estimate how many vacant rental units will be available to military families. The Air Force and other housing experts consider that the natural rental vacancy rate in most markets is about 5 percent. This vacancy rate provides for vacancies caused by normal rental turnover and by rental units undergoing repairs or renovations. Vacant rental units above the 5-percent level often are called excess vacancies and normally are considered available for rent.", "Air Force officials stated that all suitable excess vacancies should be considered as being available to the military.

However, the requirements analyses from these installations estimated that they would only use 1,223 rental vacancies.

Also, in its 1993 report on military family housing, CBO reported that \u201cnot all, or even most, families who value the on-base life-style would choose to live in DOD housing if they were faced with paying its full cost . . . It seems likely that without the implicit price subsidy for DOD housing, many more families would choose to live in the private sector.\u201d", "Although little data is available on service member housing preferences, we identified some information that cast doubt on the view that members prefer government housing. For example, a May 1995 report on quality of life in the Air Force concluded that \u201cmore Air Force personnel live off-base and given the means, prefer to live off-base.\u201d The report stated that the factors, ranked in order, that affected members\u2019 decisions to live in government or private housing included where they were stationed, safety, cost, and housing quality. Similarly, a January 1995 report on quality of life in the Marine Corps reported that members living in private housing were more satisfied with their residence than those living in on-base family housing.", "During our visit to the Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet, in August 1995, housing officials and top enlisted personnel stated that the quality of life of military families was better served through use of private housing. They stated that most military families prefer to live in civilian communities, particularly when they can afford to purchase homes.", "Concerning the impact that housing conditions have had on military quality of life and readiness, we found little evidence that retention or recruitment has been affected adversely by existing housing conditions. For example, in DOD\u2019s annual report on personnel readiness for fiscal year 1995, DOD reported that skillful management of the force drawdown since fiscal year 1992 has allowed DOD to improve the quality of the force and its readiness. Also, a DOD news release in November 1995 reported that the armed services had met their fiscal year 1995 recruiting goals \u201cwhile maintaining the high quality necessary to maintain a capable, ready force.\u201d", "Similarly, a Navy survey of enlisted personnel who left the service in fiscal year 1995 showed that the top three reasons for leaving were basic pay, promotion and advancement opportunities, and amount of family separation. A comparable fall 1995 Army survey of enlisted personnel reported that the top four reasons for leaving the Army were the amount of basic pay, quality of Army life, promotion opportunity, and separation from family.

When the private housing near these installations is too expensive for junior personnel, this practice can increase reported housing deficits because junior personnel may be living in private housing that is considered too expensive or otherwise unsuitable for their paygrades.", "For example, the Navy\u2019s November 1993 housing analysis for the Norfolk naval complex forecasted a deficit of 2,171 housing units for 1998. The deficit primarily reflected the shortage of private housing that was affordable to junior enlisted personnel. However, the analysis also reported that enough private housing was available and affordable to meet the housing needs for all officers and most senior enlisted personnel. If senior personnel and their families lived in private housing and if the government housing currently reserved for their use were redesignated for use by junior personnel, the reported deficit would be 775 units, a decrease of 1,396 units.", "This problem with housing for junior enlisted personnel is caused by two factors. First, because housing allowances increase with rank, junior enlisted personnel are least able to afford private-sector housing. In the Washington, D.C., area, for example, the monthly housing allowance for the family of a junior enlisted member in paygrade E-3 is $659. The allowance for an E-6 family is $893, or 35 percent more than the E-3 family\u2019s allowance.", "Second, junior enlisted families are more likely to live in private housing than higher graded personnel because proportionally less government housing is assigned to junior members and their families. In fiscal year 1995, about 22 percent of junior enlisted members\u2019 families in paygrades E-1 through E-3 lived in government housing compared to 37 percent of the families in paygrades E-4 through E-6 and 30 percent of the families in paygrades E-7 through E-9.", "DOD officials agreed that the relatively low proportion of government housing assigned to junior personnel is a problem. They stated that one reason the situation exists is because, prior to the early 1970s, junior enlisted personnel with dependents normally were not authorized to live in government family housing. As a result, housing constructed before that time was designed for more senior personnel and designated for their exclusive use. Many members continue to view assignment to government quarters as a privilege traditionally available to more senior, career personnel.", "DOD officials also stated that, although more government housing has been made available for junior enlisted personnel over the past few years, some installations continue to reserve government housing for senior personnel in areas where senior personnel can afford to live in private housing. They stated that some installation commanders are reluctant to designate more government housing for junior personnel because of the perceived adverse impact on senior personnel. Specifically, some commanders are concerned that requiring senior personnel to live in private housing so that junior personnel can live on base will be viewed by senior members as a reduction in their benefits and quality of life.", "Although we understand the reasons supporting the reluctance to designate more quarters for junior personnel, the practice can reduce the savings available to the government by maximizing use of private housing. Also, to lessen the potential impact on senior personnel and their families, housing redesignations could be accomplished over a phased period of time as the families move from government housing when transferred to other duty stations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Allowances Keep Private Housing From Being Affordable", "paragraphs": ["Another factor that contributes to the continued reliance on government housing is the high cost of private housing. DOD officials stated that many communities surrounding military installations have housing that is available to military families but often the housing is not affordable. DOD considers private housing to be unaffordable to a family if the housing costs, including utilities, exceed an amount equal to the sum of a member\u2019s basic housing allowance, variable housing allowance, and an additional 50 percent of the basic allowance.", "Our analysis of the housing situation at 21 installations identified several cases where private housing was available but was considered to be unaffordable. For example, the Navy\u2019s October 1994 housing analysis for the San Diego naval complex reported that affordability, rather than availability, of private housing was a key reason causing a military housing deficit in the area. The analysis reported that in 1994, 41 percent of all one- and two-bedroom rental units and 98 percent of all three-bedroom rental units were not affordable to service members in paygrades E-1 through E-3. For all enlisted paygrades, 20 percent of all one- and two-bedroom rental units and 75 percent of all three-bedroom units were not affordable. Partly because similar affordability problems were predicted for 1999, the analysis estimated that a housing deficit would continue.", "Affordability of private housing was also a key problem reported in the March 1994 housing analysis for the Marine Corps\u2019 Twentynine Palms installation. The analysis predicted that in 1998, 45 percent of all one- and two-bedroom rental units and 100 percent of all three-bedroom rental units would be unaffordable to service members in paygrades E-1 through E-3. The analysis also reported that over 1,200 military families who lived in private rental housing in 1993 were unacceptably housed primarily because of high costs. However, service members in most paygrades at Twentynine Palms do not receive the variable portion of the housing allowance because the installation is not considered to be in a high-cost area.", "Assuming that the market analyses correctly reported the actual costs of private-sector housing, situations such as these raise questions about the adequacy of the housing allowance program. In addition to helping defray housing costs when living in the private sector, housing allowances are intended to equalize housing costs paid by service members in the same paygrade, regardless of where they live in the United States. In other words, housing allowances are designed so that members in the same paygrade should pay the same amount of their housing costs whether they live in a rural, low-cost area or in an urban, high-cost area. For example, for fiscal year 1996, housing allowances were established at levels so that an E-5 family living in private housing will pay about $153 a month out of pocket for housing costs, regardless of where the family lives in the United States. The housing allowance is supposed to cover the remaining portion of the typical total housing costs for each geographic area.", "If housing allowances functioned as intended, it appears unlikely that an installation\u2019s housing analysis would find that most private-sector housing was unaffordable to military families. Yet, this is the case in some locations. According to DOD officials, the primary explanation for this is that a different measure of housing costs is used to determine housing allowances than is used to determine private housing affordability in housing analyses. To illustrate, the variable portion of the housing allowance is based on the amount service members actually spend for housing in a geographic area. In contrast, the housing analyses determine private housing affordability on the basis of average rents charged in an area for housing of the size and quality that members are entitled to.", "Use of different measures of housing costs can cause allowances to spiral downward relative to actual housing costs in an area, making private housing less affordable. For various reasons, such as keeping housing costs to a minimum, members in a geographic area may choose less housing than they are entitled to. For example, a family entitled to four bedrooms if living on base may rent a three-bedroom apartment or a house in a less desirable neighborhood. These members report lower housing expenditures than they would if they obtained the size and quality of housing they are entitled to if they lived in on-base housing. Because allowances are based on expenditures, the result is that allowances for some areas are established at levels lower than they would be if they were based on an area\u2019s average housing costs. Lower housing allowance amounts in subsequent years can result in families obtaining even less quality or quantity of housing, causing a downward spiral to develop.", "A key issue is that this problem results in some installations reporting larger housing deficits due to the unaffordability of private housing. Under the current system, the deficits can be used to justify the need to build new or renovate existing government housing. Although we did not perform a detailed analysis, it appears plausible that at some installations increased allowances would make more private housing affordable and be a more cost-effective alternative than continued use of government housing. Our point is that DOD normally does not consider options involving changes to housing allowances when considering solutions to housing problems at specific locations.", "DOD officials stated that a working group has been formed to study the housing allowance program to determine whether changes are needed.

In the current environment of constrained defense budgets, the short-term flexibility offered by housing allowances appears preferable to the long-term commitments required by military construction. For example, family housing requirements fluctuate as changes occur in the missions and in the number of personnel assigned to each installation. Generally, such changes in housing requirements can be accommodated more easily through use of housing allowances compared to the construction, operation, and maintenance of fixed inventories of government housing units. Further, housing allowances also can offer service members a greater selection of housing options to fit their needs instead of limiting them to what is available in government housing.", "Although DOD\u2019s policy of relying first on private-sector housing to meet family housing needs is cost-effective, the military services have not taken full advantage of the significant savings available through greater use of private housing. This is because DOD and the services have (1) relied on housing requirements analyses that often underestimate the private sector\u2019s ability to meet family housing needs, (2) believed that quality of life of military families is better served through use of government housing, (3) been reluctant to designate a greater portion of existing government housing for use by junior personnel who are less able to afford private housing than senior personnel, and (4) used a housing allowance system that results in available private housing being considered unaffordable in some areas.", "Many military installations in the United States have a justifiable need for government quarters.

In locations where the local communities can meet additional military family housing requirements, existing government housing units can be closed, rather than renovated or replaced, when the units reach the end of their economic life.", "The military family housing program also does not result in equitable treatment for all families. Two thirds of all military families in the United States live in private-sector housing and pay about 20 percent of their housing costs out of pocket.
