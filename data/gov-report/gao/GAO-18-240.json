The federal government spent $14.5 billion through five programs, and 45 state Medicaid agencies spent $1.8 billion. About half of teaching sites that received funding\u2014such as teaching hospitals\u2014received funds from more than one of the five programs.", "GME training costs vary due to the characteristics of teaching sites, such as the number of residents trained and their specialty, which can make it difficult to compare training costs across sites. Further, challenges exist in measuring training costs because some costs, such as faculty teaching time, are difficult to identify. Also, there is no standard method for identifying and capturing training costs, and each teaching site may vary in how it does so.", "While federal agencies generally collect information needed to manage their individual programs, this information is not sufficient to comprehensively understand whether the federal investment in GME training meets national physician workforce needs. The information agencies collect is not always complete or consistent within or across programs. For example, national data on GME training costs are not systematically collected, and some agencies lacked data to understand the total amount spent, or the outcomes of their programs, such as where supported residents went on to practice. GAO recommended in 2015 that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) develop a comprehensive planning approach to identify and address areas of health care workforce need. HHS concurred and identified steps it could take. While HHS has yet to take these steps, the information currently available is also insufficient for such planning. Comprehensive information is needed to identify gaps between federal GME programs and national physician workforce needs\u2014particularly the distribution of physicians geographically or across specialties\u2014and to make or recommend to Congress changes to improve the efficient and effective use of federal funds to meet those needs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that HHS coordinate with federal agencies, including VA, to (1) identify information needed to evaluate federal GME programs, and (2) identify opportunities to improve the quality and consistency of information, and implement these improvements.

The federal programs are managed by multiple agencies\u2014largely  through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). HHS  funding for GME training is distributed by the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS) through the Medicare program, and states may  choose to make payments for GME training with state Medicaid funds,  which are matched by federal Medicaid funding. Other, smaller sources of  federal funding include the Children\u2019s Hospitals GME (CHGME) Payment  Program and the Teaching Health Center GME (THCGME) Program\u2014 payment programs administered by HHS\u2019s Health Resources and  Services Administration (HRSA)\u2014as well as funding from the Department  of Veterans Affairs (VA) for GME training that occurs in its medical  facilities.", "However, we and other experts have raised concerns about the ability of  federal programs that fund GME training, especially Medicare, to address  current and future physician workforce needs. In a 2015 report, we found  that HHS cannot target Medicare GME funding to specific areas of  workforce need because funds are disbursed based on a statutory  formula that is unrelated to projected needs. As a result of this and other  factors, stakeholders have long raised concerns about the distribution of  residents geographically. In a 2017 report, we found that there is an  uneven distribution of residents across the country, with most  concentrating in certain urban centers and the northeast, where GME  training programs have historically been located. The distribution of  residents is particularly important given evidence that physicians tend to  practice in geographic areas similar to those where they complete their  GME training.", "We and others have also raised concerns about a lack of comprehensive  planning for the federal investment in GME training and have called for  increased accountability and transparency of federal GME funding. For  example, the National Academy of Medicine found that there is no single  entity that oversees the GME system, especially federal financing, and  that information about how federal funding, especially Medicare and  Medicaid GME payments, is used to support GME training is lacking. In a  2015 report, we found that HHS conducts limited ongoing, comprehensive  assessments of the performance of federal health care workforce  programs, including those that fund GME training, in meeting the national  health care workforce needs. In addition, we recommended that, to ensure that HHS workforce efforts meet national needs, HHS should  develop a comprehensive and coordinated planning approach to guide its  health care workforce development programs. In making this  recommendation we noted that, without such planning, HHS cannot fully  identify the gaps between existing programs and national needs as well  as the actions needed to address these gaps.", "Given the significant role of the federal government in supporting GME  training, you asked us to review aspects of this spending and related  federal oversight.

Specifically, we analyzed 2015 data on the amount spent and  number of full-time equivalent (FTE) residents supported by each  recipient of funding from Medicare, CHGME, THCGME, and the VA  program. Comprehensive data on Medicaid GME spending and FTE  residents supported were not available from CMS, so we collected 2015  federal and state data using a survey of state Medicaid agencies from 50  states and the District of Columbia. All agencies responded to the  survey. We merged data from the five programs based on each funding  recipient\u2019s Medicare identification number. For each funding recipient,  we calculated the total amount of federal, as well as state Medicaid,  funding received for GME training and, where FTE resident data were  available, the amount of funding received per FTE resident adjusted for  geographic differences in the cost of labor. We also calculated the  extent to which recipients received funding from more than one federal  source. To assess the reliability of each of these sources of data, we  reviewed documentation, interviewed agency officials, and checked the  data for obvious errors. While we discuss CMS data collection efforts later  in this report, we found the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes  of our reporting objective.", "To describe what is known about the costs of GME training programs, we  interviewed experts from seven research and industry organizations  about the costs to train residents, teaching sites\u2019 measurement of costs,  and how costs compare to federal funding levels. We also conducted a  literature review of studies that estimated the costs of training physician  residents. To identify relevant studies, we searched multiple reference  databases and reviewed the abstracts of studies initially identified to  select potentially relevant studies for full review. We also asked for  studies that estimated the costs of GME during interviews with experts. Of  the over 300 studies we initially identified, 10 were deemed relevant  because the studies provided estimates of the costs of training residents.

Challenges exist in measuring and comparing GME  training costs due to a lack of standard cost methodologies across  teaching sites and some training costs being difficult to measure. Further,  little is known about how GME training costs relate to federal GME  funding."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GME Training Costs Vary by Program Size, Type, Setting, Age, and Location", "paragraphs": ["According to literature we reviewed and experts we interviewed, GME  training costs vary by residency program characteristic, and some costs,  such as faculty teaching time, are more prone to variation than others.  Specifically, variation in training costs can be explained by one or more of  the following program characteristics:", "Program size: Larger residency programs may be more cost efficient  than smaller ones in that fixed costs, such as infrastructure and  program administration, can be spread out over a larger number of  residents. Therefore, adding another resident increases variable  costs, but lowers per resident fixed costs.", "Type of Specialty: Residency training in some specialties costs more  than others, and accreditation requirements are one of several factors  driving this variation. For example, compared to internal medicine  programs, accreditation standards for family medicine programs  require more hours of faculty involvement and higher faculty-to- resident ratios. Therefore, these residency programs may incur higher  per resident costs. The complexity of a specialty program also affects  its training costs\u2014for example, subspecialty programs, such as  vascular surgery or gastroenterology, require additional GME training  or specialized equipment and will thus incur more training costs. In  addition, costs can be affected by variation in faculty compensation.  According to a 2013 analysis of available data on residency training  costs, the median compensation for attending physicians in academic  health centers ranged from $163,319 for family medicine to $336,136  for radiation oncology. Further, malpractice insurance premium  costs can vary based on the degree of surgical involvement, with  primary care specialties having the lowest premium costs and general  surgery physicians the highest.", "Type of Training Setting: GME training in outpatient settings, such  as community-based clinics, is considered less efficient and more  expensive than in inpatient hospital settings, according to reviewed  literature and experts we interviewed. One reason for this may be  differences in the models of teaching used in each of these settings.  According to one group of experts we interviewed, residents in  inpatient settings are part of teams that do rounds together, where  much of the teaching time involves one clinical teacher and a team of  residents, nurses, and other affiliated professionals. This method of  teaching may not be feasible in outpatient settings where teaching is  more often provided on a more expensive one-to-one basis.  Outpatient settings, particularly smaller ones, may also have to incur  more fixed costs relative to inpatient settings that may have more  facility space and other resources in place to meet accreditation  requirements.", "Location: Geographic location also drives the variation in training  costs. For example, resident salaries vary based on general salary  patterns across the United States. According to one group of experts  we interviewed, there is a range of compensation packages for  residents, and base salaries can vary from $35,000 to $55,000 per  year. Malpractice insurance may also vary by geographic location.  Further, rural training sites may incur higher costs because their  training may have to utilize multiple training sites\u2014such as community  hospitals or rural health clinics\u2014in order to meet accreditation  requirements for resident rotations and patient case-mix. The added  administrative work of coordinating with other sites to provide these  resources can be a challenge.", "Age of the program: Newer residency programs may have higher  costs than older, more established programs. According to some  GME experts we interviewed, the first year a teaching site operates a  residency program is more expensive because new programs may be  smaller and cannot spread out fixed costs. In addition, it can be  expensive for a new GME program to meet accreditation  requirements, such as required infrastructure and minimum faculty.", "Studies estimating GME training costs show these costs vary by program  characteristics. For example, we identified 10 studies that estimated GME  training costs; however, these studies were not comparable because they  focused on discrete programs with different characteristics, utilized  different methodologies, were conducted at different points in time, and  did not examine the same cost elements. Further, these studies are not  generalizable due to limitations in study methodology, such as small  sample sizes. And, given the age of some of these studies, they may not  be reflective of current GME training costs. Across the 10 studies we  reviewed, estimates of costs ranged from $35,164 to $226,331 per  resident. (See table 8.)", "The Medicare cost reports that hospitals submit annually to CMS, though  they have certain limitations, also suggest variability in residency training  costs. For example, according to the cost reports, in 2015, direct costs  varied from $56,998 to $333,565 per resident (excluding outliers). (See  table 9.) However, these costs are limited to direct GME costs specified in  Medicare guidance, and they have other limitations due to their collection  and reporting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges Exist in Measuring and Comparing GME Training Costs and Little is Known about their Relationship to Federal GME Funding", "paragraphs": ["We found that there is no standard method or tool across teaching sites  for identifying and capturing GME training costs. One expert told us that,  therefore, the reporting of costs depends on how each teaching site, and  the individuals at each site, are tracking and defining those costs. Another  group of experts who conducted a study to estimate GME training costs in  teaching health centers told us they were unable to identify a common  instrument and had to develop their own instrument to standardize costs.", "According to literature we reviewed and experts we interviewed, Medicare  GME guidance for reporting training costs is not always clear, and  differences in how teaching sites define costs can lead to inconsistent  measurement. One expert told us that Medicare GME payment rules are  subject to interpretation, and thus there is variation between teaching  sites in how costs are reported on Medicare cost reports. Other GME  experts told us that many teaching health center residency programs rely  on in-kind benefits, such as building space donated by organizations, but  health centers vary in how they account for the costs of these benefits.  Some teaching health centers will score them as in-kind contributions,  others will provide a square footage cost amount, and others may not  track and report these costs at all. While one group of experts suggested  there be national guidelines to ensure all teaching sites are using the  same rules to define and report costs, one expert cautioned that a  common tool would make it impossible to reflect the unique  characteristics of each program.", "Factors specific to teaching sites may affect how they identify their  training costs. The varying relationships and financial arrangements  between the teaching site, its partners, and its faculty affect how it  allocates and reports training costs. For example, a teaching site may  have various educational partners, such as medical schools and  community-based training sites, and be affiliated with multiple hospitals,  each of which tracks costs differently. Teaching sites differ in how they  share training costs with these partners. In addition, faculty arrangements  vary. For example, in some cases faculty are employees of the teaching  site and in other cases, faculty bill for their services independently.  Moreover, facilities vary in the experience of their personnel responsible  for identifying GME training costs. For example, program directors may  not have the financial experience needed to identify costs, and some  teaching sites may use outside consultants to identify costs. Turnover in  the staff responsible for tracking costs, lack of communication between  program staff and the accounting departments, or a change in ownership  of the teaching site may add to the challenge of accurately identifying  costs.", "According to studies we reviewed and experts we interviewed, some  GME training costs are difficult to accurately identify and measure. For  example:", "Faculty Costs: Faculty responsibilities are spread out across  education, research, administrative, and patient care activities, and  the time spent in each activity is not always clear. The only allowable  faculty costs on Medicare cost reports are those for education-related  activities, such as the clinical supervision of residents. For example, if  a faculty member performs a procedure while doing rounds with  residents, the teaching site must determine how much of that time  was for patient care and how much was for education. However,  making this determination can be challenging for teaching sites. One  group of experts told us that while most teaching sites have a formula  to calculate these education costs, they are most likely an undercount.  However, another expert said that officials preparing the cost reports  are not systematically splitting faculty time between education and  patient-care activities and are most likely guessing.", "Facility Costs: MAC officials told us that facility costs that hospitals  report on their cost reports should be allocated based on square  footage, building depreciation, and utility costs, but there is some  variation in how teaching sites calculate their square footage. Further,  as previously described, donated building space may not be  accurately identified by teaching sites. Experts who conducted a study  to estimate teaching health center program costs told us that several  centers in their study were not accustomed to thinking of donated  space as a residency program expense.", "Indirect Medical Education Costs: There is not a clear and  consistent definition of the indirect medical education costs, and there  may be variability in these costs. Furthermore, there is little incentive  for teaching sites to accurately identify these costs because Medicare  does not require them for purposes of determining IME payments,  according to one reviewed study. As a result, it is unclear what  indirect costs the Medicare IME payment adjustment is meant to  cover. Additionally, experts told us that it is difficult to measure the  extent to which costs associated with the unique services that  teaching sites provide, such as stand-by services or their role as a  safety net provider, are attributable to GME training.", "Resident benefits for teaching site costs and productivity: The  benefits that residents provide can generate cost savings and revenue  for the teaching site, yet the extent of these benefits can be difficult to  calculate. According to one study we reviewed, the value that  residents provide cannot be measured directly; rather, the value is  reflected in the teaching site\u2019s patient care costs and on the clinical  productivity of attending physicians. One expert we interviewed said  that identifying when residents move from a cost to a financial benefit  is complicated and depends, for example, on a resident\u2019s year of  training and residency program requirements. Also, the value of  resident services can vary by specialty. For example, residents in  general surgery or internal medicine provide more on-call services  than residents in dermatology or radiation oncology. Although the  cost savings and revenue generated by residents has an effect on the  net costs of GME training, it is typically not accounted for when  estimating costs.", "In addition to these challenges, federal agencies do not systematically  collect and standardize cost information at the national level, according to  literature we reviewed and experts we interviewed. For example, a HRSA  study identified training costs in teaching health centers, but the study  only captured costs over one year and did not include all THCGME  programs. Further, in addition to inconsistencies in how teaching sites  collect data for Medicare cost reports, the data do not include the revenue  impact and actual indirect costs associated with training residents and  cannot be broken down by specialty programs. In addition, they are not a  comprehensive source of training costs because they are limited to  teaching sites that received Medicare GME payments. It does not include  other teaching sites, such as medical schools, teaching health centers,  and teaching hospitals that may have only received other federal funding  for GME training, such as VA GME payments. Finally, because Medicare  cost report data are not generally used to calculate GME payments, they  are not reviewed or audited by contractors except when new teaching  sites establish their base year PRA.", "Further, teaching sites may not have accurately reported costs used to  calculate Medicare DGME payments. According to experts we  interviewed, at the time that most teaching sites established the base  year PRAs used to calculate DGME payments, teaching site accounting  practices and their varying financial relationships with affiliated education  partners may have led them to over-report or under-report their costs.  As a result, there is variation in sites\u2019 PRAs, which may not reflect actual  variation in direct costs. To identify how the PRA compares to reported  direct training costs, we compared teaching site PRAs with the direct  training costs that they reported for 2015 (though reported costs may not  accurately reflect all GME training costs, as previously noted). For  teaching sites in the median range, their Medicare DGME payment  covered 67 percent of their reported direct training costs in 2015.  However, we found wide variation across teaching sites\u2014the PRA ranged  from 31 to 157 percent (excluding outliers) of teaching sites\u2019 reported  direct costs. (See table 10.)", "In addition to the challenges of identifying and comparing costs, little is  known about their relationship to federal GME funding. Some studies  have analyzed federal GME funding relative to GME training costs but do  not consistently indicate whether federal payments accurately reflect  training costs. For example, both the Medicare Payment Advisory  Commission and HHS found that the Medicare IME payment adjustment  exceeds the actual indirect costs that teaching sites incur from operating  GME programs. The studies recommended modifying the IME payment  adjustment. However, another study found that indirect medical education  costs and other costs, such as stand-by services, add to patient care  costs in teaching hospitals, and concluded that a reduction in the  Medicare IME payment adjustment could result in insufficient Medicare  payments to cover these costs. Other studies found that federal funding  is lower than actual program costs. For example, one study estimated the  per resident training cost in teaching health centers in fiscal year 2017 to  be $157,602, compared to the $95,000 per resident that was being  provided in federal funding. Another study found that their average  $183,138 per resident cost estimate for internal medicine programs of  120 residents exceeded Medicare DGME payments in 2012 by  approximately $160,000 per resident, and noted that other sources of  funding, including Medicare IME payments, subsidized training costs.", "The relationship between training costs and federal GME funding is  complicated by the nature of how most GME payments are made. For  example, with respect to Medicare GME payments, the largest source of  federal GME funding, payments are not based on actual costs, and there  are no reporting requirements for how teaching sites use the payments.  Specifically, teaching sites distribute these payments depending on their  needs and the needs of their affiliates, making it difficult to understand the  relationship between GME funding and training costs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Information the Federal Government Collects to Manage Programs Is Not Sufficient to Comprehensively Understand Its Investment in GME Training", "paragraphs": ["Agencies generally collect information to manage their respective  programs, ensure the accuracy of payments, and reduce the potential for  duplicative payments within or across federal programs that fund GME  training.

To manage their  programs, agencies use information, such as the total number of FTE  residents and training costs, to calculate payments. For example, VA  medical facilities use information that academic affiliates report about the  costs of their resident salaries and benefits to set payment rates used to  reimburse the affiliates. And, information about individual residents is  used to verify that recipients accurately reported, according to resident  counting rules, the number of FTE residents used to calculate payments.  For example, MACs use IRIS data about residents\u2019 number of years  completed in all types of GME training programs to verify that residents  who have completed their initial residency period were only counted as  half (50 percent) when determining the DGME payment amount.

CMS does not use  this information except to determine the amount of federal matching funds  for each state. While state Medicaid agencies report the aggregate  amount of GME supplemental payments they make to CMS, there are no  federal requirements that states or teaching institutions report information  about supplemental payments at the provider level, the aggregate or  provider-level amount of add-on adjustments to the state\u2019s payment rates  for GME training, or how these payments support GME training. Rather,  CMS officials said that states have the option to collect information about  Medicaid GME payments. However, of the 45 state Medicaid agencies  that reported on our survey that they paid for GME training, less than half  (20 states) indicated that they require funding recipients to report any  information related to Medicaid GME payments, such as the number or  type of residents supported.", "While the risk of duplication is reduced by each program\u2019s design, federal  agencies also use the information collected to identify duplicative  payments within and between most of the federal programs, with the  exception of Medicaid. For example, IRIS data is used to identify whether  more than one hospital claimed the same resident\u2019s time for purposes of  Medicare GME payments. Also, according to HRSA officials, contractors  conduct assessments of the FTE resident counts reported by recipients of  CHGME or THCGME program funding to identify duplication with FTE  residents reported for Medicare GME payments. For example, HRSA  officials told us that its combined academic years 2012-2013, 2013-2014,  and 2014-2015 FTE assessment of the 59 teaching health centers in the  THCGME program identified 6 centers, from 3 unique organizations, that  had a combined total of 6.63 FTE residents that were duplicative with  Medicare FTE resident claims, out of over 1,000 FTE residents reviewed  over that 3-year time period. In addition, HRSA has worked with CMS to  maintain data for this assessment. For example, at HRSA\u2019s request, CMS  added a field to the cost reports to check whether any residents from a  teaching health center rotated to the hospital and, if so, the number that  rotated from a teaching health center. However, these agencies do not  have procedures in place to identify potentially duplicative payments  between their programs and Medicaid GME payments, which totaled $2.3  billion in federal Medicaid spending in 2015. There is no federal  requirement that CMS identify potentially duplicative payments between  Medicaid GME payments and other federal GME programs. And, without  better data collected about Medicaid GME payments, there is limited  information available to identify potentially duplicative payments between,  for example, HRSA\u2019s GME programs and Medicaid GME payments.", "HRSA and VA, which combined provided 13 percent of total federal GME  funding in 2015, use the information collected for ongoing program  performance measurement and program evaluation. HRSA evaluates the  performance of its payment programs. To do so, HRSA collects  information on program outcomes, such as whether supported residents  received training in, or went on to practice in, a medically underserved  area, a primary care setting, or rural area. HRSA uses these performance  measures for ongoing evaluations, for internal and congressional  reporting, and in its budget justification. In addition, HRSA is authorized to  implement a quality bonus system for the CHGME program, which it  plans to do by fiscal year 2019. VA issues a survey to VA residents to  assess, among other things, a resident\u2019s likelihood of considering a future  employment opportunity at a VA medical facility. VA medical facilities are  required to collect detailed records of residents\u2019 participation in assigned  educational activities and they must evaluate each resident according to  accrediting body requirements, such as patient care and medical  knowledge. VA medical facilities are also required to produce an annual  report on each GME training program that includes, among other things,  the accreditation status of its GME training programs, its response to  results of the resident satisfaction survey, and opportunities for  improvement in residents\u2019 education.", "CMS, however, does not use the information it collects for Medicare or  Medicaid to evaluate the performance of these programs toward meeting  physician workforce goals, even though they accounted for 87 percent of  federal GME spending in 2015.

It does not use information collected to evaluate the  performance of Medicare GME payments, such as evaluating the number  of residents supported by specialty or whether residents went on to  practice in rural areas, primary care, or in medically underserved areas.  The officials further noted that Medicare is an insurance program, and not  among the health care workforce programs that are under the purview of  HRSA. Although CMS officials told us that they coordinate with HRSA  regarding Medicare GME payments, HRSA does not conduct research to  inform GME policy related to CMS\u2019s GME payments.

In addition, while CMS uses IRIS to collect  information on the number and type of residents and their number of  years completed in all types of GME training programs of residents  supported by Medicare GME payments, it does not use it to  understand the output of such spending or for health care workforce  planning. CMS also does not collect information on the outcomes  associated with Medicare GME payments, such as whether residents  who were supported by Medicare went on to practice primary care  specialties or in rural or medically underserved areas. Further,  although HRSA collects data about the outcomes of its CHGME and  THCGME programs, this information is self-reported by funding  recipients. However, HRSA officials told us that it has taken steps to  validate the information reported. For example, it has started to collect  residents\u2019 national provider identifiers for residents supported by the  CHGME and THCGME programs, which is used to validate resident  FTE counts and reported outcomes, such as whether residents went  on to practice in primary care.", "Quality Measures: Agencies generally require that GME training  programs be accredited in order to receive funding, and accrediting  bodies are responsible for evaluating the educational quality of GME  training programs. In addition, HRSA and VA collect some information  about the learning experiences of residents in GME training programs  supported, such as whether residents received training in certain topic  areas. HHS and its advisory bodies have proposed tying federal  funding to the performance of the programs. For example, the  President\u2019s budget proposals for fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017 for  HHS proposed to Congress that it be allowed to set standards for  teaching hospitals that receive Medicare GME payments to  emphasize skills that promote high quality and high value in health  care. In addition, the National Academy of Medicine has called for  improved measures of the performance of GME training programs,  and as of October 2017, it had an initiative to identify quality and other  measures, such as residents\u2019 competency or patient outcomes of care  provided by residents.", "Information is also not always consistently collected within programs or  standardized across programs. For example, VA medical facilities report  information centrally to VA about their total payments to academic  affiliates, but they inconsistently used accounting codes to report the total  amount that they spent and did not report the amount they paid each  academic affiliate, limiting the reliability of data VA collects on the total  amount spent on GME. Additionally, VA medical facilities are required to  report annually to VA their approved payment rates that each affiliate  charges, but VA was unable to provide payment rate schedules for all  affiliates in fiscal year 2015. Across all agencies, information about the  number of FTE residents supported was collected at, and for, generally  different points in time and through different reporting systems. (See table  12.) For example, HRSA generally collects FTE resident information  through applications or supporting documentation prior to and at the end  of a fiscal year, while VA collects such information in monthly or quarterly  invoices throughout an academic year. And, CMS collects similar FTE  resident information through cost reports and IRIS files based on each  hospital\u2019s own cost reporting period, which can vary by hospital. In  addition, the five federal programs do not consistently use the same  unique identifiers for their funding recipients, such as a hospital\u2019s  Medicare provider identification number, or individual residents  supported, such as their national provider identifier, which limits the ability  to link data across programs.", "In some cases, data collection may vary across the various GME  programs based on program requirements. Additionally, GME funding  recipients may be required by law to report certain types of information for  some programs, but not for others. For example, THCGME recipients are  required to report on the number of residents trained at the health centers  who completed their residency and care for vulnerable populations living  in underserved areas. Relatedly, CHGME funding recipients are required  to report the number of residents trained at the hospital who completed  their residency training and care for children within the service area of the  hospital or state in which the hospital is located. No similar requirements  apply to Medicare GME recipients.", "Because the information that agencies collect is not always complete or  consistent, HHS does not have sufficient information available to  comprehensively evaluate the federal programs that fund GME training.  As a result, HHS cannot identify problems and make or recommend  changes to Congress in order to improve the efficient and effective use of  federal funds. Under leading practices we derived from GPRA and  GPRAMA and federal standards for internal controls, agencies should  identify and collect complete and reliable information needed to evaluate  the performance of federal programs, while balancing the administrative  costs of such efforts. In addition, agencies should use that information to  monitor performance of programs in order to identify problems and make  changes or recommendations to Congress for improvements.  Improvements in the performance monitoring can enhance and sustain  collaboration and reduce fragmentation within and across federal  agencies that administer programs that fund GME training. However,  because of limitations with the information agencies collect, HHS does  not have information available to comprehensively understand across all  programs that fund GME training, for example, the:  1.  Total amount that the federal government spends on GME training  that includes total Medicaid GME spending and the total amount VA  medical facilities paid to academic affiliates;  2.  The amount the federal government paid each recipient for GME  training, such as the amount paid to each VA academic affiliate;  3.

Whether or not legislation is enacted to implement a  consolidated federal GME grant program, HHS still needs to take actions  to improve the information that agencies collect about how federal funding  is used to support GME training. Such actions are important for HHS to  assess the cost effectiveness of federal efforts to help meet the nation\u2019s  physician workforce needs.", "HHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate.", "In its comments, reproduced in Appendix IV, VA said that it has significant  relationships with other federal funders of GME, including HRSA. In  addition, VA said it looks forward to further dialogue with other agencies  to better share GME information. VA did not provide technical comments.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 20 days from the  report date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the  Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Veterans  Affairs.

However, little is known about these other  sources. Therefore, we analyzed Medicare cost report data to determine  the extent to which teaching hospitals were operating above their FTE  resident caps in 2015\u2014an indication of the extent to which hospitals may  receive other sources of GME funding, such as state or private sources.  We also surveyed state Medicaid Directors from 50 states and the District  of Columbia to collect information on how and the extent to which states  paid for GME training through Medicaid payments, and the states\u2019 related  reporting requirements and oversight activities. As part of our interviews  with experts from research and industry organizations, we asked about  state and private sources of funding for GME training and what is known  about the amount of such funding.", "Teaching hospitals likely utilize state and private sources of funding, as  well as other federal funding, to pay for residents beyond those paid for  by Medicare\u2014the largest federal funder of GME training. Hospitals have  continued to add residents over time even though for most hospitals  Medicare capped funding based on their number of full-time-equivalent  (FTE) residents in 1996. In 2015, about half of teaching hospitals that  receive Medicare GME payments had expanded their GME training  programs above their Medicare FTE cap, and the extent to which they  operate above their cap varied by hospital. We found that 47 percent of  teaching hospitals were operating their GME training programs above  their Medicare FTE cap on direct GME (DGME) payments. These  hospitals had an average of 30.8 additional FTE residents above their  DGME cap, ranging from 1.0 to 284.3 additional FTE residents.", "Most states (45) paid for GME training through their Medicaid programs in  2015; however, states varied in the payment model that they used to  make Medicaid payments for GME training, though most used fee-for- service payments, including supplemental payments. Of the 45 state  Medicaid agencies that paid for GME training, 25 states did so through  fee-for-service payments only; 19 states did so through both fee-for- service and managed care payments; and 1 state (New Jersey) made  managed care payments only.", "Of the 44 states that paid for GME through Medicaid fee-for-service  payments, 21 states paid as an add-on to its fee-for-service rate, and  31 states paid through lump sum supplemental or other payments.", "Of the 20 states that made Medicaid managed care payments for  GME, 12 paid teaching sites directly and 10 states made GME  payments through managed care plans.", "Of the 19 states that paid for GME through both Medicaid fee-for- service and managed care, fee-for-service GME payments made up  48 percent of all Medicaid GME payments, on average, while  managed care payments made up 52 percent. (See table 13.)", "While some states followed the Medicare formula for calculating GME  payments, most have deviated from this method. Of the 43 states that  responded about how they calculated the amount of GME payments, 10  states reported that they followed the Medicare GME payment formula to  calculate Medicaid fee-for-service payments for GME training. In addition,  two states followed Medicare\u2019s formula for making managed care  payments for GME training. Most states (32) followed another method.", "Medicaid GME payments per FTE resident varied by state and within  states, even after adjusting for geographic differences in labor costs.  Specifically, the average combined federal and state payment per FTE  resident ranged from $2,108 in Rhode Island to $100,587 in Arizona.  (See table 14.) The payment per FTE resident also varied within states.  The Medicaid payment per FTE varied the most within Ohio, where the  state reported payments ranging from $1,415 per FTE to $453,098 per  FTE.", "About half of the states (22 of 45) reported that they specified the type of  expenses that its Medicaid GME payments were intended to cover. Of  these 22 states, payments were intended to cover the costs of residents\u2019  salaries and benefits (14 states), faculty salaries and benefits (11 states),  program administration costs (10 states), or indirect medical education  costs (8 states).", "Some state Medicaid agencies have tied their payments to incentives to  expand the physician workforce. Of the 45 states that reported Medicaid  GME payments in 2015, 4 states\u2014Alabama, Montana, New Mexico, and  South Dakota\u2014reported that they restrict payments to the training of  primary care physicians only. (See table 15.) An additional 9 states  required that the funding recipient have a primary care residency  program. In addition, according to experts we interviewed, states have  been considering how to target Medicaid GME payments to meet state  workforce needs. For example, one expert said some states have used  Medicaid payments to expand GME training of physicians in outpatient,  ambulatory care settings. However, Medicaid GME payments generally  go to hospitals. Specifically, 44 of the states reported making payments to  hospitals and 7 states paid other teaching sites, such as teaching health  centers. The one state that did not make payments to teaching hospitals  directed all Medicaid payments for GME training to medical schools.  Further, one expert we interviewed told us that it is difficult for states to  change their GME financing models to direct funding to specific workforce  goals because hospitals are reliant on state GME payments to support  certain residency positions. Instead, states have used a moderate  approach, such as providing additional funding targeted to specific  training, rather than a complete funding overhaul that would redistribute  existing funds.", "Despite the significant investment in GME training by state Medicaid  agencies, which is matched by the federal government, the extent of state  oversight of Medicaid GME spending varied by state. As previously  mentioned, less than half of the states (20 of 45) required teaching sites  that received Medicaid GME payments to report information to the state.  (See table 16.) Among these 20 states, 16 required recipients to report  information on the number of residents or FTE residents, 8 states  required information about direct medical education costs, 6 states  required information about the GME training program specialties  supported, and 4 states required recipients to report information about the  residents\u2019 characteristics, such as their post-graduate year. Of the 10  states that made Medicaid GME payments to managed care plans, 4  states\u2014Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, and Minnesota\u2014set the  methodology or base rate that managed care plans were required to use  to calculate GME payments. None of the states reviewed and approved  payments.", "Further, 44 of the 45 states were able to provide at least some  information on the total amount the state spent on Medicaid GME  payments, but the amount of information they were able to provide varied.  While most states (38) were able to provide data on all GME payments by  recipient, 4 states could provide data on some but not all payments, and 2  states could not provide data on the amount of GME payments by  recipient. And, less than half of the states (18 of 45) were unable to  provide data on either the number of FTE residents or resident counts at  teaching entities that received Medicaid GME payments. (See table 17.)", "Experts we interviewed identified other sources of state and private  funding for GME training.", "Hospitals and health systems: Hospitals may rely on their own  funding to support their residency programs. One expert we  interviewed said that hospitals that sponsor GME residency programs  provide funding for certain specialty residency programs that make  money for the hospital.", "State government grant or other funding: Aside from GME funding  through Medicaid, one expert told us that some states make direct  grants to residency programs, mostly primary care residency  programs, or through state appropriations specifically for GME  training. For example, Florida created an $80 million fund to support  state training in outpatient or community-based programs. And, one  expert told us that some states have developed innovative funding  mechanisms. This was the case in Georgia, which established a  hospital coalition that funded 400 new residency slots to meet the  needs of medically underserved populations.", "Private health insurers: Experts said GME funding from private  health insurers is generally thought to be provided through higher  reimbursement rates to teaching hospitals than nonteaching hospitals,  including through Medicare reimbursement. While private insurers  fund GME training through their contracts with individual hospitals,  one expert told us that those contracts do not likely differentiate the  amount of funding that is used toward GME training versus other  activities. However, one expert raised concerns that private insurers  are not paying their share of GME costs. Another expert noted that  there have been some state-level efforts to require all payers,  including private insurers, to have some responsibilities in paying for  the education of the health care workforce, even beyond physician  GME training.", "Other: Experts also identified other possible sources of private  funding. For example, one expert told us that, while the amount of  funding from pharmaceutical or medical device companies has not  been identified in existing studies, anecdotally there is a growing use  of these funding sources. Experts also said that some funding is  provided by philanthropic organizations or medical schools that are  affiliated with residency programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Information that Federal Programs Collect about Funding for Graduate Medical Education Training", "paragraphs": ["Appendix II: Information that Federal Programs  Collect about Funding for Graduate Medical  Education Training Medicaid Services (CMS)", "Administration (HRSA)", "Affairs (VA)", "Medicaid Services (CMS)", "Administration (HRSA)", "Affairs (VA)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, William Hadley, Assistant  Director; Christine Brudevold, Assistant Director; Katherine Mack,  Analyst-in-Charge; A.
