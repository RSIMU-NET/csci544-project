Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), marketplaces are required to verify applicant eligibility using data sources and methods approved by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Applicant information that must be verified or validated to receive subsidized coverage includes Social Security number (SSN), citizenship or lawful presence, and income. To accomplish this verification, the selected state-based marketplaces relied on various federal data sources, including sources accessed via the federal data services hub (data hub). They also used state data sources, some of which may have been more current than the data hub sources. For example, all three selected state-based marketplaces supplemented federal tax income information accessed through the data hub, which can be up to 2 years old, with more-current state wage information to verify income. HHS's Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) oversaw the state-based marketplaces' verification procedures by conducting annual reviews, collecting enrollment metrics, and engaging in regular communication in plan year 2015.", "For the three selected states, GAO found few indications of potentially improper or fraudulent enrollments for plan year 2015 in the verification processes reviewed, but did identify data-quality issues, such as data-entry errors or name changes.", "About 2,000 of approximately 210,000 applicants (about 1 percent) had SSNs, names, or dates of birth that did not match the Social Security Administration's records. State officials cited inherent challenges with verifying SSN information, such as name changes. GAO also found instances in which SSNs contained likely data-entry errors.", "Twenty-one of approximately 210,000 applicants (about 0.01 percent) were reportedly deceased prior to starting coverage. The majority of these applicants died after their application was submitted, but prior to starting coverage.", "About 3,000 of approximately 123,000 applicants in two states (about 2 percent) did not resolve immigration-related inconsistencies. Inconsistencies occur when an applicant's information does not match information contained in the data source used to verify the information. The two states had manual inconsistency-resolution processes for plan year 2015 and may not have terminated coverage for these applicants in a timely manner. Officials from both states said they have since implemented or plan to implement changes to automatically close expired inconsistencies and terminate coverage, as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), signed into law  on March 23, 2010, offers subsidized health-care coverage for qualifying  applicants, expands the availability of Medicaid, and provides for the  establishment of health-insurance exchanges, or marketplaces, to assist  consumers in comparing and selecting among insurance plans offered by  participating private issuers of health-care coverage. Under PPACA,  states and the District of Columbia may elect to operate their own health- care marketplaces, or may rely on the federally facilitated marketplace,  known to the public as HealthCare.gov.

Those subsidies and other costs represent a significant, long-term fiscal  commitment for the federal government. According to the Congressional  Budget Office, the projected cost of coverage provisions to the federal  government is $51 billion for fiscal year 2017 for state-based  marketplaces and the federally facilitated marketplace. Subsidy costs are  contingent on eligibility for coverage. Therefore, enrollment controls that  help ensure only qualified applicants are approved for subsidized  coverage are a key factor in determining federal expenditures under the  act. While subsidies under the act are generally not paid directly to  enrollees, participants nevertheless benefit financially through reduced  monthly premiums or lower costs due at time of service, such as  copayments.", "To enroll in health-insurance coverage offered through a marketplace  created by PPACA, individuals must complete an application and meet  certain eligibility requirements. For example, an individual must be a U.S.  citizen or national, or otherwise lawfully present in the United States. The  marketplaces are required by law to take several steps to verify the  information in individuals\u2019 applications to determine their eligibility to enroll  in coverage and, if applicable, qualify for federal subsidies. Verification  steps include validating an applicant\u2019s Social Security number (SSN), if  one is provided; verifying citizenship, status as a U.S. national, or lawful  presence; and verifying household income and family size.", "In light of questions raised by findings in recent reports from the HHS  Office of Inspector General (OIG) and GAO about the eligibility- verification systems related to HealthCare.gov and state-based  marketplaces, you requested that we examine the PPACA enrollment  controls for state-based marketplaces.

To ascertain  applicants that enrolled in subsidized qualified health plans in 2015, we  identified applicants in our selected state-based marketplaces\u2019 eligibility  and enrollment data who received at least 1 month of health coverage  from a qualified health plan and at least 1 month of subsidy. We identified  four areas of analysis that were based on the eligibility and verification  requirements marketplaces must use to determine whether individuals  are eligible to enroll in coverage. Specifically, we identified (1) applicants  whose information, including SSN, did not match the Social Security  Administration\u2019s (SSA) records, (2) applicants who were potentially  deceased, (3) applicants who self-attested to being noncitizens or had  immigration-related inconsistencies, and (4) applicants who were  identified by the state-based marketplace as potentially incarcerated.", "To complete our analysis of these four areas, we analyzed SSA  Enumeration Verification System (EVS) output results to identify  individuals with invalid personal information; the SSA public-plus-state  Death Master File (DMF) to identify potentially deceased individuals; and  state eligibility data to identify self-attested noncitizens with unresolved  immigration statuses and potentially incarcerated individuals. Additionally,  we identified a nongeneralizable selection of 60 applicant cases to  observe the verification process. We did not perform independent data  matching on the eligibility requirements related to immigration status,  incarceration status, income, residency, or minimum essential coverage  due to data availability or limitations with the independent data sources,  such as the data\u2019s age.

A state-based marketplace  must be a governmental agency or nonprofit entity established by the  state. A state may enter into agreements with an eligible entity, such as a  state Medicaid agency, to carry out one or more responsibilities of the  marketplace. The three state-based marketplaces we selected to  examine\u2014Idaho, Maryland, and Rhode Island\u2014have the following  structures:  Idaho. Your Health Idaho is an independent entity in charge of  managing the state-based marketplace for Idaho. The marketplace  was established by the state in 2013 and began operating its own  platform in plan year 2015. Prior to plan year 2015, the marketplace  operated through the federally facilitated marketplace. Your Health  Idaho established an agreement with Idaho\u2019s Department of Health  and Welfare to conduct eligibility determinations for all applicants  seeking subsidized health care. Applicants who wish to receive  subsidized health care can begin an application either through Your  Health Idaho or through the Department of Health and Welfare. Once  eligibility for a qualified health plan is determined, the applicant\u2019s  information and eligibility determination, including any subsidy  amounts for which the applicant qualifies, are sent back to Your  Health Idaho, the entity that manages plan enrollment.", "Maryland. Maryland Health Benefit Exchange is a public corporation  and independent state agency that was established in 2011 and  began operations in plan year 2014. The marketplace works with  three state executive-branch agencies: the Department of Health and  Mental Hygiene, the Department of Human Resources, and the  Maryland Insurance Administration. In accordance with federal law,  applicants can apply for health coverage through an online portal  operated by the marketplace and through other methods such as  broker enrollments. Maryland Health Benefit Exchange maintains  eligibility and enrollment data for all individuals with qualified health- plan coverage.", "Rhode Island. Originally established through executive order in 2011,  HealthSource RI was formally established in statute in 2015 and  operates as a division of the Rhode Island Department of  Administration. The marketplace began operations in plan year 2014.  Applicants can apply for health coverage through a single online  portal operated by the marketplace. HealthSource RI maintains  eligibility and enrollment data for all individuals with qualified health- plan coverage. HealthSource RI is also the system of record for  premium payment information, since applicants make premium  payments directly to the marketplace.", "In plan year 2015, 14 states, including the District of Columbia, operated  their own state-based marketplaces. The remaining 37 states relied on  HealthCare.gov, the federally facilitated marketplace. CMS is  responsible for operating HealthCare.gov and overseeing the  marketplaces operated by the states.", "Combined, state-based marketplaces accounted for about 28 percent of  the over 9.3 million enrollments in all marketplaces as of September  2015, or about 2.6 million enrollments. California and New York together  made up about 64 percent of state-based marketplace enrollments, or  about 1.7 million enrollments. Our selected state-based marketplaces  made up about 9 percent, about 237,000 enrollments, of the total state- based marketplace enrollments. Figure 1 shows states operating their  own marketplace platforms and their percentages of the total state-based  marketplace enrollments as of September 2015.", "PPACA generally requires that individuals maintain minimum essential  health-care coverage. Minimum essential health-care coverage can  include eligible employer-sponsored minimum essential coverage, such  as plans offered by an individual\u2019s employer; and non-employer- sponsored coverage, such as individual health coverage purchased  directly from an insurance company, a qualified health plan purchased  through a state-based or federally facilitated health-insurance  marketplace, or coverage received through government-sponsored  programs.", "Under PPACA, to be eligible to enroll in a qualified health plan offered  through a state-based or federally facilitated marketplace, an individual  must be a U.S. citizen or national, or otherwise lawfully present in the  United States; reside in the marketplace service area; and not be  incarcerated (unless incarcerated while awaiting disposition of charges).  Individuals must meet additional eligibility requirements to receive  subsidies for qualified health plans, such as meeting certain household- income thresholds.", "State-based marketplaces, like the federally facilitated marketplace, are  required by PPACA to verify applicant information to determine eligibility  for enrollment and income-based subsidies, if applicable. Specifically, the  marketplaces must  check for Medicaid eligibility before determining eligibility for qualified  health plans;  validate an applicant\u2019s SSN, if one is provided, by comparison to  SSA\u2019s records;  verify citizenship or immigration status by comparison with SSA or  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) records, respectively; and  verify household income and family size by comparison against tax- return data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), as well as data  on Social Security benefits from SSA.", "Additionally, marketplaces must determine whether an applicant is eligible  for minimum essential coverage through eligible employer-sponsored or  non-employer-sponsored plans by using any available HHS-approved  data source. HHS regulations permit marketplaces to accept applicant  attestation as verification of meeting certain eligibility standards, such as  incarceration status, residency, and minimum essential coverage, if a  data source is unavailable, unless the attestation is not reasonably  compatible with other information obtained by the marketplace. Finally,  marketplaces are required to perform periodic examinations of data  sources to identify changes to applicant information, such as an  applicant\u2019s death.", "If any of the applicant\u2019s self-attested information does not match the  information contained in the data source, or if a data source is not  available to verify the information, a data-matching inconsistency is  generated. For those inconsistencies that cannot be resolved through a  reasonable effort to identify and address the cause of the inconsistency,  the marketplaces must send out a notification to the applicant, who  generally has 90 days to present satisfactory documentary evidence to  resolve the inconsistency. During this time, applicants will receive  conditional eligibility. If the inconsistency is not resolved within 90 days,  unless an extension is granted, the applicant\u2019s eligibility is determined  based on the available information. Depending on the type of  inconsistency and the availability of the data sources, the applicant\u2019s  eligibility may be terminated, or the applicant\u2019s subsidy amount may be  recalculated. Figure 2 shows the marketplace application eligibility- determination and enrollment process for subsidized qualified health  plans according to HHS regulations.", "For eligible applicants, PPACA provides two possible forms of subsidies  for consumers enrolling in individual health plans, both of which are  generally paid directly to insurers on consumers\u2019 behalf. The premium tax  credit is a federal income-tax credit, which reduces a consumer\u2019s monthly  premium payment. The other form, known as cost-sharing reduction, is a  discount that lowers the amount consumers pay for out-of-pocket charges  for deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. Eligible applicants may  use these subsidies to help make their health insurance more  affordable.", "Both state-based and federally facilitated marketplaces use applicants\u2019  reported household income and family size at their time of application to  calculate the maximum allowable premium tax-credit amount. Applicants  can choose to have some, all, or none of the premium tax credit paid in  advance to their insurance issuer. Applicants who choose to have all or  some of the credit paid in advance, known as an advance premium tax  credit (APTC), must reconcile the amount paid to insurers on their behalf  with the amount for which the applicants qualify based on the actual  household income and family size reported on their tax returns.  Applicants do not have to reconcile any cost-sharing reductions paid on  their behalf.", "The marketplaces are required to provide IRS, through HHS, with  information on enrolled individuals on a monthly basis. These data  include information on the individuals enrolled in a qualified health plan  through the marketplace, the coverage start and end dates, the monthly  premium amounts, and the amount of APTC paid to the insurer on behalf  of the taxpayer.

PPACA requires marketplaces to verify  applicant eligibility using data sources and methods approved by HHS.  As shown in table 1, the data sources included various federal data, some  of which were accessed via the federal data services hub (data hub), and  various state data, among other sources.", "As reflected in the table above for plan year 2015, two of the selected  state-based marketplaces\u2014Maryland and Rhode Island\u2014used the data  hub to perform much of their verification process. The third selected state- based marketplace\u2014Idaho\u2014opted to use the state\u2019s existing benefit- eligibility system and leveraged many of its existing eligibility-verification  processes, adding or modifying processes where needed, to meet the  verification requirements for subsidized qualified health plans. Because  Idaho used the same eligibility system for many other benefits programs,  Idaho officials noted that they may have preexisting relationships with  applicants applying for qualified health plans. For example, an applicant  may also participate in other state-administered programs such as  Medicaid or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. In such  cases, Idaho leveraged this known relationship to expedite certain steps  of the eligibility-determination process, such as the verification of SSN,  citizenship, and lawful presence.", "Officials from our selected state-based marketplaces cited inherent  limitations or challenges with using certain third-party data to verify  eligibility, such as the age of the data, unreliable results, or limited  availability. As noted above, the selected state-based marketplaces had  access to local data sources, some of which may have been more current  than the data sources used by the data hub. For example, all three  selected state-based marketplaces supplemented federal tax income  information obtained through the data hub with more-current state wage  information to verify income for subsidy eligibility. IRS income information  provided via the data hub can be up to 2 years old, which may cause  differences between the current applicant-reported income and the  information that IRS provides to the data hub. State wage information is  updated quarterly.", "Further, state officials noted inherent challenges with receiving inaccurate  or outdated information from incarceration databases. According to  officials from one state-based marketplace, these databases contained  information on when an individual was incarcerated, but did not always  accurately record when an individual was released. Therefore, an  individual may have been identified as currently incarcerated when he or  she may already have been released. This information required additional  follow-up work by the state-based marketplaces to determine whether the  individual was still in fact incarcerated and therefore not eligible for  coverage. Maryland officials stated that due to the number of false  positives they received from the data hub\u2019s connection with the SSA  Prisoner Update Processing System and the investment needed to  resolve these inconsistencies, they stopped using this source to  determine eligibility in December 2014. The other two selected state- based marketplaces\u2014Idaho and Rhode Island\u2014used state or county  data sources in addition to, or in place of, the Prisoner Update Processing  System, but Idaho officials noted that these data sources also required  additional follow-up. Rhode Island officials said that they relied on  responses from the state incarceration data over the Prisoner Update  Processing System to identify individuals incarcerated in its state prisons.  CMS officials previously said that the Prisoner Update Processing System  was unreliable for use by the federally facilitated marketplace because  the data were not sufficiently current or accurate, after receiving reports  that people were misidentified as incarcerated. We recommended in 2016  that CMS reevaluate its use of the Prisoner Update Processing System in  eligibility determinations or explore other options, such as applicant- attestation, for the federally facilitated marketplace. CMS concurred with  this recommendation.", "Officials from two selected state-based marketplaces also noted  challenges with verifying certain types of information provided by the  applicant, such as employer-sponsored minimum essential coverage,  because there were limited data sources from which to verify the information. The Rhode Island state-based marketplace used the data  hub to verify that applicants were not receiving health-care benefits  through a federal employer. However, none of the selected state-based  marketplaces verified other types of employer-sponsored coverage, such  as those from a private employer, because, according to state officials,  there was no comprehensive data source available. As a result, they  relied on the applicants\u2019 attestations. Idaho officials said that their staff  may contact employers directly in some cases, for example if the  applicant works for certain employers known to offer minimum essential  coverage, such as a state employer. Maryland state-based marketplace  officials told us they are developing a quarterly process to contact  employers directly to verify minimum essential coverage for a random  sample of applicants.", "Two of the selected state-based marketplaces also reported challenges  with the inconsistency-resolution process as they developed their  enrollment and eligibility systems. Maryland transitioned to a new  enrollment and eligibility system in plan year 2015, while Rhode Island  was working toward integrating its marketplace and Medicaid systems in  plan year 2015. Due to these changes, the state-based marketplaces  encountered some challenges, but officials from both states told us they  have since improved and modified their eligibility-determination and  inconsistency-resolution processes. For example, in plan year 2015, the  inconsistency-resolution process was manual for these two states. While  their systems were able to identify inconsistencies, they did not always  create an alert when the 90-day resolution period for applicants to submit  sufficient documentation had expired. As a result, some individuals with  unresolved inconsistencies continued to receive coverage beyond the 90- day period. Maryland and Rhode Island officials said that they have since  put in place automated or semiautomated inconsistency-resolution  processes that allow them to automatically identify expired inconsistency  time frames, redetermine eligibility, and terminate coverage, if  appropriate, for inconsistencies that have not been resolved within the 90- day period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Oversaw State- Based Marketplaces\u2019 Efforts through Various Methods", "paragraphs": ["During plan year 2015, CMS relied on several activities to oversee and  monitor state-based marketplaces\u2019 procedures for verifying applicant  eligibility for subsidized coverage.

In response to these requirements and to facilitate  their review, CMS developed the SMART report to compile this  information into an annual reporting mechanism for the state-based  marketplaces. The SMART requires the states to conduct a self- assessment of their marketplace activities, policies, and procedures in  effect during the plan year and provide a summary of marketplace  activities, accomplishments, and strategic priorities for the upcoming  year. They also include the state-based marketplaces\u2019 attestations  indicating whether they have met certain requirements outlined in  HHS regulations, such as the requirements for eligibility-verification  and redetermination procedures, enrollment standards, and annual  external financial and programmatic audits.

CMS developed a \u201cdesktop tool,\u201d similar to a checklist, that  is designed to assist the state officers in determining whether the  information is sufficient and satisfies the requirements. It is also  designed to provide feedback on the review. For example, CMS state  officers and subject-matter experts were to review the state-based  marketplaces\u2019 fraud, waste, and abuse policies and procedures to  ensure the state-based marketplaces have the ability to identify,  adjudicate, and report on fraud, waste, and abuse within marketplace  operations. These policies and procedures must include reporting  mechanisms for both external and internal parties, penalties for  noncompliance, referrals to law enforcement, and detection activities,  including data analytics and ongoing monitoring of operations.", "As part of the SMART review process, CMS state officers were to also  review each state-based marketplace\u2019s external programmatic audit  that evaluates whether the state-based marketplace\u2019s processes and  procedures were designed to prevent improper eligibility  determinations and enrollment transactions, and designed to identify  errors that resulted in incorrect eligibility determinations, among other  items.

However, our analysis did identify some quality  issues in states\u2019 data, such as SSN or name data-entry errors. Overall,  we analyzed approximately 210,000 individual applicants associated with  about $428 million in APTC amounts. Table 2 shows the population and  APTC amounts by selected state-based marketplace.", "We analyzed four areas within the selected state-based marketplaces\u2019  processes to verify applicant eligibility and identify potentially improper or  fraudulent enrollments. We selected these four areas because they were  related to the eligibility and verification requirements that marketplaces  must follow to determine whether individuals are eligible to enroll in  coverage. Specifically, we identified (1) applicants whose information,  including SSN, did not match SSA\u2019s records; (2) applicants who were  potentially deceased; (3) applicants who self-attested to being noncitizens  or were identified by the state-based marketplaces as having immigration- related inconsistencies; and (4) applicants who were identified by the  state-based marketplace as potentially incarcerated. Additionally, we  identified and reviewed a nongeneralizable selection of 60 applicants to  provide illustrative examples of the four areas analyzed. Our analysis  found the following:", "Applicants whose personal information did not match SSA\u2019s  records. We identified about 2,000 applicants of the approximately  210,000 applicants for whom SSN, first name, last name, or date of  birth did not match SSA\u2019s records. About half of the 2,000 applicants  were listed as the household\u2019s primary tax filer. These applicants\u2019  information is necessary to reconcile the amount of APTC received on  their federal tax returns at the end of the plan year. SSNs are a key  identifier in the APTC reconciliation process, and invalid personal  information can impair IRS\u2019s ability to complete the reconciliation  process. We have previously recommended that CMS take additional  steps to resolve SSN-related inconsistencies in the federally facilitated  marketplace. CMS concurred with this recommendation. Figure 3  shows the number of applicants whose personal information did not  match SSA\u2019s records.", "State-based marketplace officials cited inherent challenges with  verifying SSN information. Specifically, officials from our selected  states pointed to challenges such as applicants with name changes or  incorrect dates of birth. During our review of selected applicant cases,  we observed an instance in which an applicant used what appeared to  be her married last name on her application. The applicant, however,  had provided a passport with a different last name to verify her  citizenship, and officials said she had previously received benefits  under that name. Officials from the applicant\u2019s state said that they do  not automatically update names to match documents provided since  the name could be out of date. In another state, we observed an  instance where the state did not receive validation of an applicant\u2019s  SSN through the data hub. The applicant provided a copy of her  Social Security card and her permanent resident card, which both had  the same three last names. While the state had the correct SSN in  its enrollment data, it had only recorded the third last name, which  may have caused the applicant\u2019s information to not match SSA\u2019s  records.", "We also found instances in which the SSNs contained likely data- entry errors in two of our three selected state-based marketplaces. In  plan year 2015, one selected state-based marketplace allowed  applicants to successfully resolve identity-related inconsistencies by  providing documents that may not have had SSN information on  them, such as a birth certificate. In one applicant case from this  state, we observed that the state was not able to verify the applicant\u2019s  SSN through the data hub. The applicant provided a birth certificate  and driver\u2019s license to resolve the inconsistency. As a result of our  review, state officials determined that the applicant\u2019s SSN had a  typographical error in the middle two digits. State officials said that to  identify and appropriately resolve inconsistencies such as these, the  state-based marketplace has since created a distinct SSN-related  inconsistency that would require proof of SSN to resolve the  inconsistency.", "In one selected state-based marketplace, we observed a case where  a data-entry error was likely caused by an applicant incorrectly  entering her SSN during the online application process. The  applicant\u2019s original application had the correct SSN but a subsequent  application had an incorrect SSN. Later, her SSN was corrected and  was successfully verified by the state. In the other selected state- based marketplace, we saw an instance in which a marketplace  worker did not update an applicant\u2019s SSN when documentation was  provided to resolve the SSN-related inconsistency. The applicant went  to a walk-in center and provided a copy of his Social Security card to  resolve his inconsistency. Ultimately, the marketplace worker  overrode the SSN inconsistency and did not correct the SSN, which  allowed the error to remain in the state\u2019s data. We shared information  on these data-entry errors with the relevant state-based marketplaces,  and officials told us they have corrected the information in their  systems.", "Reportedly deceased applicants. We identified 21 of the almost  210,000 applicants (approximately 0.01 percent) who were deceased  prior to starting coverage in plan year 2015. The majority of these  applicants died after their applications were submitted, but prior to  starting coverage. For 2 of the 21 applicants, 1 was deceased for 6  months prior to the start of coverage, and another for a year. Figure 4  shows the number of applicants who were reportedly deceased or  whose information matched a decedent prior to plan year 2015.", "We identified an additional 30 of the nearly 210,000 applicants whose  SSN matched an identity that was deceased before the start of  coverage, but whose names or birthday did not match. We performed  additional review of these applicants and found that the matches were  likely the result of SSN data-entry errors in the same two selected  state-based marketplaces. Specifically, the SSA Enumeration  Verification System (EVS) results for these applicants indicated that  their reported SSNs did not match SSA\u2019s records.", "We also reviewed 11 applicant cases of these 30 applicants and  found data-entry errors. For instance, in one state we reviewed a  selected applicant\u2019s case information with the state and saw that the  applicant\u2019s SSN was not verified by the data hub. The applicant  provided a Social Security card, which showed that the state\u2019s data  had two digits of the applicant\u2019s SSN transposed and the first name  spelled incorrectly. Similarly, our review of an applicant case in the  other state found that the applicant\u2019s personal information, including  SSN, failed verification through the data hub for plan year 2015.  Though the applicant had provided a copy of his tax return that had  his correct SSN on it in, his SSN was ultimately not corrected until the  applicant came to a walk-in center in November 2016. We shared  these applicant cases with the relevant state-based marketplaces,  and they have taken steps to correct data-entry errors where  necessary.", "Additionally, we identified 324 of the approximately 210,000  applicants (about 0.15 percent) who died during plan year 2015. The  state-based marketplaces ended coverage for about 73 percent of  these applicants within 2 months, while coverage continued for 3\u201312  months after the reported date of death for the remainder of the  applicants. Through our applicant case review, we observed different  ways that states received information about deceased individuals. For  example, in one state, an applicant\u2019s parent called to report that the  applicant had died during plan year 2015, and the information was  processed by the state-based marketplace the same day. In a  different state, we observed that while the state was not aware of an  applicant\u2019s death, her insurance carrier terminated her coverage due  to nonpayment.", "Unresolved immigration status. In Rhode Island and Maryland,  almost 3,000 applicants\u2014about 2.4 percent of 123,000 applicants  from these states\u2014did not resolve their immigration-related data- matching inconsistencies. More than half of these applicants received  coverage for more than 6 months. As previously discussed, these two  state-based marketplaces had manual inconsistency-resolution  processes in place during plan year 2015 and may not have  terminated coverage for these applicants in a timely manner. Officials  from these states told us that since plan year 2015 they have  implemented automated or semiautomated processes to automatically  close inconsistencies and terminate coverage after the 90-day period.  We were not able to test whether these automated or semiautomated  inconsistency-resolution processes would appropriately terminate  coverage for these applicants after the 90-day period because they  were implemented after our period of review.", "We reviewed 12 applicant cases from our three selected state-based  marketplaces in which applicants self-attested to being noncitizens or  had immigration-related inconsistencies. In our review, we observed  applicant cases that successfully verified immigration status as well as  applicant cases in which applicants\u2019 eligibility was terminated for  failure to provide documentation. For example, in one selected case,  we saw the DHS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements system  results used to verify the applicant\u2019s lawful presence. In another case,  the state requested immigration documents from the applicant and  later terminated an applicant\u2019s coverage for failure to provide the  requested documentation.", "Potentially incarcerated. Our selected state-based marketplaces  identified 245 potentially incarcerated applicants out of the nearly  210,000 overall applicants (about 0.1 percent). As previously  discussed, there are many challenges associated with using  incarceration data, including the risk of false positives. We reviewed  nine applicant cases from our selected state-based marketplaces to  learn about the incarceration-verification process but did not  independently verify the incarceration status of the selected cases.  During this review, we observed an instance in which an applicant  provided updated incarceration information. The applicant\u2019s spouse  called the state-based marketplace to inform it that the applicant  would be incarcerated for more than 30 days.

Additionally, we considered geographic location and enrollment size,  among other characteristics. The results of our review and analysis of  these state-based marketplaces cannot be generalized to other  marketplaces.", "To identify key processes used by selected state-based marketplaces to  verify applicants\u2019 eligibility and to determine how CMS oversaw such  efforts, we reviewed relevant federal and state statutes, Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations, state policies and  procedure manuals, and CMS documentation, such as annual reports  submitted by the state marketplaces and report-review templates, data- metric templates, and review agendas.

We also obtained  and analyzed advance premium tax credit (APTC) data from the three  states for all of plan year 2015. Maryland and Rhode Island also provide  eligibility-inconsistency data. Idaho did not provide eligibility-inconsistency  data due to the way its data are stored in its system.

To  identify these applicants, we removed applicants who were part of an  application but were not seeking coverage; applicants who only received  coverage through a qualified dental plan; applicants who received  coverage through a qualified health plan but did not seek or receive  APTC; and applicants who received coverage through Medicaid or the  Small Business Health Options Program marketplaces. Where  appropriate, we also removed applicants for whom we could not identify  the correct APTC amount, for example applicants with two APTC  amounts in a single month, or whose coverage dates were not in plan  year 2015. Additionally, we did not include applicants who may have  enrolled between November 1, 2015, and December 31, 2015, to avoid  potential changes to the data that may have been made by the plan year  2016 open-enrollment season.

To identify applicants whose personal information\u2014name,  date of birth, and SSN\u2014did not match SSA\u2019s records, we used the  SSA Enumeration Verification System (EVS). Specifically, we  processed all applicants in the three selected states\u2019 eligibility and  enrollment information through SSA EVS and analyzed the output  codes to determine whether the states\u2019 information matched SSA\u2019s  records. To determine whether the state-based marketplace had also  identified an SSN-related inconsistency, we compared the SSA EVS  analysis results to the state eligibility information. To identify  applicants listed as the head of household or tax filer whose  information did not match SSA\u2019s records, we reviewed the state  enrollment and subsidy information to identify heads of household and  tax filers and then analyzed the EVS results for these applicants.", "Reportedly deceased applicants. To identify applicants who were  potentially deceased prior to or during plan year 2015, we matched  the states\u2019 eligibility and enrollment data to the SSA public-plus-state  Death Master File from June 2016. We matched records using the  SSN and compared last names and dates of birth of all potential  matches. For those applicants whose SSN and last names or date of  birth were exact matches, we determined whether the individual was  reported as deceased prior to or after the start of coverage. For  applicants who were reportedly deceased prior to starting coverage,  we analyzed the reported death date in relation to the application- submission and coverage-start dates. For applicants who were  reportedly deceased during coverage, we analyzed the reported death  date in relation to the coverage-end date. For applicants whose SSN  matched, but last names or date of birth did not match, a decedent,  we reviewed SSA EVS outputs and state eligibility and enrollment  information to determine whether an SSN-related inconsistency  existed.", "Unresolved immigration status.

These refined characteristics were identified during the  course of our analysis and were added to provide additional insight into  the states\u2019 eligibility and verification processes. Specifically, we refined  the following: condition 1 applicants with personal information that did not  match SSA\u2019s records and had an SSN-related inconsistency with an  unresolved status; condition 4 applicants whose SSNs matched  potentially deceased individuals but names or dates of birth did not, and  whose personal information did not match SSA\u2019s records; and condition 5  applicants who were identified by the state as having an unresolved  immigration-related inconsistency.
