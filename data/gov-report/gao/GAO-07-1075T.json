Because about 85 percent of the nation's critical infrastructure is privately owned, it is vital that public and private stakeholders work together to protect these assets. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for coordinating a national protection strategy and has promoted the formation of government and private councils for the 17 infrastructure sectors as a collaborating tool. The councils, among other things, are to identify their most critical assets, assess the risks they face, and identify protective measures in sector-specific plans that comply with DHS's National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP). This testimony is based primarily on GAO's July 2007 report on the sector-specific plans and the sector councils. Specifically, it addresses (1) the extent to which the sector-specific plans meet requirements, (2) the council members' views on the value of the plans and DHS's review process, and (3) the key success factors and challenges that the representatives encountered in establishing and maintaining their councils. In conducting the previous work, GAO reviewed 9 of the 17 draft plans and conducted interviews with government and private sector representatives of the 32 councils, 17 government and 15 private sector."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although the nine sector-specific plans GAO reviewed generally met NIPP requirements and DHS's sector-specific plan guidance, eight did not describe any incentives the sector would use to encourage owners to conduct voluntary risk assessments, as required by the NIPP. Most of the plans included the required elements of the NIPP risk management framework. However, the plans varied in how comprehensively they addressed not only their physical assets, systems, and functions, but also their human and cyber assets, systems and functions, a requirement in the NIPP, because the sectors had differing views on the extent to which they were dependent on each of these assets. A comprehensive identification of all three categories of assets is important, according to DHS plan guidance, because it provides the foundation on which to conduct risk analyses and identify appropriate protective actions. Given the disparity in the plans, it is unclear the extent to which DHS will be able to use them to identify security gaps and critical interdependencies across the sectors. DHS officials said that to determine this, they will need to review the sectors' annual reports. Representatives of the government and sector coordinating councils had differing views regarding the value of sector-specific plans and DHS's review of those plans. While 10 of the 32 council representatives GAO interviewed reported that they saw the plans as being useful for their sectors, representatives of eight councils disagreed because they believed the plans either did not represent a partnership among the necessary key stakeholders, especially the private sector or were not valuable because the sector had already progressed beyond the plan. In addition, representatives of 11 of the 32 councils felt the review process was too lengthy, but 8 thought the review process worked well. The remaining council representatives did not offer views on these issues. As GAO reported previously, representatives continued to report that their sector councils had preexisting relationships that helped them establish and maintain their sector councils. However, seven of the 32 representatives reported continuing difficulty achieving and maintaining sector council membership, thus limiting the ability of the councils to effectively represent the sector. Eleven council representatives reported continuing difficulties sharing information between the public and private sectors as a challenge, and six council representatives expressed concerns about the viability of the information system DHS intends to rely on to share information about critical infrastructure issues with the sectors or the effectiveness of the Protected Critical Infrastructure Information program--a program that established procedures for the receipt, care, and storage of information submitted to DHS. GAO has outstanding recommendations addressing this issue, with which DHS generally agreed and is in the process of implementing."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for inviting us to participate in today\u2019s hearing on infrastructure  protection issues. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast,  damaging critical infrastructure, such as oil platforms, pipelines, and  refineries; water mains; electric power lines; and cellular phone towers.  The infrastructure damage and resulting chaos disrupted government and  business functions alike, producing cascading effects far beyond the  physical location of the storm. In 2004, authorities thwarted a terrorist plot  to target financial institutions in New York. In 2005, suicide bombers  struck London\u2019s public transportation system, disrupting the city\u2019s  transportation and mobile telecommunications infrastructure. Our nation\u2019s  critical infrastructures and key resources\u2014including those cyber and  physical assets essential to national security, national economic security,  and national public health and safety\u2014continue to be vulnerable to a wide  variety of threats. Because the private sector owns approximately   85 percent of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure and key resources\u2014 banking and financial institutions, telecommunications networks, and  energy production and transmission facilities, among others\u2014it is vital  that the public and private sectors form effective partnerships to  successfully protect these assets.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a key player in these  partnerships. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 created DHS, giving the  department wide-ranging responsibilities for leading and coordinating the  overall national critical infrastructure protection effort. The act required  DHS to (1) develop a comprehensive national plan for securing the  nation\u2019s critical infrastructures and key resources and (2) recommend  measures to protect critical infrastructure and key resources. Homeland  Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) further defined critical  infrastructure protection responsibilities for DHS and those federal  agencies\u2014known as sector-specific agencies\u2014responsible for particular  industry sectors, such as transportation, energy, and communications.  Under HSPD-7, DHS is to establish uniform policies, approaches,  guidelines, and methodologies to help ensure that critical infrastructure  within and across the 17 infrastructure sectors is protected. The directive  further promotes the use of a risk management approach to coordinate  protection efforts. This approach includes using risk assessments to set  priorities for protective measures by the department; sector-specific  agencies; tribal, state, and local government agencies and authorities with  critical assets and resources in their jurisdiction; owners and operators of  these assets; and other entities.", "In addition, HSPD-7 required DHS to develop a comprehensive and  integrated plan for securing the nation\u2019s critical infrastructures that  outlines national protection goals, objectives, milestones, and key  initiatives necessary to fulfilling these responsibilities. In response, DHS  developed the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP). Issued in  June 2006, the NIPP is a base plan that is to serve as a road map for how  DHS and other relevant stakeholders, such as owners and operators of key  critical infrastructure, should use risk management principles to prioritize  protection activities within and across sectors in an integrated,  coordinated fashion. In particular, the NIPP\u2014along with more detailed  guidance issued by DHS\u2014required the individual sector-specific agencies,  working with relevant government and private representatives, to submit  sector-specific plans to DHS by the end of December 2006. The plans,  which were released on May 21, 2007, were to establish the means by  which the sectors will identify their critical assets, assess risks of terrorist  attacks or other hazards to these assets, assess and prioritize those assets  which have national significance, and develop protective measures for the  sectors. The NIPP also requires that sector-specific agencies develop  annual reports that discuss the sectors\u2019 status in implementing the plans.  According to the NIPP, DHS is to use these individual plans and reports to  develop an annual cross-sector report, due each September, that evaluates  whether gaps exist in the protection plans and actions to be taken to  protect critical infrastructures on a national level. If gaps exist, DHS is to  work with the sectors to address them.", "To protect critical infrastructure, the NIPP describes a partnership model  as the primary means of coordinating government and private efforts. For  each of the 17 sectors, the model requires formation a government  coordinating council\u2014composed of representatives of federal, state, local,  or tribal agencies with purview over critical assets. The model encourages  voluntary formation of a sector coordinating council\u2014composed of  representative owner-operators of these critical assets (some of which  may be state or local agencies) or their respective trade associations.   There are a total of 32 coordinating councils, 17 government and 15 private  sector. These councils create the structure through which respective  groups from all levels of government and the private sector are to  collaborate in developing the sector-specific plans and implementing  efforts to protect critical infrastructure. The sector coordinating councils  are envisioned as a primary point of contact for government to plan the  entire range of infrastructure protection activities unique to the sector. In  addition, the NIPP also identified cross-sector councils that are to promote  coordination, communications, and the sharing of key practices across the  sectors.", "This statement discusses (1) the extent to which the sector-specific plans  meet NIPP and DHS requirements, (2) the government and sector  coordinating council members\u2019 views on the value of the plans and DHS\u2019s  review process, and (3) the key success factors and challenges that sector  representatives reported they encountered in establishing and maintaining  their councils. My comments today are based on our July 2007 report on  the sector-specific plans and sector councils. Our July report was based  on a review of the NIPP as well as the sector-specific plan guidance to  ascertain the elements required in the plans. We also obtained and  reviewed 9 of the 17 draft plans against the criteria in the NIPP and plan  guidance. For more detail on the criteria we used, see appendix I. We  conducted structured interviews with representatives of the   17 government coordinating councils and the 15 sector coordinating  councils to obtain views on the value of the plans and the review process  as well as the key success factors and challenges the sectors reported that  they had encountered in establishing and maintaining their councils. These  interviews were conducted with lead sector-specific agency  representatives for the 17 sectors: the departments of Agriculture,  Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, the  Interior, and the Treasury and the Environmental Protection Agency, as  well as with the chairs, co-chairs, or steering committee members of the   15 sector coordinating councils. We conducted our work in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["DHS serves as the sector-specific agency for 10 of the sectors: information  technology; communications; transportation systems; chemical;  emergency services; nuclear reactors, material, and waste; postal and  shipping; dams; government facilities; and commercial facilities.

(See table 1 for a list of sector-specific  agencies and a brief description of each sector)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Sector Plans We Reviewed Met NIPP and DHS Sector- Specific Plan Guidance, but Varied Depending on Their Maturity and How They Define Their Assets", "paragraphs": ["The nine sector-specific plans we reviewed generally met NIPP  requirements and DHS\u2019s sector-specific plan guidance; however, the extent  to which the plans met this guidance, and therefore their usefulness in  enabling DHS to identify gaps and interdependencies across the sectors,  varied depending on the maturity of the sector and on how the sector  defines its assets, systems, and functions. As required by the NIPP risk  management framework (see fig. 1), sector-specific plans are to promote  the protection of physical, cyber, and human assets by focusing activities  on efforts to (1) set security goals; (2) identify assets, systems, networks,  and functions; (3) assess risk based on consequences, vulnerabilities, and  threats; (4) establish priorities based on risk assessments; (5) implement  protective programs; and (6) measure effectiveness.", "In addition to these NIPP risk management plan elements outlined above  and according to DHS\u2019s sector-specific plan guidance, the plans are also to  address the sectors\u2019 efforts to (1) implement a research and development  program for critical infrastructure protection and (2) establish a structure  for managing and coordinating the responsibilities of the federal  departments and agencies\u2014otherwise known as sector-specific  agencies\u2014identified in HSPD-7 as responsible for critical-infrastructure  protection activities specified for the 17 sectors. Most of the plans  included the required elements of the NIPP risk management framework,  such as security goals and the methods the sectors expect to use to  prioritize infrastructure, as well as to develop and implement protective  programs. However, the plans varied in the extent to which they included  key information required for each plan element. For example, all of the  plans described the threat analyses that the sector conducts, but only one  of the plans described any incentives used to encourage voluntary risk  assessments, as required by the NIPP. Such incentives are important  because a number of the industries in the sectors are privately owned and  not regulated, and the government must rely on voluntary compliance with  the NIPP. Additionally, although the NIPP called for each sector to identify  key protective programs, three of the nine plans did not address this  requirement. DHS officials told us that this variance in the plans can, in  large part, be attributed to the levels of maturity and cultures of the  sectors, with the more mature sectors generally having more  comprehensive and complete plans than sectors without similar prior  working relationships. For example, the banking and finance and energy  sector plans included most of the key information required for each plan  element. According to DHS officials, this is a result of these sectors having  a history and culture of working with the government to plan and  accomplish many of the same activities that are being required for the  sector-specific plans. Therefore, these sectors were able to create plans  that were more comprehensive and developed than those of less mature  sectors, such as the public health and health care and agriculture and food  sectors.", "The plans also varied in how comprehensively they addressed their  physical, human, and cyber assets, systems, and functions because sectors  reported having differing views on the extent to which they were  dependent on each of these assets, systems, and functions. According to  DHS\u2019s sector-specific plan guidance, a comprehensive identification of  such assets is important because it provides the foundation on which to  conduct risk analysis and identify the appropriate mix of protective  programs and actions that will most effectively reduce the risk to the  nation\u2019s infrastructure. Yet, only one of the plans\u2014drinking water and  water treatment\u2014specifically included all three categories of assets. For  example, because the communications sector limited its definition of  assets to networks, systems, and functions, it did not, as required by DHS\u2019s  plan guidance, include human assets in its existing security projects and  the gaps it needs to fill related to these assets to support the sector\u2019s goals.  In addition, the national monuments and icons plan defined the sector as  consisting of physical structures with minimal cyber and  telecommunications assets because these assets are not sufficiently  critical that damaging or destroying them would interfere with the  continued operation of the physical assets. In contrast, the energy sector  placed a greater emphasis on cyber attributes because it heavily depends  on these cyber assets to monitor and control its energy systems. DHS  officials also attributed the difference in the extent to which the plans  addressed required elements to the manner in which the sectors define  their assets and functions.", "The plans, according to DHS\u2019s Office of Infrastructure Protection officials,  are a first step in developing future protective measures. In addition, these  officials said that the plans should not be considered to be reports of  actual implementation of such measures. Given the disparity in the plans,  it is unclear the extent to which DHS will be able to use them to identify  gaps and interdependencies across the sectors in order to plan future  protective measures. It is also unclear, from reviewing the plans, how far  along each sector actually is in identifying assets, setting priorities, and  protecting key assets. DHS officials said that to make this determination,  they will need to review the sectors\u2019 annual progress reports, due in this  month, that are to provide additional information on plan implementation  as well as identify sector priorities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Council Representatives Disagreed on the Value of the Plans and the Review Process", "paragraphs": ["Representatives of 10 of 32 councils said the plans were valuable because  they gave their sectors a common language and framework to bring the  disparate members of the sector together to better collaborate as they  move forward with protection efforts. For example, the government  facilities council representative said that the plan was useful because  relationships across the sector were established during its development  that have resulted in bringing previously disjointed security efforts  together in a coordinated way. The banking and finance sector\u2019s  coordinating council representative said that the plan was a helpful way of  documenting the history, the present state, and the future of the sector in a  way that had not been done before and that the plan will be a working  document to guide the sector in coordinating efforts. Similarly, an energy  sector representative said that the plan provides a common format so that  all participants can speak a common language, thus enabling them to  better collaborate on the overall security of the sector. The representative  also said that the plan brought the issue of interdependencies between the  energy sector and other sectors to light and provided a forum for the  various sectors to collaborate. DHS\u2019s Office of Infrastructure Protection  officials agreed that the main benefit of these plans was that the process of  developing them helped the sectors to establish relationships between the  private sector and the government and among private sector stakeholders  that are key to the success of protection efforts.", "However, representatives of 8 of the 32 councils said the plans were not  useful to their sectors because (1) the plans did not represent a true  partnership between the federal and private sectors or were not  meaningful to all the industries represented by the sector or (2) the sector  had already taken significant protection actions, thus, developing the plan  did not add value. The remaining council representatives did not offer  views on this issue. Sector representatives for three transportation  modes\u2014rail, maritime, and aviation\u2014reported that their sector\u2019s plan was  written by the government and that the private sector did not participate  fully in the development of the plan or the review process. As a result, the  representatives did not believe that the plan was of value to the  transportation sector as a whole because it does not represent the  interests of the private sector. Similarly, agriculture and food  representatives said writing the plan proved to be difficult because of the  sector\u2019s diversity and size\u2014more than 2,000,000 farms, one million  restaurants, and 150,000 meat processing plants. They said that one of the  sector\u2019s biggest challenges was developing a meaningful document that  could be used by all of the industries represented. As a result of these  challenges, the sector submitted two plans in December 2006 that  represented a best effort at the time, but the sector council said it intends  to use the remainder of the 2007 calendar year to create a single plan that  better represents the sector. In contrast, the coordinating council  representative for nuclear reactors, materials, and waste sector said that  because the sector\u2019s security has been robust for a long time, the plan only  casts the security of the sector in a different light, and the drinking water  and water treatment systems sector said that the plan is a \u201csnapshot in  time\u201d document for a sector that already has a 30-year history of  protection, and thus the plan did not provide added value for the sector.  Officials at DHS\u2019s Office of Infrastructure Protection acknowledged that  these sectors have a long history of working together and in some cases  have been doing similar planning efforts. However, the officials said that  the effort was of value to the government because it now has plans for all  17 sectors and it can begin to use the plans to address the NIPP risk  management framework.", "Representatives of 11 of 32 councils said the review process associated  with the plans was lengthy. They commented that they had submitted their  plans in advance of the December 31, 2006, deadline, but had to wait   5 months for the plan to be approved. Eight of them also commented that  while they were required to respond within several days to comments  from DHS on the draft plans, they had to wait relatively much longer  during the continuing review process for the next iteration of the draft.  For example, a representative of the drinking water and water treatment  sector said that the time the sector had to incorporate DHS\u2019s comments  into a draft of the plan was too short\u2014a few days\u2014and this led the sector  to question whether its members were valued partners to DHS. DHS\u2019s  Infrastructure Protection officials agreed that the review process had been  lengthy and that the comment periods given to sector officials were too  short. DHS officials said this occurred because of the volume of work DHS  had to undertake and because some of the sector-specific agencies were  still learning to operate effectively with the private sector under a  partnership model in which the private sector is an equal partner. The  officials said that they plan to refine the process as the sector-specific  agencies gain more experience working with the private sector.", "Conversely, representatives from eight of 32 councils said the review  process for the plans worked well, and five of these council  representatives were complimentary of the support they received from  DHS. The remaining council representatives did not offer views on this  topic. For example, an information technology (IT) sector coordinating  council representative said that the review and feedback process on their  plan worked well and that the Office of Infrastructure Protection has  helped tremendously in bringing the plans to fruition. However, sector  coordinating council representatives for six sectors also voiced concern  that the trusted relationships established between the sectors and DHS  might not continue if there were additional turnover in DHS, as has  occurred in the past. For example, the representative of one council said  they had established productive working relationships with officials in the  Offices of Infrastructure Protection and Cyber Security and  Communications, but were concerned that these relationships were  dependent on the individuals in these positions and that the relationships  may not continue without the same individuals in charge at DHS. As we  have reported in the past, developing trusted partnerships between the  federal government and the private sector is critical to ensure the  protection of critical infrastructure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Long-standing Relationships Continue to Facilitate Councils, but Some Council Representatives Reported Information- Sharing Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Nine of 32 sector representatives said that their preexisting relationships  with stakeholders helped in establishing and maintaining their sector  councils, and two noted that establishing the councils had improved  relationships. Such participation is critical to well-functioning councils.  For example, representatives from the dams, energy, and banking and  finance sectors, among others, said that existing relationships continue to  help in maintaining their councils. In addition, the defense industrial base  representatives said the organizational infrastructure provided by the  sector councils is valuable because it allows for collaboration.  Representatives from the national monuments and icons sector said that  establishing the government sector council has facilitated communication  within the sector. We also reported previously that long-standing  relationships were a facilitating factor in council formation and that   10 sectors had formed either a government council or sector council that  addressed critical infrastructure protection issues prior to DHS\u2019s  development of the NIPP. As a result, these 10 sectors were more easily  able to establish government coordinating councils and sector  coordinating councils under the NIPP model. Several councils also noted  that the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC),  created by DHS in March 2006 to facilitate communication and  information sharing between the government and the private sector, has  helped facilitate collaboration because it allows the government and  industry to interact without being open to public scrutiny under the  Federal Advisory Committee Act. This is important because previously,  meetings between the private sector and the government had to be open to  the public, hampering the private sector\u2019s willingness to share information.", "Conversely, seven sector council representatives reported difficulty in  achieving and maintaining sector council membership, thus limiting the  ability of the councils to effectively represent the sector. For example, the  public health and health care sector representative said that getting the  numerous sector members to participate is a challenge, and the  government representative noted that because of this, the first step in  implementing the sector-specific plan is to increase awareness about the  effort among sector members to encourage participation. Similarly, due to  the size of the commercial facilities sector, participation, while critical,  varies among its industries, according to the government council  representative. Meanwhile, the banking and finance sector representatives  said that the time commitment for private sector members and council  leaders makes participation difficult for smaller stakeholders, but getting  them involved is critical to an effective partnership. Likewise, the IT sector  representatives said engaging some government members in joint council  meetings is a continuing challenge because of the members\u2019 competing  responsibilities. Without such involvement, the officials said, it is difficult  to convince the private sector representatives of the value of spending  their time participating on the council.", "Additionally, obtaining state and local government participation in  government sector councils remains a challenge for five sectors. Achieving  such participation is critical because these officials are often the first  responders in case of an incident. Several government council  representatives said that a lack of funding for representatives from these  entities to travel to key meetings has limited state and local government  participation. Others stated that determining which officials to include was  a challenge because of the sheer volume of state and local stakeholders.  DHS Infrastructure Protection officials said that the agency is trying to  address this issue by providing funding for state and local participation in  quarterly sector council meetings and has created a State, Local and Tribal  and Territorial Government Coordinating Council (SLTTGCC)\u2014composed  of state, local, tribal, and territorial homeland security advisers\u2014that  serves as a forum for coordination across these jurisdictions on protection  guidance, strategies, and programs.", "Eleven of the 32 council representatives reported continuing challenges  with sharing information between the federal government and the private  sector. For example, six council representatives expressed concerns about  the viability of two of DHS\u2019s main information-sharing tools\u2014the  Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) or the Protected Critical  Infrastructure Information (PCII) program. We reported in April 2007 that  the HSIN system was built without appropriate coordination with other  information-sharing initiatives. In addition, in a strategic review of HSIN,  DHS reported in April 2007 that it has not clearly defined the purpose and  scope of HSIN and that HSIN has been developed without sufficient  planning and program management. According to DHS Infrastructure  Protection officials, although they encouraged the sectors to use HSIN, the  system does not provide the capabilities that were promised, including  providing the level of security expected by some sectors. As a result, they  said the Office of Infrastructure Protection is exploring an alternative that  would better meet the needs of the sectors. In addition, three council  representatives expressed concerns about whether information shared  under the PCII program would be protected. Although this program was  specifically designed to establish procedures for the receipt, care, and  storage of critical infrastructure information submitted voluntarily to the  government, the representatives said potential submitters continue to fear  that the information could be inadequately protected, used for future legal  or regulatory action, or inadvertently released.", "In April 2006, we reported that DHS faced challenges implementing the  program, including being able to assure the private sector that submitted  information will be protected and specifying who will be authorized to  have access to the information, as well as to demonstrate to the critical  infrastructure owners the benefits of sharing the information to encourage  program participation. We recommended, among other things, that DHS  better (1) define its critical-infrastructure information needs and   (2) explain how this information will be used to attract more users. DHS  concurred with our recommendations. In September 2006 DHS issued a  final rule that established procedures governing the receipt, validation,  handling, storage, marking, and use of critical infrastructure information  voluntarily submitted to DHS. DHS is in the process of implementing our  additional recommendations that it define its critical-infrastructure  information needs under the PCII program and better explain how this  information will be used to build the private sector\u2019s trust and attract more  users."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["To date, DHS has issued a national plan aimed at providing a consistent  approach to critical infrastructure protection, ensured that all 17 sectors  have organized to collaborate on protection efforts, and worked with  government and private sector partners to complete all 17 sector-specific  plans. Nevertheless, our work has shown that sectors vary in terms of how  complete and comprehensive their plans are. Furthermore, DHS  recognizes that the sectors, their councils, and their plans must continue  to evolve. As they do and as the plans are updated and annual  implementation reports are provided that begin to show the level of  protection achieved, it will be important that the plans and reports add  value, both to the sectors themselves and to the government as a whole.  This is critical because DHS is dependent on these plans and reports to  meet its mandate to evaluate whether gaps exist in the protection of the  nation\u2019s most critical infrastructure and key resources and, if gaps exist, to  work with the sectors to address the gaps. Likewise, DHS must depend on  the private sector to voluntarily put protective measures in place for many  assets. It will also be important that sector councils have representative  members and that the sector-specific agencies have buy-in from these  members on protection plans and implementation steps. One step DHS  could take to implement our past recommendations to strengthen the  sharing of information is for the PCII program to better define its critical  infrastructure information needs and better explain how this information  will be used to build the private sector\u2019s trust and attract more users. As  we have previously reported, such sharing of information and the building  of trusted relationships are crucial to the protection of the nation\u2019s critical  infrastructure.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
