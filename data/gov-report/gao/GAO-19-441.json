For example, according to  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for  Health Statistics, in 2017, over 70,000 people died from drug overdoses  compared to approximately 47,000 such deaths in 2014.", "For the past decade, one key priority of U.S. efforts to combat the effects  of illicit drugs has been to reduce their availability. Many federal  departments and agencies are involved in efforts to reduce the availability  of drugs by countering the trafficking and flow of illicit drugs into the  United States. Among them are the Department of Defense (DOD) and  the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Regarding counterdrug  efforts, DOD is the lead department responsible for detecting and  monitoring (tracking) illicit drug trafficking into the United States and DHS  is responsible for securing the U.S. air, land, and sea borders to prevent  illegal activity. Both DOD and DHS created and lead interagency task  forces to help facilitate and strengthen efforts across federal agencies to  conduct counterdrug missions and activities to combat the flow of illicit  drugs into the United States. Given the number of federal counterdrug  task forces that exist, we focused this review on the two DOD and three  DHS joint task forces that conduct counterdrug missions and activities  and have overlapping areas of responsibility, particularly in the maritime  domain. In particular, for DOD we included Joint Interagency Task  Forces (JIATF)\u2014JIATF-South and JIATF-West. These interagency task  forces were formed in 1989 as partnerships between military and federal  law enforcement agencies to coordinate and conduct counterdrug  operations. For DHS, we included three Joint Task Forces (JTFs)\u2014JTF- East, JTF-West, and JTF-Investigations\u2014that were created in 2014 to  enhance and unify DHS efforts, and those of its component agencies  (components), to secure the U.S. southern border and approaches to the  United States via land, sea, or air.", "These five task forces have a role in U.S. counterdrug efforts, such as by  supporting the removal of cocaine bound for the United States and  strengthening interagency and foreign partners\u2019 counterdrug capabilities.  However, questions have been raised about their effectiveness and the  extent of coordination between them, including potential duplication of  counterdrug missions and activities. You asked us to review these five  task forces\u2019 coordination efforts, and their ability to conduct operations  effectively. In this report, we (1) describe the missions of JIATF-South,  JIATF-West, and the three DHS JTFs; (2) assess the extent to which  these task forces coordinate effectively with one another to minimize  duplication of missions and activities; and (3) examine how these task  forces measure the effectiveness of their missions and activities.", "To describe the missions of the task forces, we collected and reviewed  documentation related to each task force\u2019s missions and activities, such  as mission statements, guidance, memoranda, policies, and prior reports.  We also interviewed officials from each of the task forces, as well as key  components and offices, such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection  (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the U.S. Coast  Guard (Coast Guard). We obtained from these officials additional details  related to the task forces\u2019 missions and activities, including information on  any task force reorganization efforts that have taken place since fiscal  year 2014, such as the JIATF-West reorganization in early 2016.

Additionally,  we collected and reviewed documentation on the extent to which the task  forces coordinated with one another, such as joint operations plans and  joint investigation reports; as well as the mechanisms used for  coordination, such as joint meetings and the use of liaisons. We also met  with officials at each of the five task forces to discuss and observe the  task forces\u2019 planning and coordination efforts. Further, we developed a  set of 17 structured interview questions\u2014which we derived from our  Duplication, Overlap, and Fragmentation guide and our prior work on  collaboration and coordination best practices\u2014to interview a group of  knowledgeable officials at each of the five task forces on their  coordination efforts. Specifically, we asked officials in each of the task  forces to describe the nature of the task force\u2019s coordination efforts, to  include: (1) the presence of a collaborative relationship with each of the  other task forces; (2) the circumstances under which it coordinates; (3)  the various mechanisms used to coordinate; and (4) views on the  effectiveness of the coordination with each of the other task forces. To  quantify these results, we conducted a network analysis in which we  aggregated the responses to our structured interview questions about the  nature and mechanisms used by the task forces to communicate and  coordinate with one another and developed a representation of the  patterns of collaboration among the task forces. We then analyzed these  networks to determine the extent to which the task forces were using  mechanisms our prior work had identified as best practices for effective  coordination. We then used task force documentation, such as joint  operations after action reports, to validate the responses regarding the  coordination mechanisms used.

We assessed the task forces\u2019  performance measures against criteria, such as departmental  performance assessment standard operating procedures, best practices  to enhance performance management and measurement processes we  have identified in our prior work, and federal internal control standards  related to monitoring performance. Additionally, we examined measures  against relevant requirements in the 2017 National Defense Authorization  Act. To assess the reliability of the performance measures and any  underlying data used to inform the performance assessments from fiscal  years 2014 through 2018, we reviewed documentation, such as data dictionaries, system manuals, and user guides. We also interviewed task  force officials to better understand the processes for inputting and  monitoring the quality of the data and inputs, and how they identify and  address any deficiencies. Additionally, we interviewed task force officials  about how the data and other inputs were used, and the methodologies  for assessing the task forces\u2019 missions and activities.

According to JIATF- South officials, this focus is partly because the key coca-producing  countries are within its area of responsibility, and partly because  cocaine is a key source of profit for transnational criminal  organizations. JIATF-South is also allocated assets, such as ships  and surveillance aircraft, from DOD and DHS components (such as  the Coast Guard and CBP Air and Marine Operations), as well as  from foreign partners.

In  contrast, JTF-Investigations focuses on supporting DHS-wide  investigations and sharing information to support the other two task  forces. Similar to JIATF-West, the JTFs do not have physical assets  to support these activities. According to JTF officials, this is partly  because the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act requires the  JTFs to be cost neutral.

Specifically, we found that JIATF-West (1) lacks a  vital few performance measures that summarize its overall effectiveness  that can be consistently assessed over time and (2) that it does not have  established targets for assessing the effectiveness of its numerous  missions and activities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "JIATF-West Lacks a Vital Few, Comprehensive Performance Measures That Summarize Its Effectiveness and Are Consistent Over Time", "paragraphs": ["JIATF-West has focused its performance measures on assessing its  numerous initiatives and activities; however, it has not developed a vital  few, comprehensive performance measures that summarize the overall  effectiveness of its numerous initiatives and activities in a manner that  would convey essential information on its counterdrug activities to  decision makers at the DOD command level and above. Such information  could help these decision makers better understand the overall  effectiveness of JIATF-West\u2019s counterdrug missions and activities in  relation to broader U.S. counterdrug efforts. For example, JIATF-West  could develop a performance measure that calculates the percentage of  leads it provides to foreign partners that result in seizures or  apprehensions. Such a measure could demonstrate JIATF-West\u2019s overall  effectiveness in supporting allies and foreign partners in combating illicit  drug trafficking in its area of responsibility, in keeping with one of its  operational priorities.", "Guidance on performance measures from the DOD Office of the Deputy  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Counternarcotics and Global Threats  states that agencies should develop a vital few measures, no more than  two or three, which convey essential information on counterdrug activities  to decision makers. JIATF-West used to assess and report such  measures as recently as fiscal year 2015. For example, it reported scores  on the effectiveness of its mission and broader lines of effort, such as  countering illicit drug and precursor chemical flows in its area of  responsibility. However, JIATF-West officials told us they stopped  reporting on these performance measures in fiscal year 2015 because,  from the task force\u2019s perspective, the measures did not provide  meaningful insights into the effectiveness of the task force\u2019s operations.  However, such performance measures could provide meaningful  information on the effectiveness of JIATF-West\u2019s counterdrug activities to  decision makers at the DOD command level and above, even if such  summary information might not affect the effectiveness of operations at  the task force level. We have previously reported on the importance of  developing performance measures that demonstrate broader  effectiveness and have also reported it is worthwhile for agencies to  develop them to better determine and understand the overall  effectiveness of their missions and activities.", "Further, JIATF-West is also unable to assess the effectiveness of its  initiatives and activities over time because it has annually changed the  way it measures the effectiveness of more than 100 counterdrug  initiatives and activities. Specifically, JIATF-West has adjusted how it  assesses the initiatives and activities each year since 2014\u2014for example,  by changing the weight scale for scoring its initiatives and activities to  give more emphasis to some over others. These changes to the  methodology make it difficult to compare results and assess the  effectiveness of its activities over time. DOD guidance states that  agencies should have measures that are consistent over time to capture  trend results. In discussing these issues with JIATF-West officials, they  stated that assessing the initiatives and activities provides valuable  information on the effectiveness of the task force\u2019s efforts for internal, task  force management. They acknowledged that JIATF-West\u2019s performance  measures could be improved to allow for assessments of the  effectiveness of the task force\u2019s activities over time, but they added that  they plan to use the same methodology to calculate the task force\u2019s  initiatives and activities scores in the future because this information is  still needed internally. Given that JIATF-West\u2019s individual initiatives and  activities change year to year, however, it will be difficult for JIATF-West  to assess trends in the effectiveness of its initiatives and activities over  time. By also establishing a vital few, comprehensive performance  measures that can be assessed consistently over time, as appropriate,  JIATF-West will be able to better convey trends in the overall  effectiveness of its counterdrug missions and activities over time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "JIATF-West Lacks Specific Performance Targets for Its Initiatives and Activities", "paragraphs": ["JIATF-West has not developed specific performance targets (i.e.,  established acceptable levels of performance or outcomes) for its  initiatives and activities as part of its documented assessment  methodology, and no such targets appear in any of the task force\u2019s  annual assessment reports. When assessing its initiatives and activities,  JIATF-West officials told us it aims to achieve the best possible  outcome\u2014or the highest possible score\u2014for each of the initiatives and  activities it undertakes and assesses. DOD guidance states that targets  should be set for each performance measure to establish a minimum  level of performance to be accomplished within a given time frame.

Since they began reporting on their performance, the  measures the JTFs reported changed in fiscal year 2018 and, according  to JTF officials, will change again in fiscal year 2019. Specifically, in the  fiscal year 2017 performance report, the JTFs reported on activities, such  as the amounts of drugs seized, arrests made, and currency seized.  However, according to task force officials, the 2017 report\u2019s performance  measures did not accurately reflect the strategic-level coordination the  JTFs performed. For example, the measures the JTFs reported in fiscal  year 2017 focused on drug seizures and arrests made by the DHS  components. While the drug seizures and arrests made by the DHS  components may have been made possible because of coordination  activities of the DHS JTFs, using data on drug seizures and arrests as  JTF performance measures resulted in double-counting because the  components reported on the same seizures and arrests for their  respective counterdrug programs.", "To address these issues for fiscal year 2018, the JTFs and the DHS  Coordination Cell developed a new set of performance measures that  were intended to better reflect the JTFs\u2019 coordination activities and contributions. For example, a new JTF performance measure developed  for fiscal year 2018 included the number of leads that the JTFs provided  to a partner law enforcement agency, DHS component, or foreign  government partner for interdiction or investigative action. Table 3 shows  the evolution of the JTF performance measures from fiscal year 2017 to  fiscal year 2018.", "The 2017 National Defense Authorization Act requires the Secretary of  DHS to establish outcome-based and other appropriate performance  measures to evaluate the effectiveness of each joint task force.  Although the DHS JTF Coordination Cell and the JTFs developed  performance measures in fiscal year 2018 that better reflect the specific  missions and activities of the three task forces, these measures are  focused on outputs\u2014such as the number of operations conducted in  combating transnational criminal organizations\u2014and not outcomes, such  as the number or percentage of leads that resulted in seizures of illicit  drugs. According to JTF Coordination Cell officials, the fiscal year 2018  JTF performance measures are not outcome-based because it is difficult  to quantify and capture the contributions of the JTFs through their roles  as coordinators and facilitators of missions and activities that are  conducted by DHS components. Table 4 illustrates each of the DHS JTF  performance results for fiscal year 2018 under the revised measures.", "In addition to the changes to the performance measures made from fiscal  years 2017 to 2018, JTF Coordination Cell officials told us in October  2018 they plan to further revise their performance measures for fiscal  year 2019, as they believe their measures could continue to improve to  better reflect the value added by the JTFs and their coordination and  information-sharing activities. JTF Coordination Cell officials further stated  that they had considered linking the fiscal year 2018 performance  measures to relevant strategic-level outcomes in DHS plans. However,  they noted that such outcomes\u2014including the number of drug seizures  and apprehensions\u2014are already reported by the individual DHS  components and they are trying to avoid the double-counting that  occurred in the fiscal year 2017 performance report.", "We acknowledge that the types of coordination activities that the JTFs  perform are inherently more difficult to measure, but developing and  implementing outcome-based performance measures that reflect the  value the JTFs add would better position the JTFs to demonstrate the  effectiveness of their coordination efforts. For example, a performance  measure that calculates the percentage of leads provided to components,  partner law enforcement agencies, or foreign government partners that  result in a successful seizure or arrest could help demonstrate the JTFs\u2019  contributions to DHS counterdrug efforts.
