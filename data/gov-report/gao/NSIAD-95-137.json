DOD uses the report as a management tool to monitor changes in the level of inventory. In the report, DOD identifies an approved acquisition objective inventory, which it defines as items needed to satisfy the wartime and peacetime requirements to equip and sustain U.S. and allied forces in accordance with DOD policies and plans.", "When the total of on-hand and due-in inventories falls to or below a certain level\u2014called the reorder point\u2014inventory managers place orders for additional inventory. Depending on the item, the reorder point may include requirements for one or more of the following: war reserves that are authorized to be purchased, customer requisitions that have not been filled, a safety level to be on hand in case of minor interruptions in the resupply process or unpredictable fluctuations in demand, items to be issued during the period between when a need to buy an item is identified and when it is received (lead time), items held as insurance against inventory outages, and items to be issued during the repair period for repairable items.", "Because the reorder point provides for items to be used during the lead time and for a safety level, inventory managers can place orders so that the orders arrive before out-of-stock situations occur.

Specifically, we found that the Navy computed its portion of the shortage by including (1) about $5 billion of principal items (e.g., ship and aircraft components not considered to be secondary inventory) and (2) $2 billion of items supplied by contractors or managed by other DOD components or petroleum products. Also, DOD\u2019s figure included $2.4 billion of standard price surcharges that increased acquisition costs by adding charges for transportation and inventory losses.", "Of the $16.4 billion shortage, $6.1 billion was needed to satisfy economic order quantity requirements and $10.3 billion was needed to satisfy reorder point requirements.

The reorder point shortage deceased by $5.9 billion, while the economic order quantity shortage decreased by $2.4 billion.", "Of the $8.1 billion shortfall, $3.3 billion was for aviation parts managed by the Army\u2019s Aviation and Troop Support Command, the Navy\u2019s Aviation Supply Office, and the Air Force\u2019s San Antonio Air Logistics Center and for clothing and textile items managed by DLA\u2019s Defense Personnel Support Center. Officials at these locations attributed the reduced shortage to removing Desert Storm requirements, downsizing the military forces, eliminating DLA war reserve requirements, and decreasing requirements due to reduced levels of operations.", "The transfer of consumable items to DLA also contributed to reduced shortages in the Navy and the Air Force.", "Our analyses of inventory records showed that requirements were reduced significantly between September 1991 and September 1993. Reorder point requirements, including war reserves, safety levels, and lead times, decreased by $19.5 billion (34 percent), from $58 billion to $38.5 billion. The decreased requirements allowed inventory to be reduced to lower levels before replenishment orders were placed.

On March 31, the item had a reorder point shortage of 1,862. The inventory manager purchased 2,309 vanes in April. Because the inventory was subsequently drawn down and requirements increased, a second purchase for 1,920 vanes was made in July and a third purchase of 2,070 vanes in October. The inventory manager for the vane said that the shortages were a normal function of the supply system and resulted in inventory purchases.

For example, on March 31, 1993, the Aviation Supply Office had a shortage of two power turbine assemblies used on the CH-46E helicopter. Because of lower demands and field activities turning in items for repair, the inventory manager not only did not buy the 2 assemblies but canceled a purchase request for 17 assemblies. The item had a replacement cost of about $135,000 each. In March 1993, the Navy was short eight panel assemblies used on the H-53A helicopter. The Aviation Supply Office did not buy the assemblies because the H-53A helicopter was obsolete and not in service. The panel assembly has not been purchased since 1982 and, if needed, on-hand assemblies can be used.

For example, in March 1993, a receiver transmitter used on various aircraft had a reorder point shortage for eight valued at $126,244. The inventory manager at the Aviation Supply Office did not expect to buy any receiver transmitters because the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force were turning in large quantities of the transmitters and the demand for it was decreasing. In September 1993, the Air Force was short six fiberglass containers used for shipping the inlet fan on the F100 engine. The shortage was valued at $39,345. The San Antonio Air Logistics Center did not buy for the shortage because the fiberglass container had been replaced by a metal container. The fiberglass containers were discontinued because they had higher damage rates than the metal containers and the repair procedures for the fiberglass containers were not environmentally acceptable. In May 1994, DLA was short 42,992 sweaters valued at $484,286. There are four different sizes of a modacrylic and wool fiber sweater the Air Force, the Army, and the Navy use.
