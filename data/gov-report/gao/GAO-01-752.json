New and valuable information on the plans, goals, and strategies of federal agencies has been provided since federal agencies began implementing GPRA. Under GPRA, annual performance plans are to clearly inform the Congress and the public of (1) the annual performance goals for agencies\u2019 major programs and activities, (2) the measures that will be used to gauge performance, (3) the strategies and resources required to achieve the performance goals, and (4) the procedures that will be used to verify and validate performance information. These annual plans, issued soon after transmittal of the president\u2019s budget, provide a direct linkage between an agency\u2019s longer-term goals and mission and day-to-day activities. Annual performance reports are to subsequently report on the degree to which performance goals were met. The issuance of the agencies\u2019 performance reports, due by March 31, represents a new and potentially more substantive phase in the implementation of GPRA\u2014the opportunity to assess federal agencies\u2019 actual performance for the prior fiscal year and to consider what steps are needed to improve performance, and reduce costs in the future.", "VA\u2019s mission reflects the nation\u2019s historic commitment to care for veterans, their families, and their survivors. VA administers a variety of programs, including one of the world\u2019s largest health care systems. VA estimates that, in fiscal year 2000, it spent about $42 billion\u2014more than 80 percent of its total budget\u2014to provide health care services to 3.6 million veterans and to pay disability compensation and pensions to over 3.2 million veterans and their families and survivors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assessment of VA\u2019s Progress and Strategies in Accomplishing Selected Key Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["This section discusses our analysis of VA\u2019s performance in achieving its selected key outcomes and the strategies VA has in place, including strategic human capital management and information technology, for accomplishing these outcomes. In discussing these outcomes, we have also provided information drawn from our prior work on the extent to which VA provided assurance that the performance information it is reporting is credible."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Quality and Cost of Veterans\u2019 Health Care", "paragraphs": ["Overall, VA reported making good progress towards achieving its key outcome of providing quality health care to veterans at a reasonable cost to the government in fiscal year 2000. For example, VA reported that its average cost per patient was 2 percent less than last year. VA also reported that performance improved for most of its key measures compared to last year\u2019s performance. However, VA reported a decline in performance for two key measures (see table 1).", "VA\u2019s performance report, in general, demonstrated progress toward achieving its key performance goals. The key goals\u2014the goals VA\u2019s senior management consider most important\u2014show how well VA is doing in providing quality health care to veterans at a reasonable cost. For each key measure, VA provided a discussion of the extent to which it met its fiscal year 2000 goal. In addition, VA provided baseline and performance data, where available, to show the extent to which performance has changed over several fiscal years.", "For most of the key goals that VA did not achieve, it explained why the goals were not achieved. Also, VA provided supplementary information to show that the performance deficiency was either not significant or that VA\u2019s performance improved in fiscal year 2000. For example, VA reported that while it did not meet its patient satisfaction goals, its performance on other patient satisfaction surveys showed that VA patients were more satisfied than patients of private-sector health care providers. Also, VA noted that the differences between its planned and actual performance on the patient satisfaction measures were not significant, because they were within the margin of error for its annual patient satisfaction survey.", "VA could have done a better job, however, of explaining in its performance report why some key performance goals were not met. For example, VA did not explain why it did not meet its goal to have at least 75 percent of patients with scheduled appointments see a provider within 20 minutes of their scheduled appointment time. It provided a partial explanation of why it did not obtain at least 3.7 percent of its medical care funding from alternative revenue streams. However, VA\u2019s performance plan cited factors contributing to the decline in collections. For example, the plan noted that more veterans are enrolling in managed care organizations from which VA cannot typically collect because it is not a participating provider.", "In addition, VA\u2019s performance report included two key health care performance measures that VA has not yet quantified. These measures, based in part on previous GAO reports and recommendations, are for the percentages of patients who are able to obtain initial appointments within 30 days for primary or specialty care. Also, VA is in the process of improving its ability to collect the necessary data to measure its performance. It plans to use fiscal year 2001 data as its baseline for setting future annual performance goals.", "VA\u2019s performance report shows VA\u2019s continuing efforts to address deficiencies in the quality of its performance data. For most\u2014though not all\u2014of its key health care performance measures, VA identified the sources of performance data, and how data quality is assured. VA\u2019s data quality initiatives include, for example, hiring a full-time Data Quality Coordinator, and revising coding procedures and training to help improve the collection of clinical data. Also, due in part to the IG\u2019s recommendations, VA implemented edit checks of its system data to improve the quality of the data used to report the number of unique VA patients.", "In addition to health care performance data, VA also needs quality financial data. VA received an unqualified opinion on its fiscal year 2000 financial audit report. However, VA continues to experience problems with its financial management systems, including information security and integrated financial management systems weaknesses. Further, VA is unable to accumulate cost data at the activity level. Reliable cost information is needed for VA to assess its operating performance.", "VA\u2019s performance report generally provides clear and reasonable descriptions of its strategies for correcting performance deficiencies and improving future performance on its key performance measures, even in those areas where VA met its fiscal year 2000 performance goal. For example, while VA met its goal for the Chronic Disease Care Index, which is a significant quality indicator, it provided strategies to continue to improve its performance in the future, including initiatives to improve patient safety and provide clinical training to medical staff. VA also identified numerous strategies and initiatives for improving performance in areas where performance goals were not met, such as   enhancing provider/patient communications,   expanding access to VA health care through increased use of community- based outpatient clinics and use of short-term contracts with non-VA specialists,   expanding the use of clinical guidelines, and   educating patients and staff on prevention programs.", "VA identified human capital strategies to improve patient access and appointment timeliness. For example, VA plans to   hire additional clinical staff to improve access and appointment timeliness,   add specialists to its primary care teams to provide veterans with a greater variety of services, even at some community-based clinics.", "VA\u2019s discussions included some information technology strategies regarding health care. For example, VA is integrating telemedicine technologies into ambulatory care delivery systems to increase patient access and efficiency of health care delivery. VA noted that its facilities are equipped with compatible video-conferencing technology for facilitating geographically remote clinical consultations and patient examinations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Processing Veterans\u2019 Benefit Claims", "paragraphs": ["VA reported making little progress toward achieving its key outcome of processing compensation and pension benefit claims timely and accurately in fiscal year 2000. Although VA did not meet any of its fiscal year 2000 key performance goals for this outcome, VA reported some improvement in the time required to resolve appeals of claims. However, VA reported that performance declined from fiscal year 1999 to 2000 with respect to the other key measures (see table 2).", "In its performance report, VA provided a clear discussion of the extent to which it met each of its key performance goals for fiscal year 2000. In addition, VA provided baseline and performance data where available, to show the performance over several fiscal years. In the discussion of its performance, VA noted that it expected timeliness to worsen in fiscal year 2001 because of the effect additional legislative and regulatory requirements will likely have on claims-processing time.", "For two of the key goals, VA explained why the goals were not achieved. Some of the reasons VA cited for the shortfall in the claims-processing timeliness and/or the national accuracy rate included VA (1) underestimating how long it would take to realize the positive impact of initiatives such as increased staffing, improved quality reviews, and training directed at specific deficiencies; (2) using a more rigorous quality review system than in the past; and (3) having to address complex regulatory changes affecting the manner in which claims are processed. Based, in part, on previous GAO reports and recommendations on claims processing, VA is strengthening its system for reviewing claims accuracy\u2014the Statistical Technical Accuracy Review\u2014by collecting more specific data on deficiencies concerning incorrect decisions in those regional offices that have accuracy problems. In addition, VA is evaluating and disseminating information on regional office practices that hold promise for improving performance nationwide, according to VA officials. While VA explained why it did not achieve its accuracy and timeliness goals for disability rating-related claims, it did not explain why it did not meet the timeliness goal for appeals resolution. VA noted improvement in its appeals resolution timeliness although it did not meet its established goal.", "VA\u2019s performance report provides an increasing assurance that its performance information is credible. For example, VA is conducting independent reviews of a sample of claims to assess accuracy rates and weekly assessments of transactions to identify questionable timeliness data from regional offices.", "VA provided clear and reasonable discussions of strategies, including information technology initiatives, for improving future performance on key claims-processing goals. For example, VA is rewriting claims- processing manuals in an easy-to-understand format to enable employees to find information quickly. In addition, VA has implemented the Veterans On-Line APPlications (VONAPP) that allows veterans to electronically complete and submit applications for compensation, pension, and other benefits. However, we recently testified that VONAPP faces potential security vulnerabilities as a result of weaknesses in general support systems and operating subsystems access controls that affect the department\u2019s overall computer operation. Also, VA is developing the Veterans Service Network\u2019s Compensation and Pension Benefits Replacement System, which is expected to provide greater access to claimant information through a state-of-the-art automated environment. We testified that this project has suffered from numerous problems and schedule delays, which threaten the overall success of the initiative. In addition, VA is piloting, testing, or enhancing the operational capability for (1) the Compensation and Pension Record Interchange to provide enhanced accessibility to VHA records, (2) the Personnel Information Exchange System to allow for electronic exchange of military personnel records with DOD, and (3) the Virtual VA, to create a work environment for electronic claims processing.", "VA\u2019s performance report discusses human capital strategies for dealing with the fact that one-fourth of its claims-processing staff will become eligible to retire over the next 5 years. VA\u2019s succession planning strategy includes recruiting new staff, redirecting staff from other offices, and providing training. VA hired over 450 new claims-processing staff during fiscal year 2000. In addition, VA plans to redirect 200 existing staff to claims-processing positions and hire nearly 250 new staff during fiscal year 2001. Although VA identified human capital strategies for hiring, redirecting, and training staff, its performance plan does not identify performance goals and measures that are linked to the program improvement planned. VA is continuing to develop computer-assisted training modules and other materials on claims processing under the Training and Performance Support System to train the large wave of new hires and current employees who will replace prospective retirees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disabled Veterans Employment", "paragraphs": ["VA reported making good progress toward achieving its key outcome of assisting disabled veterans in acquiring and maintaining suitable employment.

Also, VA reported its performance improved by 12 percentage points over its fiscal year 1999 performance.", "VA\u2019s performance report clearly explains the initiatives it believes were responsible for exceeding the goal. For example, VA refocused the program to make the primary goal obtaining suitable employment, improved the assessment of veterans\u2019 work skills transferable to the civilian labor market, and increased the number of placements in suitable jobs.", "To improve the credibility of VR&E\u2019s performance information, VA continues to have regional office staff regularly review a sample of cases for quality and VA headquarters staff evaluate data for validity and reliability.", "VA provides reasonable and clear discussions of strategies to continue to place veterans in suitable employment. As part of these strategies, VA is changing the skill mix of its staff from vocational rehabilitation specialists to employment specialists, and from counseling psychologists to vocational rehabilitation counselors. In addition, VA has established a Blue Ribbon Panel to review the program\u2019s policies and practices and evaluate them against best practices of other organizations.", "Although VA is responsible for VR&E, it partners with the Department of Labor\u2019s (DOL) Veterans\u2019 Employment and Training Service (VETS), that also helps veterans obtain training and employment. VA conducts joint training with DOL for VETS-funded state and local training and job placement staff.

VA added a section describing its efforts to address major management challenges identified by GAO and VA\u2019s IG. The Office of Inspector General, for each management challenge it identified, described the challenge and identified recommendations that VA has, and has not, implemented. For example, regarding inappropriate benefit payments, the IG noted that VA has implemented its recommendation to enter into a matching agreement with the Social Security Administration for prison records. However, the IG noted that VA has not yet implemented recommendations to identify and adjust the benefits of incarcerated veterans and dependents, recover overpayments to veterans who have been released from prison, and establish a method to ensure that regional offices properly adjust benefits for incarcerated veterans and dependents in a timely manner.

For example, VA has identified additional key measures it believes are important to assessing how well it is meeting the needs of veterans and their families. These include additional measures of patient safety, health care cost-effectiveness, and customer satisfaction with VA services. In general, VA continues to provide adequate discussions of strategies for improving future performance and update performance goals based on past performance. Also, VA provides additional information on (1) costs associated with meeting strategic goals and objectives, (2) efforts to improve data quality, and (3) ways to address major management challenges.", "VA\u2019s fiscal year 2002 performance plan represents a significant change in the way VA measures its performance toward achieving its key outcome of providing quality health care to veterans at a reasonable cost. Starting with fiscal year 2001, VA will no longer have key measures for the percentage increase in the number of unique patients; the percentage decrease in per- patient costs; the decrease in the percentage of health care funding from alternative revenue streams; and the percentage of medical residents trained in primary care. VA is adding several new key performance measures to better assess progress toward achieving this outcome. For example, VA has designated the following as key measures:   A measure related to patient safety\u2014the percentage of root-cause analyses not correctly completed within 45 days of an adverse patient event. This is a quality measure, based on VA\u2019s system for continuously improving patient safety at its medical facilities. When medical errors occur, VA medical staffs are required to prepare root-cause analyses to identify the reasons for these errors. This information, in turn, can be used to identify corrective actions.", "Two indexes of overall VA medical care that include elements of quality, patient access, customer satisfaction, and cost. According to VA, these measures represent more sophisticated ways to measure the efficiency of its medical care than the former key measure of cost per patient, because they measure not just efficiency in providing care, but efficiency in providing high-quality and accessible care that meets patients\u2019 needs. These indexes include six other key goals in the fiscal year 2002 performance plan\u2014the revised Chronic Disease Care and Prevention Indexes; the three appointment timeliness measures; and the inpatient and outpatient customer satisfaction measures\u2014plus per-patient costs.", "VA reported that it, in general, makes changes to key measures (1) when actual performance has met or exceeded original strategic goals, (2) when further performance improvements are unlikely or unreasonable, (3) to ensure that measures are consistent with its strategic plan, and (4) when it develops better ways to measure its performance.", "VA continues to provide clear and reasonable discussions of strategies for improving performance and continues to revise its performance goals based on past performance. As previously discussed for each key outcome, VA provided strategies for how it expects to achieve its goals. VA described additional strategies in its plan that do not appear in the performance report. For example, VA will expand its initiative to process claims from active-duty service members awaiting discharge from military service. In addition, VA adjusted performance goals based on its fiscal year 2000 performance as well as external factors, such as new duty-to-assist legislation. For example, VA increased its fiscal year 2001 timeliness goal for processing of disability rating-related claims from 142 days to 202 days and established a goal of 273 days for fiscal year 2002. VA also revised its fiscal year 2001 claims-processing accuracy goal from 85 percent to 72 percent, and established a goal of 75 percent for fiscal year 2002.", "In its fiscal year 2002 performance plan, VA provides additional information on the estimated costs of meeting its fiscal year 2002 performance goals. The fiscal year 2001 performance plan included VA\u2019s estimates of obligations needed to meet each of its strategic goals. VA\u2019s fiscal year 2002 performance plan also provided estimated obligations by strategic objective. Because each of VA\u2019s four main strategic goals covers multiple objectives related to different VA programs, presenting cost data by objective provides a clearer linkage of funding to achievement of performance goals. Meanwhile, VA continues to work with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on a plan to restructure its budget accounts, so VA\u2019s budget presentations to the Congress can better link proposed funding with specific levels of performance.", "VA\u2019s fiscal year 2002 performance plan includes a more detailed discussion of its efforts to improve the quality of its performance data. For example, the Veterans Health Administration identifies in more detail its initiatives to improve the quality of its data on patient care developed by its health care facilities. It has initiatives to improve the quality of coding at facilities to ensure that the care provided to veterans is being correctly recorded. The Veteran Benefits Administration also provided more detailed information on its data quality efforts. It created a Data Management Office to work with its program offices to identify strategies and initiatives to address the collection, processing, and storage of quality data.", "In the fiscal year 2002 performance plan, VA restructured its discussion of major management challenges to mirror the challenges identified by GAO in our January 2001 Performance and Accountability Series report on VA, and the challenges identified by VA\u2019s IG in November 2000. For each of these challenges, VA provided information on the nature of the challenge, and the status of its efforts to resolve it. However, VA could have provided more specific discussions of its plans to address its major management challenges.
