In recent testimony, the Director of National Intelligence highlighted that many nation states, terrorist networks, and organized criminal groups have the capability to target elements of the United States information infrastructure for intelligence collection, intellectual property theft, or disruption. In July 2009, press accounts reported attacks on Web sites operated by major government agencies. The ever-increasing dependence of federal agencies on information systems to carry out essential, everyday operations can make them vulnerable to an array of cyber-based risks. Thus it is increasingly important that the federal government carry out a concerted effort to safeguard its systems and the information they contain. GAO is providing a statement describing (1) cyber threats to federal information systems and cyber-based critical infrastructures, (2) control deficiencies that make federal systems vulnerable to those threats, and (3) opportunities that exist for improving federal cybersecurity. In preparing this statement, GAO relied on its previously published work in this area."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Cyber-based threats to federal systems and critical infrastructure are evolving and growing. These threats can come from a variety of sources, including criminals and foreign nations, as well as hackers and disgruntled employees. These potential attackers have a variety of techniques at their disposal, which can vastly enhance the reach and impact of their actions. For example, cyber attackers do not need to be physically close to their targets, their attacks can easily cross state and national borders, and cyber attackers can easily preserve their anonymity. Further, the interconnectivity between information systems, the Internet, and other infrastructure presents increasing opportunities for such attacks. Consistent with this, reports of security incidents from federal agencies are on the rise, increasing by over 400 percent from fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2009. Compounding the growing number and kinds of threats, GAO--along with agencies' internal assessments--has identified significant deficiencies in the security controls on federal information systems, which have resulted in pervasive vulnerabilities. These include weaknesses in the security of both financial and non-financial systems and information, including vulnerabilities in critical federal systems. These deficiencies continue to place federal assets at risk of inadvertent or deliberate misuse, financial information at risk of unauthorized modification or destruction, and critical operations at risk of disruption. Multiple opportunities exist to improve federal cybersecurity. To address identified deficiencies in agencies' security controls and shortfalls in their information security programs, GAO and agency inspectors general have made hundreds of recommendations over the past several years, many of which agencies are implementing. In addition, the White House, the Office of Management and Budget, and certain federal agencies have undertaken several governmentwide initiatives intended to enhance information security at federal agencies. While progress has been made on these initiatives, they all face challenges that require sustained attention, and GAO has made several recommendations for improving the implementation and effectiveness of these initiatives. Further, the Department of Homeland Security also needs to fulfill its key cybersecurity responsibilities, such as developing capabilities for ensuring the protection of cyber-based critical infrastructures and implementing lessons learned from a major cyber simulation exercise. Finally, a GAO-convened panel of experts has made several recommendations for improving the nation's cybersecurity strategy. Realizing these opportunities for improvement can help ensure that the federal government's systems, information, and critical cyber-based infrastructures are effectively protected."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to testify at today\u2019s hearing on  cybersecurity regarding our recent work on challenges facing federal  efforts to protect systems and critical infrastructure from cyber-based  threats.", "Pervasive and sustained cyber attacks against the United States continue  to pose a potentially devastating impact on federal systems and  operations.

We have also recommended that  agencies fully implement comprehensive, agencywide information security  programs by correcting weaknesses in risk assessments, information  security policies and procedures, security planning, security training,  system tests and evaluations, and remedial actions. The effective  implementation of these recommendations will strengthen the security  posture at these agencies. Agencies have implemented or are in the  process of implementing many of our recommendations.", "In addition, the White House, OMB, and certain federal agencies have  undertaken several governmentwide initiatives that are intended to  enhance information security at federal agencies. However, these  initiatives face challenges that require sustained attention:    Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI): In January  2008, President Bush initiated a series of 12 projects aimed primarily at  improving the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) and other  federal agencies\u2019 efforts to protect against intrusion attempts and  anticipate future threats. The initiative is intended to reduce  vulnerabilities, protect against intrusions, and anticipate future threats  against federal executive branch information systems. As we recently  reported, the White House and federal agencies have established  interagency groups to plan and coordinate CNCI activities. However, the  initiative faces challenges in achieving its objectives related to securing  federal information, including better defining agency roles and  responsibilities, establishing measures of effectiveness, and establishing  an appropriate level of transparency. Until these challenges are adequately  addressed, there is a risk that CNCI will not fully achieve its goals.", "Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC): For this initiative, OMB  directed agencies that have workstations with Windows XP and/or  Windows Vista operating systems to adopt security configurations  developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the  Department of Defense, and DHS. The goal of this initiative is to improve  information security and reduce overall information technology operating  costs. We recently reported that while agencies have taken actions to  implement FDCC requirements, none of the agencies has fully  implemented all configuration settings on their applicable workstations. In  our report we recommended that OMB, among other things, issue  guidance on assessing the risks of agencies having deviations from the  approved settings and monitoring compliance with FDCC.", "Einstein: This is a computer network intrusion detection system that  analyzes network flow information from participating federal agencies and  is intended to provide a high-level perspective from which to observe  potential malicious activity in computer network traffic. We recently  reported that as of September 2009, fewer than half of the 23 agencies  reviewed had executed the required agreements with DHS, and Einstein 2  had been deployed to 6 agencies. Agencies that participated in Einstein 1  cited improved identification of incidents and mitigation of attacks, but  determining whether the initiative is meeting its objectives will likely  remain difficult because DHS lacks performance measures that address  how agencies respond to alerts.", "Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) Initiative: This is an effort designed  to optimize individual agency network services through a common  solution for the federal government.
