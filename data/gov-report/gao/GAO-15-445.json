GAO conducted site visits to 11 selected buildings in three metropolitan areas based on a variety of criteria, including security level, agency officials' recommendations, and for FPS, possible inconsistencies in its data on prohibited items, and other factors. GAO analyzed FPS's and USMS's data, reviewed relevant documentation, and interviewed FPS and USMS officials in headquarters and the field."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Federal Protective Service (FPS) and the Department of Justice's (DOJ) United States Marshals Service (USMS) experience a range of challenges in their efforts to provide effective security screening, including:", "Building characteristics and location may limit security options : many General Services Administration (GSA) buildings were designed and constructed before security screening became a priority.", "Balancing security and public access : striking an appropriate balance between facilitating the public's access to government services and providing adequate security can be difficult, for example, when there is a high volume of visitors.", "Operating with limited resources : some FPS protective security officers are not fully trained to conduct security screening, and FPS and USMS may have limited funding for additional training or additional security officers.", "Working with multiple federal tenants : many tenant stakeholders at multi-tenant GSA buildings have differing needs and priorities that may not always align when trying to build consensus for security-screening decisions.", "To assess security-screening efforts, both FPS and USMS have taken steps such as conducting covert and intrusion tests and collecting data on prohibited items. From fiscal years 2011 to 2013, FPS data show that protective security officers passed covert tests on security-screening procedures at a low rate. In October 2012, FPS reduced the number of screening scenarios used for covert testing, but has since reinstated some of them. USMS data show that court security officers passed intrusion tests on security screening at a higher rate. For example, USMS reported that court security officers passed 83 percent of intrusion tests on security screening in fiscal year 2010, 91 percent in fiscal year 2011, and 92 percent in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. Although USMS tests more frequently than FPS, it has not met its intrusion-test frequency requirement per building each year. In addition, FPS's and USMS's data on prohibited items show wide variations in the number of items identified across buildings. For example, FPS reported it had detected approximately 700,000 prohibited items in 2013; however, FPS data showed that there were 295 buildings with no reported data on prohibited items from fiscal years 2004 through 2013. While FPS and USMS may use the results of covert and intrusion tests to address problems at the individual building or FPS region or USMS district level, to some degree, they do not use the results to strategically assess performance nationwide. The benefits of using data in this manner are reflected in the Interagency Security Committee's (ISC) guidance, as well as key practices in security and internal control standards GAO has developed. Without a more strategic approach to assessing performance, both FPS and USMS are not well positioned to improve security screening nationwide, identify trends and lessons learned, and address the aforementioned challenges related to screening in a complex security environment."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FPS and USMS each develop and implement a strategy for using covert and intrusion testing, and prohibited-items data to improve security-screening efforts.

An individual in possession of or attempting to introduce a  prohibited item, including an illegal or dangerous item into a federal  building, is considered an individual who may pose a security threat. For  the purposes of this report, we focused our efforts on the security  screening of persons at access control points. This process varies at  each federal building based on a variety of factors, but a visitor to a FSL  IV federal building, for example, may undergo a full security screening,  which may include a protective security officer or court security officer  checking his or her government-issued identification, having his or her  belongings go through an x-ray machine, and the visitor physically  walking through a walk-through magnetometer. Federal employees may  undergo different levels of security screening at a federal building  depending on a variety of security-related factors unique to that building.  Screening of federal employees may range from a protective security  officer or court security officer verifying that the employee has a valid  government-issued identification card or an agency-issued credential, to  full screening that would require the employee to go through a similar  process as a visitor to a FSL IV federal building, as described above.", "FPS\u2019s protective security officers\u2014contract security guards\u2014are the most  visible component of FPS\u2019s operations, as well as the first contact with  federal agencies for individuals entering a federal building.

FPS protective  security officers are responsible for controlling access to federal buildings,  conducting security screening at access control points, enforcing property  rules and regulations, detecting and reporting criminal acts, and  responding to emergency situations involving building safety and security.  FPS protective security officers (1) control access to federal buildings by  checking the identification of government employees who work there as  well as members of the public who visit, and also (2) operate security- screening equipment, such as x-ray machines and walk-through  magnetometers, to ensure prohibited items\u2014including illegal items, such  as firearms, explosives, knives, and drugs\u2014do not enter federal  buildings. In general, FPS protective security officers do not have arrest  authority, but can detain individuals who are being disruptive or pose a  danger to public safety. According to FPS, it has around 13,000  protective security officers at approximately 2,700 of the 8,900 FPS- protected federal buildings across its 11 regions. Of those, FPS  conducts security screening of visitors and employees at approximately  2,400 buildings.

Facility security  committees and court security committees, which are composed of  representatives of tenant entities at federal buildings and other  stakeholders, have broad latitude in determining the security measures  appropriate for their facility. The decision regarding the optimal  combination of physical countermeasures (such as security barriers, x-ray  machines, closed circuit television, and number and type of security- screening access control points staffed by FPS protective security officers  and USMS court security officers) is based on a variety of factors. These  factors include a facility security assessment report conducted by FPS,the FSL, and the security needs of individual tenants. It is important to  note that facility security committees and court security committees,  rather than FPS and USMS, render the final decision regarding the  number and type of security-screening access control points and  technical countermeasures that are to be installed in each individual  building.

As such, the employees who enter the  building from the parking garage receive little to no screening beyond  checking their identification cards upon entry into the garage. Further,  according to USMS officials, in the instance that USMS determines the  building needs to increase its security, it would be difficult to screen  employees entering the building from the parking garage because the  court security officers would not be able to utilize most of the screening  equipment at the access control point due to the location of the elevators  relative to the access control point.", "Further, if a GSA building is considered to be historically significant\u2014that  is, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places or is eligible for  listing\u2014renovations by federal agencies must follow the requirements of  the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. Under the  act, federal agencies are to use historic properties to the maximum extent  feasible and retain and preserve the historic character of the property  when making infrastructure changes or rehabilitating a property. As we  have reported in the past, buildings listed on the National Register of  Historic Places or aging buildings may not be able to support, or may  make it more difficult to implement, security changes when complying  with the National Historic Preservation Act\u2019s requirements.", "Also, when trying to make security screening enhancements that will alter  the design or layout of a public space in a GSA building, such as to a  security screening access control point for the public, FPS and USMS  officials reported that it is challenging to coordinate such efforts with GSA  due to factors including GSA\u2019s limited budget and initiatives such as  GSA\u2019s First Impressions Program. The program emphasizes making  better \u201cfirst impressions\u201d for the visiting public and also for the building\u2019s  tenants, in the public spaces of existing federal buildings. Therefore,  GSA\u2019s First Impressions Program\u2019s goals can sometimes conflict with  what the tenant entities or FPS or USMS believe to be needed screening- security enhancements. According to USMS officials, working with GSA  can be challenging when trying to install new security enhancements or  making alterations to the space because the changes may not meet the  aesthetic framework GSA desired for the public space. For example,  there is a severe glare caused by the sun\u2019s reflection through the  windows into the lobby during a significant portion of the day, where the  security screening access control point for the public is located at a  building that we visited. According to USMS officials at the building, the  glare obscures the court security officer\u2019s ability to see incoming visitors.  The glare also affects the court security officer\u2019s view of the x-ray  machine\u2019s computer monitor, potentially impeding the court security  officer\u2019s ability to appropriately screen items sent through the x-ray  machine (see fig. 1 below). However, according to USMS officials, GSA  will not allow USMS to apply a tinting on the windows to reduce the  impact of the glare because it would alter the aesthetics of the public  space. At the time of our review, USMS and GSA had not resolved this  issue. At a different entrance at the same building, solar glare made it  difficult for court security officers to see individuals entering the building.  USMS, however, was able to work with GSA to come up with a mutually  agreeable solution. GSA suggested and created a \u201cliving wall\u201d by planting  foliage to help cover an exterior plain white wall, which had reflected  sunlight into the building (see fig. 2 below)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Balancing Security and Public Access", "paragraphs": ["Striking an appropriate balance between providing security at federal  buildings, and facilitating the public\u2019s access to government offices for  services and other business transactions, continues to be a major  challenge, as we have reported in the past. FPS and USMS officials at 6  of the 11 buildings we visited noted this challenge. We previously  reported that GSA\u2019s goal is to create an environment that reflects an  open, welcome atmosphere, as well as to protect against those with the  intent to do harm. GSA also considers federal workers\u2019 convenience and  privacy an important part of these considerations. For example, federal  employees may undergo different levels of security screening depending  on a variety of building-specific factors which may range from a federal  identification check to a full screening, as the general public would  experience. Federal agencies face particular challenges in GSA buildings  with high public demand requiring regular public access. Such buildings  include courthouses and federal office buildings that house agencies such  as the SSA, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services  (USCIS), and the Internal Revenue Service.", "According to the ISC, the potential threat to federal tenant entities within a  multi-tenant building is based on several factors, which include, but are  not limited to whether:  the tenant entity\u2019s mission and interaction with certain segments of the  public is adversarial in nature (e.g., criminal and bankruptcy courts,  high-risk law enforcement);  the tenant entity\u2019s mission draws attention of organized protest groups  (e.g., Environmental Protection Agency, courthouses, Department of  Energy); and  the building is located in a high-crime area, as determined by local law  enforcement.", "For example, according to SSA headquarters officials, the majority of  challenges the agency experiences results from the tension between  trying to provide effective security while accomplishing its mission. The  SSA\u2019s mission is to deliver social security services that meet the needs of  the public. To accomplish its mission, the SSA has 1,256 field offices  where the agency provides in-person services to the public. Security has  become such a pressing concern that there are armed FPS protective security officers at all SSA offices that involve customer interactions. Furthermore, many field offices are specifically located in areas easily  accessible to the public, which requires some offices to be located in  higher risk crime areas, increasing their security risks.", "In some instances, the SSA has delegated security authority from FPS, and would then  be responsible for providing the armed security officers. each day, primarily for services provided by USCIS or the Internal  Revenue Service. USCIS created separate entrances with screening  access control points at two buildings we visited, to provide additional  security while also managing the number of visitors to the USCIS offices.  At both buildings, USCIS paid for the dedicated screening access control  points for its customers, including the screening equipment and the  additional protective security officers.

As a result,  protective security officers deployed to federal buildings may have been  operating x-ray and walk-through magnetometer equipment for which  they have not been trained to use, thus raising questions about their  ability to fulfill a primary responsibility at screening access control points.", "We have made recommendations for FPS to improve upon its security- screening procedures, and FPS has taken some steps to do so.Specifically, FPS has begun to implement its16-hour National Weapons  Detection Training program. This program, referred to as \u201cscreener  training,\u201d was included in all new solicitations for contract protective  security-officer vendor companies issued in fiscal year 2014, according to  FPS headquarters officials. This program doubles the screener training  that protective security officers had received under prior contracts and  includes performance-oriented training and testing. In February 2014, the  first contract was awarded that included the 16-hour \u201cscreener training,\u201d  according to FPS headquarters officials. FPS-certified inspectors are to  provide the \u201cscreener training\u201d to those protective security officers  covered under the new contract. According to FPS officials at the  headquarters and regional level, the initial feedback from the protective  security officers who have undergone the new training has been very  positive. The implementation of this program, however, will take time.  Typically, protective security-officer vendor contracts are for 5-year  periods, and according to a FPS headquarters official, contracts can be  modified at any time to add within scope changes such as the new  \u201cscreener training\u201d provision. In addition, to offset resource demands on  FPS for providing the additional \u201cscreener training\u201d and to increase  accountability for all new solicitations, FPS selected four contracts in  three regions for a \u201cTrain the Trainer\u201d pilot.

FPS and the respective  protective security officer companies modified four contracts in March  2014. The \u201cTrain the Trainer\u201d pilot officially began in April 2014.", "Limited resources may contribute to the added challenge of not having  enough protective security officers. According to FPS headquarters  officials, limited staff is due to limited funding at the facility level (building- specific) or tenant agency level (tenant-specific). For example, despite  ISC standards that specify that each protective security officer should  only be responsible for one screening task at a security-access control  point, during our building visits, we found several instances when a  protective security officer was conducting multiple screening tasks due to  limited staff. For example, at one building we visited, there are three  security screening access control points, each with two protective security  officers who are responsible for (1) checking employee identification, (2)  manning the x-ray machine, and (3) manning the walk-through  magnetometer. According to an FPS regional official, despite the fact that  this building is the largest building in the West Coast by square footage,  there is a limited FPS presence on-site, relative to the size of the building.  In some instances, a roving protective security officer may backfill at a  security screening access control point if it gets busy, but screening may  not be within his or her responsibilities or an area he or she is specifically  trained in. At another building we visited, USMS officials made the  decision to close one of its three security screening-access control points  in November 2013 due to budget shortfalls.", "According to USMS headquarters officials, obtaining adequate resources  and funding is always an issue, but USMS is continuing to take steps to  develop its security program. In 2013, USMS doubled the annual training  requirement for court security officers, focused primarily on security  screening.
