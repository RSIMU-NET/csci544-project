Our objectives were to assess (1) the funding and status of CSEPP in Alabama and Calhoun County; (2) the impact of federal, state, and local management on Alabama\u2019s program; and (3) Calhoun County\u2019s opposition to the chemical stockpile disposal facility that the Army plans to build at the Anniston Army Depot."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In November 1985, the Congress directed the Department of Defense (DOD) to destroy the U.S. stockpile of obsolete chemical agents and munitions and also directed that the disposal program provide for the maximum protection of the environment, the public, and the personnel involved in disposing of the munitions. Although the Army considers the likelihood of a chemical release at one of its eight storage sites to be extremely small, the health effects of an accident can be severe. Some munitions contain nerve agents, which can disrupt the nervous system and lead to loss of muscular control and death. Others contain a series of blister agents commonly, but incorrectly, referred to as mustard agents, which blister the skin and can be lethal in large amounts.", "State and local officials, in accordance with state laws, have primary responsibility for developing and implementing emergency response programs for communities in the event of an emergency. In 1988, the Army established CSEPP to assist communities near the chemical stockpile storage sites to enhance existing emergency preparedness and response capabilities in the unlikely event of a chemical accident. Most communities near the sites had little capability to respond to a chemical emergency when CSEPP began. Threats to the stockpile include external events such as earthquakes, airplane crashes, and tornadoes and internal events such as spontaneous leakage of chemical agent, accidents during handling and maintenance activities, and self-ignition of propellant. The effect of a chemical stockpile accident would depend on such things as the amount and type of agent released, meteorological conditions, and the community\u2019s proximity to the storage site and emergency response capabilities.", "The Department of the Army is responsible for managing and funding CSEPP. Section 1521(c)(3) of 50 U.S.C. states that the Secretary of Defense may make grants to state and local governments, either directly or through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to assist those governments in carrying out functions related to emergency preparedness. Under a memorandum of understanding, the Army delegated partial management of the program to FEMA. As the primary source of technical expertise in chemical weapons, the Army determines overall program direction and provides funding. As the primary source of expertise in emergency preparedness, FEMA distributes Army funds to states through cooperative agreements and provides technical assistance. \u201cCooperative agreements\u201d are legal instruments that provide federal funds when there will be substantial involvement by federal agencies in the management of state and local programs. In contrast to cooperative agreements, \u201cfederal grants\u201d are legal instruments that provide funds when there will be no substantial federal involvement. Program funds flow from the Army to FEMA headquarters, through FEMA regional offices, and to the states. States provide funds to counties as their subgrantees. According to CSEPP guidance, FEMA is responsible for working with state and local governments in developing emergency preparedness plans, upgrading community response capabilities, and conducting training. A combined Army and FEMA office, called the CSEPP Core Team, coordinates and implements public affairs, exercises, training, communications, and other activities for the program. (See app. I for funds allocated to CSEPP entities for fiscal years 1988 through 1995.)", "At the state level, the Alabama EMA is responsible for CSEPP and other emergency programs. Six Alabama counties participate in the program: Calhoun, Clay, Cleburne, Etowah, St. Clair, and Talladega. Of the six counties, Calhoun County has the largest population at risk and has received most of the funds. Calhoun EMA manages CSEPP and other emergency programs for the county. Anniston Army Depot in Alabama stores 661,000 chemical weapons containing more than 2,200 tons of nerve and mustard agents. Included in Anniston\u2019s stockpile are approximately 78,000 nerve agent-filled M55 rockets, the stockpile\u2019s most unstable weapon. Before constructing its chemical stockpile disposal facility at Anniston and other stockpile sites, the Army is required to obtain certain permits and approvals from federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq), the Environmental Protection Agency has delegated the administration of the environmental permitting process to the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (DEM)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alabama and Six Counties Have Not Spent Most CSEPP Funds", "paragraphs": ["Since 1989, the Army and FEMA have awarded Alabama $46 million, more than any other state, for CSEPP.

According to FEMA, the unexpended funds are mostly the result of Calhoun County\u2019s refusal to initiate the CSEPP projects until the Army and FEMA agree to all of the county\u2019s demands related to specific requirements. According to Calhoun County EMA, the agency does not initiate actions that do not conform to CSEPP guidance and could be detrimental to providing maximum protection to the public. When disputes related to specific requirements occur, there is no established approach for negotiating an agreement among federal, state, and local officials.

In 1992, the Army and FEMA determined that every CSEPP jurisdiction should have a functioning communications system connecting the Army installation, state EMA, and immediate response zone counties. The immediate response zone is the area generally extending approximately 6 to 9 miles around the storage site and the area considered at the greatest risk from a chemical release. The Army and FEMA approved a CSEPP 800-MHz communications system for Alabama in 1993 and authorized $8.8 million and $4.4 million in fiscal years 1994 and 1995, respectively. FEMA subsequently authorized an additional $3 million, bringing total funding for the system to $16.2 million.", "The communications system is an integrated, simulcast network with  20 channels that operate at a frequency of 800-MHz. The system will enable Alabama emergency workers to communicate inter- and intra-agency without having to wait for a channel to clear if someone is using it. The system is also the platform to simultaneously activate sirens and tone alert radios. In the authorization, FEMA also said the precise number of radios, their distribution, and follow-on radios would be decided by negotiations among FEMA, state, and county officials.", "Despite several years of studying, meeting, and negotiating, Alabama does not have an integrated 800 MHz communications system for CSEPP. Federal, state, and local officials did not agree on the number and distribution of the 800-MHz radios until April 23, 1996. In addition, FEMA officials decided to place a $1-million repeater tower and some radios in Talladega County\u2019s precautionary zone. The \u201cprecautionary zone\u201d is the area beyond 21 to  30 miles from the storage site and, under most conditions, beyond where CSEPP activities are required and where a repeater tower would be located. However, Calhoun and St. Clair county officials believe placing the tower and radios in the precautionary zone does not comply with program guidance. Some equipment will be nearly 50 miles from the Anniston Army Depot. As a result, Calhoun EMA, which is managing the contract for the 800-MHz system, was reluctant to award the contract.", "According to FEMA, the 800-MHz communications system is not in place because Calhoun County EMA refused to initiate work on the contract until the county\u2019s demand for additional radios was met. According to the Calhoun EMA Director, his agency only supports projects that provide goods, services, and equipment in compliance with CSEPP guidance. On April 23, 1996, federal, state, and county officials met to resolve the issues that were delaying the implementation of the CSEPP 800-MHz project in Alabama. At the meeting, federal officials agreed to provide additional 800-MHz radios to Alabama and Calhoun and Talladega counties. Calhoun County EMA awarded the 800-MHz contract on May 30, 1996. According to Calhoun EMA, the contractor has 16 months from the contract award date to manufacture and install the communications system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Calhoun County EMA Disagrees With FEMA\u2019s Selection of Facilities for Collective Protection", "paragraphs": ["In 1989, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory concluded that, in the event of an accidental release of chemical agent, a chemical plume could cover sections of Calhoun County\u2019s immediate response zone in 1 hour. (See app. II for a description of the potential distribution of the hazard from a chemical release.) Oak Ridge also concluded in the 1989 report that evacuation was not recommended for the general population in Anniston\u2019s immediate response zone and recommended expedient sheltering. According to another Oak Ridge National Laboratory draft report in 1991, Calhoun County residents would take 5 hours and 45 minutes to evacuate the greater Anniston area. The Oak Ridge\u2019s estimate is the clearance time required for 100 percent of the vehicles to evacuate the area during bad weather at nighttime. On the basis of the Oak Ridge studies, Calhoun County EMA officials believe that it would be impossible to safely evacuate everyone. However, according to a senior official from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Calhoun County officials should not rely on the results of the 1991 draft report for planning purposes because the (1) report was never finalized and (2) changes in road conditions and demographics since 1991 may have affected the results of the draft report.", "To shelter the people they cannot evacuate, Calhoun County EMA officials believe collective protection is the best option. According to Calhoun EMA officials, \u201ccollective protection\u201d is a combination of (1) a filtered overpressurized air system and (2) adequate food, water, and medical supplies to house a selected number of people up to 3 days in a closed facility. However, Army officials believe Calhoun EMA\u2019s shelter time estimate of 3 days is excessive and that a chemical plume would pass over the area in 3 to 12 hours. The facilities to be provided with collective protection include schools, hospitals, jails, community centers, and public buildings that are within walking distance of homes and businesses. The Army Edgewood Research, Development and Engineering Center has completed a study to validate procedures for sheltering residents in a variety of housing types and identify a less burdensome and costly way to protect citizens in place. The draft report is dated December 8, 1995, and comments are being incorporated for publication of the final report.", "Although FEMA allocated Alabama $4.2 million for positive pressurization, county officials are reluctant to accept the allocation because they disagree with FEMA\u2019s selection of facilities and funding amount. In September 1995, Calhoun County EMA provided federal officials a suggested list of 55 facilities for collective protection. FEMA officials selected 21 facilities from the list on the basis of the location and type of facility but did not discuss their selection with Calhoun EMA officials. According to county officials, five of the facilities FEMA selected were not their highest priority. In addition, FEMA only provided enough funding for  8 to 10 hours of support rather than the 3 days requested by the county. As a result, as of April 19, 1996, county officials had not accepted the allocation.

The radios are capable of providing alerting signals and instructional messages about appropriate protective actions.", "In fiscal year 1993, FEMA allocated Alabama $900,000 to conduct a demographics survey to determine the requirements for tone alert radios and $4.3 million for the radios, with the stipulation that the funds not be released until the survey was completed. FEMA required the demographics survey to determine the number of residences and institutions requiring tone alert radios before they were purchased and installed. Because the Alabama EMA has not completed the demographics survey, FEMA has not released the funds. (See app. III for a discussion of Alabama EMA\u2019s management of the demographics survey.) According to Alabama EMA officials, they are close to awarding a contract for the survey with the Argonne National Laboratory and plan to submit their contract proposal to the governor\u2019s office in June 1996.

In July 1994, the Argonne National Laboratory concluded there was a potential for the aerosol deposition of agents off post from a chemical stockpile accident at Anniston. The deposition creates the requirement for personal protective equipment. \u201cPersonal protective equipment\u201d consists of portable respirators, protective suits, gloves, boots, and hoods. Because of their traffic, decontamination, health, and other critical response duties at the periphery of the chemical plume, local CSEPP emergency workers may find themselves in danger of contamination from an unexpected shift in the chemical plume.", "In fiscal year 1994, Calhoun County EMA requested funding for personal protective equipment. FEMA deferred the request until CSEPP funds became available in fiscal year 1995. At this time, FEMA transferred $850,000 to Alabama EMA for personal protective equipment with the condition the agency was not authorized to purchase equipment until the Occupational Safety and Health Administration completed an evaluation of available civilian protective equipment. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration completed its evaluation in late 1995. However, Calhoun EMA officials believe they need additional funding for Army-provided equipment, protective components for decontamination teams, and medical examinations for local emergency workers. A draft document produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that emergency workers who wear personal protective equipment complete annual medical examinations. In late 1995, the Army initiated a needs assessment study to calculate new equipment requirements for Alabama and Kentucky. Alabama EMA officials assume that any additional personal protective equipment funding will be withheld pending the outcome of the assessment.", "According to FEMA, there is nothing preventing Calhoun County EMA from purchasing the approved equipment, but the county has refused to initiate work on the project until its demand for additional funding is approved.

The Army\u2019s and FEMA\u2019s management responsibilities are not well-defined; there is no clearly defined protocol for communicating with any of the management groups. As a result, state and county EMA officials are uncertain about federal roles and responsibilities, and often find themselves trying to interact with two or more officials from the CSEPP Core Team, FEMA headquarters, and the FEMA regional office. For example, a Calhoun EMA official recently contacted a FEMA Core Team member to discuss the unresolved issue about the distribution of 800 MHz radios. The Core Team member told the county official to use the state\u2019s chain of command and direct his inquiries through Alabama EMA and the FEMA regional office. In some cases, county EMA officials have vented their frustrations to the Army Program Manager for Chemical Demilitarization and to Members of Congress.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, FEMA said that CSEPP has a well-defined and long-established protocol for intergovernmental communications.

According to the Core Team\u2019s charter, dated January 6, 1995, the Core Team is the focal point for accountability of the program and coordinates and integrates on- and off-post activities. The Core Team was established, in part, to streamline procedures, improve responsiveness to state and local agencies, and enhance the overall budget process.

In commenting on a draft of this report, FEMA said that too much precision in the guidance would limit CSEPP\u2019s ability to change with improvements in technology and emergency management techniques. However, as a result of its imprecise nature, the guidance is often interpreted differently by federal, state, and county officials. In other cases such as emergency medical services, reentry, and restoration, the guidance has not been completed.", "CSEPP\u2019s guidance on communication systems states that radios should go to public safety agencies. At one time, FEMA officials interpreted this to mean only agencies responding immediately to the chemical emergency. On the other hand, Calhoun EMA officials interpret the guidance to include law, fire, rescue, and other public safety agencies responding to a chemical emergency, as well as governmental, medical, educational, and other special agencies. County officials point out that CSEPP guidance goes far beyond public safety agencies. In February 1996, after extensive negotiations, FEMA tentatively agreed to fund radios for agencies defined as quasi-public safety agencies. These agencies include Calhoun County Road Department, Anniston Public Works, and Anniston Water Works. Federal, state, and local officials did not agree on the final number and distribution of the 800-MHz radios until April 23, 1996.", "In another example, Calhoun County EMA officials provided five pages of references to CSEPP guidance to justify their request for 24-hour staffing of their emergency operations center. However, the guidance does not provide a firm position on the requirement for 24-hour staffing. County officials\u2019 justification is based primarily on the 8-minute window to respond to a chemical emergency. The officials believe the county needs to have 24-hour staffing for its operations center to meet the 8-minute alert and notification requirement. If an incident occurred when the center was closed, it would take a minimum of 30 minutes for an employee to travel to the center and initiate the alert and notification process. The Army policy is to implement 24-hour staffing of the depot\u2019s emergency operations center when disposal operations begin and not to fund 24-hour staffing of local centers. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Army said that Calhoun EMA should consider less costly options, such as using the county\u2019s 911 emergency center, to initiate its alert and notification process. According to Calhoun County EMA, there are safety concerns about the location of the county\u2019s existing 911 center in the immediate response zone. In addition, Calhoun EMA attempted to relocate and consolidate the county\u2019s 911 emergency center with the EMA emergency operations center in the early 1990s, but did not receive any support from the Army or FEMA. The need for 24-hour staffing is still an ongoing issue with federal, state, and Calhoun County officials.", "Local officials are also dissatisfied with FEMA\u2019s inconsistent interpretation of CSEPP guidance. For example, the St. Clair County EMA Director commented to us about FEMA\u2019s inconsistent budget decisions. FEMA denied her request for alert devices for the county\u2019s volunteer fire department because the department was not in the protective action zone and does not comply with CSEPP guidance. In contrast, she points out that Talladega County is receiving a repeater tower and radios for its precautionary zone, outside of CSEPP guidance. According to FEMA officials, they are obtaining a waiver to CSEPP guidance for Talladega\u2019s tower.", "In other cases, CSEPP guidance is not complete. Program officials originally planned to complete all program guidance and standards by September 1989. However, they have not yet completed their guidance on emergency medical services or reentry and restoration procedures. As a result, local communities lack formal guidance to help them prepare their plans and determine their requirements for medical services, reentry, and restoration. According to FEMA officials, the guidance has been distributed in draft form pending resolution of outstanding issues. They believe that the outstanding issues should not preclude the states and counties from using the drafts for daily planning.

However, our work shows that in certain cases, FEMA officials become involved in the management of local projects to the point of making specific decisions on requirements. This level of involvement has contributed to disagreements and time-consuming negotiation on projects.", "For example, according to Calhoun EMA officials, FEMA never consulted with the county on their selection of the 21 facilities to be collectively protected and selected 5 facilities that county officials would prefer to be protected at a later date. In another example, FEMA officials had Talladega County EMA officials take them by helicopter to view the proposed sites for additional sirens. In Calhoun County, the same FEMA officials videotaped the locations where county officials said they needed sirens. With respect to the 800-MHz communications project, FEMA officials specified where the radios will be located by each agency in Calhoun County. In commenting on a draft of this report, FEMA said that the past and present scrutiny by the Congress and us has resulted in the agency\u2019s instituting stricter controls to ensure that it does not authorize unnecessarily elaborate or unreasonable funding requests. We believe that once the Army and FEMA approve and allocate funds for a CSEPP project, state and local agencies are in the best position to implement and manage the project. Similarly, FEMA also concludes in its comments that the states are in the best position to determine program priorities on a statewide basis and balance local requirements against the needs of all CSEPP counties.", "According to Calhoun County EMA, FEMA sometimes places unacceptable conditions on the county\u2019s use of CSEPP funds. For example, in September 1995, FEMA allocated Calhoun County $11,400 to complete the purchase of three mobil emergency road signs, with the following conditions: no vehicles would be provided to move the signs, no additional funding would be provided for maintenance, and Calhoun County would be accountable for the signs.

For example, FEMA allocated Alabama EMA funds in fiscal year 1996 to purchase laptop computers for local public information officers to use every day and take to the joint information center during a chemical emergency. However, the intent of this allocation differs from Alabama EMA\u2019s concept of operations, which provides for local public information officers to remain in their counties\u2019 operations centers. The state\u2019s concept of operations provides for county liaisons in the joint information center to handle county affairs. As a result, Alabama EMA officials plan to request that FEMA reallocate these funds to the county EMAs.", "Similarly, Calhoun EMA officials said that the funding process lacks teamwork and that federal officials do not understand the county\u2019s concept of operations. FEMA deferred funding for several local projects that county officials believe should have been funded sooner. For example, the county did not receive funding for personal protective equipment until 1995\u2014more than 6 years after the program\u2019s inception. In another instance, Alabama and Calhoun EMA officials concluded in 1992 that Calhoun County lacked the infrastructure to treat and care for all evacuees but FEMA did not provide funding for host counties until fiscal year 1996. In addition, according to Calhoun EMA officials, FEMA may not have the personnel with the technical expertise to adequately assess local budget requests.

In commenting on a draft of this report, the Army said that the initial estimate was made prior to defining the program\u2019s scope, requirements, and time frames.

In 1994, we reported that communities near the stockpile sites lacked critical items to respond to a chemical emergency, including operational communications systems, alert and notification devices, decontamination equipment, complete automated information systems, and personal protective equipment. For example, Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and Pueblo, Colorado, did not have sirens installed and most other stockpile sites did not have tone alert radios. According to the Army, Pine Bluff now has an operational siren system. In 1995, we reported that program officials lacked accurate financial information to identify how funds were spent and ensure that program goals were achieved.

In addition, the Army and participating states developed life-cycle cost estimates for CSEPP in 1995 to facilitate DOD\u2019s oversight of the program\u2019s escalating costs. Notwithstanding these actions, the federal financial management of CSEPP is still weak. Specifically, records on expenditure data are limited; allocation data differ among FEMA, Alabama EMA, and county EMAs; and FEMA maintains large unexpended balances of funds for Alabama and Calhoun County.

The Army policy is to implement 24-hour staffing of the depot\u2019s emergency operations center when disposal operations begin and not to fund 24-hour staffing of local centers. Alabama EMA officials believe the Army should staff the depot\u2019s emergency operations center during both storage and disposal operations. State officials told us the current lack of 24-hour staffing at the depot\u2019s center results in less than adequate immediate response capability during nonworking hours and places local citizens at unnecessary risk.

Calhoun EMA officials believe this is unacceptable when it takes a minimum of  30 minutes for agency employees to reach the center and begin activating the alert and notification process. According to CSEPP guidance, the time that elapses from the chemical accident to the decision to warn the public of the danger is of paramount importance to the success of the public alert and notification system. The guidance also requires the outdoor alert and notification system be capable of providing an alerting signal and instructional message within 8 minutes from the time a decision is made that the public is in danger. County EMA officials plan for a response time of 8 minutes\u20145 minutes to make a protective action decision and  3 minutes to alert and notify the public.

In addition, FEMA believes that the cost of 24-hour staffing of the CSEPP emergency operations center out weighs the benefits in light of available alternatives, ranging from using the county\u2019s current 911 emergency system to using the off-post warning system. FEMA officials also recommend that the 911 center stay in the immediate response zone and that its building be overpressurized to allow the center to operate during a chemical emergency and be responsible for the initial alert and notification actions. According to FEMA, Calhoun County refuses to consider reasonable alternatives adopted by other counties participating in CSEPP.

For example, the Army restructured the overall management of CSEPP and established a centralized office to streamline procedures, improve responsiveness to the states and counties, and improved the budget process. However, we found little evidence that these steps had any significant effect on the federal management of CSEPP in Alabama.

However, until the Army and FEMA take steps to delineate their roles and responsibilities, complete and clarify CSEPP\u2019s planning guidance, reduce their involvement in state and local management of projects, and implement effective financial controls, federal, state, and local officials will continue to disagree on specific CSEPP requirements and time-consuming negotiations on projects in Alabama are likely to continue. 2. See comment 1. 3. We revised the report to show that some of FEMA\u2019s expenditures support the entire CSEPP community, including the development of program guidance, training courses, and computer software. However, almost  45 percent of all CSEPP funds have been for federal management, contracts, and military installations such as the Anniston Army Depot.

However, because of weaknesses in FEMA\u2019s financial management and reporting, we were unable to provide a complete picture of how program funds were spent at the other four storage sites and that the program was susceptible to fraud, waste, and abuse. In addition, we did not report that CSEPP funds were effectively allocated. On the contrary, we reported that critical items needed by local communities to adequately respond to a chemical stockpile emergency were not operational or had not been purchased. 4. We revised the final report to more clearly state that some of Alabama EMA\u2019s and Calhoun County EMA\u2019s actions have contributed to the lack of progress in Alabama\u2019s CSEPP. However, we do not agree with FEMA\u2019s position that the unexpended funds are mostly the result of Calhoun County EMA\u2019s refusal to initiate CSEPP projects until the Army and FEMA agree to all of the county\u2019s demands. The delays experienced in Alabama\u2019s CSEPP are likely to continue until an effective approach is developed for reaching timely agreements among federal, state, and local officials on specific requirements for projects. 5. We revised our report to reflect FEMA\u2019s position that the 800-MHz communications system is not in place because Calhoun County EMA refused to initiate work on the contract until the county\u2019s demand for additional radios was met. However, we disagree with FEMA\u2019s statement that the overall scope of the 800-MHz communications project was resolved in 1993. Since 1993, the Army and FEMA allocated $1 million and $2 million for additional equipment and radios in June 1995 and August 1995, respectively. As recently as April 23, 1996, FEMA authorized additional radios for Alabama and Talladega and Calhoun counties. It appears that all the disagreements about the project may have been resolved on April 23, 1996, when Army and FEMA officials agreed to provide additional 800-MHz radios to Alabama and Talladega and Calhoun counties. Calhoun County EMA officials awarded the 800-MHz contract on May 30, 1996. According to Calhoun EMA officials, the contractor has 16 months from the contact award date to manufacture and install the communications system.", "The 800-MHz project is an example in which Calhoun County EMA delayed implementation of the project until it received enough radios, in its opinion, to help ensure maximum protection for the citizens of the county. In addition, Alabama and Talladega County benefited from Calhoun EMA\u2019s efforts in that they also received additional radios. In summary, we question FEMA\u2019s conclusion that Calhoun County EMA wrongfully delayed the 800-MHz project because the county insisted on a system that exceeded CSEPP requirements; after 3 years of negotiations, FEMA itself agreed to fund the county\u2019s request. Similar problems experienced with the 800-MHz project are likely to continue in Alabama until an effective approach is developed for reaching timely agreements among federal, state, and local officials on specific requirements for projects. 6. We revised the final report to include that, according to FEMA, the agency has not received a formal rebuttal or request from Calhoun County to change the authorization for the collective protection project. We also added to the report that Army officials believe Calhoun EMA\u2019s shelter time estimate of 3 days is excessive and that a chemical plume would pass over the area in 3 to 12 hours. However, our concern with this project was that FEMA officials did not discuss their selection of facilities to be protected with local officials and selected five that they would prefer to be protected at a later date. In addition, according to Calhoun EMA, FEMA did not (1) provide enough funding for the supplies requested by the county and (2) discuss FEMA methodology to estimate the average cost of $200,000 to protect each facility. Finally, as a result of CSEPP\u2019s fragmented management structure, there was a 6-month lapse between FEMA headquarters\u2019 authorization and Calhoun County\u2019s receipt of it. 7. We revised our report to include FEMA\u2019s position that there is nothing preventing Calhoun County EMA from purchasing the approved personal protective equipment but that the county has refused to initiate work on the project until its demand for additional funding is approved. As discussed previously, Calhoun County EMA is ready to issue a contract for the civilian respirators and protective suits when the requirements for medical examinations are defined and related funds are provided by FEMA. Although FEMA allocated funds for personal protective equipment in fiscal year 1995, federal and local officials are still negotiating specific requirements. The problems experienced in Alabama\u2019s CSEPP are likely to continue until an effective approach is developed for reaching timely agreements on specific requirements among federal, state, and local officials. 8. We revised our report to include the protocol for intergovernmental communications as described by FEMA. However, FEMA does not recognize the role and responsibilities of the CSEPP Core Team in its protocol. According to the Core Team\u2019s charter, dated January 6, 1995, the team is the focal point for accountability of the program and coordinates and integrates on- and off-post activities. The Core Team was established, in part, to streamline procedures, improve responsiveness to state and local agencies, and enhance the overall budget process. Because of differences similar to these, we continue to believe that the role and responsibilities of the CSEPP Core Team are not clearly understood by state and county officials.", "In addition, we disagree with FEMA\u2019s statement that CSEPP has had a long-established protocol for communications. Army and FEMA officials routinely communicate with local officials without complying with the protocol described by FEMA. During this review, FEMA officials conducted on-site inspections of the CSEPP siren system in Alabama and routinely contacted county officials outside of FEMA\u2019s stated protocol. 9. According to FEMA, to the extent that CSEPP guidance is unclear, such flexibility is necessary to meet the diverse functional, technical, and geographical needs of CSEPP and the ill-defined maximum protection mandate of the Chemical Stockpile Disposal Program. We believe that without clear and complete program guidance, disagreements and time-consuming negotiations on projects in Alabama are likely to continue. In May 1996, we reported similar concerns about FEMA\u2019s ambiguous criteria for its disaster assistance program.", "We revised the report to show that CSEPP guidance has been distributed in draft to state and county agencies pending resolution of outstanding issues. FEMA officials believe that the outstanding issues should not preclude the states and counties from using the drafts for daily planning. However, Calhoun County EMA officials do not consider FEMA drafts as final planning guidance. In addition, Alabama EMA officials said the program still needs to resolve numerous problems with reentry and restoration issues and that the continuous changes and redirection of the program have diverted resources away from protecting the public and the environment. Clay County EMA officials in Alabama told us that there is a general lack of clear guidance for CSEPP. In addition, Etowah County EMA officials said that CSEPP standards and guidance were changed whenever Army and FEMA officials wanted to change them, without regard to the needs of local governments.", "CSEPP has had a working definition of maximum protection since 1991. CSEPP Policy Paper Number 1, entitled Definition of Maximum Protection, states that the most important objective of the emergency preparedness and implementation process is the avoidance of fatalities to the maximum extent possible should an accidental release of chemical agent occur. The policy paper states that this objective can be achieved through (1) the establishment of comprehensive emergency planning and preparedness programs and (2) preventive measures designed to render the chemical stockpile less susceptible to both internally and externally generated accidents. The Assistant Associate Director in FEMA\u2019s Office of Technological Hazards signed the policy paper on May 6, 1991. 10. We believe that the inability to reach agreement on specific projects is due, in part, to federal officials\u2019 being too involved in the management of local projects. Once the Army and FEMA approve and allocate funds for a CSEPP project, state and local agencies are in the best position to implement and manage the project and federal involvement in the project should be minimal.", "According to Alabama EMA officials, they have discussed the problem related to Army\u2019s and FEMA\u2019s micromanagement of CSEPP with FEMA officials. These officials said that the current CSEPP process does not allow state directors flexibility in managing their emergency preparedness programs. The issue of FEMA\u2019s involvement in the management of local projects was also raised by the Director of Calhoun County EMA on July 13, 1995, before the Procurement Subcommittee, House Committee on National Security. The Director testified that CSEPP projects were hampered by micromanagement at the federal level. 11. We believe that the inability to reach timely agreements on project and funding requirements indicates that the CSEPP budget process is not working effectively. As discussed in the report, state and county officials told us that the CSEPP process lacks teamwork. For example, Etowah County EMA officials in Alabama told us that the agency did not have an influence on the CSEPP budget process and that the agency very seldom receives a response from the Army or FEMA on substantive issues. Similarly, according to St. Clair County EMA officials, the county has no influence in the CSEPP budget process. 12. We revised the final report to recognize that some progress in CSEPP has occurred in Alabama. However, communities near Anniston Army Depot are not fully prepared to respond to a chemical stockpile emergency, and Alabama and six counties have not been able to spend $30.5 million,  66.4 percent of the $46 million allocated to enhance their emergency preparedness. Alabama and its counties have not been able to spend most of the CSEPP funds allocated to them because (1) FEMA, state, and local officials cannot agree on specific requirements for major capital projects and (2) FEMA has not provided Alabama or Calhoun County officials permission to spend some of the funds. 13. As discussed above, we have revised the report to more clearly state that Calhoun County EMA\u2019s actions have contributed to the delay of Alabama\u2019s CSEPP. However, we do not agree with FEMA\u2019s position that the unexpended funds are mostly the result of Calhoun County EMA\u2019s refusal to initiate CSEPP projects until the Army and FEMA agree to all of the county\u2019s demands.
