However, GAO has consistently found that DHS and the Coast Guard recognize, but have yet to address, the fact that the Coast Guard's acquisition needs are not affordable.", "This statement is based on GAO's body of work issued during the past three years on Coast Guard major acquisitions and highlights GAO's recently completed review of the transfer to the Coast Guard of the C-27J aircraft as well as observations regarding the Coast Guard's fiscal year 2016 Capital Investment Plan. The statement addresses the status of the Coast Guard's (1) aviation assets, particularly the C-27J aircraft and (2) surface assets, as well as (3) the overall affordability of its major acquisition portfolio.", "GAO has made a number of recommendations to improve acquisition management and assess the affordability of the Coast Guard's portfolio.

However, it will take 7 years and about $600 million to fully transfer and modify the aircraft by adding information technology and surveillance systems. Transfer of the C-27J faces a number of risks but the aircraft is expected to contribute significant flight hours toward the Coast Guard's goal once complete. In light of this transfer, the Coast Guard is in the process of determining the best mix of fixed-wing aircraft to provide the capabilities it needs to carry out its missions. As shown in the table, GAO reported that the Coast Guard has fallen short of its flight hour goal; this trend is expected to continue until the Coast Guard revises its mission needs, an effort it expects to complete in 2016. The Coast Guard also plans to complete a fixed-wing fleet mix analysis by 2019, which will revisit the current flight hour goal and the assets that will best meet its needs. The table reflects the existing fleet and flight hours as compared to GAO's analysis of the Coast Guard's planned fleet including the C-27J aircraft.", "Note: The HC-144 and C-27J are medium range assets while the HC-130H and HC-130J are long range assets. The fiscal year 2014 \u2018medium range' column includes 4 legacy medium range aircraft.", "According to GAO's April 2015 review, the Coast Guard continues to field National Security Cutters and Fast Response Cutters. The Coast Guard is also working with three potential shipbuilders to design the Offshore Patrol Cutter, needed to recapitalize the majority of the major cutter fleet, with plans for the first ship to be fielded in 2022. In the meantime, the Coast Guard's legacy Medium Endurance Cutters, which the Offshore Patrol Cutter is planned to replace, have begun to reach the end of their service lives. The Coast Guard currently has no definitive plan to extend the service life of these legacy assets and as a result faces a potentially significant capability gap.", "GAO found in June 2014 that budget officials have acknowledged that the Coast Guard's current plan for developing new, more capable assets is not affordable given current and expected funding levels. For the past 5 years, GAO has found that the Coast Guard's acquisition funding has fallen short of what it estimates it needs to fully recapitalize its assets. The Coast Guard has responded by annually delaying or reducing its capability. The Coast Guard and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have taken some steps to address these affordability issues, but as yet these efforts have not led to the types of significant trade-off decisions among resources and needs that would improve the long-term outlook of the Coast Guard's acquisition portfolio."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Coast Guard\u2019s plan to buy  and deploy the assets it has determined it needs to fulfill its current and  anticipated missions.

We also assessed gaps in  the fixed wing aviation fleet, based on the current flight hour goals and  surveillance capabilities. We analyzed the Coast Guard\u2019s May 2012 C- 27J business case analysis and the subsequent analysis that it provided  to Congress in an August 2013 letter. We also reviewed aviation fleet  performance information and talked with operators and maintenance  personnel. We also made observations on the Coast Guard\u2019s fiscal year  2016 budget and Capital Investment Plan and interviewed Coast Guard  budget officials. We discussed these observations with Coast Guard  budget officials and incorporated their views as appropriate.

However, as we  reported in March 2015, it will take time and money to fully transfer and  modify the aircraft. As of May 2015, 2 of the 14 C-27J aircraft had been  removed from storage at the Air Force\u2019s 309th Aerospace Maintenance  and Regeneration Group (AMARG) at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base  where 13 of the 14 C-27Js are stored. These 2 aircraft are currently at the  Coast Guard\u2019s aviation maintenance facility in Elizabeth City, North  Carolina where the aircraft are continuing to be inducted into the Coast  Guard. The Coast Guard expects to deliver 2 additional C-27Js from  AMARG to its maintenance facility by the end of fiscal year 2015.", "The first part of induction entails removing the aircraft from the AMARG  storage facility, which involves taking off a protective compound,  conducting system checks and basic maintenance, and successfully  completing a flight test\u2014among other steps. The Coast Guard then needs  to ensure that it can support these assets and modify the C-27Js to meet  its missions. This is a lengthy and complex process and, as a result, the  fleet of 14 fully operational C-27Js is not anticipated until 2022.", "In our March 2015 report, we identified a number of milestones and risks  that will need to be addressed to achieve fully capable aircraft. In general,  the Coast Guard must achieve three major milestones before the aircraft  are fully operational:  1.   induct the aircraft,  2.   establish operational units (bases), and  3.  add surveillance and advanced communication capabilities.", "In addition, complicating these efforts are areas of risk that need to be  addressed before the Coast Guard can field fully operational C-27Js.  These three risk areas are: (1) purchasing spare parts, (2) accessing  technical data, and (3) understanding the condition of the aircraft. These  and other risks may inhibit the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to operate the aircraft  as planned. However, the Coast Guard is working to mitigate these risks.  Figure 1 illustrates the milestones and risk areas the Coast Guard must  address before it can field a fully capable C-27J aircraft.", "According to initial Coast Guard estimates, while the C-27J aircraft come  at no acquisition cost to the Coast Guard, the costs to fully operationalize  them will total about $600 million. The fiscal year 2016 Capital Investment  Plan includes $482 million for this effort. The Capital Investment Plan also  notes that the Coast Guard has yet to fully estimate the total cost of  incorporating and operating the C-27J. The Coast Guard is planning to  refine this initial estimate by January 2016, in accordance with a February  2015 DHS acquisition decision memo.", "In addition to the challenges in converting the C-27Js to fully operational  aircraft, we found in March 2015 that the Coast Guard faces a shortfall in   To fully meet its mission needs, the  achieving its overall flight hour goal.Coast Guard\u2019s 2005 mission needs statement set forth a goal of 52,400  hours per year.

The revised fleet as currently envisioned, with the addition  of the C-27J, will narrow this gap, but the Coast Guard will still fall short of  the 52,400 flight hour goal. As a result of planned changes to its fleet  composition to accommodate the C-27J\u2014specifically reducing its planned  purchase of 36 HC-144s to 18\u2014and other reasons the Coast Guard is  now on a path to fall short of meeting this goal by 18 percent when all  planned assets are operational.", "Table 1 shows: (1) the aircraft that comprise the current 2014 fleet plan  and the Coast Guard\u2019s planned fleet once the C-27Js are operational, (2)  the annual flight hours each fleet provides, and (3) the difference between  the flight hours of the fleets and the 52,400 hour goal.", "According to the fiscal year 2016 Capital Investment Plan, the Coast  Guard is currently conducting a revised fixed-wing fleet analysis, intended  to be a fundamental reassessment of the capabilities and mix of fixed- wing assets needed to fulfill its missions. Coast Guard budget and  programming officials recognize the aviation fleet may change based on  the flight hour goals in the new mission needs statement and the overall  fleet mix analysis. The fiscal year 2016 Capital Investment Plan,  therefore, does not include any additional fixed-wing asset purchases. For  example, DHS and the Coast Guard have formally paused the HC-144  acquisition program at 18 aircraft, which are the aircraft they have already  purchased.", "The Coast Guard has begun to rewrite its mission needs statement and  concept of operations and plans to complete this effort by 2016.

We  recommended in our March 2015 report that the Secretary of Homeland  Security and the Commandant of the Coast Guard inform Congress of the  time frames and key milestones for completing the fleet mix study,  including the specific date when the Coast Guard will publish its revised  annual flight hour needs and when it plans to inform Congress of the  corresponding changes to the composition of its fixed-wing fleet to meet  these needs. DHS concurred with our recommendation but did not  provide specific time lines for meeting this recommendation.

In  addition, the Coast Guard deferred testing for several key capabilities on  the cutter, such as cybersecurity, the use of unmanned aerial systems, or  its ability to handle certain classified information. Coast Guard officials  said follow-on operational tests will be conducted between fiscal years  2015 and 2017. While future tests will be key to understanding the NSC\u2019s  capabilities, any necessary changes resulting from these tests will have to  be retrofit onto all 8 NSCs since they are all either built or under contract.

For  example, the cutter is experiencing problems operating in warm climates,  including cooling system failures, excessive condensation forming  puddles on the deck of the ship, and limited redundancy in its air  conditioning system affecting use of information technology systems.  According to operational reports from a 2013 deployment, the  Commanding Officer of an NSC had to impose speed restrictions on the  vessel because of engine overheating when the seawater temperature  was greater than 68 degrees. In addition, cold climate issues on the cutter  include a lack of heaters to keep oil and other fluids warm during  operations in cold climates, such as the arctic. Further, Coast Guard  operators state that operating near ice must be done with extreme caution  since the ice can move quickly and the NSC could sustain significant  damage if it comes in contact with the ice.

For  example, senior Coast Guard officials have stated a need for over $2  billion per year, but the Coast Guard has received $1.5 billion or less over  the past 5 years. The President\u2019s budget requests $1 billion for fiscal year  2016. In an effort to address the funding constraints it has faced annually,  the Coast Guard has been in a reactive mode, delaying and reducing its  capability through the annual budget process but without a plan to  realistically set forth affordable priorities. The Coast Guard, DHS, and  Office of Management and Budget officials have acknowledged that the  Coast Guard cannot afford to recapitalize and modernize its assets in  accordance with the current plan at current funding levels. Efforts are  underway to address this issue, but so far, these efforts have not led to  the difficult trade-off decisions needed to improve the affordability of the  Coast Guard\u2019s portfolio. We recommended in 2014 that the Coast Guard  develop a 20-year fleet modernization plan that identifies all acquisitions  needed to maintain the current level of service\u2014aviation and surface\u2014 and the fiscal resources needed to buy the identified assets. We  recommended that the plan should consider trade-offs if the fiscal  resources needed to execute the plan are not consistent with annual  budgets. The Coast Guard concurred with our recommendation, but its  response did not fully address our concerns or set forth an estimated date  for completion.", "In June 2014, we also reported that the Coast Guard faces a potentially  expensive recapitalization of other surface assets, such as the polar  icebreakers and its fleet of river buoy tenders, as these assets continue to  age beyond their expected service lives and, in some cases, have been  removed from service without a replacement. These issues pose  additional potential challenges to the affordability of the Coast Guard\u2019s  overall acquisition portfolio.", "Icebreakers\u2014According to program officials, due to funding constraints,  the Coast Guard chose not to invest in either of its heavy icebreakers as  they approached the end of their service lives. Thus, both heavy  icebreakers were out of service from 2010 to 2013 and the Coast Guard  could not complete missions, such as resupplying a science laboratory in  Antarctica. The Coast Guard has recently returned one of these heavy  icebreakers back to service, but still has one fewer heavy icebreaker than  it has historically operated and several fewer than it needs, according to  the Coast Guard\u2019s June 2013 heavy icebreaker mission need statement.  The fiscal year 2016 President\u2019s Budget asks for $4 million for continued  preparatory studies to develop a cost estimate, among other things.
