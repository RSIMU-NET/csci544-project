However, DLA has not conducted an analysis of the MRE industry to determine the level of purchases needed annually to sustain the industrial base while retaining the ability to meet a surge in requirements. Without conducting an analysis that provides more information on industry capabilities, DLA does not have reasonable assurance that it is balancing readiness and budget priorities with the need to sustain the industrial base in the most efficient way. DLA acknowledges in its strategic plan for MRE inventory that sharing information about the military services' usage patterns among DLA and the services will be vital to making purchase decisions. While the military services provide DLA with their estimated future demand for MREs, DLA does not obtain information from the services, as part of existing coordination efforts, about potential changes to MRE consumption and disposals that could affect future demand.

Operational plans are developed by  military planners to support war-fighting scenarios set forth in broad  defense strategic guidance provided by the President, the Secretary of  Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Service logistics  officials stated that operational plans generate the selection of military  units, which in turn have associated personnel and equipment, and thus  are the major driver of WRM requirements. Associated information, such  as time-phased force-deployment data that support an approved  operational plan, is likewise used for determining requirements. For  example, Air Force logistics officials stated that operational plans are  used as the basis to determine requirements for WRM, and that three  theater working groups determine the personnel and equipment  necessary to support those operational plans in each of the component  commands by reviewing, validating, and planning the movement of WRM  globally.

Army logistics  officials stated that officials responsible for operations and planning  determine what types and numbers of units would be necessary to carry  out a given operational plan, and these units would have a defined level  of personnel and equipment that would make up the parameters of the  data entered into modeling programs. The Army has various modeling  programs to determine WRM needs for prepositioned and sustainment  stocks. To develop sustainment WRM requirements, for example, it  maintains a modeling program that uses actual data from training and  contingencies that are uploaded to the model every 90 days. Air Force  officials stated that the decisions regarding units and equipment made  during theater working-group discussions are input into an Air Force data  system that computes WRM requirements. Marine Corps logistics officials  stated that to develop WRM requirements, they use technical data, such  as equipment and personnel data, that comes from authoritative data  sources and service systems of record, and a computer modeling  program computes the WRM requirements.", "Some service officials stated that changes to troop end strength, force  posture, and force structure could over time be reflected in operational  plans, and ultimately affect WRM requirements, but these factors are  more long-term influences than the primary drivers of the annual WRM  requirements that are the focus of DLA\u2019s annual data call process.  Regarding troop end strength, Marine Corps logistics officials stated that  missions do not change as a result of increases or decreases to end  strength. One official added that operational plans are largely  independent from end strength, since forces will always be first devoted  to contingencies, with the services assuming risk in other areas as a  result of decreases in end strength. Air Force logistics officials stated that  factors such as troop end strength or force posture do not necessarily  affect WRM requirements, especially in the short term, although over time  they may do so. For example, if changes in force posture were to lead to  the closure of bases in Central Command, then the Air Force would  eventually most likely review moving excess WRM from that location to  other locations, or if cheaper than moving they may choose to divest of  the WRM by disposal or sales. Further, the officials stated that the  availability of funding and transportation and storage costs affect WRM  considerably as these factor into decisions about how the Air Force could  best support operational plans.", "As they determine their WRM requirements for DLA-managed items,  some service officials stated they review their service\u2019s inventory levels  and prepositioned stocks to determine what inventory is already in place.

To satisfy a  surge requirement if needed, DLA maintains a certain level of MREs as  WRM inventory that is owned and managed by DLA. DLA has identified  an MRE war reserve level of 5 million cases. The current level was  established in fiscal year 2005 at a time when U.S. military operations  were ongoing in Iraq and Afghanistan. DLA officials stated that DLA  purchases up to the WRM level, meeting the 5 million case level through  a combination of on-hand assets and assets that are due to be delivered  within a 12-month period. According to a 2013 DLA study, while DLA is  not obligated to purchase a specific amount of MREs per year from its  suppliers, it currently has an annual purchase objective of 2.5 million  MRE cases. This purchase objective represents an annual minimum  target for MRE purchases from industry.", "As DLA manages MREs within the WRM level of 5 million cases, it  monitors various types of data to determine the exact amount of MRE  purchases that will be made and when. For example, DLA monitors yearly  sales estimates that are provided by the military services, information  provided by the services about their ability to consume MREs through  training, and agreements in place with the military services about storage  and transportation of MREs. While operational plans are the primary  driver for WRM requirements determination for other DLA-managed  items, numerous factors are at play as DLA plans MRE purchases to buy  towards the level of WRM. For example, service officials told us that end  strength is not a key factor for deciding WRM requirements for other  items. In contrast, end strength is important for MRE WRM levels  because end strength levels directly affect the number of MREs that can  be consumed in training exercises and thus the amount of MREs that can  be rotated in a given year and that would be replaced by future  purchases.", "DLA monitors purchases from industry and sales to the services for  planning purposes.

DLA also seeks to ensure that appropriate plans are in  place to rotate the WRM stocks of MREs to prevent the need for  disposals. For example, DLA officials stated that the war reserve stocks  of MREs with the shortest shelf life are to be rotated out first to prevent  disposal. Therefore, DLA uses information about service training cycles to  help plan the rotation of the oldest stock. This information affects the  amount of MREs that will need to be replaced as WRM through additional  purchases from industry, all while monitoring on-hand and on-order MRE  inventory levels as compared to the WRM level. DLA officials stated that  DLA uses information such as its knowledge of DOD priorities, service  training cycles, and updates on service training and operational activities  obtained through monthly telephone calls and other regular interaction  with the services to forecast service demand for MREs and further inform  planning.", "Further, DLA has performance-based agreements with the Army, Navy,  Marine Corps, and Air Force that detail the specific amount of MRE war  reserve stocks that DLA will deliver to a specific location within a defined  time frame. This information is also tracked by DLA and can further affect  inventory levels and the requirement to purchase additional MREs. For  example, the performance-based agreement between DLA Troop Support  and the Army signed in March 2013 specifies the total number of MRE  cases stored by DLA for the Army in locations in the continental United  States, Europe, Hawaii, Japan, Korea, and Southwest Asia, as well as  aboard Army prepositioning ships. The agreement sets forth  responsibilities of DLA Troop Support, such as to (1) stock and store the  levels of MREs in DLA- or DLA-commercial-provided storage, (2) rotate  the MREs through the DLA customer base, (3) maintain the capability to  deliver the MREs in certain time frames depending on location and  situation (for crisis or contingency needs as opposed to peacetime  needs), and (4) maintain records of MRE stocks, among other duties.  Similarly, the agreement details the responsibilities of the Army, which  include the need to notify DLA Troop Support upon execution of  contingency operation plans and peacetime exercises to allow for the  release of stocks and to submit requisitions to DLA Troop Support for  MREs with specific lead times that vary by location and situational need.", "DLA officials stated that as with other types of WRM, the Navy does not  operate in the same manner as the other services.

The average on-hand inventory level was about 4.66  million cases. In addition, the data show that the average yearly MRE  sales to the services decreased from about 4 million cases in fiscal year  2010 to 3 million cases in fiscal year 2012 and remained relatively  constant at around 3 million cases from fiscal years 2012 through 2014.  There were also decreases in annual purchases from suppliers starting in  fiscal year 2010.", "The services have different requirements for, and therefore purchase  different amounts of, MREs. As shown in figure 4, the Army is the largest  purchaser of MREs.", "In addition to monitoring sales and purchase data, DLA has conducted  several reviews since 2003 to determine whether the war reserve level is  appropriate based on potential contingency requirements, historical  demand, and industry capability.", "A DLA study conducted in 2003 reviewed the processes used to  determine war reserve requirements for MREs and found that the war  reserve level could be maintained at 4.1 million cases.", "A DLA study conducted in 2007 analyzed historical sales data that  included a worst-case planning scenario and found that the war  reserve level could be within the range of 3.2 million to 5 million  cases.", "A DLA study completed in July 2013, using a methodology similar to  that of previous studies, found that the level of MRE on-hand  inventory could be at a range between 3.45 million and 3.96 million  cases of MREs to support contingency requirements, efficiently  manage resources, and sustain the industrial base. The 2013 study  stated that reasons for the proposed decrease in MRE on-hand  inventory included less demand for MREs from fiscal years 2010  through 2012; the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq and  Afghanistan; the possible effects of sequestration on force structure;  and an increased capacity reported by the MRE industry to meet  surge requirements. Further, the Federal Emergency Management  Agency moved from using military grade MREs to commercially  available alternatives, meaning that the demand for MREs is further  reduced. In addition, the study noted that other troop feeding options  such as new types of rations and dining facilities that can be quickly  established could reduce dependence on MREs during contingency  operations.", "Although DLA\u2019s 2013 study supported a lower war reserve inventory level  for MREs, DLA issued an MRE strategic plan in September 2013 stating  that after subsequent analysis, DLA leadership decided to maintain the  current level of 5 million cases and revisit this level after 2014. As of March 2015, DLA officials stated that an update to the MRE strategic plan  was under review. According to DLA officials, higher-than-expected  demand for MREs occurred in fiscal years 2013 and 2014. Prior  estimates for those 2 years were 2.3 million to 2.7 million cases, but  actual sales were around 2.9 million each year. Officials attributed the  higher-than-anticipated demand to increased training needs during  peacetime and to small-scale deployments in response to crises such as  the Ebola virus epidemic in Africa and tensions in Syria and the Ukraine.  The 2013 MRE strategic plan projected purchases of 2.3 million to 2.5  million cases a year through fiscal year 2016, a level that, according to  the plan, will allow DLA to uphold the war reserve level of 5 million cases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Military Services May Not Be Able to Maintain Sufficient Rotations of MREs through Future Consumption", "paragraphs": ["Military service officials who manage MREs expressed concerns that in  light of changing needs, resulting from budgetary impacts and smaller  end strengths, it may be difficult for the services to consume MREs in the  future at a rate that will allow them to maintain sufficient rotations of  MREs and prevent disposals due to expiring shelf life. Army and Marine  Corps officials stated that they did not believe reduced purchases of  MREs would result in shortages, but they also cautioned that since MREs  are critical for military operations, it is important that the MRE industry be  able to increase production to meet a surge in need.", "According to service officials, each service estimates the amount of  MREs needed for training and other purposes. These estimates are  largely based on training plans and are submitted to DLA annually.  According to service officials, these estimates have ranged from about  3.2 million to 3.6 million cases per year over the past several years.  Service officials stated that they are responsible for monitoring MRE  consumption and ensuring that their service works towards purchasing  the estimated amounts from DLA. Service officials also stated that they  track use of MREs to the unit level for training or operational needs.  However, they acknowledged that they may not always know if MREs are  consumed or disposed of. For example, an Air Force subsistence official  stated that the Air Force has recently begun to track MRE disposals and  he knew that disposals occurred, but he could not identify how many  disposals had occurred. A Marine Corps subsistence official stated that  some MREs are disposed of due to issues such as accidental improper  storage, and the Marine Corps\u2019 subsistence office would only know this  information if the unit decided to report the disposal. An Army subsistence  official stated that he receives reports on MRE disposals, but that the  reports may not always be complete and reliable.", "The performance-based agreements between DLA and each service  establish the policies, procedures, and responsibilities concerning  operational rations support to the service by DLA. According to these  agreements, DLA is financially responsible for inventory losses unless the  losses result from a service\u2019s inability to rotate inventory within the  required time limits; then the loss is the responsibility of the service.  Some service subsistence officials stated that it can be challenging to  meet the rotation demands in these agreements through training and  operational use of MREs. Service subsistence officials also stated that  disposal of unused MREs is costly, and that MREs cost almost as much  to dispose of as to purchase because they must be disposed of in certain  ways due to the flameless heating component.", "With regard to the current MRE war reserve level of 5 million cases, Army  and Marine Corps officials stated that they have been able to meet the  required rotation demands in recent years, and that they believe that  MRE disposals have not been a major issue. However, officials stated  that, in the coming years, decreasing troop end strength will likely result in  fewer service members to train. Because many MREs are consumed  during field training, reductions in the number of service members  therefore are likely to decrease the services\u2019 overall demand for MREs.  For example, the DLA study conducted in 2013 stated that the Army  planned to reduce its MRE war reserve levels by 200,000 cases due to  decreases in troop end strength. Army officials told us that they expect  that planned reductions in troop end strength will reduce MRE  consumption. Army and Marine Corps officials also stated that, while  MREs are of critical importance because they are a primary food ration  for sustaining military forces during the early phases of military  operations, their experience shows that the current war reserve level of 5  million cases per year is probably not necessary and that they would  support DLA maintaining a lower inventory level of MREs. However,  these officials stated that the level would ultimately depend on industry  capabilities to meet surge needs.", "Officials from the Army\u2019s subsistence program stated that they have been  concerned for several years that withdrawals from operations in Iraq and  Afghanistan would result in substantial amounts of MREs that the Army  could not consume. One official stated that although MRE disposals due  to lack of consumption have not yet been an issue for the Army, two  events likely prevented the need for disposals in recent years. First,  according to Army and DLA officials, in 2012 a warehouse fire in  Afghanistan destroyed around 125,000 cases of MREs. Second, the 2011  tsunami in Japan destroyed around 100,000 cases of MREs. Army  subsistence officials also stated that due to concerns about the Army  being able to use enough of the MRE stock stored in Japan, DLA and the  Army chose to restock the Japan levels to 4,800 cases instead of the  100,000, cases that were stored there prior to the tsunami. Further,  service and DLA officials stated that there are 300,000 cases of MREs  from fiscal year 2011 stored in a cold-storage warehouse facility that had  been held back from consumption to undergo extensive testing to ensure  the cases were not infested with a certain type of beetle. While the MREs  were ultimately deemed safe for consumption through 2015, service  officials expressed concerns that the MREs were at the end of their shelf  life and, consequently, they did not want to accept them from DLA.  However, they added that it may be necessary to accept the MREs to  prevent a large-scale disposal. An Army official stated that while this  issue stemmed from a possible infestation that required MREs to be  taken out of rotation and tested, it had altered the flow of MREs from  various fiscal years and problems with meeting rotational levels would  continue. DLA officials stated that this was a one-time occurrence and  they did not share the Army\u2019s concern.", "In addition, an official from the Air Force\u2019s subsistence program stated  that Air Force demand for MREs may decrease in the coming years as a  result of shortening the duration of basic training. While shorter training  may result in less consumption of MREs, the official stated that the Air  Force uses fewer MREs than the Army and Marine Corps and is therefore  not as concerned about the ability of the Air Force to rotate MREs if the  war reserve level remains at 5 million cases, provided that funding for the  Air Force\u2019s rotation program remains available. The official stated that Air  Force war reserve levels for MREs may decrease in certain areas such  as Europe due to a focus on operations elsewhere, but that the Air  Force\u2019s overall war reserve requirement was unlikely to decrease  dramatically in the coming years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DLA Lacks Analysis on Purchase Levels Needed to Sustain the Industrial Base and Information on the Services\u2019 MRE Usage", "paragraphs": ["Although DLA monitors various data on MREs, as previously discussed, it  lacks analysis on the level of MRE purchases needed to sustain the  industrial base while maintaining surge capability. More specifically, DLA  has not assessed whether its annual purchase objective of 2.5 million  cases is valid. Further, DLA\u2019s ability to forecast the number of MREs the  services will need is limited to some extent because DLA does not obtain  information from the services about their usage of MREs, including  consumption and possible disposals. Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government state that an agency needs relevant, reliable, and  timely information to effectively and efficiently run its operations and make  appropriate decisions. Further, DOD guidance states that the  department\u2019s materiel management shall operate as a high-performing  and agile supply chain responsive to customer requirements during  peacetime and war while balancing risk and total cost.", "DLA has not conducted a recent detailed analysis to determine the level  of MRE purchases from industry necessary to sustain the current  industrial base while retaining the ability to meet a surge capability.  Although DLA has an annual purchase objective of at least 2.5 million  cases, officials stated that this number reflects an unofficial agreement  with the MRE industry and is based on limited information from industry  rather than on a DLA analysis of industry capabilities. Further, DOD has  acknowledged that DLA\u2019s future acquisitions of MREs may need to  address a reduced annual purchase objective to avoid disposal of unused  stock. DOD noted that reduced acquisitions could challenge the  department\u2019s ability to meet surge requirements. However, the 2013 MRE  strategic plan states that it is a challenge for DOD to determine what  quantities of MRE sales will keep each of the MRE suppliers producing at  a level that sustains the industrial base to meet the needs of the  department as well as respond to a surge requirement that could occur.  The strategic plan further states that a minimum sustaining rate study  could be conducted to develop this type of analysis. A 2013 review  conducted by DLA to assess the appropriateness of the MRE war reserve  level states that such a study would require the participation and  cooperation of industry. DLA officials stated that this type of analysis was conducted more than 20 years ago regarding the MRE industrial  base, but noted that this dated analysis would not reflect the current  industrial base.", "DLA officials told us that this type of analysis has been conducted on  other supply chains, and that while this type of study can be performed by  an outside party such as a contractor, an office within DLA routinely  conducts these studies. For example, in 2013, DLA conducted a minimum  sustaining rate study and other industrial capability assessments of the  three manufacturers of a certain type of parachute that had high demand  during the height of military operations in Afghanistan, but now has far  less demand as a result of the drawdown. DLA subsequently reported  that information collected about its own demand patterns and the  capabilities of the manufacturers was used to determine the most cost- effective industrial solution for that particular item.", "According to DLA officials, DLA has not conducted a minimum sustaining  rate study or other similar analysis for MREs because industry would  have to provide access to financial and production records. Access to  such records is provided by companies for any minimum sustaining rate  study conducted by DLA, as was the case for the study on parachute  manufacturers discussed previously. However, DLA officials stated that  DOD cannot require a supplier to provide the financial data needed to  complete a minimum sustaining rate study. DLA may request the  suppliers agree to such a financial audit, as was the case for the study on  parachute manufacturers discussed previously. While DLA officials told  us that they obtain some information from MRE suppliers on their  capabilities, DLA stated in both its 2013 MRE study and the 2013  strategic plan that it is difficult to know the capabilities of the MRE  industries without more detailed information provided by industry, since  as stated in its strategic plan, the companies have expanded product  lines and customer bases. For example, the three suppliers are  expanding their commercial business to make MRE-like rations and other  products available to the public (such as shelf-stable meals and pouched  foods) and producing other types of operational rations, such as first  strike rations and unitized group rations.", "DLA has conducted recent analyses of the supply chains for other types  of operational rations. In 2014, DLA conducted an analysis of the first  strike rations and unitized group rations that have low or zero peacetime  demand. DLA\u2019s analysis focused on possible strategies to assist the  subsistence industry in quickly ramping up production of these rations.  DLA officials noted that this analysis included a review of and data from  the operational ration industry that produces MREs. However, several  companies that do not produce MREs were part of this analysis, and one  major MRE supplier was not included in this analysis. Additionally, DLA  conducted an analysis in 2010 that assessed various acquisition  strategies for MREs, from continuing its current strategy of relying on  three selected MRE suppliers to pursuing full and open competition  among possible suppliers. As part of this analysis, DLA reviewed the  industrial capabilities that exist among MRE suppliers relative to projected  DOD surge needs. However, the analysis did not determine the level of  MRE purchases from the current three suppliers that can sustain the  industrial base, and it did not include an assessment of the validity of the  current 2.5 million case purchase objective.", "Without conducting an analysis to determine the amount of annual MRE  purchases needed to sustain the industrial base and respond to surge  needs, DLA lacks information that would be useful for managing MRE  inventory, including an assessment of the validity of the 2.5 million case  purchase objective and an understanding of the potential consequences  of falling below the annual purchase objective. DLA officials told us that it  is important to appropriately balance risk and cost and ensure that the  services have MREs as needed while best using resources. Further, as  previously discussed, DLA conducted reviews to assess the  appropriateness of the MRE war reserve levels in 2003, 2007, and 2013.  All of these reviews resulted in various conclusions to either hold constant  or reduce purchases, as they were based mostly on DOD\u2019s projected  demand for MREs and not a detailed analysis of industry capabilities.  Such analysis could be useful to DLA in managing MRE inventory.", "In addition, although DLA coordinates with the military services to obtain  information on MRE requirements and demands as previously discussed,  DLA does not obtain consumption and disposal information from the  services. DLA states in its 2013 MRE strategic plan that it is vital to  collaborate and share information with the military services to continually  improve processes. DLA officials stated that DLA does not obtain  information from the services on consumption and disposals because  DLA\u2019s responsibility ends once it sells MREs to the services. Service  officials agreed that it is the responsibility of the services to incorporate  information related to usage of MREs in determining their requirements  for MRE purchases from DLA. However, DLA acknowledges in the  strategic plan that sharing information about the military services\u2019 demand  and usage patterns will be vital to making purchase decisions. Officials  from the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force stated that they monitor the  consumption of MREs. Further, service officials stated that while they do  not monitor total MRE disposals at this time, they do collect and track  some information regarding disposals when this information is provided  by units and could provide this information to DLA if requested.", "Such information, along with the information DLA already tracks, could  provide further insight on potential changes in the services\u2019 future  demand for MREs during peacetime and help DLA in managing its MRE  inventory. DLA reports in its MRE strategic plan that it intends to continue  monthly coordination phone calls with the services and to include effects  of sequestration and training budgets as items for discussion. As there is  already considerable existing coordination between DLA and the military  services, sharing additional information related to changes in MRE  consumption and disposals could provide additional insight to DLA on  service demand and usage patterns. In the absence of such information,  DLA\u2019s information regarding future service demand for MREs may be  limited, making it difficult to optimize the MRE supply chain across DOD.  Obtaining this additional information from the services would help DLA  ensure that, consistent with DOD guidance, its MRE supply chain is agile  and responsive to customer requirements during peacetime and war  while balancing risk and total cost.", "The difficulty of forecasting demand for items has been a recurring  inventory-management problem across DOD. Previous GAO reports have  cited difficulty with demand forecasting at each of the services and DLA.  In addition, we have identified DOD supply-chain management as a high- risk area since 1990 due in part to weaknesses in accurately forecasting  the demand for spare parts. Furthermore, DOD issued its  Comprehensive Inventory Management Improvement Plan to focus, in  part, on improving the accuracy of demand forecasts.

In a June 2014  report, we found that DLA had set an internal goal in 2012 for reducing  inventory and disposing of nearly $4 billion of on-hand inventory, and that  it accomplished this goal in fiscal year 2013. According to DLA  headquarters officials, the benefits of reducing on-hand inventory are     (1) achieving cost savings by reducing the warehouse infrastructure  needed to store on-hand inventory and (2) preventing reductions to DLA\u2019s  working-capital fund obligational authority, which might reduce supply  availability for the military customers.", "As part of its responsibilities to perform storage and distribution functions  for WRM in support of operational requirements, DLA keeps on-hand  assets that are above current needs (in other words, the assets are in  excess of the approved acquisition objective and being held as retention  stock) if the materiel will help to meet a service WRM requirement. DLA  recategorizes such stock as WRM in its inventory stratification reporting,  and this stock becomes part of the approved acquisition objective. This  recategorization protects the WRM stocks from disposal that could  otherwise occur. However, these stocks are not otherwise managed or  stored separately specifically for the purpose of being available in the  event of a military operation. Rather, the inventory is comingled with  regular stocks, and DLA issues these stocks in response to customer  requisitions, whether for peacetime needs or in response to a surge  requirement related to a military operation.", "DLA officials stated that there are certain types of items that need to be  stocked in order to ensure they are available for surge needs, such as  those items that are military-unique or of limited availability. Further, small  items that are low cost and without shelf-life constraints can be stocked.  The officials stated that decisions to stock items are made on a case-by- case basis depending on the assessment of the responsible supply-chain  managers, which includes an assessment of the surge needs associated  with an item. Some examples of military-unique items stocked by DLA are  camouflaged bandages, chemical protection suits, and operational  rations, including MREs. As another example, supply-chain managers  from the construction and equipment supply chain stated that DLA stocks  a type of matting (called AM2 matting) that can be configured into landing  pads for expeditionary aircraft because it is of limited availability and  military-specific. Industrial hardware supply-chain managers told us that  fasteners, nuts, and bolts are stocked in DLA depots because many are  low cost and without shelf-life constraints. Further, DLA officials told us  that these items do not take up considerable storage space in DLA  storage depots.", "DLA also has sought to comingle its stocks with service stocks to gain  efficiencies and reduce storage and transportation costs. These initiatives  are not focused specifically on WRM inventories since WRM stocks are  not maintained or stored separately from other stocks, but do include  items that have WRM requirements. For example, DLA and the Army  have a joint initiative under way to transfer sustainment stocks of DLA- managed items previously owned by the Army to DLA. When transferred,  these items would be comingled in DLA storage facilities.

A DLA official stated that the  agency\u2019s long-term contracts with industry attempt to leverage the  commercial marketplace to acquire surge coverage to offset the need to  stock items as WRM. As such, contracts can include surge and  sustainment clauses to provide access to items with WRM requirements  when the need for them arises. For example, according to DLA officials,  since medical items are costly to stock and have limited shelf life, DLA\u2019s  medical supply chain uses contingency contracts to acquire the majority  of its items. In recent years, DLA has sought to stock fewer items within  the medical supply chain and relied more on contingency contracts. A  DLA official stated that this strategy had improved delivery times from  over 200 days prior to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to a current  delivery time of 3 to 5 days. This official stated that when DLA contracts  for access to medical inventory and obtains the inventory when needed, it  does not have to be stocked on DOD shelves, which prevents wasting  money on stocked items that must be later destroyed due to expired shelf  life and ensures that medical professionals and their patients obtain high- quality products.", "DLA also incorporates surge clauses into its contracts for some items that  it maintains in its stocks.

Further, the  guidance states that DLA manages the Warstopper Program to ensure  the transition from peacetime to wartime is supported by a viable  industrial base despite the variable demand patterns, technology   Warstopper  inhibitors, skill retention, and general industry issues that may exist for  DLA-managed go-to-war items.", "Items must meet certain mission, demand, or production characteristic  criteria to be funded through the Warstopper Program.

Aside from these congressionally-identified items, other  mission characteristics include life-saving or life-preserving items and  items that, if unavailable, can severely affect a strategic warfighting  capability. For example, medical items and personal protection items with  high value to the preservation of a servicemember\u2019s life (examples  include helmets, body armor, fire-retardant garments, medical patient  movement items and surgical equipment) are important for DOD\u2019s  warfighting capability, according to the Warstopper Program guidance.  Similarly, the guidance includes examples of energy items and repair  parts capable of stopping a strategic warfighter capability if they are  unavailable, such as lithium batteries and helicopter windshields. Demand  characteristics that can facilitate an item\u2019s inclusion in the Warstopper  Program include items with a validated WRM requirement and those with  a low peacetime and high wartime demand. Lastly, production  characteristics that will exceed the industrial capability to meet wartime  requirements, such as long lead times or short shelf lives, could make an  item eligible for Warstopper funding.", "DLA conducts research and analysis to determine whether an investment  is needed to help ensure availability of items and materiel that meet the  criteria for the program. DLA guidance states that studies, data collection,  and reports are outputs of the program that provide information to assess  the state of the industrial base and develop industrial solutions, as  opposed to buying more stocks to store. The office responsible for  managing a particular item or supply chain develops a proposal for the  investment and submits the proposal to DLA headquarters for approval.  The investment may take the form of one of several types of contingency  contracts or other means of investment, such as the purchase of critical  raw materials or the purchase of government-provided equipment to  speed up or modernize industrial processes.

DLA has also put effort into managing the  MRE inventory and, in doing so, monitors various types of data. However,  DLA lacks other analysis and information that could be useful in  managing this inventory. For instance, without conducting an analysis that  provides more information on industry capabilities than its previous  studies, DLA does not have reasonable assurance that it is balancing  readiness and budget priorities with the need to sustain the industrial  base in the most efficient way. Similarly, without obtaining information  from the military services about potential changes to consumption and  disposals of MREs that could affect future demand, DLA may be limited in  its ability to optimize the supply chain across the department. Forecasting  demand for supplies has been a long-standing challenge for DOD in  managing its inventories, and additional information sharing among DLA  and the services could help to reduce uncertainty about the future  demand for MREs.

DOD stated in its written response that DLA  will conduct an analytical study on the level of MRE purchases needed to  sustain the industrial base. DOD noted that this effort would require the  participation and cooperation of industry, as we acknowledge in our  report.
