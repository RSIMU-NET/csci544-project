Studies also indicated that increased tax revenues  would have resulted from the increases in economic activity from the  ARC project.

For example, according to Port  Authority officials, the Port Authority redirected funds it had allocated to  the ARC project to other projects in the region, which could increase  employment and economic activity tied to those projects. Likewise, funds  that New Jersey planned to allocate to the ARC project were reallocated  to the state\u2019s highway trust fund, which would then support economic  activity related to highway projects.

Air quality effects  are of particular relevance in the development of transit projects. FTA,  pursuant to law, includes whether a project is in an area that has not  attained air quality standards required by the Clean Air Act as a factor in  selecting projects for the New Starts program. According to the  Environmental Protection Agency, the entire New York City region is out  of compliance with certain ambient air quality standards that are designed  to protect public health. The project would reduce automobile trips and  thereby decrease emissions that contribute to existing air quality  problems in the region and related public health problems. According to  the Environmental Protection Agency, adverse health effects associated  with air pollutants include increased respiratory symptoms, hospitalization  for heart or lung disease, and premature death. Local transportation  agency officials told us that air quality factors were important when  considering the potential environmental effects of the ARC project. Over  the long term, air quality would have been positively affected due to an  estimated overall daily decrease of about 590,000 in vehicle miles  traveled in the region and about 22,100 fewer trans-Hudson vehicle trips.  While longterm air quality effects were generally positive in nature, the  results of these changes would be dispersed over the entire metropolitan  area, and were too difficult to estimate for the New York region, as noted  in the environmental study.", "According to the environmental study, other adverse environmental  effects would have been short term and mitigated. Among the  environmental effects were negative effects on air quality, mainly related  to dust created by excavation and construction and exhaust emissions  from equipment, noise, potential storm water runoff, vibration, potential  soil erosion, and potential disturbance of various contaminated sites.

The change in cost estimates may  reflect a more accurate understanding of what actually constitutes the   First, as a project progresses from a concept on  project. For example, according to Port Authority officials, early in the  project they learned that there were no existing surveys of New York  Penn Station, and they had to survey the station before detailed designs  could be developed. As shown in figure 3, cost estimates are more  uncertain at the beginning of a project (the range is wide), because less is  known about its detailed design and construction requirements, and  therefore the opportunity for change is greater.", "Second, costs can appear to change if they are not expressed in a  consistent manner, that is, in constant year dollars (to eliminate any  inflationary effects) versus year of expenditure dollars (that may mask any  changes in real terms because of inflation). Third, project cost estimates  are sensitive to factors such as changes to the scope of the project. In  some cases, a sponsor may reduce the scope or add more features to  the project as the design progresses. Uncertainty of the costs is reduced,  as the project scope is better defined, but costs also may increase.  Fourth, cost estimates can change as risks are assessed and reassessed  throughout project development, resulting in the amount FTA requires  project sponsors to set aside for project contingency to increase or  decrease. For example, FTA officials said risk factors could include  changes in real estate costs, new information involving surface or  subsurface ground conditions and materials, or the degree of competition  among contractors. According to FTA officials, risks like these can affect  the cost of a project, and sponsors may never adequately address all of  them, but at a minimum both the sponsor and FTA must be aware of what  those risks are.", "The ARC project cost estimates increased from the $7.4 billion estimate  in 2006 for a number of reasons:  In 2008, FTA\u2019s cost estimates ranged from $9.5 billion to $12.4 billion,  based on potential scenarios in its 2008 Risk Assessment, which not  only assumed different levels of risk but also included $1.7 billion set  aside for contingency.

After considering  comments from NJT, FTA revised the cost range to $9.8 billion to  $12.4 billion.

The  agreement establishes the terms and conditions for federal financial  participation, including the maximum amount of New Starts funding being  committed. To obtain this grant agreement, a project must be approved  by FTA for final design and construction and have gone through a series  of steps that make up the New Starts approval process. Among the  phases of the New Starts planning and development process are:  systems planning, alternatives analysis, preliminary engineering, and final  design.", "Systems planning. Systems planning involves the continuing regional  transportation planning process carried out by metropolitan planning  organizations in urban areas throughout the United States. This  process produces long-range transportation plans and shorter-range  transportation improvement programs, along with environmental and  other analyses.", "Alternatives analysis. The analysis of alternatives examines the  benefits and costs of different options, such as light rail or bus rapid  transit, in a specific transportation corridor or in a regional sub-area. It  concludes with the selection of a locally preferred alternative and  adoption of that alternative into a fiscally constrained long-range  transportation plan. The project sponsor submits the proposed project  to FTA for evaluation so as to gain approval to enter preliminary  engineering, the next phase of development. FTA evaluation does  not include a full cost-benefit analysis, but does consider cost- effectiveness and other benefits of the proposed project.", "Preliminary engineering. Preliminary engineering involves the project  sponsor refining the project by examining the costs, benefits, and  impacts of different design alternatives, and completing an analysis of  environmental impacts as required by the National Environmental  Policy Act of 1969. Once preliminary engineering is complete, FTA  evaluates and rates the project to determine whether it can be  approved into final design.", "Final design.  In the project\u2019s final design phase, the project sponsor  prepares final construction plans and cost estimates, and, if needed,  includes right-of-way acquisition and relocation of utilities.", "After final design is complete, FTA may approve the project for a full  funding grant agreement, at which point the project may move into the  construction phase. In some cases, FTA may obligate some of the  funding expected to be provided in the full funding grant agreement  through an early system work agreement. Although not a guarantee of full  funding, an early system work agreement provides funding so that work  can begin before full funding is awarded."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Teresa Spisak (Assistant  Director), Robert Ciszewski, Alexander Lawrence, David Hooper, Hannah  Laufe, Joshua Ormond, Amy Rosewarne, and Max Sawicky made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
