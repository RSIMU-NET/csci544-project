For example, of the 17 sector-specific plans, only 9 have been updated. Of these 9 updates, just 3 addressed missing cyber criteria, and those 3 involved only a relatively small number (3 or fewer) of the criteria in question. Recently DHS issued guidance specifically requesting that the sectors address cyber criteria shortfalls in their 2010 sector-specific plan updates. Until the plans are issued, it is not clear whether they will fully address cyber requirements. Accordingly, the continuing lack of plans that fully address key cyber criteria has reduced the effectiveness of the existing sector planning approach and thus increases the risk that the nation's cyber assets have not been adequately identified, prioritized, and protected. Most sector-specific agencies developed and identified in their 2007 sector plans those actions--referred to by DHS as implementation actions--essential to carrying out the plans; however, since then, most agencies have not updated the actions and reported progress in implementing them as called for by DHS guidance. Specifically, in response to 2006 guidance that called for agencies to address three key implementation elements (action descriptions, completion milestones, and parties responsible), most sectors initially developed implementation actions that fully addressed the key elements. However, while 2008 guidance called for implementation actions to be updated and for sector reports to include progress reporting against implementation action milestone commitments, only five sectors updated their plans and reported on progress against implementation actions. DHS attributed this in part to the department not following up and working to ensure that all sector plans are fully developed and implemented in accordance with department guidance. The lack of complete updates and progress reports are further evidence that the sector planning process has not been effective and thus leaves the nation in the position of not knowing precisely where it stands in securing cyber critical infrastructures. Not following up to address these conditions also shows DHS is not making sector planning a priority. Further, recent studies by a presidential working group--which resulted in the President establishing the White House Office of Cybersecurity Coordinator--and an expert commission also identified shortfalls in the effectiveness of the current public-private partnership approach and related sector planning and offered options for improving the process. Such options include (1) prioritizing sectors to focus planning efforts on those with the most important cyber assets and (2) streamlining existing sectors to optimize their capacity to identify priorities and develop plans. Given this, it is essential that DHS and the to-be-appointed Cybersecurity Coordinator determine whether the current process as implemented should continue to be the national approach and thus worthy of further investment."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The nation\u2019s critical infrastructure relies extensively on computerized  information technology (IT) systems and electronic data.

This means that as a nation, we do not  know precisely where we are in implementing sector plans and associated  protective measures designed to secure and protect the nation\u2019s cyber and  other critical infrastructure, despite having invested many years in this  effort. This condition is due in part to DHS not making sector planning a  priority and as such, not managing it in a way that fully meets DHS  guidance. These conclusions, taken as a whole, further raise fundamental  questions about whether the current approach to sector planning is  worthwhile and whether there are options that would provide better  results. Consequently, it is essential that federal cyber security leaders\u2014 including DHS and the to-be-appointed Cybersecurity Coordinator\u2014exert  their leadership roles in this area by, among other things, determining  whether it is worthwhile to continue with the current approach as  implemented or consider if proposed options provide more effective  results.

This should include  collaborating closely with other sector-specific agencies to develop    sector-specific plans that fully address cyber-related criteria in the next  release of the plans, and    sector annual reports that (1) include updated implementation actions and  associated milestones and (2) report progress against plan commitments  and timelines."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DHS concurred with our recommendations but took exception with  certain report facts and conclusions that it said formed the basis for our  recommendations. Specifically, in an email accompanying its written  response\u2014which was signed by the Director, Departmental GAO/OIG  Liaison Office and is reprinted in appendix II\u2014DHS said it concurred with  our recommendation. In its written response, DHS added that it supported  continually assessing the effectiveness of the sector approach and  identifying and implementing improvements as appropriate. The  department also stated in its written response that alternative options can  be explored and implemented along with the current sector approach,  rather than a binary choice between continuing the existing sector-specific  planning approach and other options. We agree such efforts can be  pursued in parallel and that doing them in this manner would be  consistent with our recommendations. The department also commented  that the report does not give due consideration to many of the ongoing  sector and cross-sector cyber security activities identified in the annual  reports and briefed to us. We recognize that DHS has multiple ongoing  efforts to improve critical infrastructure protection (CIP) planning and  implementation, and our report conclusions state this point. While our  report for the sake of brevity does not include all of DHS\u2019s efforts, it does  include illustrative examples throughout as part of giving a fair and  balanced view of DHS\u2019s efforts in this area.", "Notwithstanding the concurrence discussed above, DHS in its written  response took exception with our report\u2019s facts and conclusions in nine  areas\u2014referred to by DHS as general items. Each of these general items,  along with our response, is summarized below.", "General item 1: With regard to our report section that states that the  sector-specific agencies have yet to update their respective plans to fully  address key cyber security criteria as called for by DHS, the department  commented that it established a risk management framework (as part of  the 2006 National Infrastructure Protection Plan or NIPP) which called for  cyber and other elements (i.e., human, physical) to be addressed. DHS  added that its 2006 SSP guidance did not call for these elements to be  addressed separately in the plans and at that time GAO had not identified  the 30 cyber criteria in DHS\u2019s guidance; therefore, when the 2007 SSPs  were issued they did not fully address the 30 cyber criteria (which is  consistent with our October 2007 report findings). To address this  situation, DHS said it revised the NIPP in early 2009 to, among other  things, provide for more robust coverage of cyber security using as a basis  the 30 cyber criteria identified by GAO. In addition, in its guidance to the  sector agencies in developing their 2010 SSPs, DHS directed the agencies  to update their plans using the revised NIPP and in doing so, to fully  address the 30 GAO-identified cyber criteria.", "GAO response: It is a positive development that DHS has issued guidance  directing the sector agencies to fully address missing cyber criteria as part  of having the sectors rewrite their SSPs in 2010.", "In addition, while we agree with DHS that its 2006 guidance did not call for  cyber to be addressed separately in each SSP section, it is important to  point out that DHS\u2019s 2006 guidance nonetheless called for the sectors to  address in the SSPs how they planned to secure the cyber aspects of their  critical infrastructures. Consequently, the 2007 SSPs were to have  addressed cyber in order to be in compliance with DHS\u2019s guidance.", "In 2007, we initiated a review to assess the extent to which these plans  addressed cyber. As part of that review, we analyzed the 2006 guidance  and identified 30 cyber-related criteria that the critical infrastructure  sectors were to address in their SSPs. Our analysis of the plans found them  to be lacking in the cyber area and we subsequently recommended that  DHS request that by September 2008, the sector agencies update their  SSPs to address missing cyber-related criteria. DHS agreed with this  recommendation, and stated that the department had initiated efforts to  implement it. However, in following up on this recommendation and  analyzing the cyber content of the sectors\u2019 2008 SSP updates (which was  the first objective of this report), only 3 of the 17 sectors had updated their  plans to address missing criteria.", "General item 2: Regarding the section of our report stating that the reason  sector-specific agencies did not fully address missing cyber criteria in their  plans was due in part to the fact that they were unaware of the cyber  criteria shortfalls identified in our 2007 report, DHS described several  initiatives it had taken to inform the agencies of their planning shortfalls.", "GAO response: We recognize that DHS has taken actions to inform the  agencies of the shortfalls identified in our 2007 report. Accordingly, we  cited illustrative examples of such actions throughout our report.  Nonetheless, when we interviewed sector agencies officials, several stated  that they were unaware of the GAO identified shortfalls, which raises  questions about the effectiveness of DHS\u2019s efforts.", "General item 3: DHS stated that while the SSPs have not been fully  updated to include ongoing and planned cyber security activities, it does  not mean there is a lack of cyber security planning in the sectors or that  the planning to date has been ineffective. DHS also reiterated its earlier  point that our report does not take into account many of its ongoing  activities in the sector related to cyber security. In addition, the  department commented that all the sectors reported on their progress in  the 2008 annual reports.", "GAO response: We recognize that DHS has had many ongoing efforts  related to improving the cyber content of SSPs and illustrative examples  are provided throughout our report. However, the sector-specific agencies\u2019  limited progress in addressing missing cyber content in their SSPs  indicates a lack of effectiveness of planning. Specifically, of the 17 sector- specific plans, only 9 have been updated. Of these 9 updates, just 3  addressed missing cyber criteria, and those 3 only involved a relatively  small number (3 or less) of the criteria in question. In our view, this  continuing lack of plans that fully address key cyber criteria has reduced  the effectiveness of the existing sector planning approach and thus  increased the risk that the nation\u2019s cyber assets have not been adequately  identified, prioritized, and protected.", "Further, while we agree with DHS that the sectors reported aspects of  progress in the 2008 annual reports, only five sectors updated and  reported on the extent of progress in carrying out their implementation  actions as called for by DHS guidance, while the other 12 did not. This  level of reporting is not sufficient for evaluating sector-wide progress and  raises concerns about the effectiveness of these annual reports as a tool to  measure progress.", "General item 4: DHS commented that (1) we expanded the scope of this  engagement beyond the initial focus on coverage of cyber security in the  SSPs to encompass the entire sector planning approach and that DHS was  not asked to provide a broader update on the public-private partnership,  and (2) our draft report did not include information on DHS\u2019s numerous  ongoing activities with the agencies and sectors related to cyber security.", "GAO response: With regard to the first comment, the focus of our  engagement was on the cyber security aspects of the sector-specific plans  and progress reporting, which are an important part of the sector planning  approach. Consequently, even when taking into consideration DHS\u2019s  ongoing activities with the agencies and sectors related to cyber security,  the planning and reporting shortfalls we identified indicate a lack of  effectiveness with the current sector approach.", "Regarding DHS\u2019s second comment, we recognize that DHS has multiple  ongoing efforts to improve CIP planning and implementation, and our  report includes illustrative examples of DHS\u2019s efforts to do so. As a case in  point, on July 27, 2009, we briefed DHS using the presentation slides in  this report and updated the slides to incorporate examples (in addition to  the ones we had already included in the briefing) that DHS described to us  during that meeting. Although DHS has many ongoing efforts related to  improving the cyber content of SSPs, our analysis showed that there had  been limited progress in addressing missing cyber content in the SSPs  since our 2007 recommendation; this indicates to us that the planning  process lacks effectiveness, which is why we recommended that DHS  assess whether improvements are needed to the current process.", "General item 5: In regard to our report stating that DHS guidance calls for  the sector agencies to annually review and update as appropriate their  sector plans, which serve as a means to provide an interim snapshot of  where agencies stand in addressing their gaps and is why we used it as a  basis to assess progress, DHS said the SSPs are intended to be strategic,  three-year plans and are not meant to provide a snapshot of where  agencies stand in addressing their gaps and should not be used as a basis  to assess progress in CIP protection.", "GAO response: Our report acknowledges that the SSPs are high-level  strategic plans and the sector annual reports serve as the primary means  of assessing progress in improving CIP protection. Specifically, as stated in  our report, the annual reports are used to, among other things, capture  changes in sector programs and assess progress made against goals set in  the SSPs. However, it should be noted that annual updates to the SSPs also  include information on progress being made against SSP goals and as such  serve as a source of evidence on where agencies stand in addressing their  gaps and provide a basis to assess progress in CIP protection. Specifically,  the 2008 updates we reviewed and analyzed included key information on  what sector agencies had (or had not) done to address missing cyber  security content that we identified in their 2007 SSPs.", "General item 6: In response to our reporting that most agencies had not  updated their implementation actions and reported progress in  implementing them as called for by DHS guidance, DHS commented that  many of the implementation actions were one-time actions that were  completed in 2007 or 2008, and that others are of an ongoing, continuous  nature. The department added that since the vast majority of these items  were completed, DHS made adjustments in 2009 to the reporting process to  more accurately capture the progress of CIP efforts, and that DHS is now  working with the sectors toward the development of outcome-based metrics  designed to measure the beneficial value of activities in mitigating CIP risks.", "GAO response: We recognize that many of the implementation actions  were one-time or ongoing actions, but DHS\u2019s guidance nonetheless called  for the sectors to update the actions and report on the extent of progress  in achieving the actions. Further, we agree that DHS has made recent  positive changes to their reporting processes to more accurately capture  progress. However, as noted in our report, most sectors had not reported  in their 2008 sector annual reports that their implementation actions were  completed, which showed that the existing progress reporting process was  not totally effective.", "General item 7: In response to our reporting that DHS\u2019s lack of follow up  to address SSP planning shortfalls showed it was not making sector  planning a priority, the department stated that it (1) is actively engaged  with the agencies and sectors, (2) assists the sectors with planning and  reporting on an ongoing basis, and (3) continually evaluates and improves  these processes with input from the sectors.", "GAO response: We recognize that DHS has multiple ongoing efforts to  improve CIP planning and implementation, and our report includes  illustrative examples of DHS\u2019s efforts. Despite these efforts, DHS\u2019s limited  progress in addressing missing cyber content in the SSPs since our 2007  recommendation and the lack of updated implementation actions and  progress reporting\u2014coupled with the department\u2019s limited follow up to  correct these conditions\u2014led us to conclude that DHS is not making  sector planning a priority.", "General item 8: DHS stated that although our report cited the work and  studies of an expert commission and the President\u2019s cybersecurity  working group, including the issues they raised with the current sector  planning approach, we did not discuss the reports with the department.", "GAO response: On July 27, 2009, we briefed DHS on our findings, conclusions,  and recommendations, which included descriptions of the work performed  by these two groups. Specifically, in advance of our meeting, we provided the  department with a draft of our briefing presentation slides for review and  then met to discuss each slide of our presentation, including those addressing  the work of these two expert groups.", "General item 9: In citing our recommendation that calls for DHS to  collaborate closely with the sector-specific agencies to develop SSPs that  fully address cyber-related criteria, the department stated this  collaboration has already begun as part of the department\u2019s current effort  to have the sector agencies update their SSPs for issuance in 2010.", "GAO response: This effort to collaborate with the agencies is consistent  with our recommendations.", "As we agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents  of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

Specifically, in response  to 2006 guidance that called for agencies in developing implementation actions to  address three key elements (e.g., action descriptions, completion milestones), most  sectors initially developed implementation actions that fully addressed the key elements;  however, while 2008 guidance called for implementation actions to be updated and for  sector reports to include progress reporting against implementation action milestone  commitments, only five sectors updated their plans and reported on progress against  implementation actions. DHS attributed this in part to the department not following up and  working to ensure that all sector plans are fully developed and implemented in  accordance with department guidance.", "The lack of complete updates and progress reports is further evidence that the sector  planning process has not been effective and thus leaves the nation in the position of not  knowing precisely where it stands in securing its cyber and other critical infrastructure.   Not following up to address these conditions also shows DHS is not making sector  planning a priority. Further, the recent studies by the President\u2019s working group and  expert commission also identified shortfalls in the effectiveness of the current public- private partnership approach and related sector planning and offered options for  improving the process. Given this, it is essential that DHS determine whether the current  process should continue to be the national approach and thus worthy of further  investment  Accordingly, we are making recommendations to the Secretary of Homeland Security,  consistent with any direction from the Office of the Cybersecurity Coordinator, to assess  whether the existing sector-specific planning processes should continue to be the nation\u2019s  approach to securing cyber and other critical infrastructure. If the existing approach is  deemed to be the national approach, we also recommend that the Secretary make it an  agency priority and manage it accordingly, including collaborating closely with other  sector-specific agencies to develop (1) sector plans that fully address cyber-related  criteria and (2) sector annual reports that include implementation actions and milestones  and progress reporting against plan commitments and timeline.", "In oral and written comments on a draft of this briefing, DHS officials, including the  Director of Infrastructure Protection\u2019s Partnership and Outreach Division, which is  responsible for sector-specific planning, commented on two areas. Specifically, they  stated that that the sector agencies had made more progress in implementing cyber- related criteria than reported in our briefing due to other ongoing DHS and sector efforts  outside the sector plans and sector annual reports (implementation actions), which were  the focus of the briefing. For example, DHS officials said its cyber division works regularly  with many sectors on cyber assessments, exercises, and information sharing. While on  the surface these may appear to improve cyber security, the officials did not show how  these activities helped the agencies address missing cyber-related criteria or effectively  implement their plans. The officials also said that focusing on the agencies\u2019 efforts the  year after they issued their sector plans is premature as the agencies have until 2010 to  rewrite and reissue their next sector plans. This notwithstanding, DHS\u2019s guidance calls for  the sector agencies to annually review and update as appropriate their sector plans,  which is a means to provide an interim snapshot of where agencies stand in addressing  their gaps and is why we used it as a basis to assess progress.", "Consistent with the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Homeland Security Presidential  Directive-7 identified    DHS as the principal federal agency to lead, integrate, and coordinate  implementation of efforts to protect critical infrastructure and key resources; and     lead federal agencies, referred to as sector-specific agencies, as responsible for  coordinating critical infrastructure protection efforts with the public and private  stakeholders in their respective sectors.", "It also required DHS to develop a plan that outlines national goals, objectives, milestones,  and key initiatives necessary for fulfilling its responsibilities for physical and cyber critical  infrastructure protection.", "In 2006, DHS issued the plan\u2014commonly referred to as the NIPP\u2014which, in addition to  addressing the above, is to serve as a road map for how DHS and other relevant  stakeholders are to use risk management principles to prioritize protection activities within  and across sectors in an integrated, coordinated fashion. Further, the NIPP required the  lead agencies of the 17 critical infrastructure sectors to develop a sector-specific plan  (SSP) to address how the sector\u2019s stakeholders would implement the national plan and  how each sector would improve the security of its assets systems, networks, and  functions.", "In addition, as required by the NIPP, the sector-specific agencies are to provide updates  on sector progress with their SSPs, including efforts to identify, prioritize, and coordinate  the protection of the sector\u2019s critical infrastructure, to DHS on an annual basis. DHS is  responsible for incorporating these reports into an overall critical infrastructure/key  resources report, called the National Critical Infrastructure/Key Resources Protection  Annual Report, which is due to the Executive Office of the President by September of  each year.", "Sector-specific agencies are to work in coordination with relevant government and  private-sector representatives to develop and update the SSPs. Table 1 shows the  designated agency for each sector.", "The sector-specific plans are to    describe how the sector will identify and prioritize its critical assets, including  cyber assets such as networks;     identify the approaches the sector will take to assess risks and develop  programs to manage and mitigate risk;     define the security roles and responsibilities of members of the sector; and     establish the methods that members will use to interact and share information  related to the protection of critical infrastructure.", "In response, the sector-specific agencies developed and issued SSPs for their sectors in  May 2007. Subsequently, we examined these plans to determine the extent to which they  addressed cyber security and reported in October 2007 on the extent to which the  sectors addressed aspects of cyber security in their plans. Specifically, we reported that  the results varied in that none of the plans fully addressed all 30 cyber security-related  criteria. We also reported that several plans\u2014including the information technology and  telecommunications sectors\u2014fully addressed many of the criteria and others\u2014such as  agriculture and food and commercial facilities\u2014were less comprehensive.", "Further, we recommended that DHS request that by September 2008 the sector-specific  agencies\u2019 plans address the cyber-related criteria that were only partially addressed or  not addressed at all. In its October 2007 response to our report, DHS agreed with our  recommendation and stated it had initiated actions to implement it.", "Since our 2007 report, an expert commission (led by two congressmen and industry  officials) and a White House working group (established by the President) studied and  reported on the public-private partnership approach and related issues such as sector  planning as well as other aspects of U.S cyber security policy. Specifically,    In August 2007, a commission\u2014commonly referred to as the Commission on  Cybersecurity for the 44th Presidency\u2014was established to examine the (1) adequacy  of U.S. cyber strategy, including public-private partnerships and the sector approach  and (2) identify areas for improvement. In December 2008, the commission reported,  among other things, that the current public-private partnership and sector planning  approach had serious shortcomings such as overlapping roles and responsibilities  and duplication of effort. The commission made 25 recommendations aimed at  addressing these and other shortfalls with the strategy and its implementation. tegic nd InterntionSdie, Securing Cyberspace for the 44th Presidency, A Report of the CSIS Commission on  Cybersecurity for the 44th Presidency (Washington, D.C., Decemer 2008); nd The White House, Cyberspace Policy Review:  Assuring a Trusted and Resilient Information and Communications Infrastructure (Washington, D.C., My 29, 2009).", "In February 2009, the President directed the National Security Council and the  Homeland Security Council to conduct a comprehensive \u201c60-day review\u201d of all U.S.  cyber policies and structures. With regard to public-private partnerships, which  include sector planning, the councils reported in May 2009 that the sector and other  groups involved in this area performed valuable work but that there was a  proliferation of plans and recommendations that resulted in government and private  sector personnel and resources being spread across a multitude of organizations  engaged in sometimes duplicative or inconsistent efforts. The review concluded that  there are alternative approaches for how the federal government can work with the  sectors and recommended that these options be explored. At this time, the President  also created the office of Cybersecurity Coordinator\u2014who is to be part of the White  House\u2019s National Security Staff and National Economic Council\u2014to, among other  things, assist in developing a new U.S. cyber policy.

However, until these plans are issued, it is not clear whether they fully address cyber  requirements. This notwithstanding, having sector-specific agencies continue to have  SSPs that do not fully address key cyber elements has reduced the effectiveness of the  existing sector planning approach and thus increases the risk that the nation\u2019s critical  cyber assets have not been adequately identified, prioritized, and protected.", "Sector Plans and Related Reports Do Not Fully Provide for Effective  Implementation  To provide for effective sector plan implementation, DHS issued guidance that called for  the sector-specific agencies to provide for such activities in their SSPs and sector annual  reports.", "Specifically, with regard to the SSPs, the department issued March 2006 guidance  directing the sector-specific agencies to develop and incorporate in their SSPs actions  and activities\u2014referred to as implementation actions\u2014essential to carrying out the plans  and achieving the goal of securing the sectors\u2019 cyber and other assets.

However, these areas, including  overall progress, did not specifically address implementation progress with the sector- specific plan. For example, the energy sector reported on, among other things, progress  with communicating with sector partners, protecting international energy assets, and  collaborations with the Department of Homeland Security. In addition, the  communications sector reported on, among other things, progress to narrow key gaps  identified in the sector\u2019s 2007 report, and progress with key programs. Despite this, the  reporting was not sufficient for evaluating either sector-wide progress with sector-specific  plans, or the effectiveness of these plans.", "The incomplete implementation updates and progress reports are due in part to DHS not  following up and working to ensure that all sector plans were fully developed and  implemented in accordance with departmental guidance. Specifically, although DHS  issued periodic sector-planning guidance, periodically met with sectors officials, and  conducted other planning-related activities as discussed above, department officials said  their follow-up and oversight of the sector plans did not always result in the sectors  developing plans that fully meet DHS guidance. These officials said this occurs due to the  fact that as part of DHS\u2019s partnership with the private sector, the parties do not always  agree on the extent to which DHS guidance is to be addressed in performing sector  planning activities. Consistent with this, our past cyber critical infrastructure protection  research and extensive experience at the sector agencies and their private sector  counterparts have shown that the public-private partnership is indeed challenging to  manage. That research and work also pointed out that DHS nonetheless has a leadership  role and responsibility to make sure (1) the partnership works effectively and (2) the  sectors plan for and implement efforts aimed at protecting the nation\u2019s cyber and other  critical infrastructure, including ensuring the current sector approach is still worth pursuing  and considering, where appropriate, alternative approaches. mple, GAO, Critical Infrastructure Protection: Department of Homeland Security Faces Challenges in Fulfilling  Cybersecurity Responsibilities, GAO-05-434, (Washington, DC.: My 26, 2005); nd Critical Infrastructure Protection: Progress  Coordinating Government and Private Sector Efforts Varies by Sectors' Characteristics, GAO-07-39, (Washington, DC.: Oct. 16, 2006).", "Shortfalls with Current Public-Private Partnership Approach and Related Sector Planning  Highlighted in Recent Studies by Expert Commission and Presidential Working Group  In addition to the above briefing results, the recent reports by the Commission on  Cybersecurity for the 44th Presidency and President\u2019s 60-day review also identified  shortfalls with the current public-private partnership approach and relating sector  planning, that show such planning is not effective. To address the shortfalls, the  commission and presidential review identified options to be considered as means to  improving sector planning. Examples include:    The cyber security commission recommended simplifying the sector approach by  prioritizing sectors in order to focus planning and other activities on the most  important sectors\u2014which it identified as Energy, Finance, Information Technology,  and Communications\u2014with the most important cyber assets.", "The President\u2019s review identified a number of models of effective public-private  partnership and planning (e.g., the processes and structures used by the United  Kingdom) and suggested that the positive attributes of these models be applied to  the sector agencies and related organizations.
