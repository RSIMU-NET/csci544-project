Responses to GAO\u2019s non-generalizable questionnaire from 11 401(k) plan record keepers\u2014entities that manage participant account data and transactions for plans\u2014showed that most plans covered by the questionnaire had not adopted products and services that could help participants turn their savings into a retirement income stream (referred to as lifetime income options in this report). Responses to the questionnaire represented more than 40 percent of all 401(k) assets and about a quarter of plans at the end of 2014. GAO found that of the plans covered by the questionnaire, about two-thirds did not offer a withdrawal option \u2014payments from accounts, sometimes designed to last a lifetime\u2014and about three-quarters did not offer an annuity\u2014arrangements that can guarantee set payments for life.", "Concerns about legal risks and record keeper constraints may deter many plan sponsors\u2014typically employers that provide 401(k) plans and establish investment and distribution options\u2014from offering lifetime income options. The Department of Labor (DOL) issues regulations and guidance for plan sponsors and is responsible for educating and assisting them to help ensure the retirement security of workers. For example, DOL has prescribed steps plan sponsors can take to satisfy their fiduciary duties (i.e. act prudently and in the best interest of participants) when selecting an annuity provider for a 401(k) plan. However, according to industry stakeholders GAO interviewed, those steps are not often used because they include assessing \u201csufficient\u201d information to \u201cappropriately\u201d conclude that the annuity provider will be financially able to pay future claims without definitions for those terms. Without clearer criteria to select an annuity provider, fear of liability may deter plan sponsors from offering annuities. Further, GAO found that a mix of lifetime income options to choose from is not usually available. DOL provides an incentive in the form of limited liability relief to plan sponsors who, among other things, provide participants at least three diversified investment options. However, no such incentive exists for plan sponsors offering a mix of lifetime income options. Without some degree of liability relief, plan sponsors may be reluctant to offer a diverse mix of lifetime income options to their participants. Lastly, stakeholders told GAO that record keepers may make only their own annuities available to the plans they service. DOL provides guidance on selecting service providers, but it does not encourage plan sponsors to seek choices from their service providers, which may prevent plans from having appropriate annuity options available to offer participants.", "Required minimum distributions (RMD) can offer a default for those who do not choose a lifetime income option by setting a minimum amount of taxable 401(k) income for those age 70 \u00bd or older, based on life expectancy. Some plan sponsors know how to administer RMDs, and some already choose to provide RMD payments calculated to last a lifetime. However, DOL\u2019s guidance on default lifetime income is focused on a particular annuity type used only by a few plans. By issuing guidance encouraging plans to consider letting RMDs be the default distribution process for retiring participants, DOL may help create lifetime income for participants who do not choose an option."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes seven recommendations to DOL, including that it clarify the criteria to be used by plan sponsors to select an annuity provider, consider providing limited liability relief for offering an appropriate mix of lifetime income options, issue guidance to encourage plan sponsors to select a record keeper that offers annuities from other providers, and consider providing RMD-based default lifetime income to retirees.

Plan  participants today typically must take responsibility for identifying and  developing a retirement strategy to ensure income for the remainder of  their lives. Those who fail to do so face the risk of outliving their savings  and relying primarily on Social Security.", "Plan sponsors have been encouraged to offer options within 401(k) plans  that provide some level of guaranteed income over the course of  participants\u2019 lives. Yet, many plan sponsors may still be reluctant to offer  lifetime income options, and plan participants may be inclined to avoid  committing to a lifetime income strategy when faced with a distribution  decision at retirement. Given the current state of lifetime income options  in 401(k) plans, you asked us to review challenges and potential changes  to help plan sponsors and participants. This report addresses the  following questions.  1.  What is known about the adoption of lifetime income options in 401(k)  plans?  2.  What barriers, if any, deter plan sponsors from offering lifetime  income options?  3.  What challenges, if any, do participants face in learning to make  informed decisions about lifetime income options?  4.

To examine what barriers, if any, deter plan sponsors  from offering lifetime income options, we conducted a non-generalizable  online survey of plan sponsors through industry organizations such as  PLANSPONSOR, the Plan Sponsor Council of America, the National  Association of Plan Administrators and BenefitsLink. To assess the  challenges participants may face in learning to make informed decisions  about lifetime income options, we reviewed a non-generalizable sample  of the written information some 401(k) plan sponsors provide to  participants when they leave an employer, referred to as separation  packets. We obtained separation packets from participants and industry  stakeholders we interviewed, as well as from publicly available sources  such as plan websites. We also obtained and reviewed examples of  information, such as lifetime income illustrations, that some service  providers make available for plan sponsors to include in benefit  statements or on plan websites to help participants plan for retirement. To  examine what defaults exist for participants who do not select a lifetime  income option, we coordinated with Boston Research Technologies, a  research firm. To review the survey methodologies we interviewed  individuals knowledgeable about the methodology and compared  selected survey responses against data from other large samples of  401(k) participants. We found the survey responses to be reflective of the  broader population of 401(k) plan participants and as a result, we  generalize the survey responses to that population. To answer all these  questions, we reviewed relevant research; industry publications; and  federal laws, regulations, and guidance on lifetime income options in  401(k) plans.

In addition to providing lump sums, record keepers reported  that roughly a third of plans covered by our record keeper questionnaire  adopted some form of a withdrawal option, including installment  payments, systematic withdrawals, or managed payout funds. We sent  a questionnaire to a non-generalizable sample of plan record keepers that  represented about a quarter of the 401(k) plan market at the end of  2014. Plans generally do not have to provide participants with  distribution options that will help them secure lifetime income in  retirement. Plans can provide lump sum distributions of participants\u2019  entire account balances and remove participants from the plan after  participants reach the plan\u2019s retirement age. However, when made  available by plans, withdrawal options allow participants access to their  401(k) plan account throughout retirement. Withdrawal options can be  structured in a variety of ways, some designed, but not guaranteed, to  stretch a participant\u2019s savings throughout retirement (see table 2).", "Record keepers reported that mid-size and large plans covered by our  questionnaire had the highest adoption rates of withdrawal options and  were also more likely to make sophisticated withdrawal options available  to participants. As shown in figure 5, these mid-size and large plans had  higher adoption rates of both installment payments and systematic  withdrawals than small plans. One plan adviser we interviewed  suggested this variation in adoption rates is due to small plans\u2019 persistent  view of 401(k) plans principally as an asset accumulation vehicle and a  lack of focus on helping participants with their retirement income needs.", "Further, this plan advisor and other industry stakeholders noted that  sponsors of larger plans are better positioned to negotiate reductions in,  or waivers from, the fees record keepers charge for administering  withdrawal options, which could affect their adoption. Similarly, figure 5  shows record keepers reported that mid-size and large plans covered by  our questionnaire had at least twice the adoption rate of systematic  withdrawal options as small plans. Industry stakeholders indicated that  systematic withdrawal options are generally more prevalent among larger  plans because they have more experience offering withdrawal options.  These industry stakeholders explained that because of this greater level  of experience with offering withdrawal options, larger plans may also be  more comfortable offering more sophisticated options like systematic  withdrawals. Record keepers reported that a few plans covered by our  questionnaire adopted managed payout funds, but unlike other  withdrawal options, such as installment payments and systematic  withdrawals, that are available among all the record keepers who  responded to our questionnaire, industry stakeholders told us managed  payout funds are not readily available as an in-plan option. In addition,  industry stakeholders told us that managed payout funds are found  primarily outside of 401(k) plans in the retail market.", "Although RMDs have not been identified by EBSA or IRS as a default  systematic withdrawal option, RMDs can serve that purpose for retirees  who remain in the plan beyond age 70 \u00bd if they are calculated to provide  minimum amounts based on a retiree\u2019s life expectancy and account  balance. Plans may and do also adopt other methods that satisfy the  RMD provisions. Withdrawals can satisfy those provisions as long as the  distributions from those options are as much or more than the applicable  RMDs, such as when plans only offer lump sum withdrawals of the entire  account balance. Therefore, the RMD provisions can be met without  providing participants with payments based on life expectancy. In fact,  industry research has shown that many plans do not allow retired  participants to take partial withdrawals; instead, retirees must either  withdraw their entire account balance or forgo withdrawing any funds.  Further, according to a record keeper, some plans may require  participants to take lump sum distributions of their entire account balance  before reaching age 70 \u00bd to avoid having to administer RMDs.  Similarly, a lump sum distribution for a participant age 70 \u00bd or older  would also allow a plan sponsor to meet RMD requirements. However,  none of these practices help to provide participants with lifetime  retirement income."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "About Three-Fourths of Plans in Our Review Did Not Offer an Annuity Option", "paragraphs": ["Record keepers reported that about three-quarters of plans covered by  our questionnaire did not offer an income annuity. Among the options  offered by roughly a quarter of plans in our record keeper questionnaire  were fixed immediate annuities, guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits  (GMWB), and deferred annuities (see table 3 for a description of each  option). Plans adopt annuity options to allow participants to secure  guaranteed income for retirement from their 401(k) plan savings. Annuity  options are structured in a variety of ways, such as the timing of its  purchase or the beginning of payments, to meet different guaranteed  retirement income needs of participants.", "Record keepers reported that plans covered by our questionnaire most  frequently adopted a fixed immediate annuity, a simple and traditional  form of annuity benefit found in 401(k) plans that offered annuities. As  shown in figure 6, small and mid-sized plans in our review had slightly  higher adoption rates than large plans. Some industry stakeholders told  us that smaller plans generally have higher adoption rates of in-plan  annuity options because they are more likely to use record keepers that  are insurers and participate in group annuity contracts.", "What Are 401(k) Plan Group Annuity Contracts?", "Record keepers reported that most small plans covered by our  questionnaire are funded through the use of   group annuity contracts,  as shown in Figure 7. Group annuity contracts place a \u201cwrapper\u201d of  benefits, namely an annuity or a minimum death benefit, around a  bundle of investments that are similar to mutual funds. See Appendix  III for an illustration of how group annuity contracts are used as a plan  funding mechanism.  We previously reported that some plan sponsors  may be unaware that their plan is funded through a group annuity  contract or may not know to consider the terms of the option. Industry  stakeholders explained that even though group annuity contracts have  provisions\u2014including terms and rates\u2014for participants to purchase or  receive an annuity at retirement, they are principally used as a funding  mechanism for insurers to administer plan assets and are therefore  rarely used to provide lifetime income. One insurer said that the cost to  administer a plan through a group annuity contract is competitive with  those administered directly with investment funds. However, we  previously reported that fees associated with group annuities can add  significant costs to a plan (see GAO-12-325).", "Industry stakeholders also told us that a fixed immediate annuity is the  most straightforward and simple annuity that plans can offer participants  because they are typically purchased in one transaction at retirement and  provide a specified benefit. Further, one stakeholder noted that fixed  immediate annuities are relatively standardized and that their simplicity  facilitates comparisons of providers\u2019 products. Several record keepers  noted that products that are easier for participants to understand and for  record keepers to implement, such as fixed immediate annuities, are  more likely to be adopted by plans.", "Small and mid-sized plans also represented nearly all of the plans from  our record keeper questionnaire that adopted GMWBs, a more  complicated product introduced in recent years to the in-plan market.  Similar to fixed immediate annuities, some stakeholders told us that  GMWBs may be more prevalent among smaller plans because insurers,  many of whom offer their own GMWB product, often perform  recordkeeping and administrative functions for smaller plans and make  their own product readily available. Industry stakeholders told us that  because GMWBs are a hybrid investment and insurance product, they  can provide unique benefits, but can also be difficult to understand. Some  stakeholders told us that GMWBs can be beneficial for plans that focus  on helping participants accumulate their savings because the product  allows participants to remain invested in the stock and bond markets and  benefit from potential returns while guaranteeing income against market  downturns. Because GMWBs allow participants to benefit from potential  returns, the levels of guaranteed minimum withdrawal payments may also  increase. In contrast, some other stakeholders indicated that the features  of GMWBs that make it a flexible annuity option result in higher costs as  compared with other types of annuities. See Appendix II for an illustration  of the ownership phases of a typical GMWB.", "Despite recent agency actions to help facilitate the use of some types of  deferred annuities, plan adoption of this form of annuity is limited. Record  keepers reported that less than 1 percent of plans covered by our record  keeper questionnaire had adopted any deferred annuity option. Treasury  recently promulgated regulations on the use by plans of QLACs, a type of  deferred annuity. Two insurers told us that they have begun to offer  QLACs to plans, but the products are relatively new to the market.  Accordingly, record keepers reported that that no plans covered under  our questionnaire had adopted QLACs as an in-plan option. Similarly,  DOL recently affirmed that a deferred annuity embedded in a target date  fund (TDF) can be used as a qualified default investment alternative  (QDIA), but industry stakeholders told us that few service providers  have developed these products and, plan adoption has been very limited.  Industry stakeholders also told us that they expect adoption of deferred  annuities, such as QLACs and deferred annuities embedded in target  date funds, to increase in the future as more providers introduce their  products to the in-plan market and more plans adopt them as a default  solution.", "Record keepers reported that less than 1 percent of plans covered by our  questionnaire adopted an annuity shopping platform to help participants  select and buy an annuity outside the plan using rollover funds. Annuity  shopping platforms allow participants to compare and shop for annuities  from competing insurers. They can be offered in-plan, but one provider  told us that they generally are not because of sponsors\u2019 concerns about  the fiduciary responsibilities associated with insurer selection. The  provider also suggested that the annuity shopping platform to select and  buy an annuity outside the plan using rollover funds is the easiest option  for plans to facilitate participant access to guaranteed lifetime income  options because, among other reasons, sponsors do not have to assume  the fiduciary responsibilities associated with insurer selection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "According to Stakeholders, Many Plans Do Not Allow Partial Annuitization", "paragraphs": ["Industry stakeholders and Treasury officials indicated that many plans  lack partial annuitization options, which means many participants who  have access to an annuity option through their plan must either annuitize  their entire account balance or none of it. Agency officials and industry  stakeholders have said that allowing participants to partially annuitize  their account balance helps participants to combine multiple lifetime  income options and purchase only the amount of annuity that they need.  Partial annuitization also allows participants to purchase an amount of  annuity that makes sense for their situation in consideration of not only  their plan savings but also income sources outside the plan, such as from  Social Security or the resources of a spouse. Research has also shown  that when offered, partial annuitization increases both the percentage of  people who annuitize and the average percentage of balances that are  annuitized. An industry stakeholder noted the increase in the purchase  of annuities through the Federal Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) after partial  annuitization was introduced. When the TSP began in 1986, the annuity  option was an \u201call or nothing\u201d choice. In 2004, TSP amended the plan to  include partial annuitization and saw an increased use of annuities. For  example, although the take up of TSP annuities in general remains low,  more participants annuitized after TSP introduced partial annuitization.  According to the insurer that has been the exclusive annuity provider to  the TSP since its inception, 784 annuities were purchased in 2003.  From 2004 to 2008, after partial annuitization was implemented, the  number of annuity purchases\u2014including partial or full annuitization\u2014 increased to an average of 1,645 per year, a 110 percent increase in the  number of participants annuitizing at least a portion of their account  balances. In addition, the insurer noted that the average purchase  amount of annuities increased 60 percent from $66,000 to $106,000.", "All-or-nothing decisions to annuitize can have adverse effects on  participants. When annuity purchase decisions are framed as an \u201call-or- nothing\u201d choice, most participants will bypass the annuity option and opt  for a lump sum, which does not allow them to benefit from in-plan options  that could help secure lifetime income. On the other hand, industry  stakeholders noted that full annuitization using 100 percent of a plan  account balance may not be suitable because it does not leave savings  that may be necessary for emergencies, such as for healthcare  expenses, or for other purposes, such as bequest motives. Similarly, they  noted that full annuitization may also be inappropriate for most individuals  because they may already have sufficient income through Social Security  and other retirement benefits that provide an annuity benefit, such as a  defined benefit plan.", "DOL is responsible for assisting and educating plan sponsors to help  ensure the retirement security of plan participants. According to a  Treasury fact sheet on retirement security, all-or-nothing choices may  lead many participants to decline a plan\u2019s annuity option, leading some  plan sponsors to perceive participant demand to be low and the option to  be unnecessary. Treasury noted one of its goals is to make it easier for  plans to offer participants a combination of retirement income options that  avoid an all-or-nothing choice. However, 401(k) plans are not required to  offer partial annuitization and our interviews with industry stakeholders  and agency officials indicate that plan sponsors are not incentivized to  offer partial annuitization and may not be aware of the benefits to  participants. Recent collaborations by Treasury and DOL have tried to  encourage plans to allow participants the ability to combine multiple  options to receive their retirement benefits. For example, the actions  taken by Treasury approving the use of QLACs and by DOL facilitating  the use of deferred annuity contracts embedded within a target date fund  have made it easier for plans to offer partial annuitization options.  However, partial annuitization is not encouraged broadly through general  guidance applicable to all 401(k) plans, such as DOL\u2019s Meeting Your  Fiduciary Responsibilities publication. Agency officials have told us that  many plans continue to frame annuity purchases as an \u201call-or-nothing\u201d  choice even though one Treasury official said that there is nothing  prohibiting plans from offering partial annuitization.

Of the 54 plan sponsors responding to our  survey, 39 did not offer an annuity, and 26 of them said their decision was  influenced by the resources required to obtain liability relief. In 2008, DOL  promulgated a \u201csafe harbor\u201d rule that sets out procedures 401(k) plan  sponsors can follow to satisfy their fiduciary duties when selecting an  annuity provider. To obtain fiduciary relief under the safe harbor rule, for  example, plan sponsors must perform an analytical search for annuity  providers and consider the provider\u2019s ability to pay claims in the future, in  addition to the costs and benefits of the annuity. According to the rule,  plan sponsors and other fiduciaries following the safe harbor when  selecting an annuity provider fulfill their fiduciary duty and should,  therefore, not be subject to corporate or personal liability for that  selection.", "Stakeholders we interviewed indicated that the safe harbor for selecting  an annuity provider is not helpful and the primary challenges stem from  the requirements that plan sponsors appropriately:", "Consider information sufficient to assess the ability of the annuity  provider to make all future payments under the annuity contract.", "Conclude that, at the time of the selection, the annuity provider is  financially able to make all future payments under the annuity  contract. Plan sponsors must also periodically review the  appropriateness of the conclusion over time as the provider continues  to issue annuity contracts.", "To facilitate the availability of annuity options in 401(k) plans, the 2005  ERISA Advisory Council Working Group on Retirement Distributions and  Options recommended DOL change sponsor responsibilities for selecting  an annuity provider. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), required  DOL to promulgate regulations clarifying the fiduciary standards  applicable to the selection of an annuity contract as a form of distribution  for a DC plan. In 2007, in the preamble to the proposed safe harbor  rule, developed in response to the PPA requirement, DOL stated that plan  sponsors had frequently cited their fiduciary liability as a reason for not  offering an annuity spend down option. However, by DOL\u2019s own  estimates, the safe harbor was unlikely to make plan sponsors  substantially more willing to offer annuities because it estimated when it  proposed the rule that the safe harbor would increase the share of  participants offered an annuity by only 1 percentage point.", "Assessing the future financial health of an insurer can be a difficult task  for a plan sponsor, and many plan sponsors responding to our survey  indicated they would be more likely to offer an annuity if the benefits of  the safe harbor were more readily attainable. Members of Congress in  both parties introduced legislation that would have, among other things,  amended ERISA to permit plan sponsors and fiduciaries to rely more  heavily on state regulators when selecting an annuity provider.  Additionally, the Director of the Federal Insurance Office told us plan  sponsors should not be expected to look at an insurer\u2019s annual report to  assess its financial liabilities or know more about an insurer than the  research and metrics a rating agency or other entity might make publicly  available. Officials we spoke with at the National Association of Insurance  Commissioners (NAIC) also told us the safe harbor should have verifiable  criteria. For example, the plan sponsors responding to our survey who did  not offer annuities responded that any single criterion provided would  make them more likely to offer them, as shown in table 4.", "DOL is responsible for educating and assisting plan sponsors to help  ensure the retirement security of workers and their families. However, the  annuity selection safe harbor can only translate into increased retirement  security if it is used, and it does not provide sufficiently detailed criteria  that plan sponsors feel they can use to obtain the liability protection it  offers. The safe harbor requires plan sponsors to consider \u201csufficient\u201d  information to \u201cappropriately\u201d reach a conclusion about the annuity  provider\u2019s future solvency without defining the terms \u201csufficient\u201d and  \u201cappropriate.\u201d In 2010, a DOL official told us the agency was considering  addressing industry concerns that plan sponsors have to second-guess  state insurance regulators to assess insurers\u2019 financial viability, and in  2014, DOL published information indicating that it would be developing  proposed amendments to the safe harbor to provide plan fiduciaries with  more certainty that they have discharged their obligations when  contracting to provide an annuity option. DOL officials told us one  advantage of revising the annuity selection safe harbor would be that it  could provide greater clarity for plan sponsors and thus lead to more  annuity options for participants. NAIC officials mentioned a standard  proposed by an association of insurers, which would include, among  other criteria, that the insurer be licensed in at least 26 states. RFI  responses from two participant advocates suggested that annuity  providers should also be licensed in states with strong regulatory  protections. A DOL official told us that because the ERISA standard of  prudence requires plan fiduciaries to exercise some degree of judgement  in making the annuity provider selection, it precludes development of a  simple and easily verifiable checklist.

For example, participants could use a  portion of their savings to purchase an annuity and leave the balance  invested in their plan for a withdrawal option.", "A variety of products and services could be offered in the plan  environment to provide participants with a mix of annuity and withdrawal  options. For example, managed payout funds provide for automated  withdrawals, and annuity providers offer a wide variety of guaranteed  income options. Furthermore, plans can also offer participants access to  an online annuity shopping platform, and with it, comparable information  on multiple products from multiple providers. See Appendix IV for further  details.", "However, there is no agency guidance available to help plan sponsors  minimize their legal risks when offering participants a mix of annuity and  withdrawal options within a plan. The current safe harbor for the selection  of an annuity provider is available to plan sponsors only offering an  annuity product from a single annuity provider. Based on our analysis, a  plan sponsor could increase its risk of legal liability for each option it  offers. For example, a plan sponsor that offers an in-plan annuity  increases its risk by adding withdrawal options. Of the 12 plan sponsors  responding to our survey who did not offer withdrawal options, 8  responded that the fiduciary responsibilities for managing participant  assets in the draw-down phase influenced their decision.", "The results of our record keeper questionnaire indicate that most plan  sponsors are not offering a mix of lifetime income options. In contrast,  plan sponsors are required to diversify the plan investments they offer.  In addition, when 401(k) plans permit participants to exercise control over  their investment choices and, among other things, offer participants a  broad range of investment alternatives, plan sponsors or other fiduciaries  are not liable for any losses that result solely from a participant\u2019s exercise  of that control.", "DOL has not provided an incentive for plan sponsors to provide  participants a mix of lifetime income options and information about them.  EBSA\u2019s mission is to assure the security of the retirement, health, and  other workplace-related benefits of America\u2019s workers and their families,  and without lifetime income options in workplace 401(k) plans, those  benefits may not remain secure throughout retirement. Accordingly, DOL  is engaged in an initiative with Treasury to encourage plan sponsors to  offer prudent lifetime income options. Currently, each additional lifetime  income option plan sponsors offer potentially exposes them to additional  legal risk, unless that option is an annuity selected in a process pursuant  to the safe harbor for annuity selection. DOL has not established a  process plan sponsors can use to prudently select an appropriately  diverse mix of annuity and withdrawal options offered to participants.  Consequently, DOL has not determined the types of products\u2014such as  those on an online annuity shopping platform\u2014that might appropriately  be included in such a mix. DOL officials told us the decision to offer any  lifetime income option is still a fiduciary one, and that even if they  provided such relief, plan sponsors would still have some fiduciary  responsibility associated with providing participants lifetime income.  However, if plan sponsors and others are protected from liability when  participants exercise control choosing among lifetime income options in a  way comparable to how they are protected when participants exercise  control in choosing investments to accumulate retirement savings,  sponsors may be more likely to offer a mix of lifetime income options from  which participants can choose in their plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Plan Sponsors May Cause Participants to Lose Lifetime Income When They Change Record Keepers or Annuity Providers", "paragraphs": ["Another deterrent to plan sponsors offering annuities, according to  representatives of annuity providers, is the possibility of plan participants  having to lose lifetime income guarantees when the plan sponsor  changes service providers. To serve the best interests of participants,  plan sponsors may at times be required to change service providers,  including annuity providers and record keepers. Plan sponsors have a  legal obligation to establish and follow a formal review process at  reasonable intervals to decide whether to continue to use a service  provider or look for replacements. However, lifetime guarantees\u2014 insurance policies offering lifetime income\u2014can be difficult to transfer.", "When participants contribute over time to a guaranteed lifetime income  product such as a deferred income annuity or a GMWB, they are  purchasing both an investment product and a guarantee of lifetime  income. Purchasing an annuity in small amounts over time can have  certain advantages, such as managing interest rate risk (see app V).  When the plan sponsor changes record keepers or annuity providers, the  investment will transfer, but the lifetime income guarantee may not. Some  products might charge a guarantee fee of 1 percent or more every year  and, as such, there is the potential for participants to have committed  substantial resources to the guarantee before losing it due to a service  provider change (see fig. 8). For example, a guarantee fee of 100 basis  points (1 percent) for a GMWB may not be unrealistic. A representative of  one plan sponsor told us that the plan\u2019s Request for Proposals from  401(k) service providers for a GMWB did not return a single bid for less  than 100 basis points per year.", "Representatives of one service provider told us that in general it is difficult  to transfer annuities among annuity providers because it is difficult for  providers to absorb the risk of another provider\u2019s insurance products. For  a product with a lifetime income guarantee to transfer from one record  keeper to another, the new record keeper\u2019s platform must either have the  capacity to support the annuity product, or use third party software to  allow a link to product information on the platform. Representatives of  one annuity provider told us that given the complexities in effectively  managing such a situation and the confusion about whether those efforts  would be successful, many plan sponsors may be reluctant to offer  annuities.", "According to examples provided by industry officials, options needed to  protect participants already exist, whether by refunding, preserving, or  transferring their lifetime income guarantees, and some annuity providers  and record keepers have taken steps to preserve participant benefits  when plans change record keepers or annuity providers. For example, an  association of defined contribution plans\u2019 record keepers has developed  common data standards for tracking annuity products, which are intended  to simplify the transfer of annuity data among record keepers. In another  example, one annuity provider representative offers participants a refund  of fees if they lose their lifetime income guarantee, returning to them  some value that could replace the lost lifetime income. Further, another  annuity provider representative told us his company paid the lifetime  income guaranteed by another annuity provider\u2019s product, effectively  transferring the annuities from provider to provider. An additional  approach to preserving such benefits would be to allow participants to roll  over their 401(k) plan annuity into an IRA version of the annuity provider\u2019s  product in the retail market if it would otherwise be lost. However, such  distributions would move some 401(k) plan benefits while leaving others,  increasing the likelihood of participants having to manage benefits in  multiple places, which we previously reported can be challenging for  participants. Figure 9 shows how steps similar to those already taken by  some providers could preserve participant benefits despite service  provider changes.", "DOL is responsible for educating and assisting plan sponsors to help  ensure the retirement security of workers and their families. Federal  internal control standards also state that management should ensure  there are adequate means of communicating with external stakeholders  that may have a significant impact on an agency achieving its goals.

DOL  officials told us on this subject that some plan fiduciaries may not  examine insurance contract details as closely as the details of investment  vehicles, and in such situations, they need to be more careful. However,  DOL has not issued guidance encouraging plan sponsors to consider  whether a service provider contract ensures future service provider  changes do not cause participants to lose the value of lifetime income  guarantees. While options to prevent lifetime income guarantee loses  may exist, it is not clear how widespread they are in practice. However,  by following such guidance from DOL, plan sponsors could make such  options more widespread by requesting them, and they may be more  willing to allow participants to accumulate in plan annuities in the future, if  they are confident that a service provider change will not amount to a  benefit reduction for participants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Plans\u2019 Access to Annuities May be Limited by Their Record Keeper", "paragraphs": ["Industry stakeholders we interviewed told us that plan sponsor access to  annuity options is often dependent on the options their record keeper  makes available.

However, several industry stakeholders,  including some record keepers, told us that sponsors\u2019 choices of annuity  options may be limited because of cost considerations and business  affiliations.", "Cost. Industry stakeholders told us that, among other things, it is  costly to integrate plan record keeper systems with those of an  insurer, especially for complex and non-standardized annuity products  like GMWBs, which require daily transmittal of information between  systems. In contrast, stakeholders indicated that fixed immediate  annuities may be the least costly annuity option that plan sponsors  can adopt because they are simple and straightforward for record  keepers to implement. Stakeholders also told us that some record  keepers may offer an open record keeping platform that either already  supports competing annuity products or can be customized at the  sponsor\u2019s request to do so. However, a number of record keepers told  us that even for providers that offer an open platform, the process of  integrating the systems for annuity products like GMWBs can be  costly absent strong demand for them from plan sponsors.", "Business affiliation. Industry stakeholders told us that many record  keepers are affiliated with specific insurers, financial service  providers, and investment managers. In such instances, the services  or products offered by their respective affiliates may influence the  annuity products that the record keeper platform supports. Some  stakeholders also told us that financial services companies that are  focused on the retail annuity and investment markets may not want  their affiliated record keeper to make in-plan annuity options available  because their business is either based on or is comprised significantly  of participants rolling over their savings into a retail IRA. Similarly,  some stakeholders indicated that record keepers may not offer  annuities because some record keepers are also investment  managers who may be compensated based on assets managed,  which decrease with annuity purchases. Some stakeholders also said  that insurers that have proprietary annuity products, especially  GMWBs, have an interest in only offering their own products on their  affiliated record keeping platform. As a result, plan sponsors that want  to offer an annuity option generally must choose their record keeper\u2019s  product or forego the option altogether.", "In general, plans\u2019 ability to persuade their record keepers to make annuity  options available can be limited, similar to investment management  services as we previously reported. Industry stakeholders have  indicated that larger sponsors are generally more likely to have the  leverage or resources to persuade their record keeper to support  competing products and services from multiple providers on their  recordkeeping platform. Smaller sponsors may not be able to affect this  change and may need to select a different record keeper to implement  their desired annuity option or forego adopting an annuity option  altogether.

While factors like cost and business affiliation  may prevent some record keepers from supporting a variety of products,  DOL officials told us participants would benefit from their plans having the  ability to access non-proprietary products along with proprietary products.  We previously recommended that DOL provide guidance to plan  sponsors that addresses, among other things, the importance of  considering multiple providers when choosing a managed account  provider, and the importance of requesting from record keepers a choice  of more than one provider.

As participants age, a larger portion of  their assets are devoted to annuities, and at the target date, fund  members receive an annuity that provides lifetime income payments.", "On September 15, 2015, President Obama directed executive branch  agencies to give particular consideration to selecting and setting default  options. One option already in place that can provide a default for  participants in 401(k) plans is the provision of required minimum  distributions (RMD). A plan can be disqualified under the Internal  Revenue Code if they do not follow the RMD provisions. Under these  provisions, participants are required to begin receiving at least minimum  payments starting after the participant retires and reaches the age of 70  \u00bd. RMD calculations based on life expectancy provide lifetime income by  design. Some plan sponsors are willing to administer RMDs as lifetime  income by providing the minimum distribution to the participant in the plan  rather than requiring participants to take a lump sum. As a result,  participants who do not proactively commit to a lifetime income strategy  may still get lifetime income through a plan that complies with RMD  provisions by making distributions on the regulated minimum schedule.  Default income based on RMD provisions can also begin when a  participant retires and is in need of income, even though a distribution is  generally not required until after the participant turns 70 1/2. For example,  the Thrift Savings Plan for federal employees offers a series of monthly  payments computed by the TSP based on IRS life expectancy tables.", "President Obama\u2019s executive order directs agencies to specifically  consider using default options, and RMDs can function as such for  lifetime income. However, DOL does not communicate that the RMD  methodology can be used this way in its Meeting Your Fiduciary  Responsibilities publication. Currently, the only default option for lifetime  income that DOL has formally supported is a deferred annuity, which was  offered by less than 1 percent of the plans represented by record keepers  who responded to our questionnaire. In contrast, many record keepers  already know how to administer RMDs, so DOL could leverage that  experience by providing guidance on how to use the methodology to  produce lifetime income for participants. DOL officials told us they had not  considered this approach and would need time to do so. However,  without leveraging a default that is widely available in plans, few  participants are likely to be impacted, and RMDs are essentially the only  type of distributions that all 401(k) plans are required to make. Unless  DOL begins encouraging plan sponsors to consider providing RMD-based  default income, many retirees who do not select a lifetime income option  may continue to receive a single lump sum payout that may not be used  for lifetime income."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since the enactment of section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code in  1978, 401(k) plans have become the most common retirement savings  vehicle in the United States.

First, most plan  sponsors are unlikely to be equipped to judge the long-term viability of an  insurer, yet they currently must do so under the existing safe harbor.  Providing clearer criteria for making this determination likely would  encourage more sponsors to seek fiduciary relief for offering annuities.  Second, DOL offers fiduciary relief when savings are accumulated in an  appropriate mix of investments, but it offers no such relief for plans  offering a mix of lifetime income options. Extending this relief to plan  sponsors could encourage more plans to make a mix of options available  and, therefore, allow participants to create a better retirement strategy by  selecting and combining annuity and withdrawal options.", "DOL can also provide additional guidance, in its Meeting Your Fiduciary  Responsibilities publication or elsewhere, for fiduciaries as they consider  how their participants\u2019 account balance will translate into retirement  income. DOL guidance can encourage plan sponsors to use a record  keeper that includes annuities from other providers on its record keeping  platform and increase the likelihood the plan sponsor will have access to  annuities that the plan sponsor considers to be in the best interest of the  plan participants. DOL guidance can encourage fiduciaries to offer  participants the option to partially annuitize their account balance,  allowing participants to purchase the amount of guaranteed lifetime  income most appropriate for them. DOL guidance can also help plan  sponsors plan for future service provider changes when offering an  annuity. The fear of causing participants to lose annuity guarantees due  to a service provider switch may cause plan sponsors to stay in a less  than ideal service provider relationship or not offer an annuity. Guidance  can encourage plan fiduciaries to consider whether a lifetime income  contract could cause participants to lose lifetime income guarantees  under such a circumstance before entering into the contract. DOL  guidance can also encourage plan sponsors to provide an expert in  retirement income strategies for participants to talk to about the plan\u2019s  distribution options. Enabling participants to receive advice about in-plan  lifetime income options given their individual circumstances will better  ensure they make retirement income decisions that can be directly  applied to their specific circumstances.", "Lastly, DOL can encourage participants who have not chosen a lifetime  income option at retirement toward income security with defaults. These  participants may be less likely to take advantage of advice when offered.  RMD-based default income can stretch out the account balances of these  participants throughout retirement if sponsors and participants understand  how they can be administered and used. Unless DOL encourages plan  sponsors to consider providing RMD-based default income, many retirees  who do not select a lifetime income option may continue to receive a  single lump sum payout that may not be used for lifetime income."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making seven recommendations to the Secretary of Labor.", "We recommend the Secretary of the Department of Labor (DOL) help  encourage plan sponsors to offer lifetime income options by:  1.

The agencies provided technical comments,  which we have incorporated where appropriate. DOL also provided  written comments, which are reproduced in Appendix VI.", "In its written comments, DOL agreed that today workers face greater  responsibility for managing their assets for retirement, both while  employed and during their retirement years. As we note in our report and  DOL stated in its comments, DOL is committed to continuing to explore  steps to advance lifetime income options in individual account retirement  plans, such as 401(k) plans. DOL expressed reservations about GAO\u2019s  recommendations but described actions consistent with their intent, as  discussed below. Regarding the recommendation to clarify the steps a  plan sponsor must take to assess the long term solvency of an annuity  provider when selecting one in accordance with DOL\u2019s safe harbor, DOL  stated that a clarification might erode consumer protections by degrading  the oversight of fiduciaries making such selections. We commend DOL  for placing a high value on consumer protections and wanting to uphold  the requirements placed on fiduciaries. However, our report notes on  page 26 the relatively challenging process for plan sponsors prudently  offering an in-plan annuity. DOL\u2019s suggested alternative is that the plan  fiduciaries outsource these decisions to a financial institution as an  investment manager under Section 3(38) of ERISA. We agree with DOL  that it has identified a promising strategy, and commend DOL for doing so  transparently. However, this strategy relies on a plan having access to  something rather specific, which is a deferred annuity embedded in a  target date fund. While they may be used more often in the future, as our  report notes on page 52, less than 1 percent of plans covered by our  record keeper survey offered deferred annuities. At this time, we are not  confident that relying on a strategy available to so few plans will  effectively resolve the challenges posed by the current version of the  annuity provider selection safe harbor. While we agree that outsourcing  can bring helpful expertise to the complex fiduciary task of selecting an  insurer, it is not clear whether such a service would be available and  affordable to the bulk of 401(k) plan sponsors. For example, we report on  page 27 that a large consulting firm told us they do not select annuity  providers for plan sponsors because the costs and liability risks of doing  so are prohibitive.", "Regarding the recommendation to consider providing fiduciary relief to  plan fiduciaries offering an appropriate mix of annuity and withdrawal  options, DOL expressed concern that it could shift the responsibility for  annuity selection from the fiduciary to the participant. However, we  believe that a concern is unwarranted, and the change would not  adversely affect participants. DOL already offers certain fiduciary relief  under section 404(c) related to the investments offered under a plan.  Once plans have performed their fiduciary duty in selecting a broad range  of at least three investment alternatives with differing characteristics and  provided participants with educational information on them, the participant  bears the risk of selecting from among them. Analogously, we believe it  would be appropriate for DOL to provide, once plans have exercised their  fiduciary duty to select an appropriate mix of annuity and withdrawal  options, for participants to bear the risk of selecting from among them.  While it raised these concerns, DOL stated in its letter that it is open to  considering alternative regulatory approaches. DOL also noted that it has  an active regulatory agenda but will include the recommendations as part  of its ongoing development and prioritization of its agenda.", "Finally, with respect to the recommendations to provide guidance to  fiduciaries on how the account balances of their participants will translate  into financial security in retirement, DOL stated that it will review its  publications along the lines of the recommendations to explore ways in  which to encourage use of products and arrangements designed to  provide participants and beneficiaries a lifetime income stream after  retirement, and take steps to better educate participants and plan  sponsors about the need to think about retirement savings as lifetime  income. DOL also noted that the Meeting Your Fiduciary Responsibilities  publication may not be the appropriate vehicle for addressing some of the  subject matter in the recommendations. However, the recommendation  also states that DOL could alternatively issue new guidance. We  specifically cited the Meeting Your Fiduciary Responsibilities publication  because it covers a wide range of topics and may reach a wider audience  than other forms of guidance.

The first  survey included questions we provided about participants\u2019 experiences  with lifetime income options offered through their plan and had 5,804  completed responses. The target population of this survey was full-time  workers who participate in a defined contribution plan. The second  survey, with 3,594 completed responses, included questions about  managing retirement savings in multiple accounts. The target population  of this survey was full-time, part-time, and contract workers whose current  employer offers a defined contribution plan.

For the first survey, we estimate that the sampling error is  approximately 1.7 percent at the 95 percent confidence interval. We  estimate that the sampling error for the second survey is 1.5 percent at  the 95 percent confidence interval.

We developed, in consultation with  GAO\u2019s actuaries and an external actuary who has expertise in annuity  pricing, a formula that was calibrated to approximate annuity prices  similar to those found in U.S. retail annuity markets in July 2013.

The systematic withdrawal  strategy is structured to provide a level amount of total inflation- adjusted income when combined with Social Security and annuity  income that is purchased with plan savings. The model and the  systematic withdrawal strategy assume that retirees live to age 100,  unused account balances earn 3 percent real return, and inflation  grows at 2.25 percent per year. The model does not reflect the effect  that actual lifespan, investment returns, and inflation could have on  the illustrated retirement strategy. The model allows users to include  or exclude a fixed immediate annuity based on the age of the  illustrated retiree and purchased from the 401(k) account balance in  the illustration. We obtained annuity prices from an annuity shopping  platform provider who provided averaged quotes across multiple  annuity providers as of January 2016. As such, modeled annuity  prices reflect the pricing available through a platform provider and  differ by gender. Annuities offered inside a 401(k) plan would not  differentiate pricing by gender and may be rated differently than other  market segments.

During this  phase the participant decides how to allocate investment assets among  various options made available. The insurer monitors the participant\u2019s  account value and automatically adjusts or steps-up the benefit base  periodically should additional contributions or investment gains increase  the value of the account. Once a benefit base is stepped up, it typically  does not later decline because of investment losses that may reduce the  participant\u2019s investment account value.

The maximum withdrawal amount that a participant  can take in a year (without incurring a reduction in their benefit base) is  generally calculated as a percentage of the participant\u2019s benefit base at  the time of the first withdrawal. As in the accumulation phase, the  insurance company will typically increase the benefit base if a  participant\u2019s account value, net of withdrawals and fees, increases above  the existing benefit base, which may in turn increase the minimum  insured lifetime income and the maximum withdrawal that the participant  may take without reducing the benefit base.", "Insured: A participant enters the insured phase if their investment  account value has been reduced to zero as a result of withdrawals,  investment losses, or any expenses, fees, or other charges. In such  cases, the participant\u2019s benefit base (the amount to which the withdrawal  percentage is applied) remains unchanged, but the participant\u2019s  investment account value is zero.

Once the insurance company begins paying the  agreed-upon insured payment, the fees that the participant had been  paying for that protection would cease, as would any investment  management and other fees paid for other benefits.

Employers have the potential to  reach large numbers of adults in a cost-effective manner at a place where  they make important financial decisions regarding retirement. Financial  literacy\u2014the ability to use knowledge and skills to manage financial  resources effectively\u2014is becoming increasingly important.", "Participants make decisions about lifetime income options in the same  plan environment in which they have become accustomed to making  decisions to accumulate savings, (e.g., on the plan website or by  submitting a form). The authors of a report on lifetime income options  noted that by simplifying the steps needed to select and combine lifetime  income options, plan sponsors can help participants overcome inertia to  make complex retirement planning decisions about their retirement  income strategies. One way to do this is to integrate the selection of  lifetime income options into the routine tasks participants may perform.  For example, each time participants change their investment allocation  using a plan website designed by one record keeper we interviewed, they  are also given the option to invest some of their savings in a fund that will  gradually and automatically turn into a guaranteed minimum withdrawal  benefit (GMWB) as the participant nears retirement. In a second example,  a managed account service provider told us participants can typically  implement their recommendations on a plan\u2019s lifetime income options at  the click of a button.", "In-plan annuities can be offered as an investment option purchased in  smaller amounts over time as the participant nears retirement. For  example, more than 44 percent of the mid-size 401(k) plans represented  in our record keeper questionnaire that adopted GMWBs allow  participants to purchase those benefits over time through periodic  contributions. Figure 18 shows how purchasing annuities in this way can  help participants address, for example, the risk of purchasing a single,  large annuity when interest rates might be unfavorably low (\u201cinterest rate  risk\u201d). Breaking up annuity purchases into smaller amounts can also help  participants address the hesitation associated with a single, large  purchase. For example, one independent financial adviser told us splitting  up annuity purchases helps build her clients\u2019 comfort with the idea of  annuitizing a modest portion of their retirement savings. It also gives them  time to react to changes in their health or financial status that could  change their need for annuitization."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Protections of In-Plan Options", "paragraphs": ["Most plan sponsors we surveyed cited the potential regulatory protections  provided through ERISA as an additional advantage of in-plan lifetime  income options. We have reported on these protections, including the  requirement that plan fiduciaries act solely in the interest of plan  participants and beneficiaries for the exclusive purpose of providing plan  benefits and defraying the expense of plan administration. Other  protections, as shown in table 7, include the selection and monitoring of  appropriate investment options and holding down and clearly disclosing  fees.", "Plan sponsors can typically obtain lower fees for lifetime income options.  We have reported that participants generally pay lower fees through their  plan than they would on their own because plan sponsors can use  participants\u2019 combined savings to negotiate with service providers. An  industry report noted this may benefit participants with smaller balances  because in a 401(k) plan, all participants typically pay the same relative  costs, such as the same annual fee as a percentage of their investment in  a lifetime income option. According to a study of lifetime income options,  under certain conditions participants who remain invested in their plan  can increase retirement income from certain withdrawal options by more  than 20 percent after 20 years. Industry stakeholders also reported that  in-plan annuities are generally less expensive than their retail-market  counterparts in part because plan sponsors can reduce or eliminate the  commissions paid to make annuities available for sale on an individual  basis. Representatives of one 401(k) plan told us that in-plan, they could  access an annuity product for their participants at less than half the cost  of comparable retail options. According to one association of insurance  and financial services companies, assets covered by an in-plan  guarantee totaled $3.6 billion in 2014, while retail annuity sales that same  year totaled more than $235 billion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Product Variety, Gender Pricing and Consolidation in 401(k) Plans", "paragraphs": ["Several industry stakeholders reported that retail annuity markets offer a  wider variety of options than are available for use in 401(k) plans.  Additionally, retail versions of annuities may have more sophisticated  features than those available as in-plan options. One insurance company  explained how the retail version of a GMWB they offer allows individuals  to \u201clock in\u201d positive investment returns on a daily basis. However, this  feature was too complicated for the in-plan version, which instead only  allows participants to lock in investment gains once a year. Similarly, one  researcher told us the withdrawal options currently available to  participants may not be sophisticated enough to adapt to fluctuating  investment returns and other changes in a participant\u2019s circumstances.  One managed account service provider we interviewed told us the service  can help participants develop more responsive withdrawal strategies that  change from year to year depending on participants\u2019 circumstances.", "However, as we reported in 2015, managed account services still  represent a small, if growing, portion of the 401(k) market.", "We have also reported that annuity pricing in 401(k) plans may create  instances where male participants are better off purchasing an annuity in  retail markets rather than through their plan. Retail annuities typically  vary based on gender. As a result, men, who tend not to live as long as  women, can generally secure higher monthly payments from an annuity  than women with otherwise similar characteristics. In contrast, annuities  offered in 401(k) plans must be priced on a gender-neutral basis. This  requirement stems from a Supreme Court decision ruling that employers  sponsoring plans offering annuities that make smaller monthly payments  to women than to men violate a ban on gender-based employment  discrimination. According to Treasury officials and researchers, the  effects of gender on in-plan annuity prices may be offset by other factors  such as the plan sponsor\u2019s ability to negotiate lower fees. One researcher  added that the potential effects of an annuitant\u2019s gender on the pricing of  in-plan annuities is also limited because prices for opposite sex joint and  survivor annuities take into account both male and female longevity and  so are priced more similarly in institutional and retail markets.", "Participants may also have trouble consolidating multiple 401(k) accounts  to manage their retirement savings from a single account. As evidenced  by our survey of defined contribution plan participants in coordination with  a research firm, a vast majority of participants are likely to accumulate  more than one account over their career. The majority of participants we  surveyed reported they would likely pay for a service that consolidates  their accounts into their current plan if their plan sponsor offered one.", "Almost all participants we surveyed would view such a service as a  valuable benefit if their plan sponsor made it available, as compared with  other workplace benefits they might receive (see fig. 19)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the U.S. Department of Labor", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": ["Charles Jeszeck, (202) 512-7215 or jeszeckc@gao.gov."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Tamara Cross (Assistant  Director), Tom Moscovitch and Ted Leslie (Analysts-in-Charge), and  David Lin made key contributions to this report.
