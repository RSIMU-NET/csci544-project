This report: (1) describes trends in the number of corporate tax expenditures and estimated corporate revenue losses since 1986; (2) describes the use of corporate tax expenditures in 2011; and (3) compares the size of corporate tax expenditures to federal spending by budget function and, for tax expenditures used only by corporations, identifies spending programs with similar purposes. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed Department of the Treasury estimates of tax expenditure revenue losses from 1986 to 2011 and Internal Revenue Service 2010 data and interviewed agency officials. GAO also reviewed the legislative history and relevant studies to determine the reported purpose of corporate-only tax expenditures, and searched federal program lists to identify federal spending programs that appear to share a reported specific purpose similar to corporate-only tax expenditures. The programs identified as related were not reviewed by the agencies responsible for the programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Estimated tax revenue that the federal government forgoes resulting from corporate tax expenditures increased over the past few decades as did the total number of corporate tax expenditures. In 2011, the Department of the Treasury estimated 80 tax expenditures resulted in the government forgoing corporate tax revenue totaling more than $181 billion. Many of these tax expenditures are broadly available to both corporate and individual taxpayers. More than twothirds or 56 of the 80 tax expenditures used by corporations in 2011 were also used by individual taxpayers, such as other types of businesses not organized as corporations. Modifying any of these 56 tax expenditures as part of broader corporate tax reform would likely affect both corporate and individual taxpayers to some degree.", "Corporate tax expenditures span a majority of federal mission areas, but their relative size differs across budget functions. The 80 corporate tax expenditures had estimated revenue losses in 12 of the 18 budget functions in 2011. Of the $181 billion in estimated corporate tax revenue losses, 81 percent was concentrated in the international affairs and housing and commerce budget functions, exceeding federal outlays in those budget functions. The 24 tax expenditures used only by corporations in 2011 provide support intended to encourage certain activities, such as energy production, or provide support for certain entity types, such as credit unions. A corporate tax expenditure may have multiple purposes: one narrowly focused on a specific activity or entity as well as broader or additional purposes pursuing national priorities or other activities. For example, 7 of the 24 corporate-only tax expenditures are aimed at encouraging or supporting specific energy sources and technologies, and these tax expenditures may also have broader national purposes such as promoting domestic energy production and energy security. In examining their narrowly focused reported purposes, one-third of the 24 corporate-only tax expenditures appear to share a similar purpose with at least one federal spending program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO made no recommendations in this report.

Estimated corporate revenue losses represent the  amount of revenue the federal government forgoes as a result of  corporate tax expenditures. Tax expenditures play a central role in a  number of Congress\u2019s and the administration\u2019s proposals for corporate  tax reform. Discussion regarding corporate tax reform has involved  modifying or repealing certain tax expenditures as a way to broaden the  corporate tax base and using the resulting revenue gains to offset  reduced revenue from lowering the corporate income tax rate. However,  there is little agreement on how much corporate tax rates should be  reduced; which tax expenditures should be repealed or modified to offset  such a rate cut; and what, if any, changes would be made to the  individual income tax system to account for other types of business  organizations and individual taxpayers that claim the same tax  expenditures as corporations.", "Corporate tax expenditures cover a wide range of federal policy goals and  may have one or more purposes that are also pursued by federal  spending programs.

We  aggregated estimated corporate and individual revenue losses and also  identified the number of tax expenditures with only estimated corporate  revenue losses, those with both corporate and individual revenue losses,  and those with only individual revenue losses.", "To describe the use of corporate tax expenditures, including the number  of taxpayers claiming corporate-only tax expenditures, we analyzed  Treasury revenue loss estimates for 2011 for corporate and individual  taxpayer groups. We defined corporate tax expenditures as those that Treasury reported had estimated revenue losses for corporations in 2011;  we describe any tax expenditures that Treasury estimated lost only  corporate tax revenue in 2011 as corporate-only tax expenditures. We  also obtained, where available, estimates from the Internal Revenue  Service (IRS) Statistics of Income (SOI) 2010 corporate sample on the  number of corporate taxpayers claiming certain tax expenditures. These  were the most recent estimates available at the time of our work.  Similarly, we obtained publicly available fiscal year 2010 data from IRS\u2019s  Tax Exempt and Government Entities division on certain corporate tax  expenditures. To assess the reliability of the data and estimates, we  reviewed agency documentation, interviewed agency officials, and  reviewed our prior reports that have used the data and estimates. While  we determined that the Treasury and IRS data and estimates were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes, the IRS SOI corporate sample may  not provide a precise estimate of the number of taxpayers claiming a tax  expenditure when the number of taxpayers is very small.", "To compare corporate tax expenditures to federal spending by budget  function, we summed the estimated revenue losses of corporate tax  expenditures and compared them to federal outlays by budget function for  2011. To identify spending programs with reported purposes similar to  corporate-only tax expenditures in 2011, we first identified the reported  purpose of those tax expenditures by reviewing their legislative histories,  our prior work, as well as work by the Congressional Research Service  (CRS) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that discussed the tax  expenditures.

The corporate-only tax expenditures may have broader or  additional purposes beyond the narrow reported purposes we identified.  We used the narrow reported purposes as they allowed us to identify the  tax and nontax programs that appear to most closely support the activity  or entity the corporate-only tax expenditures support. We then searched  the 2012 Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) to identify  federal spending programs that appear to share a similar reported  purpose based on the CFDA\u2019s program descriptions.

However, as both Treasury and the Joint Committee on Taxation note,  the benefits and outcomes from the tax expenditure may be intended to  ultimately benefit people other than the direct recipients of the tax  expenditure. To the extent that a tax expenditure leads to changes in the  prices of particular goods or services, wages, or returns on investment,  consumers, employees, or shareholders may see benefits that they  otherwise would not have received.

In  addition, we have long reported that, once enacted, tax expenditures and  their relative contributions toward achieving federal missions and goals  are often less visible than spending programs, which are subject to a  more systematic review of performance, including results.

Using a broader purpose for this tax expenditure  would likely increase the number of federal spending programs identified  that have a similar purpose. For example, our prior work on renewable  energy identified nearly 700 federal initiatives related to renewable  energy, including the bio-diesel and small agri-biodiesel producer tax  credits. Applying an even broader national purpose, such as  encouraging domestic energy production, could further increase the  number of federal spending programs, as well as other federal activities,  such as federal regulations and tax expenditures, which may share a  similar purpose.
