This report examines: 1) GSA's efforts to reform its delegated leasing program; 2) the extent to which GSA assesses agencies' policies, procedures, and performance in managing their delegated leasing activities; and 3) the extent to which GSA ensures delegated leases meet requirements. GAO reviewed federal statutes and regulations, and GSA's guidance and data on delegated leases. To illustrate how GSA approves and oversees delegated leases, GAO judgmentally reviewed 17 delegated leases selected to include lease contract value, type of lease, and agencies with high number of delegated leases.

For example, GSA created GSA's Real Estate Exchange (G-REX) to centralize delegated lease requests and approvals, but GAO found G-REX had incorrect information on lease rental values and rates\u2014reporting rates 12 times higher than they actually were. Moreover, GAO found that GSA was not annually reconciling data between G-REX and the government-wide real property database, per GSA's own procedures. GSA officials said that their past efforts to fully reconcile the data were unsuccessful but acknowledged there may be ways to compare the data to improve the reliability of both datasets. Until GSA clarifies what it can do to partially reconcile the data sets, it is not obtaining the intended benefits of this data validation exercise.", "GSA does not know if agencies have the ability to manage their delegated leasing activities because it does not regularly assess their policies and procedures, or their performance in meeting GSA's management goals, such as avoiding extensions. GSA procedures state that GSA will consider the agency's organizational structure and ability to meet certain GSA performance measures prior to granting requests for delegated leasing authority. Moreover, federal internal control standards call for agencies to design control activities to better manage the program. However, GSA officials said that GSA relies on the agencies to oversee their own delegated leases. Nevertheless, GAO found instances of inadequate policies and procedures at one agency in managing its delegated leasing activities. Further, all 4 agencies had delegated leases that were in holdover status (occupying a space beyond the expiration of the lease term), which violates program requirements. Because GSA does not regularly assess agencies' procedures or performance, it cannot ensure that agencies are effectively managing their delegated leasing activities.", "GSA cannot ensure that the leases agencies execute under delegated authority meet program requirements and are within the authority granted because it lacks key procedures to do so. GAO found that GSA had only reviewed 1 percent of the post lease award documents agencies had submitted, and in some cases, agencies had not submitted required documentation. GSA officials said the agencies are responsible for ensuring that documents are submitted and requirements are met. However, a risk-based assessment of a selection of delegated leases' post award documents can provide assurances that agencies comply with existing regulations and prevent potential fraud, waste, and abuse. Because GSA did not have a process to systematically review these documents, GSA is unable to ensure that delegated leases meet requirements and that agencies are positioned to prevent fraud, waste, or abuse."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that GSA (1) reconcile its databases; (2) regularly assess agency procedures for managing delegated leasing, (3) track agency performance, and (4) develop a review process for post lease award documents.

GSA  leases space in 8,681 buildings or other assets and maintains a total  inventory of more than 370 million square feet of workspace for 1.1 million  federal employees, plus support contractors. In addition, GSA may  delegate its leasing authority to other agencies if GSA determines it is in  the government\u2019s best interest. Currently, GSA has delegated such  authority to 18 departments and independent government offices, which  have used this authority to execute an additional 5,600 delegated leases,  at a total annual rent of about $985 million. When GSA delegates its  leasing authority to other agencies, GSA is still responsible for overseeing  the overall delegated leasing program. When not properly managed,  delegated leases run the risk of not being cost effective for the federal  government. In 2007, we and the GSA Office of the Inspector General  (OIG) identified problems with the delegated leasing program, such as  excessive rental rates and insufficient documentation to support that the  government received a fair and reasonable price. GSA responded to our  recommendations by instituting reforms to enhance its management and  oversight of the delegated leasing program.", "You asked us to review GSA\u2019s delegated leasing program, including  reforms made and remaining challenges. This report examines: (1) the  efforts GSA has made to reform its delegated leasing program since  2007; (2) the extent to which GSA assesses agencies\u2019 policies,  procedures, and performance in managing their overall delegated leasing  activities; and (3) the extent to which GSA ensures leases procured with  GSA\u2019s delegated authority meet requirements.", "To assess the efforts GSA has made to reform its delegated leasing  program since 2007, we reviewed prior GSA and GAO reports on this  program, GSA regulations, policies, and manuals related to the program,  particularly those issued since 2007. We reviewed the development of  GSA\u2019s Real Estate Exchange (G-REX)\u2014GSA\u2019s tool to track the lease  delegation application and approval process and store key post award  documents. To determine if the G-REX data for fiscal year 2016 to fiscal  year 2018 were reliable, we looked for outliers and incomplete data. We  also compared the G-REX data with the Federal Real Property Profile  (FRPP) Management System, which is the government-wide real property  database administered by GSA that includes data on all federally  occupied spaces, including those leased using delegated authority from  GSA, to understand if delegated leases in G-REX matched FRPP annual  data for a selection of delegated leases, as described below. While we  note some data quality issues with G-REX in our report, we concluded  that the G-REX data are sufficiently reliable for our purposes of reporting  the number of lease extensions and the number of leases reviewed by  GSA. We also interviewed GSA officials on their reforms and data  validation efforts.

We compared these methods to GSA\u2019s  procedures for overseeing the delegated leasing program and federal  internal control standards on designing control activities. We selected the  design of a control environment principle because it related to GSA\u2019s  ability to review agencies\u2019 procedures for managing their delegated  leasing activities.", "To determine the extent to which GSA ensures delegated leases meet  requirements, we assessed GSA\u2019s process for reviewing post award  documents by reviewing GSA policy and internal procedures documents  and comparing GSA\u2019s process for reviewing post award documents  against these documented procedures. Specifically, we determined  whether GSA had a process in place to review post award documents  submitted to ensure that delegated leases met requirements and were  free of fraud, waste, and abuse. We compared GSA\u2019s process to leading  practices we previously identified on managing fraud risk.", "In addition, for all three objectives, we selected a non-probability sample  of 17 delegated leases to provide an illustration of how GSA has  implemented its policies and procedures for the delegated leasing  program. We selected 10 of these leases from G-REX from fiscal year  2016 to fiscal year 2018, and 7 from the FRPP. We selected the 17  leases based on the following criteria: delegated lease authority requests granted since January 1, 2016;  leases with relatively high total rent amounts;  leases from agencies that had a high numbers of delegated leases;  and  the type of authority used for the lease (preferring general purpose  lease delegations since they are the most common).", "In addition, for the 7 FRPP leases, we selected delegated leases with  start dates of January 1, 2016 or later to improve the probability of  being able to find the lease in G-REX, since many older leases were  not recorded in G-REX.", "For these 17 delegated leases, we reviewed supporting documentation  and attempted to match lease data found in G-REX with the same lease  in FRPP. Regarding these 17 delegated leases, we interviewed the four  agencies that had requested the associated delegation of leasing  authority: the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA); the Department of  the Interior (DOI) (one of our selected delegated leases was from the  Bureau of Land Management (BLM)); the Department of Veterans Affairs  (VA); and the Department of Commerce (Commerce), (one of our  selected delegated leases was from the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)). We reviewed selected agencies\u2019  procedures and methods for collecting and compiling documentation  supporting delegated leases. We reviewed documentation agencies are  required to upload after awarding the delegated lease and how GSA  reviewed the supporting documentation to determine its sufficiency. We  also interviewed GSA officials responsible for reviewing delegated leasing  authority requests for our selected leases.

In 2007, GSA issued new requirements for the delegated  leasing program in the FMR Bulletin 2008-B1 (2008 Bulletin). For  example, the 2008 Bulletin instructed GSA and the agencies on the  proper submission of documents to GSA; and required agencies to have  an organizational structure in place to support the delegation of authority,  and to ensure compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and GSA  directives governing the lease acquisition.", "In 2014, GSA began using a new electronic system\u2014G-REX\u2014to review  and process applications for delegations of leasing authority.

These data quality issues affect GSA\u2019s ability to monitor its  delegated leasing program. First, we found that when information is  compiled, the G-REX system overstates the total delegated lease  contract values by 12 times higher than they actually were for every  delegated lease in the G-REX system. This occurred because it multiplied  annual rents by the number of months of the lease, instead of by the  number of years. For example, for a lease with an annual rent of  $2,300,000 and a lease term of 48 months, the calculated total contract  value was $110,400,000 instead of the $9,200,000 total contract value it  should have had for the 4 year lease. GSA officials confirmed this error  and corrected it during the course of our review. Second, we also found  data errors in G-REX resulting in approved delegated leasing projects  with annual rental rates higher than they actually were. For example, we  found a data entry within G-REX for an approved delegated lease with a  total lease rental rate several times higher than the average annual rent  rate. After reviewing the lease file, GSA officials confirmed that the rental  rate was incorrectly entered by the user into G-REX. We also found two  G-REX data entries for approved delegated leasing projects with 25 year  lease terms. General purpose delegated leases can only be for terms of  up to 20 years. GSA officials confirmed that both identified leases were  within the authorized delegated leasing parameters but that the data  entries were inaccurate due to a system error within G-REX that  incorrectly calculated the renewal options.", "GSA officials said that they are aware of some data quality issues with  the G-REX system and are working to address them in an updated  version, which they plan to launch later in 2019. Officials said that the  new version of G-REX will include more business rules to prevent missing  data and identify anomalies. Further, uploading required post award  documents is not currently a mandatory action in G-REX. Instead, G-REX  sends automatic reminder emails to agencies if these documents have  not been uploaded. To address this issue, GSA officials said that the new  version of G-REX would improve the post award document upload  process.

GSA officials stated that while they  could identify certain specific discrepancies between FRPP and G-REX,  conducting a full reconciliation of the two databases has many degrees of  complexity. Specifically, G-REX does not include all delegated leases, in  part, because not all existing delegated leases migrated into G-REX from  the prior GSA leasing system. In addition, GSA officials said FRPP and  G-REX do not directly match because each database serves different  purposes. Specifically, FRPP is a single comprehensive database that  contains information on federal real property worldwide, updated  annually. In contrast, G-REX is considered a business process  management software application and is primarily used by GSA to  process and capture lease delegation applications, according to GSA  officials.

Moreover, although FRPP data quality could be improved,  FRPP can still provide reliable background information on GSA\u2019s federal  real property portfolio.

However, the 2014 Bulletin does not explicitly state GSA  will perform a full reconciliation. GSA could partially reconcile G-REX and  FRPP by doing some cross-data comparison. For example, had GSA  cross-verified G-REX and FRPP data, even on a case-by-case basis, it  could have potentially caught and addressed the data quality issues we  found in G-REX earlier. Some comparison of G-REX with the relevant  data in FRPP could improve the reliability, and thereby the usefulness, of  both data sets. For example, GSA officials said that GSA could, in theory,  begin comparing leases reported in FRPP as being awarded with  delegated authority against G-REX\u2019s record of delegated leases. A partial  reconciliation like this could identify leases possibly acquired without  delegated leasing authority or other data quality issues and GSA could  then take steps to increase the reliability of the G-REX data.

Instead, GSA  officials said that they expect agencies to have the capacity to manage  their delegated leases until evidence suggests otherwise and said GSA  assesses agencies\u2019 activities on an ad hoc basis. For example, GSA  officials said that GSA audited USDA and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)  because of tips from outside sources. Agencies requesting a delegation  of leasing authority must submit, among other things, an organizational  structure and staffing plan to support the delegation that identifies trained  and experienced staff to support delegated leasing activities.", "In our review, we found that not all selected agencies had sufficient  policies and procedures to manage their own delegated leases. For  example, GSA\u2019s ad hoc review of USDA\u2019s delegated leases found  significant oversight issues. Specifically, GSA found that USDA had  awarded seven leases without a delegation of authority. In addition,  USDA was unable to locate the executed lease for one of the delegated  leases we reviewed. USDA officials said the agency has learned from  experiences like this one and is currently developing better policies and  procedures to prevent this from happening again. For example, USDA  has centralized leasing oversight between two bureaus and plans to  annually review selected delegated leases. Moreover, GSA\u2019s ad hoc  review of BIA\u2019s delegated leases found that BIA had also leased property  without delegated authority. Further, GSA\u2019s 2012 audit of post award  documents found that BIA had some delegated leases that had expired,  and some exceeded the space threshold of 19,999 square feet. As a  result of its review, GSA did not grant BIA any new delegated leasing  authority until its OIG completed its findings and BIA responded with a  corrections plan that corrected these deficiencies, according to GSA.", "GSA\u2019s 2014 Bulletin states that GSA will review the adequacy of the  requesting agency\u2019s organizational structure and staffing proposed for the  delegation; and whether the requesting agency has complied with all  applicable laws, executive orders, regulations, OMB Circulars, and  reporting requirements under previously authorized delegated leases.  Further, according to federal standards for internal control, management  should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks.  Control activities are the actions management establishes through  policies and procedures to achieve objectives and respond to risks in the  internal control system. Accordingly, agencies with delegated leasing  authority should have an appropriate organizational structure and  effective policies and procedures to support the delegation and to ensure  compliance with applicable laws and other requirements, both of which  help agencies manage their delegated leasing activities.", "If GSA had designed control activities to regularly review each agency\u2019s  policies and procedures for managing its delegated leases, GSA officials  could have known earlier that an agency lacked the ability to manage its  delegated leases and possibly delayed granting additional delegations of  leasing authority until the agency had demonstrated their ability to  manage its delegated leasing activities. GSA officials said assessing an  agency\u2019s policies and procedures to manage delegated leasing activities  when reviewing the agency\u2019s individual application for a delegation of  leasing authority is not practical. GSA officials noted that it would become  a repetitive and unproductive process to review an agency\u2019s policies and  procedures each time they applied for delegated leasing authority as the  same agencies are requesting delegated leasing authority for many  leases and an agency\u2019s policies and procedures would not change with  each new application. However, GSA could assess agencies\u2019 policies and  procedures for managing delegated leasing activities at regular intervals,  such as annually or biennially. Because GSA is not following its own  procedures set out in the 2014 Bulletin, or designing control activities that  would allow it to assess, at regular intervals, agencies\u2019 ability to manage  their own delegated leasing activities, GSA cannot ensure that it is  providing this authority to agencies that can manage it effectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GSA Does Not Track Agencies\u2019 Performance in Meeting GSA Management Goals", "paragraphs": ["GSA does not track agencies\u2019 performance toward meeting GSA\u2019s  management goals, which is inconsistent with the 2014 Bulletin and GSA  policy. GSA has three key management goals for tracking the success of  the delegated leasing program:  1.  Delegated leases should have lease rates that are at or below private  sector rates over half the time, according to GSA\u2019s annual  performance plan. The 2014 Bulletin states that, prior to granting the  agency\u2019s request for a leasing delegation, GSA will consider the  demonstrated ability of the requesting agency to meet or exceed this  published performance measure for the cost of leased space, among  other things.  2.  Delegated leases should not extend into holdover status. The 2014  Bulletin states that a lease in holdover status, or an agency occupying  a building or space with no lease because it has expired, is in violation  of the lease delegation authority.   3.  Delegated leases should not be extended unless necessary to avoid a  holdover. GSA\u2019s leasing desk guide states that short-term lease  extensions should only be used as a last resort because they typically  cost more, among other reasons.", "The post award documents that agencies submit into G-REX do not allow  GSA to track agencies\u2019 performance in meeting these management  goals. For example, G-REX does not calculate when lease rates are at or  below private sector rates. GSA officials said that GSA does not track the  performance of agencies with delegated leasing authority against these  three management goals because it is primarily the agencies\u2019  responsibility to ensure they meet them. However, the four agencies with  delegated leases that we reviewed did not always meet GSA\u2019s three  goals.", "Officials from two of the agencies we interviewed said that they were  unaware of GSA\u2019s performance cost metric for negotiating lease rates at  or below private sector rates or that it applied to delegated leases.  Consequently, the agency officials did not know if they met it. Since  neither G-REX nor the agencies with delegated authority track lease rates  in this way, GSA does not know if agencies are meeting GSA\u2019s  performance cost metric or, more simply stated, if agencies are  negotiating cost-effective lease rates.", "Regarding holdovers, we found all four agencies in our review were  experiencing holdovers, which raises questions about how effective their  policies are to prevent them. For example, USDA does not use its lease  expiration data in an effective manner to track expiring leases to submit  lease delegation applications, according to GSA\u2019s audit of USDA  delegated leases. Consequently, USDA had one quarter (1,100 of 4,000)  of its delegated leases in holdover status in the past 24 months,  according to the GSA report. Furthermore, according to our analysis of  agency data, all four selected agencies have expired delegated leases  where the agency either has a standstill agreement with the landlord, or is  simply in holdover status. For example, VA had approximately 10  percent of its delegated leases in holdover status in fiscal year 2018.", "Regarding extensions, according to G-REX data, almost half of all  approved delegated lease authority requests from fiscal year 2016 to  fiscal year 2018 were for lease extensions, which goes against GSA\u2019s  goals. Officials from three of the four agencies in our review said that they  use extensions because they need more time to develop the agency\u2019s  space need requirements for a new delegated lease, and they might not  have the time to do so before the current delegated lease\u2019s expiration  date. GSA staff stated that if an agency has a large number of  extensions or holdovers, it denotes that the agency may not be  monitoring its leases and as a result is not fully aware of expiring  delegated leases. Tenant agencies agree that lease extensions are often  not in the best financial interest of the federal government because they  are not open to competition, according to this previous work. For  example, the USDA\u2019s delegated lease site in Coquille, Oregon was  extended without competition for 45 years. USDA officials agreed this  was not in the best financial interest of the federal government and that  delegated leases should be opened for competition after 20 years.", "Lease extensions and expired leases in holdover or standstill status are  inefficient and costly for the federal government for two reasons. First,  without competition among landlords, an agency may be unable to meet  the goal of negotiating a lease rate at or below the private sector rate.  Second, we have previously reported that the short-term nature of  holdovers and standstill agreements creates uncertainties, which can  make it challenging for agencies to plan and budget for space needs and  difficult for lessors to secure financing. Moreover, we have reported that  holdovers can create an adversarial relationship with building owners,  prompt concerns about an agency\u2019s portfolio management, and create  unnecessary uncertainty for relevant stakeholders. We also noted that  holdovers and standstills occur for a variety of reasons, including  challenges finalizing space requirements, tenant agency labor shortages,  and the sometimes lengthy duration of the leasing process.", "Absent procedures to regularly track the performance of agencies with  delegated leasing authority to ensure cost effectiveness and limit the use  of extensions, holdovers, and standstill agreements, GSA cannot ensure  that these agencies are meeting the management goals of the delegated  leasing program. When previously reviewing GSA\u2019s management of its  own portfolio, we found that tracking and monitoring several measures  over the life cycle of the lease acquisition process may help reduce the  overall number of holdovers and extensions. For example, using a  tracking tool to alert management of delegated leases approaching their  expiration date could help to reduce the reliance on extensions and to  prevent holdovers and standstill agreements. Regularly tracking agencies\u2019  ability to meet key management goals would alert GSA to holdovers and  heavy use of extensions that are not cost effective and may warrant  additional oversight."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GSA Cannot Ensure That Individual Delegated Leases Met Requirements", "paragraphs": ["GSA requires that agencies submit an acquisition plan for their lease  when requesting delegated leasing authority, but GSA does not  systematically ensure that the subsequently executed leases follow those  plans and meet program requirements. Agencies submit an acquisition  plan along with other documents in order to request delegated leasing  authority. GSA officials told us that they review requests for delegated  leasing authority by verifying that all required information and documents  are uploaded into G-REX and that a lease consistent with the acquisition  plan would meet program requirements. GSA officials noted, however,  that the acquisition plan is strictly a planning tool and that the terms and  conditions are subject to change when finalizing the lease. When  approving a request for delegated leasing authority, GSA issues an  executive summary and approval letter to the agency identifying the  parameters of the leasing authority delegated, such as space limits.", "Once the agency with delegated leasing authority awards the lease, the  agency is required to upload to G-REX certain post award documentation,  including the executed lease, within 30 days. These documents provide  insight on final lease terms such as square footage, lease expiration date  and cost, which may differ from the acquisition plans agencies submitted  when applying for delegated leasing authority.", "We have previously identified risk-based assessment and mitigation as  leading practices for providing assurances to managers that they are  complying with existing legislation, regulations, and standards and  effectively preventing, detecting, and responding to potential fraud, waste,  and abuse. Assessing a selection of delegated leases\u2019 post award  documents could serve as an early warning system for managers to help  mitigate or promptly resolve issues through corrective actions and ensure  compliance with existing legislation, regulations, and standards.", "However, GSA officials said that they do not have a process in place to  systematically review post award documents from delegated leases to  determine whether the lease awarded met program requirements and  were within the authority granted in the approval letter. We found that as  of November 2018, GSA had reviewed approximately one percent of the  post award documents agencies submitted into G-REX, according to G- REX data. GSA officials told us they had not developed a system for  reviewing post award documents because GSA views it as primarily the  responsibility of the agency with the delegated authority to ensure they  comply with the 2014 Bulletin\u2019s post award requirements. Further,  according to GSA officials, GSA\u2019s primary role in the lease delegation  process is to review and approve requests for delegated leasing authority.  As a result, GSA officials have determined that regularly reviewing post  award documents is not the best use of their already constrained  resources. However, GSA\u2019s reliance on agencies to comply with all  requirements absent any mechanism to ensure post award accountability  could allow agencies to lease space outside of the delegated authority  granted to them. GSA\u2019s previously mentioned, ad hoc audits of USDA  and BIA delegated leases reinforced the need for strengthened oversight  to ensure that leases meet requirements, as both audits found problems.  For example, the DOI\u2019s OIG confirmed in 2014 GSA\u2019s findings that BIA  approved $32.7 million in delegated lease agreements that exceeded  GSA square footage and purchase approval limits.", "GSA\u2019s review of USDA\u2019s delegated leases also found that approximately  540 lease files were missing the awarded lease documents in G-REX. In  addition, the review found that no file, in its sample of 27 lease files, had  all the required documents uploaded in G-REX. Furthermore, among  our selected delegated leases, we found instances of agencies not  uploading post award documents to G-REX after the lease was awarded.  For example, one delegated lease file in our sample was still missing the  executed lease over 2 years after the lease was signed. If post award  documents are not uploaded as required, GSA may not even have the  documentation necessary to determine if a delegated lease met program  requirements and was within the authority granted.", "Even if all post award documents are uploaded, GSA still cannot verify  that the leases were executed within the parameters of the granted  delegated leasing authority and in accordance with program requirements  without a systematic process for reviewing post award documentation.  For example, as noted above, if GSA assessed a selection of delegated  leases\u2019 post award documents, it may have identified the missing  executed lease and other deficiencies noted above and been able to  notify the agency. Further, GSA cannot ensure that agencies are  preventing fraud, waste, or abuse."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["GSA oversees the delegated leasing program and is a guarantor of the  government\u2019s monetary obligations under a delegated lease in the event  of default. However, if not properly managed, delegated leases run the  risk of not being cost effective for the federal government. GSA has taken  some actions to address previously identified issues with the program, but  its current oversight and management of the program is compromised by  a lack of key processes that make it unable to ensure the program is  working as intended.", "Because GSA has not determined how to reasonably reconcile G-REX  and FRPP data, pursuant to its own procedure, it is missing oversight  opportunities, such as finding leases with annual rent or lease terms that  do not meet program requirements. Additionally, without a way to  regularly assess agencies\u2019 policies and procedures to manage their  delegated leasing activities or track their performance in meeting key  management goals, GSA cannot be sure agencies can sufficiently  manage their leases or secure cost-effective rates. Periodic reviews of an  agency\u2019s ability to manage its delegated leasing activities would help  GSA ensure that it is providing this authority to agencies that can manage  it effectively and efficiently. Finally, without a systematic process for  monitoring a selection of submitted post award documents to help identify  and promptly resolve issues and ensure compliance with existing  legislation, regulations, and standards, GSA cannot ensure that delegated  leases comply with the terms of the delegation and the program is free  from fraud, waste, and abuse."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following four recommendations to GSA  The Administrator of GSA should take steps to reconcile G-REX and  FRPP to the extent practical.
