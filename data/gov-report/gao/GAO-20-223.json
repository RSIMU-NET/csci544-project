Of seven key practices, the Coast Guard did not apply two and partially applied three. For example, the Coast Guard did not measure its progress in achieving the goal of modernization, as key practices recommend. Coast Guard documents for organizational change and associated guidance do not require such practices to be followed. By ensuring such practices are implemented, the Coast Guard will be better positioned to determine the extent to which its investments meet modernization's goal of improving effectiveness and efficiency.", "Although the Coast Guard has informed Congress that it needs to increase its workforce, it has assessed a small portion of its workforce needs. Its preferred tool for assessing workforce needs is its manpower requirements determination process, which includes manpower requirements analyses (MRA) and is completed with a manpower requirements determination (MRD). Coast Guard guidance states that MRAs are to be updated every 5 years, and according to its April 2018 Manpower Requirements Plan, the Coast Guard's goal is to complete MRDs for all of its 58,000 personnel and 158 unit types. However, the Coast Guard had completed MRAs for 13 percent of its workforce and MRDs for 2 percent over the past 5 calendar years (see figure).", "The Coast Guard's plan does not include time frames and milestones for how it will achieve its workforce assessment goal, and information on the resources it needs to complete MRDs for all positions and units has not been updated in 10 years.

In addition, the  growing frequency of natural disasters and growth in commercial maritime  activity has increased demands on the Coast Guard\u2019s longstanding  mission responsibilities. The effect of these additional missions and  increased demands underscore the importance for the Coast Guard to  identify its resource needs, including the assets (vessels and aircraft) it  needs to carry out its missions and the workforce to operate and maintain  them. In April 2018, the Coast Guard reported to Congress that it faced  challenges meeting its daily mission demands because it was operating  below the workforce level necessary to meet all of its mission  requirements.", "The Coast Guard has implemented initiatives over the past 2 decades to  improve its ability to meet its increased mission demands, such as its  multibillion-dollar recapitalization effort to acquire a new fleet of aircraft  and vessels. During this time, the Coast Guard has undertaken other key  efforts to support its ability to meet its increased mission demands. These  have included an effort known as \u201cmodernization,\u201d which realigned its  organizational structure, and creation of a process to conduct workforce  assessments to determine the number and type of personnel required to  meet mission needs. In 2009 and 2010, we issued reports on the status  of modernization. We noted that it was too soon to assess its effects and  that as the Coast Guard continued to implement its new organizational  structure, it should develop ways to measure the effects of its  organizational changes to determine whether modernization met its  intended benefits of creating a more effective and efficient Coast Guard.", "You requested that we review the status of modernization and the Coast  Guard\u2019s progress in implementing its new organizational structure and  assessing its workforce needs.

In addition, we reviewed reports  evaluating longstanding agency management challenges. We assessed  Coast Guard organizational changes that occurred as part of  modernization against key practices we outlined in our June 2018 report  on government reorganization. Specifically, we collected and analyzed  documentation related to the Coast Guard\u2019s actions to implement  organizational change efforts, such as the modernization effort and the  integration of the Coast Guard\u2019s reserve component into the headquarters  governance structure.

In particular, we analyzed  documents on the Coast Guard\u2019s manpower requirements determination  process, which is the process the Coast Guard is to use to determine the  number of people and the mix of skills needed for each of its 158 unit  types. To do this, we analyzed data from manpower requirements  analyses and determinations that the Coast Guard prepared from  calendar year 2003, when the service began implementing its manpower  requirements determination process, through calendar year 2019, the last  full year of data available at the time of our review. We assessed the  reliability of these data, through electronic testing, reviewing  documentation, and interviewing Coast Guard headquarters and field unit  officials on how these data were collected and used. We determined that  these data were sufficiently reliable for determining the number of  positions within each type of Coast Guard unit.

The Coast Guard\u2019s 37 sectors report to nine districts, and each  district reports to one of two area commands. District commanders are  responsible for regional operations and execute operations and missions  within their area of responsibility. Sector commanders are responsible for  local operations within each district.

It was also intended to realign the Coast Guard\u2019s  operations and policies across multiple headquarters program offices. For  example, the Coast Guard has six operational mission programs  overseeing its statutory missions, and before modernization the  leadership of each of them developed separate action plans and policies  to execute their missions, while independently making resource  decisions.

The Sector Staffing Model assesses  workforce requirements for shore force units, while the Activity-Based  Staffing Model assesses boat stations. For comparison, while activity  models may identify the workforce needed based on the activities  previously conducted by a unit, determinations identify the workforce  needed to conduct the activities required by a unit to accomplish its  planned mission, based on documented requirements.

In October 2019, Coast Guard officials told us that  some of these adjustments continue in smaller, incremental efforts within  the Deputy Commandant offices and individual Coast Guard programs.  For example, Coast Guard officials from the Office of Mission Support  Integration within the Deputy Commandant for Mission Support told us  that efforts to modernize its mission support functions were ongoing.  Officials told us that they were centralizing management of certain  support delivery functions. Officials told us that centralization would help  to ensure consistency in how functions are performed across the  organization, as well as provide access to timely and complete  information about the status of assets, personnel, and equipment.

The Coast Guard generally applied this key  practice because it identified a case for change to continue to drive the  need for the modernization effort. Our prior work shows that key elements  of successful initiatives are the demonstrated commitment of top leaders  and accountability for change. Further, top leadership involvement and  clear lines of accountability for making improvements are critical to  overcoming organizations\u2019 natural resistance to change. According to  Coast Guard documents, in 2006, when the modernization effort started,  Coast Guard leadership promoted the changes outlined in the Coast  Guard\u2019s 10 modernization initiatives through internal memos and action  plans. Coast Guard documentation highlighted the benefits of the  change and identified the next steps to be taken in order to complete the  change. Additionally, commandants issued their strategic priorities  highlighting plans for the modernization effort. More recently, the Coast  Guard\u2019s 2018 report to Congress reiterated the importance of the  modernization effort, noting that the challenges that initially drove the  need for organizational changes continue to challenge the Coast Guard.", "Dedicated implementation team. The Coast Guard generally applied  this key practice because it established a team to implement its  modernization changes. In 2007, Coast Guard created the Strategic  Transformation Team to coordinate the early implementation of the  modernization effort. According to Coast Guard officials from the Office of  Resource, Organizational Analysis, and Workforce Management, as the  effort moved from the planning stages to implementation, the team  consolidated the goals in the Coast Guard\u2019s 10 modernization initiatives  into five main reorganization efforts. The team was responsible for  ensuring that the implementation of these five efforts was consistent with  the initial goals of modernization. This included facilitating the use of the  Coast Guard\u2019s existing organizational review and approval processes for  organizational changes and leading the measurement processes for  ensuring that the goals of modernization were met.", "Hold leaders accountable. The Coast Guard partially applied this key  practice because it initially established an office to oversee its  modernization but did not continue these efforts to ensure leadership  accountability for modernization implementation. In 2009, the Coast  Guard created a permanent oversight office under the Office of the Vice  Commandant to transition the coordination responsibilities of the Strategic  Transformation Team to monitor implementation of the modernization  effort. The office was given an expanded role of managing change  efforts across the Coast Guard, including overseeing the development of  metrics related to organizational change efforts to ensure that these  changes achieved goals.", "However, in 2015 the Coast Guard disestablished this oversight office  and did not specify any office responsible for ensuring organizational  change efforts met intended goals. According to Coast Guard officials  from the Office of Resource, Organizational Analysis, and Workforce  Management, the Coast Guard redistributed some of the oversight  office\u2019s responsibilities among other offices within the established  headquarters organizations. The officials told us they did so since they  determined the initial goals of modernization\u2014to create the new  headquarters organizations\u2014had been met and oversight was no longer  needed. These officials stated that the individual headquarters  organizations could manage any necessary planning moving forward for  their specific organization.", "As such, the Coast Guard\u2019s shifting leadership priorities affected what  parts of the modernization effort were implemented and, in some cases,  resulted in years spent working towards a change that was later  terminated. For example, in 2012, the Commandant stated that the  original modernization initiative to establish a single operations command  to manage field operations was not near completion, taking up  institutional energy, and impacting operations. As a result, he decided to  discontinue the effort and retain the two area field command structure.  However, according to Coast Guard officials from the Office of Resource,  Organizational Analysis, and Workforce Management, planning for the  effort was close to completion, and ending it led to the reassignment of  staff. During this time, the Coast Guard also reduced FORCECOM\u2019s role  from managing and measuring the overall readiness capabilities of the  service to focusing on workforce training, and moved the organization  under the Deputy Commandant for Mission Support. At that point, the  Coast Guard had already prepared and issued a business plan for  FORCECOM outlining the initial primary mission, goals and metrics for  evaluating effectiveness.", "We also assessed the Coast Guard\u2019s application of key reform practices  against its reorganization of the reserve component and found, similar to  our determinations of the modernization effort, it partially applied key  practices under Leadership focus and attention.

This is  particularly important for the modernization effort which the Coast Guard  reported in 2018 had fundamentally altered how it conducts business  across the organization, for every mission and at every level.

The Coast Guard did not apply this  key practice because it did not track its progress in implementing the  modernization effort on an ongoing basis. Officials told us that during the  early stages of modernization, the Coast Guard developed  implementation plans and engaged in a significant planning effort to  finalize the organizational realignment. These plans provided a method to  track the Coast Guard\u2019s progress as they implemented each phase of  modernization; however, as the effort matured, the Coast Guard  determined that the effort did not require the same amount of planning as  initial implementation. In 2009, during the early stages of modernization,  the Coast Guard reported that it had efforts planned or underway to  monitor the implementation progress of the modernization effort, including  developing implementation plans, goals, and performance metrics. As  the modernization effort matured and the Deputy Commandant for  Mission Support and Deputy Commandant for Operations were created,  Coast Guard officials determined that they did not need the same amount  of planning, and the Coast Guard stopped updating its implementation  plans.", "Additionally, for the reorganization of the reserve component, the Coast  Guard has minimally applied practices under the Managing and  monitoring category.

For example, the Coast Guard established no milestones or metrics  against which to measure the reserve components\u2019 progress in achieving  its intended goal of improved mission performance.", "Measure employee satisfaction. The Coast Guard partially applied this  key practice because it sought employee feedback during the early  stages of the modernization effort, but did not continue to measure  employee satisfaction with the effort. During the initial implementation of  modernization, the Coast Guard used a combination of informal and  formal mechanisms to seek employee satisfaction. For example,  according to a 2009 National Academy of Public Administration report,  the Commandant reached out to personnel through informal means, such  as social media, to communicate and obtain real time feedback from staff  affected by the organizational changes. Formally, the Coast Guard  obtained anecdotal information through surveys of staff through the  Organizational Assessment Survey and the Office of Personnel  Management\u2019s Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey; however, these  methods do not include specific questions related to the impact of  organizational change efforts. Specifically for modernization, beyond  efforts during the early stages of modernization, there has been no  sustained Coast Guard-wide effort to monitor the impact of the change on  employees.", "According to a senior Coast Guard official from the Office of Resource,  Organizational Analysis, and Workforce Management, the Coast Guard is  not required to conduct such assessments as changes are implemented.  Specifically, the document governing the Coast Guard\u2019s organizational  change process does not specify measuring employee satisfaction as  part of the organizational change request process.

In addition, the Coast Guard has taken steps to build a Force  Planning Construct model to inform leadership on the forces and  capabilities needed to execute its steady state and contingency  operations. In its April 2018 Manpower Requirements Plan to Congress,  the Coast Guard stated that it envisioned using the model to assess  future workforce needs.

However, the Coast  Guard has completed such determinations for a small fraction of its  workforce, as we discuss later in this report.", "Finally, for the reorganization of the reserve component, we found that  the Coast Guard had minimally applied the key practice under Strategic  workforce planning. In particular, officials from the new reserve  component told us that even though the reserve force is not covered by  existing workforce planning tools, the Coast Guard continued to proceed  with reorganizing the reserve force structure.", "For each of the key reform practices that were not fully implemented, we  found that the Coast Guard\u2019s organizational change request process and  associated guidance documents did not require such practices to be  followed, nor did they require tracking implementation of changes,  collecting data to measure progress, or assessing employee satisfaction.  By not fully implementing each of these key practices, the Coast Guard  may miss opportunities to demonstrate that its investment in the  modernization effort meets its ultimate goals to enhance efficiency and  effectiveness and to improve the overall performance of the Coast Guard.  Systematically tracking progress of organizational change efforts and  measuring their effects, including employee satisfaction, would better  position the Coast Guard to identify challenges, if any, to meeting the  goals of the organizational change in a timely manner.

The manpower requirements determination process begins with  programs or Coast Guard leadership, such as the Commandant or  Vice Commandant, requesting an MRA, which is a comprehensive  review of workforce needs as determined from a wide range of  factors. These factors include regulations, training, and competencies  needed to effectively perform each mission. The MRA assesses the  information necessary to adjust personnel, resources, mission, or risk,  depending on availability of resources. Officials from the manpower  requirements determination program, contractors, or in some cases,  other Coast Guard programs, may conduct MRAs.", "After Action Report.

The process is to  conclude with a manpower requirements determination. The  determination identifies the number and type of positions a unit type  requires to meet mission-based capability requirements. In developing  the determination, stakeholders are to review MRA results and  develop the determination, while documenting any changes from the  initial MRA. These stakeholders typically include representatives from  the program assessed in the MRA and experts from around the Coast  Guard in areas such as personnel assignments, workforce  forecasting, training availability and capacity, and resource oversight,  among others. The manpower requirements determination program  then submits the determination to be signed by the Assistant  Commandant for Human Resources.

When it reaches that goal, the manpower requirements determination  process will allow the Coast Guard to know which units are the most  understaffed, and to make service-wide decisions based on where the  most urgent needs are. Only when determinations have been completed  for its entire workforce can Coast Guard leadership allocate personnel in  the most effective and efficient manner. Notably, Coast Guard documents  emphasize the importance of an enterprise-wide approach to track and  manage resources because it enables leadership to compare needs and  make informed trade-offs across programs.", "In 2019, officials in the manpower requirements determination program  told us that MRAs were to be updated every 5 years. Officials stated that  this is a best practice that aligns with the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s workforce strategy. Pacific Area Command officials we spoke  with also told us that they view the guidance as requiring that MRAs  should not be older than 5 years. Additionally, the Coast Guard\u2019s 2015  Staffing Logic and Manpower Requirements Manual states that the  Manpower Requirements Determination Program Division Chief is  responsible for ensuring that each unit type has undergone an MRA  within the past 5 years.

Coast Guard officials told us they were using a combination of  two documents to guide its manpower requirements determination  process, and neither document was both current and comprehensive in  terms of detailing the steps to follow. For example, the 2015 Staffing  Logic and Manpower Requirements Manual contains individual process  step requirements, but has been rescinded. In contrast, the 2018 Manpower Requirements Manual provides current policy, but does not  include guidance on process steps that program officials are to follow. In  its 2018 manual, the Coast Guard rescinded the 2015 manual without  replacing or affirming its process steps. Officials stated that analysts in  the manpower requirements determination program use the rescinded  2015 guidance in executing the process because they have no other  guidance to follow.", "Officials in the manpower requirements determination program provided  several reasons for why the program has not consistently ensured that all  steps are completed. First, officials told us that completing a  determination for each MRA had not always been a priority for the Coast  Guard. Officials said that in some cases manpower requirements  determinations were not completed due to disagreement among  stakeholders about how to apply the results of the MRA. Officials said, for  example, that while an MRA may find that a program is significantly  understaffed, some stakeholders may argue against including the full  scale of the shortfall in the determination due to limited resources and  competing needs. Second, officials stated that some determinations were  not completed because some programs requesting MRAs were not  interested in obtaining the final determination upon receiving the MRA.  Specifically, they explained that sometimes the program that requested to  initiate the manpower requirements determination process is most  interested in the staffing data contained in the MRA, rather than the final  determination, which formalizes the trade-offs and results proposed in the  MRA.", "Officials in the manpower requirements determination program told us  that both the 2015 and 2018 manpower requirements determination  guidance did not identify circumstances when a manpower requirements  determination was not required to be completed for an MRA. Further,  program officials told us that they were not aware that the process  guidance they reported using required after-action reports. Coast Guard  officials also stated that having the process guidance in a rescinded  document had made their ability to implement and oversee the process a  challenge due to the possibility of officials applying the guidance  inconsistently. They further said they recognized the manpower  requirements determination process was not clear and needed to be  revised, and that doing so may help ensure officials consistently  implement the process. In June 2019, officials said they planned to issue  updated guidance, but had not established a timeframe for doing so. By  issuing updated guidance for conducting manpower requirements  determinations that outlines required process steps, and any  circumstances in which the process steps do not need to be performed,  the Coast Guard can better ensure that those responsible for  implementing the process do so consistently."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coast Guard Has Not Tracked the Extent of Manpower Requirements Analyses and Determinations Completed", "paragraphs": ["In addition to requiring MRAs to be conducted every 5 years, the  rescinded 2015 Coast Guard guidance, which officials reported using to  execute the manpower requirements determination process, states that  the manpower requirements determination program is to maintain and  update a master list of MRAs conducted to enable the program to track  and organize its workload. However, the Coast Guard has not tracked  the extent to which it has assessed Coast Guard unit types through the  manpower requirements determination process, as required in the 2015  process guidance, which officials report is still in use. For example, in  March 2019 Coast Guard officials stated that they did not maintain a list  of MRAs or manpower requirements determinations completed since the  program began in 2003, and they were not aware that maintaining a list  was a requirement. Officials prepared a list to respond to our request, and  in April 2019, provided us with a list of MRAs and determinations the  Coast Guard had completed since 2003. However, we found that the list  was not accurate. The Coast Guard\u2019s list underrepresented the number of  MRAs completed by almost half.

While  the list the Coast Guard compiled for us underrepresented the number of  MRAs completed, the information it provided to Congress in its April 2018  report overrepresented the extent to which it has assessed its workforce  needs. Specifically, in April 2018 the Coast Guard reported to Congress  that it had recently analyzed workforce needs for 54 percent of its  workforce using the manpower requirements determination process and  its activity models. However, more than half of the MRAs it had completed  had not been updated in the past 5 years, as Coast Guard guidance  requires.

Nevertheless, program officials told us they generally did not track  information on the costs of conducting MRAs. According to officials, the  manpower requirements determination program cannot track all such  costs because cost data is spread across different program offices. For  example, officials stated that for contracted MRAs, contracting fees are  easier to identify, but the manpower requirements determination program  does not have access to other major costs, such as travel by officials  conducting the analysis. While the manpower requirements determination  program oversees the MRA process, and is tasked with ensuring  manpower requirements determinations are completed for every unit in  the Coast Guard, officials said that generally the program that is the  subject of the MRA provides funding for the study, and only that program  maintains access to travel costs associated with the MRA. They said the  manpower requirements determination program does not request cost  information from the programs requesting MRAs. Additionally, the  manpower requirements determination program does not collect cost  information from programs that conduct their own MRAs.", "The Coast Guard has increasingly used contractors to complete MRAs.  While the Coast Guard has not tracked the costs of conducting MRAs,  Coast Guard analysis has shown that having MRAs completed by  contractors is more costly than completing them in-house. Program  officials said they have increasingly used contractors because of staffing  limitations. For example, from calendar years 2010 through 2019,  contractors completed nearly half of the Coast Guard\u2019s 54 MRAs.

Specifically, we requested the entire collection of MRA and  determination documents from the Coast Guard. We then requested the  number of positions that make up each unit type with a completed MRA.  We assessed the reliability of the Coast Guard\u2019s data through electronic  testing, reviewing documentation, and interviewing Coast Guard  headquarters and field unit officials regarding how these data were  collected and used. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for determining the number of positions within each type of Coast  Guard unit. With this information, for every MRA and determination  completed, we calculated the number of positions in the Coast Guard\u2019s  workforce supported by available data.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2018 to February  2020 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

In 2006, under its organizational  modernization effort, the Coast Guard issued a goal to optimize the use of  the reserve component by ensuring the reserve workforce had the  necessary training and support. The Coast Guard shifted governance of  the reserve component under the Deputy Commandant for Mission  Support; however under this structure, the Coast Guard did not take into  account the difference between the reserves workforce being considered  a program as opposed to a distinct component of the United States  military. As such, in 2018, the Coast Guard chartered a project team to  evaluate the state of the reserve component\u2019s governance and develop  alternate options to better integrate the reserves into the Deputy  Commandant for Operations.", "In 2019, the Coast Guard integrated its reserve component into its Deputy  Commandant for Operations governance structure. Officials told us that  the goals for the new reserve component organization are to provide  headquarters decision-makers enhanced visibility of operational  readiness, competencies assigned and attained, and to use predictive  modeling to look 2 or 3 years ahead to anticipate readiness posture and  administrative readiness. They noted that achieving these goals relies on  better data collection and developing metrics that can capture Coast  Guard-wide information.
