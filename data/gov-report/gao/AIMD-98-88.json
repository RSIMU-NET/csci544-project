The overall objective of the FMS project is to improve the District\u2019s financial systems through faster, more efficient, and accurate processing providing increased functionality, flexibility, and reduced cost of operations. According to the Chair of the Authority, the new FMS is intended to (1) eliminate the principal problems that exist with the current system and ensure that all financial management guidelines are adhered to, (2) enable managers to more effectively and efficiently monitor and control financial resources, and (3) produce timely, accurate, and reliable information, providing decisionmakers with the basic financial information needed to make more informed decisions.", "The Authority awarded a contract for the new FMS in September 1997 and committed to an aggressive implementation schedule. The schedule anticipates (1) pilots in five agencies beginning in February 1998, (2) the accounting system to be implemented by October 1998, and (3) District-wide implementation by February 1999."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objective, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["We were asked to review the District\u2019s efforts to acquire a new financial management system. Our objective was to determine whether the District had implemented disciplined software acquisition processes for acquiring its new financial management system.", "To accomplish this, we applied the Software Engineering Institute\u2019s Software Acquisition Capability Maturity Model (SA-CMM) and its Software Capability Evaluation (SCE) method. SEI\u2019s expertise in, and methods for, software process assessment are recognized and accepted throughout the industry. Our evaluators were all SEI-trained software specialists.", "SA-CMM ranks organizational maturity according to five levels (see figure 1). Maturity levels 2 through 5 require the verifiable existence and use of certain software acquisition processes, known as key process areas (KPA). According to SEI, an agency that has these acquisition processes in place is in a much better position to successfully acquire software than an organization that does not have these processes in place. We evaluated the District\u2019s software acquisition processes against six of the seven level 2 KPAs (the transition to support KPA was not evaluated because the District does not plan to support FMS in-house) and one level 3 KPA (see table 1). We selected level 2 because it is the minimum level at which any assurance exists that software acquisition processes are mature enough to consistently deliver promised software capabilities on time and within budget. We included one level 3 KPA\u2014acquisition risk management\u2014because it is considered by software experts to be a very important process area.", "Basic project management processes are established to track performance, cost, and schedule.

The software acquisition planning process, among other things, includes (1) addressing software life-cycle support in acquisition plans, (2) preparing life-cycle software cost estimates, (3) having a written software acquisition policy, (4) measuring and reporting on the status of software acquisition planning activities, and (5) having guidance on software training and experience requirements for project personnel."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FMS Project Performs Some but Not All Software Acquisition Planning Practices", "paragraphs": ["The FMS project had many strengths in this KPA. The District received pro bono assistance from several companies to help define the acquisition strategy and conduct the activities for software acquisition planning. An acquisition strategy was developed and the acquisition planning team was staffed with personnel with software and systems experience. The team developed a cost estimate and the District management was briefed by the team on a periodic basis. This enabled the District management to be informed on the progress of the acquisition planning and the various activities through the solicitation phase.", "However, the FMS project also had many weaknesses in this KPA. Weaknesses observed included a lack of policy on acquisition planning and no specific assignment of responsibility for acquisition planning. Furthermore, the FMS project did not always document significant project decisions or update the planning document to reflect these decisions. For example, when the District decided to not pursue a single contract to both acquire FMS and outsource data center operations, the capability assessment (a software acquisition planning document) was not updated to reflect this decision. Decisions should be documented and the planning documents updated to ensure that large acquisitions such as FMS can be effectively managed.

Specific requirements for a solicitation process include, among other things (1) having and following a solicitation plan, (2) assigning responsibility and ensuring sufficient resources for coordinating and conducting solicitation activities, (3) preparing and reviewing cost and schedule estimates for the software products and services being acquired, and (4) periodically measuring solicitation work completed and effort and funds expended, comparing these measures to plans, and reporting the results to management."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FMS Project Performing Most Solicitation Practices", "paragraphs": ["The FMS project exhibited many process strengths during the solicitation. The District has a policy on solicitation and the FMS project followed this policy. The project had experienced personnel on the source selection team and these personnel briefed the team members on the objectives of the solicitation. However, the District did not measure either time or funds expended to conduct the solicitation. Specifically, no evidence was provided to show that the FMS project tracked personnel hours or costs during the conduct of the solicitation. Addressing this weakness would enable the District to better estimate the resources needed to conduct similar acquisitions in the future. For example, if these data were collected and made available to other projects, such as the tax systems upgrade, the District would be in a better position to understand its own capability to effectively conduct solicitation, to estimate how long such a solicitation was likely to take, and to eliminate problems that may have hampered the FMS solicitation.

As a result, the District\u2019s success or failure in acquiring FMS depends largely on specific individuals rather than on well-defined software acquisition management practices. This greatly reduces the probability that the system will consistently perform as intended and be delivered on schedule and within budget.", "To satisfy the intent of all the software acquisition key process areas and thereby have a reasonable assurance that acquisition efforts are effectively planned, managed, evaluated, and tracked, the District must address the many weaknesses identified in this report. This would entail the District formulating and implementing a written policy for software acquisition planning, requirements development and management, project management, contract tracking and oversight, evaluation, and acquisition risk management.
