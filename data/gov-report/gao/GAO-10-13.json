The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has previously reported on limitations in DHS's efforts to plan and execute its efforts to deliver US-VISIT exit, and made recommendations to improve these areas. GAO was asked to determine (1) the status of DHS's efforts to deliver a comprehensive exit solution and (2) to what extent DHS is applying an integrated approach to managing its comprehensive exit solution.

However, it has not adopted an integrated approach to scheduling, executing, and tracking the work that needs to be accomplished to deliver a comprehensive exit solution. Rather, it is relying on several separate and distinct schedules to manage individual components and the US-VISIT prime contractor's work that supports these components. Moreover, neither of the two component schedules that GAO reviewed are reliable because they have not been derived in accordance with relevant guidance. Specifically, both the Air Exit Pilots schedule and the Temporary Worker Visa Exit Pilot schedule only fully meet one of nine key schedule estimating practices, and either partially, minimally, or do not meet the remaining eight. In contrast, the prime contractor's schedule is largely reliable, as it fully or substantially meets all nine practices. Without a master schedule for the Comprehensive Exit project that is integrated and derived in accordance with relevant guidance, DHS cannot reliably commit to when and how the work will be accomplished to deliver a comprehensive exit solution to its almost 300 ports of entry, and it cannot adequately monitor and manage its progress toward this end."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For many years, Congress and the executive branch have sought better  ways to record and track the arrival and departure of foreign travelers  through U.S. air, sea, and land ports of entry (POE).

In addition, US-VISIT\u2019s program and project management  guidance and plans recognize that schedule management plays a critical  role in the success of its activities. For example, the program management  plan requires a tiered and integrated master schedule that includes  contractor schedules for each task order and a project level schedule.  Further, US-VISIT\u2019s program guidance states that the integrated master  schedule provides a means to ensure attainability of program objectives  and evaluate the project\u2019s progress in doing so.", "Program officials told us they do not have an integrated master schedule  for the Comprehensive Exit project. Instead, each ongoing project  component has its own separate schedule. In addition, the US-VISIT  prime contractor has its own schedule to support the project components,  although program officials said that the work in this schedule is manually  incorporated into each component schedule. However, our analysis of the  schedules for ongoing Comprehensive Exit components, as well as the  contractor\u2019s schedule, did not show any evidence of this, and the program  office provided no other documentation to demonstrate that the manual  incorporation exists. According to program officials, DHS cannot develop  a complete schedule for the Comprehensive Exit project until decisions  have been made on the direction and scope of the Air/Sea and Land exit  solutions. However, relevant guidance states that a comprehensive  schedule should reflect all activities for a project and recognizes that there  can be uncertainties and unknown factors in schedule estimates due to,  among other things, limited data. In light of such uncertainties and  unknowns, the guidance discusses the need to perform a schedule risk  analysis to determine the level of uncertainty and to help identify and  mitigate the risks.", "As a result, DHS does not have a comprehensive project view of the work  that must be, among other things, sequenced, timed, resourced, and risk- adjusted to deliver the Comprehensive Exit solution.

Our research has  identified nine practices associated with developing and maintaining a  reliable schedule. These practices are (1) capturing all activities,   (2) sequencing all activities, (3) assigning resources to all activities,   (4) establishing the duration of all activities, (5) integrating schedule  activities horizontally and vertically, (6) establishing the critical path for  all activities, (7) identifying float between activities, (8) conducting a  schedule risk analysis, and (9) updating the schedule using logic and  durations to determine the dates. In addition, the project management  plan states that a project schedule should reflect the work breakdown  structure for the project as well as ELCM required artifacts. The plan also  requires that the project schedule be horizontally and vertically integrated,  that all scheduled milestones and tasks be linked logically, and that  schedule status be captured on a regular basis.", "Both the Air Exit Pilots schedule and the Temporary Worker Visa Exit  Pilot schedule only fully meet one of the nine key schedule estimating  practices, and either partially, minimally, or do not meet the remaining  eight. In contrast, the prime contractor\u2019s schedule is largely reliable, as it  fully or substantially meets all nine practices. To be considered reliable,  relevant guidance states that a schedule needs to fully meet all nine  practices.

A detailed discussion of the extent to which each schedule  meets the nine practices is in appendix II.", "Component schedules: Both the Air Exit Pilots and Temporary Worker  Visa Exit Pilot schedules establish the duration of time planned for  executing key activities, and they detail work activities that are integrated  with higher-level milestones and summary activities. However, neither  schedule reflects a valid critical path due to a high number of missing  dependencies and rigid schedule constraints. For example, the schedule  contains 16 remaining activities that identify dates when the activities  must begin. These are rigid schedule constraints and such dates remain  fixed regardless of the allocation of resources or predecessor activities  finishing on time, earlier, or later. This is important because the critical  path represents the longest chain of activities through the network and  determines the length of the project. Thus, delays in an activity that is on  the critical path would cause the entire component effort to slip. Without a  valid critical path, the program office cannot accurately determine the  amount of time required to complete the project component and assess  how delays impact the projected completion date. According to program  officials, they manage each exit component to a critical path that is  calculated by the scheduling software on a weekly basis. However, as  noted above, the critical paths are not valid due to missing dependencies  and rigid schedule constraints.", "In addition, neither schedule is based on a schedule risk analysis. A  schedule risk analysis is important because it allows high-priority risks to  be identified and mitigated, and the level of confidence in meeting  projected completion dates to be predicted. Also, officials stated they do  not perform regular, electronic checks on the schedules to know the true  status of the components and thus ensure the integrity of the schedules\u2019  logic. Furthermore, neither schedule assigns resources to activities, which  limits insight into current or projected resource allocation issues. Without  assigning resources, the risk of the projected completion date slipping is  increased.", "Contractor schedule: The prime contractor\u2019s schedule reflects a number  of best practices. For example, this schedule can be traced to the  contractor\u2019s work breakdown structure, activities have appropriate logical  sequencing, and resources are assigned to activities.

However, the schedule does not reflect a  valid critical path because it contains two separate critical paths that are  not linked.

Moreover, even the individual schedules governing the execution of what  DHS described as unrelated components are not sufficiently reliable as  standalone schedules. For the Comprehensive Exit project to be managed  in a fully integrated manner, it is important for DHS to develop and  implement an integrated master schedule.
