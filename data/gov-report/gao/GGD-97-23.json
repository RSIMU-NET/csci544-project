Commercial banks and thrifts originally served very different purposes and markets. Commercial banks issued debt payable on demand, which was backed by short-term commercial loans. The customers of commercial banks tended to be businesses and wealthy individuals seeking liquid deposit accounts. Savings and loan associations, however, used deposits to fund home mortgages of their members. But, because of the long terms of mortgages, members were restricted in their ability to withdraw their funds. Savings banks were initially designed to provide a range of financial services to the small saver. Their asset portfolios were generally more diversified than those of savings and loan associations to enable them to provide more flexible deposit terms. Despite the historical differences between these institutions, the powers and services of banks and thrifts have converged over time with few practical differences remaining in their authorities, except that these institutions continue to be subject to different regulatory schemes. (See app. I for more information on the history of U.S. bank and thrift oversight.)", "At the end of 1995, the United States had nearly 12,000 banking institutions.

Of those, 4,494 bank holding companies and 833 thrift holding companies each held only 1 bank or thrift.", "Holding companies may consist of a parent company, banking subsidiaries, nonbanking subsidiaries, and even other holding companies\u2014each of which may have its own banking or nonbanking subsidiaries.

Banking subsidiaries are separately chartered banks subject to the same regulation and capital requirements that apply to other banking institutions. Nonbanking subsidiaries are companies that may be engaged in a variety of businesses other than banking; however, any nonbanking activities of a bank holding company subsidiary must be closely related to the business of banking and produce a public benefit. Thrift holding companies may be owned by or own any type of financial services or other business. Many bank holding companies have established nonbank subsidiaries engaged in consumer finance, trust services, leasing, mortgage lending, electronic data processing, insurance underwriting, management consulting services, and securities brokerage services.", "Holding companies in the United States may also have multiple tiers. For example, as we mentioned above, holding companies may have subsidiary holding companies that have their own banking or nonbanking subsidiaries.

Between 1985 and 1995, the number of banks and thrifts in the United States fell by about 34 percent due to consolidation through mergers and also bank and thrift failures. The number of banks decreased by 4,476\u2014from 14,417 to 9,941. The number of thrifts decreased by 1,597\u2014from 3,626 to 2,029.", "Industry consolidation has been characterized by a greater concentration of deposits among the largest banking companies in the country. For example, the 10 largest bank holding companies controlled 17.4 percent of bank deposits in 1984; they increased this share to 25.6 percent in 1994. Similarly, the 10 largest thrift institutions increased their share of deposits from 12.4 percent to 17 percent. However, although nationwide concentration has been increasing over the past 10 years, increases in local market concentration have been much more modest relative to the changes at the national level. According to industry analysts, this has occurred because banking institutions not located in the same local market have merged, and constraints imposed by antitrust laws have helped to prevent increases in concentration at the local level.", "The nature of the activities that banking institutions engage in has also changed drastically over the past several decades.

For example, a merger of banking institutions with differing charters may be purposefully structured to place the application decision with the agency deemed most likely to approve the merger and expand permissible activities. According to some former agency officials, a regulatory agency\u2019s desire to maintain or increase the number of institutions under its jurisdiction could inhibit the agency from taking the most appropriate enforcement action against an institution because that action could prompt a charter switch.", "Although the statutory mandates that define responsibilities of federal regulators help produce a common understanding of the principal goals of bank regulation, bank regulators may prioritize these goals differently, according to the mission of the particular regulatory agency, among other factors.

Consequently, the four oversight agencies share responsibility for developing and implementing regulations, taking enforcement actions, and conducting examinations and off-site monitoring.", "Analysts, legislators, banking institution officials, and numerous past and present agency officials have identified weaknesses and strengths in this oversight structure. Some representatives of these groups have broadly characterized the federal system as redundant, inconsistent, and inefficient. Some banking institution officials have also raised concerns about negative effects of the structure on supervisory effectiveness. Some regulators, banking institutions, and analysts alike have asserted that the multiplicity of regulators has resulted in inconsistent treatment of banking institutions in examinations, enforcement actions, and regulatory decisions, despite interagency efforts at coordination. We have cited significant inconsistencies in examination policies and practices among FDIC, OCC, OTS, and FRS, including differences in examination scope, frequency, documentation, loan quality and loss reserve evaluations, bank and thrift rating systems, and examination guidance and regulations. At the same time, some agency and institution officials have credited the current structure with encouraging financial innovations and providing checks and balances to guard against arbitrary oversight decisions or actions.", "As a result of concerns about the current oversight structure, many proposals have been made to restructure the multiagency system of bank regulation and supervision. These proposals have not been implemented, partly as a result of assertions by FRS and FDIC officials that they rely on information obtained under their respective supervisory authorities to fulfill their nonoversight duties: monetary policy development and implementation, liquidity lending, and operation and oversight of the nation\u2019s payment and clearance systems for FRS; administration of the deposit insurance funds, resolution of failing or failed banks, and disposition of failed bank assets for FDIC. As we have pointed out in the past, the extent to which FRS needs to be a formal supervisor of financial institutions to obtain the requisite knowledge and influence for carrying out its role is an important question that involves policy judgments that only Congress and the President can make. Nevertheless, past experience, as well as evidence from the five foreign oversight structures we studied (see below for further discussion) provides support for the need for FRS to obtain direct access to supervisory information. We have also favored a strong, independent deposit insurance function to protect the taxpayers\u2019 interest in insuring more than $2.5 trillion in deposits. Nonetheless, previous work we have done suggests that a strong deposit insurance function can be ensured by providing FDIC with (1) the ability to go into any problem institution on its own, without having to obtain prior approval from another regulatory agency; (2) the capability to assess the quality of bank and thrift examinations, generally; and (3) backup enforcement authority.", "Treasury also has several responsibilities related to bank oversight, including being the final decisionmaker in approving an exception to FDIC\u2019s least-cost rule.

Thus, each of the bank oversight structures that we reviewed also provided the Ministry of Finance, or its equivalent, with some degree of influence over bank oversight and access to information. Although each country included its finance ministry in some capacity in its oversight structure, most also recognized the need to guard against undue political influence by incorporating checks and balances unique to each country.", "While central banks and finance ministries generally had substantial roles in bank oversight, deposit insurers, with the exception of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, did not. Their less substantial oversight role may be attributable to the fact that national governments provided no explicit guarantees of deposit insurance and that deposit insurers were often industry-administered. Thus, in most of these countries, deposit insurers were viewed primarily as a source of funds to help resolve bank failures\u2014either by covering insured deposits or by helping to finance acquisitions of failed or failing institutions by healthy institutions. Supervisory information was generally not shared with these deposit insurers, and resolution decisions for failed or failing banks were commonly made by the primary bank oversight entities.", "Most of the foreign structures with multiple oversight entities incorporated mechanisms and procedures that could ensure consistent and efficient oversight. As a result, banking institutions that were conducting the same lines of business were generally subject to a single set of rules, standards, or guidelines. Coordination mechanisms included having oversight committees or commissions with interlocking boards, shared staff, or mandates to share information. Some countries relied on the work of external auditors, at least in part, for purposes of efficiency. Bank oversight in these countries generally did not include consumer protection or social policy issues.", "There are many practical problems associated with creating a new agency or consolidating existing functions. Although such issues were beyond the scope of this report, it remains important that transition and implementation issues be thoroughly considered in deliberations about any modernization of bank oversight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["GAO\u2019s work on the five foreign oversight systems showed that there are a number of different ways to simplify bank oversight in the United States in accordance with the four principles of consolidated oversight, independence, consistency, and enhanced efficiency and reduced burden. GAO recognizes that only Congress can make the ultimate policy judgments in deciding whether, and how, to restructure the existing system. If Congress does decide to modernize the U.S. system, GAO recommends that Congress:", "Reduce the number of federal agencies with primary responsibilities for bank oversight. GAO believes that a logical step would be to consolidate OTS, OCC, and FDIC\u2019s primary supervisory responsibilities into a new, independent federal banking agency or commission. Congress could provide for this new agency\u2019s independence in a variety of ways, including making it organizationally independent like FDIC or FRS. This new independent agency, together with FRS, could be assigned responsibility for consolidated, comprehensive supervision of those banking organizations under its purview, with appropriate functional supervision of individual components.", "Continue to include both FRS and Treasury in bank oversight. To carry out its primary responsibilities effectively, FRS should have direct access to supervisory information as well as influence over supervisory decisionmaking and the banking industry. The foreign oversight structures GAO viewed showed that this could be accomplished by having FRS be either a direct or indirect participant in bank oversight. For example, FRS could maintain its current direct oversight responsibilities for state chartered member banks or be given new responsibility for some segment of the banking industry, such as the largest banking organizations. Alternatively, FRS could be represented on the board of directors of a new consolidated banking agency or on FDIC\u2019s board of directors. Under this alternative, FRS\u2019 staff could help support some of the examination or other activities of a consolidated banking agency to better ensure that FRS receives first hand information about, and access to, the banking industry.", "To carry out its mission effectively, Treasury also needs access to supervisory information about the condition of the banking industry as well as the safety and soundness of banking institutions that could affect the stability of the financial system. GAO\u2019s reviews of foreign regulatory structures provided several examples of how Treasury might obtain access to such information, such as having Treasury represented on the board of the new banking agency or commission and perhaps on the board of FDIC as well.", "Continue to provide FDIC with the necessary authority to protect the deposit insurance funds. Under any restructuring, GAO believes FDIC should still have an explicit backup supervisory authority to enable it to effectively discharge its responsibility for protecting the deposit insurance funds. Such authority should require coordination with other responsible regulators, but should also allow FDIC to go into any problem institution on its own without the prior approval of any other regulatory agency. FDIC also needs backup enforcement power, access to bank examinations, and the capability to independently assess the quality of those examinations.", "Incorporate mechanisms to help ensure consistent oversight and reduce regulatory burden. Reducing the number of federal bank oversight agencies from the current four should help improve the consistency of oversight and reduce regulatory burden. Should Congress decide to continue having more than one primary federal bank regulator, GAO believes that Congress should incorporate mechanisms into the oversight system to enhance cooperation and coordination between the regulators and reduce regulatory burden.", "Although GAO does not recommend any particular action, such mechanisms\u2014which could be adopted even if Congress decides not to restructure the existing system\u2014could include expanding the current mandate of FFIEC to help ensure consistency in rulemaking for similar activities in addition to consistency in examinations; assigning specific rulemaking authority in statute to a single agency, as has been done in the past when Congress gave FRS statutory authority to issue rules for several consumer protection laws that are enforced by all of the bank regulators; requiring enhanced cooperation between examiners and banks\u2019 external auditors; (While GAO strongly supports requirements for annual full-scope, on-site examinations for large banks, GAO believes that examiners could take better advantage of the work already being done by external auditors to better plan and target their examinations.) requiring enhanced off-site monitoring to better plan and target examinations as well as to identify and raise supervisory concerns at an earlier stage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["FRS, FDIC, OCC, and OTS provided written comments on a draft of this report, which are described below and reprinted in appendixes IV through VII. Treasury also reviewed a draft and provided oral technical comments, which we incorporated where appropriate.", "FRS agreed that it is useful to consider the experience of other countries in making policy determinations. It also agreed that there are different ways to accommodate the policy goal of modernizing the U.S. supervisory structure. FRS reiterated its opinion that the purpose of bank supervision is to enhance the capability of the banking system to contribute to long-term national economic growth and stability. FRS agreed with our description of the direct involvement of central bank staff in bank oversight in the countries we studied and our recommendation that FRS continue to be included in bank oversight. However, it felt that we should be more specific in stating that FRS needs \u201cactive supervisory involvement in the largest U.S. banking organizations and a cross-section of other banking institutions\u201d to carry out its key central banking functions. To clarify what was meant by this statement, a senior FRS official advised us that FRS\u2019 present regulatory authority gives it the access and influence it needs. But if the regulatory structure were changed so that there is only one federal regulator for each banking organization\u2014holding company and all bank subsidiaries\u2014then FRS feels that it would have to be the regulator for the largest banking organizations and a cross-section of others in order to carry out its key central banking functions.", "We agree that FRS needs to have direct access to supervisory information as well as the ability to influence supervisory decisionmaking and the banking industry if the oversight structure is changed. However, in our studies of foreign oversight structures we found that direct central bank involvement in bank oversight, and access to and influence over the banking industry, could be accomplished in several ways. These could include giving the central bank a formal role as bank supervisor, participating on oversight boards with staff involvement in examination and other areas of supervision, and serving in informal yet influential roles that included participation in oversight by central bank staff.", "FRS also noted that 88 percent of U.S. banks are part of banking organizations that are actively supervised by no more than two oversight agencies. The portion of activities supervised by the third or fourth agency in holding companies where more than two agencies are involved in oversight is generally small. We acknowledge that most U.S. banks are supervised by no more than two federal banking supervisory agencies. Nevertheless, as the table provided by FRS shows (see app. IV), more than 50 percent of bank assets are held in companies that are supervised by three or four of these agencies. Furthermore, it is the larger, more complex banking institutions\u2014whose failure could pose the greatest danger to the financial system\u2014that are likely to be subject to oversight by more than two agencies, with the potential attendant oversight problems described in our report. In addition, the percentage of assets supervised by additional agencies\u2014which may be relatively small\u2014does not indicate their importance or potential risk to the banking organization.", "FDIC provided four fundamental principles for an effective bank regulatory structure, which are generally consistent with the principles and recommendations that we advocate. These principles include providing FDIC with an explicit backup supervisory authority, backup enforcement power, and the capability to assess the quality of bank and thrift examinations. We also support providing FDIC with such backup authority. FDIC also noted that the broader regulatory responsibilities related to the role of the deposit insurer require current and sufficient information on the ongoing health and operations of financial institutions. In FDIC\u2019s judgment, periodic on-site examination remains one of the essential tools by which such information may be obtained.", "FDIC commented on the mechanisms we described that Congress might consider to enhance regulators\u2019 cooperation and coordination and reduce regulatory burden, noting that the current processes for coordinating regulation allow for the consideration of the unique regulatory perspectives of each agency. We agree that the present practice of cooperation, coordination, and communication among the agencies in rulemaking allows the unique viewpoints of each of the oversight agencies to be considered. The assignment of rulemaking authority to a single agency would not preclude incorporating other viewpoints, as evidenced by the current rulemaking process with regard to some consumer protection regulations, where a single agency has been assigned such authority. We believe assigning rulemaking authority for safety and soundness regulations could be one way to attain a more efficient regulatory process.", "OCC described our report as comprehensive and conveying more about the foreign regulatory structures than has been available to the public, albeit not exhaustive. OCC agreed with us that the foreign structures are not readily adaptable to the United States and described some of its observations about the differences among the five countries\u2019 regulatory structures. Consequently, OCC suggested that Congress consider our suggestions very carefully in making any changes to the oversight structure in the United States. We agree that Congress should be cautious in any consideration it gives to changing the regulatory structure.", "OTS generally concurred with our principal recommendations and restated its position that consolidation will make the bank oversight system more efficient and effective. It added that reducing the number of federal oversight agencies should be done in a way that preserves a strong and stable regulatory environment and protects agency employees. We agree that the consolidation of any oversight agencies should be done in a way that preserves a strong and stable regulatory environment that is effective, efficient, and responsive to the needs and risks of the supervised institutions.", "FRS, FDIC, and OTS also noted several regulatory actions and other initiatives underway that are designed to improve coordination\u2014including joint or coordinated examinations\u2014and reduce regulatory and supervisory redundancy and overlap. We believe such efforts are important to the consistency and efficiency of the regulatory structure and have incorporated this information into our report where appropriate.", "The comment letters from FRS, FDIC, and OTS attest to the unique perspectives of each of the oversight agencies, which we believe provide valuable insights to Congress. As we describe in our report, there is a range of ways to address our recommendations and to capture these perspectives in any congressional consideration of changing the current U.S. bank oversight structure. Therefore, we have incorporated the agencies\u2019 insights in the report where appropriate. In addition, we have included descriptions of the interagency efforts discussed in the agencies\u2019 responses to improve coordination and cooperation and reduce regulatory burden."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
