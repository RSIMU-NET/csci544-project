These  veterans also have a high risk of premature death, including suicide.  For  many of them, effective treatment, especially antipsychotic drug therapy,  has reduced the severity of their illnesses and increased their ability to  function in society.  In fiscal year 2000, VA spent $1.1 billion to provide  psychiatric care for almost 200,000 veterans with psychosis.  Of this  amount, $123 million was spent on antipsychotic drugs.  In fiscal year 2001,  the amount for antipsychotic drugs jumped 29 percent to $158 million\u2014or  7 percent of VA\u2019s total drug costs.", "Since 1989, new antipsychotic drugs have been approved in the United  States.  These new \u201catypical\u201d drugs are effective and much less likely to  cause involuntary body and facial movements, tremors, and contractions  associated with the traditional drugs for schizophrenics.  However, atypical  antipsychotic drugs are expensive, and the cost differences among them  can vary significantly.  All atypical antipsychotic drugs are on VA\u2019s national  formulary, except the newest, which is available through nonformulary  approval processes.  To ensure that veterans with mental disorders receive  the most appropriate yet cost-effective drug, VA issued a guideline in July  2001 for prescribing atypical antipsychotic drugs for newly diagnosed  patients or for patients not responding favorably to their current  medication.  According to VA officials, the guideline was needed to better  manage the cost associated with atypical antipsychotic drugs and the effect  of the drug companies\u2019 marketing of these drugs to physicians.  However,  the guideline emphasizes that clinical factors rather than cost ultimately  determine physicians\u2019 prescribing decisions.", "You asked us to review whether this guideline may result in restricted  access to the more costly atypical antipsychotic drugs and, in turn,  adversely affect the quality of care for veterans.  To address these  concerns, you asked us to determine (1) if VA's clinical guideline for  prescribing atypical antipsychotic drugs is consistent with medical  community practices for managing serious mental illnesses and  (2) whether implementation of the guideline is consistent with its intent to  ensure that prescribing decisions are ultimately based on physicians\u2019  clinical judgment.", "To conduct our work, we interviewed or obtained documents from VA  officials responsible for developing the guideline, representatives from  federal agencies responsible for mental health issues, professional medical  organizations, mental health advocacy groups, private mental health care  providers, private pharmacy benefits management companies, and state  Medicaid or mental health departments in California, Florida, Georgia,  Massachusetts, and Texas.  Also, we obtained and reviewed four clinical  guidelines for antipsychotic drug use that are widely accepted by public  and private health systems.  Further, we contacted pharmacists in each of  VA\u2019s 22 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) and visited or  contacted 14 facilities in 8 of them to determine whether the guideline was  being used. We also surveyed VA psychiatrists about how the guideline  affected their prescribing practices.  In addition, we reviewed VA  antipsychotic drug utilization data for each VISN and its medical facilities.   (For more information on our methodology, see appendix I.)  We  conducted our work from September 2001 through April 2002 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Over the past several decades, the introduction of two types of drugs\u2014 traditional and atypical antipsychotic drugs\u2014for treating schizophrenia,  and in some cases, bipolar disorder, have enabled physicians to better  manage their patients\u2019 mental illnesses, resulting in a better quality of life  for many veterans.  Because schizophrenia severely impairs thinking,  language, perception, mood, and behavior, schizophrenics often withdraw  from society and retreat into a world of delusions, hallucinations, and  fantasies.  With drug treatment, approximately 60 to 70 percent of  schizophrenics experience either complete remission or only mild  symptoms of the disease; the remaining 30 to 40 percent continue to  experience psychotic symptoms.  Most patients with schizophrenia are  maintained on antipsychotic drugs throughout their lives since symptoms  return in over 70 percent of stable patients who stop taking their drugs.", "Bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, is characterized  by extreme and unpredictable mood swings, ranging from high excitement  or euphoria\u2014where the patient is energetic and confident\u2014to despair or  deep depression, where the patient may feel sad, helpless, apathetic, angry,  or suicidal.  As with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder can impair a patient\u2019s  ability to function.  To control bipolar episodes, physicians often prescribe  mood-stabilizing drugs, but in cases where these drugs are not effective,  physicians may prescribe antipsychotic drugs on a short-term basis.  The  introduction of traditional and atypical antipsychotic drugs has also helped  facilitate a shift in treatment settings for adults with severe mental illness,  both in the VA system and in the general medical community, from  expensive inpatient care in hospitals to less costly outpatient care in  community-based treatment facilities.", "Traditional antipsychotic drugs were first introduced in the 1950s.  While  these drugs are effective in treating psychosis, they can often cause severe  side effects, such as involuntary body and facial movements, tremors, and  contractions.  For example, after 5 years of taking traditional drugs,  patients have a 32 percent chance of developing a sometimes irreversible  movement disorder, and after 25 years, they have a 68 percent chance.  The  Food and Drug Administration first approved atypical antipsychotic drugs  in 1989, and five are currently available for use. (See table 1.)  They are  considered as effective as traditional drugs in treating psychosis, but they  are much less likely to cause the severe involuntary movements associated  with the traditional drugs.  While atypical drugs also have side effects\u2014 some of which can be serious\u2014most occur with less severity than the side  effects associated with traditional drugs.  The side effects vary among the  atypical drugs and include sedation, sexual dysfunction, cardiac problems,   and sudden drops in blood pressure.  Additional side effects are weight  gain and elevated cholesterol that could lead to heart disease and diabetes.   Various studies and psychiatrists we interviewed have concluded that  because the side effects are reduced, patients are more likely to stay on  their drug therapy and have fewer relapses of psychosis when taking  atypical antipsychotic drugs.", "Over the last few years, the number of prescriptions for atypical  antipsychotic drugs has increased dramatically in VA.  In fiscal year 1999,  62 percent of all antipsychotic drug prescriptions were for atypical drugs;  by fiscal year 2001, more than 80 percent were for atypical drugs.", "Antipsychotic drugs\u2014both traditional and atypical\u2014are VA\u2019s third most  expensive class of drugs.  In fiscal year 2001, VA filled more than 1.5  million 30-day antipsychotic prescriptions for more than 176,000 patients at  a cost of $158 million, accounting for 7 percent of its total pharmacy  budget. Overall, atypical antipsychotic drugs are more costly than  traditional antipsychotic drugs.  For VA, the average daily cost of atypical  drugs is about 17 times higher than the average daily cost of traditional  drugs.  However, the average daily cost among atypical drugs varies.  In  fiscal year 2001, clozapine cost about $8 a day per patient, while quetiapine  cost less than $3 a day. (See fig. 1.)", "In 2001, 30-day prescriptions were written for all five atypical antipsychotic  drugs, with olanzapine and risperidone prescribed most often to veterans.  (See fig. 2.)", "In 2001, most patients began treatment on risperidone, olanzapine, or  quetiapine. (See fig. 3.)", "Choosing which atypical antipsychotic drug to prescribe for patients can be  difficult.  Experts have concluded that the scientific evidence is not  sufficient to favor any one of the atypical drugs.  Each has been proven  effective in clinical trials, but effectiveness appears to depend on the  particular patient.  A panel of academic researchers reviewed available  scientific evidence in 1999 and concluded that the three most widely used  atypicals\u2014risperidone, quetiapine, and olanzapine\u2014are comparable in  efficacy, safety, and patient tolerability.  The Cochrane Collaboration, an  organization that systematically reviews randomized clinical medical trials,  reviewed the evidence comparing two of the atypical drugs, risperidone  and olanzapine.  It concluded that little evidence exists to suggest  choosing one drug over the other.  Three internal VA panels in the last 3  years agreed that none of the three most widely used atypical drugs could  be judged better than the others.", "Studies conducted by drug manufacturers have been inconclusive in  comparing atypical drugs.  The studies often were too short in duration to  draw conclusions about the drugs\u2019 long-term effects.  In addition, many  studies excluded substance abusers and those who were violent and  uncooperative\u2014a significant problem in determining effectiveness because  many schizophrenics meet these criteria.", "The National Institute of Mental Health has recently funded a $42 million  study that will compare the five atypical antipsychotic drugs available  today to each other and to a traditional antipsychotic drug.  This study, the  Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE), will  examine 1,800 schizophrenic patients, including patients with substance  abuse and other medical problems.  Four VA facilities are among the 53  medical facilities participating in CATIE.  One of the objectives of the  CATIE study is to identify specific patient profiles for each drug in order to  guide physicians in selecting the best atypical drug for their patients.  The  study\u2019s results are expected to be available by 2006.", "VA physicians are generally free to prescribe any drug on the formulary.   VISNs and facilities can place restrictions on some drugs that require close  monitoring to ensure appropriate use, but these restrictions cannot be  based solely on cost.  Usually psychiatrists are the practitioners that  prescribe atypical drugs for psychotic patients, although some facilities  allow other types of physicians to write refill prescriptions or to prescribe  these drugs for nonpsychotic patients with dementia or diseases such as  Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s.  VA policy requires that all drugs on the  formulary be available at each VA pharmacy.  VA further requires its 22  VISNs to establish approval processes for prescribers to obtain drugs not  listed on their formularies.  In addition, to provide flexibility in meeting  local patient needs, VA allows VISNs to add drugs to network formularies  to supplement the national formulary.  Pharmacy and Therapeutics  committees in each VISN, consisting of physicians, pharmacists, and other  health care professionals are usually responsible for selecting these  additional drugs.", "According to VA\u2019s Pharmacy Benefits Management Strategic Health Care  Group\u2019s Medical Advisory Panel officials, VA chose not to limit the  number of atypical drugs available on the formulary because such limits  potentially restrict physicians\u2019 ability to prescribe the most appropriate  drug for their patients.  Four of the five atypical antipsychotic drugs\u2014 olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and clozapine\u2014are listed on VA\u2019s  national formulary.  The fifth, ziprasidone, which the Food and Drug  Administration approved in 2001, is not listed on the national formulary,  but is available through local nonformulary approval processes.  VA  generally does not place drugs on the formulary until they have been on the  market at least 1 year.", "To educate physicians about the increasing importance and cost of atypical  antipsychotics and to provide uniform information in the face of increasing  pharmaceutical industry marketing to VA psychiatrists, VA issued the  guideline for prescribing atypical antipsychotics to supplement VA\u2019s overall  treatment guidelines for managing patients with psychosis.  In addition to  discussing appropriate drug therapy, the overall treatment guidelines  include sections on the evaluation, diagnosis, and social rehabilitation of  patients with psychoses.  The overall treatment guidelines currently  recommend that psychiatrists treating patients with psychosis either  prescribe moderate doses of traditional antipsychotic drugs or prescribe  atypical antipsychotic drugs.  VA is currently revising the guidelines for  managing patients with psychosis, including recommending atypical drugs  before traditional drugs for these patients.", "While the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) and the National  Mental Health Association stated that physicians could consider cost when  prescribing antipsychotic drugs, each has voiced concerns that some local  VA officials might use the guideline more stringently to cut costs\u2014either by  restricting physician access to more expensive atypical drugs for new  patients or by switching stable patients to the less expensive atypical  drugs.  Officials from the American Psychiatric Association and the  National Association of VA Physicians and Dentists have expressed similar  concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Prescribing Guideline for Atypical Antipsychotic Drugs Is Sound", "paragraphs": ["VA\u2019s guideline for prescribing atypical antipsychotic drugs is consistent  with published clinical practice guidelines commonly used by public and  private health care systems.

VA\u2019s  prescribing guideline for atypical antipsychotic drugs is reprinted in  appendix II.  For information on how the guideline was developed, see  appendix III.  Specifically, VA\u2019s guideline states that  the guideline is to be used only for new patients or for patients not  responding favorably to traditional medications,  therapy is ultimately based on physicians\u2019 assessment of patient needs  and the guidelines are not intended to interfere with clinical judgment,  and  because no consensus exists in scientific literature to support that one  atypical antipsychotic drug is superior to another, physicians should  begin treatment with one of the less expensive atypical antipsychotic  drugs on VA\u2019s national formulary if there are no patient specific reasons  to prescribe one drug over another.", "For cases where no clinical reason exists to prescribe one atypical drug  over another, VA\u2019s guideline includes an algorithm showing the suggested  treatment order for prescribing the four atypical antipsychotic drugs on  VA\u2019s formulary.  The guideline\u2019s algorithm recommends that physicians first  prescribe risperidone or quetiapine, in either order, to patients with a first  episode of psychosis or patients with chronic psychosis who have relapsed.   The algorithm lists olanzapine as the next drug that physicians should try,  and clozapine as the last drug.  The guideline\u2019s treatment order reflects VA\u2019s  prices of the drugs\u2014risperidone and quetiapine are significantly less  expensive than olanzapine.  Clozapine is not only the most expensive drug,  but it is seldom used because of its risk of causing a life-threatening blood  disorder.  Because ziprasidone has only recently received Food and Drug  Administration approval, it is not included on VA\u2019s national formulary, and  it is not included in the algorithm.  However, the guideline states that it may  be considered for patients with intolerance or a poor response to the other  atypical drugs.", "In the preface to its algorithm VA\u2019s prescribing guideline discusses the  importance of cost-effective high quality care.  According to officials  responsible for developing the TMAP and PORT guidelines, their guidelines  did not include cost because they were meant to be broad and apply to a  wide variety of organizations.  Nevertheless, some health care systems that  use these guidelines also consider cost.  For example, the Texas  Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation has a supplemental  policy that recommends using the less expensive atypical antipsychotics  before other atypicals when appropriate.  It asks its physicians to choose  the least expensive of the three drugs recommended by TMAP for new  patients when their clinical judgment does not indicate the use of one  atypical drug over another.  The Massachusetts Medicaid behavioral health  program has a similar approach.  It follows the PORT guidelines, and in  1999 issued a memorandum with additional guidance and a cost-  effectiveness study to its psychiatrists pointing out that risperidone was  less expensive and just as effective as olanzapine for new patients.  The  memorandum and study were issued to highlight the importance of using  cost as a factor in deciding which drug to prescribe."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Experts Acknowledge That Using Cost as a Factor Is Reasonable and Appropriate", "paragraphs": ["Because available scientific evidence and expert opinion suggest that all  atypical drugs are appropriate treatment for psychosis, incorporating cost  into VA\u2019s prescribing guideline is reasonable, appropriate, and consistent  with providing cost-effective health care.  The Institute of Medicine has  concluded that when no marginal therapeutic benefit is expected from  more expensive drugs, guideline developers may reasonably recommend  less expensive drugs.", "Almost all of the psychiatric experts we interviewed\u2014including those in  charge of TMAP and PORT\u2014said that asking physicians to consider drug  cost as a factor when prescribing atypical antipsychotic drugs is  reasonable, appropriate, and consistent with providing cost-effective  quality medical care to patients.  Psychiatrists from the National Institute  of Mental Health, which funds antipsychotic drug research, also agreed that  it was appropriate for psychiatrists to consider less expensive atypical  drugs.  The co-chairman of VA\u2019s Committee on Care of Severely Chronically  Mentally Ill Veterans stated that the VA guideline represents quality  medical care because no scientific evidence exists to recommend one drug  over another and because physicians make the final prescribing decisions  based on their medical judgment.", "State mental health officials from California, Georgia, and Florida\u2014states  that do not use cost to rank medications\u2014recognize the importance of  considering costs when choosing among them.  For example, the medical  director of Georgia\u2019s Division of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and  Substance Abuse stated that in the face of recent state budget cuts of 2.5 to  5 percent, the state may consider adopting guidelines similar to VA\u2019s that  include cost as a factor.

Two other formulary leaders reported that their VISNs were using different  guidelines\u2014one VISN modified the guideline to include ziprasidone in the  algorithm and the other VISN developed a guideline that does not suggest a  treatment order or use cost as a determining factor under any  circumstances.  The remaining two formulary leaders stated that their  VISNs do not use guidelines for prescribing atypical antipsychotic drugs.", "In implementing VA\u2019s prescribing guideline, some VISNs simply distributed  the guideline to facilities for use, and some facilities combined guideline  distribution with group discussions on the costs of atypical antipsychotic  drugs.  Officials from one VISN distributed the guideline to its facilities  along with pocket-sized cards for each psychiatrist showing the prices and  doses for every antipsychotic drug.  Despite the fact that most VISNs use  the guideline, not all psychiatrists told us they were aware of it.   Specifically, in our survey we asked psychiatrists if they had seen or been  briefed on the prescribing guideline.  Of those responding, 66 percent  reported that they had, 11 percent reported that they were unsure, and 23  percent reported that they had not.", "In addition, formulary leaders, psychiatrists, and pharmacists in five VISNs  told us that several facilities require physicians to follow additional policies  and procedures for prescribing atypical antipsychotic drugs.

These psychiatrists are generally  concentrated in a few VISNs.  For example, in VISN 22, 33 percent of  responding psychiatrists reported that they did not feel free to prescribe  the atypical antipsychotic drug that they believed was best for some of  their patients, and in VISN 18, the rate was 22 percent.  Three other VISNs  had rates of more than 10 percent.  Conversely, four VISNs had no  psychiatrists who felt they could not exercise their clinical judgment in  prescribing these drugs.

For example, the  Miami VA Medical Center no longer requires physicians to first select  among the traditional antipsychotic drugs before prescribing any atypical  drugs, but it does require that psychiatrists prescribe risperidone and  quetiapine before prescribing olanzapine.  The chief pharmacist at the  center told us that this policy was implemented to control cost.  This policy  conflicts with the prescribing guideline, because cost has greater weight  than physicians\u2019 clinical judgment.  Furthermore, VA psychiatrists at other  facilities reported that their managers exerted pressure to prescribe the  lower cost atypical drugs.  One psychiatrist stated that facility  administrators pushed for prescribing less expensive atypical drugs, even  though the psychiatrist\u2019s evaluation of some patients indicated that these  drugs would be less effective than the more costly atypical drug  olanzapine.  In addition, 31 of the 876 psychiatrists that we included in our  survey analysis reported that they believed prescribing high-cost atypical  antipsychotic drugs could affect their performance ratings.", "About 22 percent of the psychiatrists who responded to our survey  reported that they are required to follow additional VISN or facility  procedures for prescribing olanzapine.  While these procedures help the  facility manage pharmaceutical use, they have the potential to  overemphasize cost-containment if they put pressure on physicians to  prescribe the less expensive drugs.  Examples where this could happen are  discussed below.", "In VA\u2019s Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, Los Angeles, California,  part of VISN 22, all psychiatrists provide written justifications for  olanzapine prescriptions, which are reviewed by pharmacists or senior  psychiatrists.

For nonroutine requests\u2014such as those for new patients  who have not previously taken atypical antipsychotic drugs\u2014the  pharmacist forwards the request and written justification to a senior  psychiatrist who reviews them and may discuss recommended  treatment options with the prescribing physician.  In the 4 months  after the prescribing guideline was implemented, 11 percent of all  olanzapine requests were denied as part of its cost containment  procedures.  However, according to a member of the facility\u2019s Pharmacy  and Therapeutics Committee, the facility may eliminate these cost- control measures entirely as a result of a January 2002 notice from the  Under Secretary for Health that discusses VA policy when treating  patients with psychosis.", "The VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, California, part of  VISN 22, also regulates olanzapine use, but it does not require  prescribing physicians to provide written justification.  Instead,  pharmacists trained in the use of drugs to treat mental illness are  required to review all prescriptions for olanzapine and discuss  treatment options with prescribing physicians, recommending the lower  cost risperidone or quetiapine first for patients who have not tried them.   For cases where the psychiatrist does not agree with the pharmacist\u2019s  recommendation, the case is forwarded to the chief psychiatrist or the  facility\u2019s pharmacy and therapeutics committee for final approval or  denial.", "The Carl T.

If the matter is still not resolved, another psychiatrist will  review the case.  If the original prescribing psychiatrist still disagrees  with the recommendation, the matter is referred to and decided by the  facility\u2019s chief of medicine.  In addition, psychiatrists have been asked to  examine their cases of veterans who are currently on olanzapine to  determine if these veterans could be switched to a less expensive  atypical drug.

Such consultations provide vital information for  consideration by physicians when choosing the most appropriate drugs for  their patients with psychosis, and nationally the vast majority of  psychiatrists report that their clinical judgment, not cost factors,  determines which atypical drugs they prescribe.

VA also stated that VHA would continue to  routinely monitor prescribing patterns of atypical antipsychotic drugs  through its national drug utilization database in order to identify and  address any outliers in drug usage that might become apparent.  However,  we found that while VHA was periodically reviewing atypical antipsychotic  drug utilization mainly at the national and VISN levels, it had no formal plan  to systematically review the data to monitor compliance with the guideline  at the facility level. Thus, we caution VA from relying too heavily on  national and VISN data.  Doing so might not detect individual facility  policies that could restrict access to the more costly atypical antipsychotic  drugs.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs;  appropriate congressional committees; and other interested parties.

These guidelines are not intended to interfere with clinical judgment.  Rather, they are intended to assist practitioners in providing cost effective, consistent, high quality care.  The following recommendations are dynamic and will be revised, as new clinical data become available. 1)  Prioritize the use of atypical antipsychotic medication for new antipsychotic medication starts and for patients not      responding to or having problematic side effects on typical antipsychotic medication. 2) Though differences in the clinical effectiveness and pharmacoeconomic profile of the atypicals have been suggested by      some studies, there is no consensus in the literature to support one being globally superior to another; therefore, once      the physician determines there are no patient specific issues, begin therapy with an effective, less expensive agent.", "At the present time, this would lead to the preference of quetiapine and risperidone over olanzapine. 3)  Utilize current local approaches of clinical assessment to determine response to medication and whether medication      changes are indicated.

The draft  guideline was then reviewed and modified by the Medical Advisory Panel  and VA mental health officials.  VISN pharmacy leaders and the Medical  Advisory Panel approved the guideline.  In July 2001, VA Pharmacy Benefits  Management posted the guideline to its web site and sent it to the VISNs.   In the past, VA Pharmacy Benefits Management has used the same process  to develop several similar guidelines for prescribing other classes of drugs.   The Institute of Medicine, in a recent report on VA\u2019s national formulary,  commended VA for these previous pharmacy-specific guidelines, stating  that they were based on current scientific and clinical research data and its recommendations were consistent with recommendations of other leading  medical organizations.", "VA\u2019s commissioning of a task force of health care professionals to review  medical literature and develop a guideline based on that literature is an  accepted practice.
