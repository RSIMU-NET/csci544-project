Table 1.1 compares the number of publicly and privately owned U.S. airports in 1995.", "Of the 4,172 publicly owned airports, 565 (14 percent) are commercial service airports. Commercial service airports (referred to as commercial airports in this report) are legally defined as airports (1) with scheduled passenger service, (2) that annually enplane 2,500 or more passengers, and (3) that are publicly owned. FAA has identified nine additional airports\u2014seven of which are privately owned\u2014that would qualify for commercial status on the basis of the amount of annual passenger traffic but do not qualify because they are privately owned or do not have scheduled airline service.", "Airline passenger traffic is highly concentrated at the largest commercial airports. The 29 large hub airports accounted for over 67 percent of all passenger enplanements in 1995, the last year for which figures were available. The 42 medium hub airports accounted for another 22 percent of annual enplanements in the same year. Figure 1.1 depicts the concentration of passenger traffic at the largest commercial airports. 29 Large hub 67.2% 67 Small hub 7.1% 42 Medium hub 22.2% Public ownership of commercial airports varies. Most public owners are local governments, such as cities or counties. However, in many instances, local and state governments form special governmental entities, such as single-purpose airport authorities or port districts to manage airports as well as other transportation-related infrastructure. The legal and other relationships between a local or state government and a special governmental entity vary, but most local or state governments exert some level of control over them. A few states, such as Alaska, Hawaii, and Maryland, also own airports. For example, Maryland owns the Baltimore-Washington International Airport. The federal government owns two major airports\u2014Washington Dulles International Airport and Washington National Airport\u2014and has leased them to a public entity, the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Federal Role in Financing Airport Development", "paragraphs": ["Federal grants have played a critical role in building the nation\u2019s airport infrastructure.

All of these sources of capital are affected by federal policies. Figure 1.2 depicts the average percentage contribution of each of these sources of capital at 53 large and medium hub airports in 1994.", "The percentages for large hubs do not add to 100 because of rounding.", "For smaller airports, federal grants constitute a larger portion of their total capital because the other sources are not as accessible.

Since 1970, airport grants have been financed by the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which is financed from taxes on domestic and international airline travel, domestic cargo transported by air, and noncommercial aviation fuel. AIP, the current federal airport grant program, was established by the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982, as amended, and is administered by FAA. AIP grants help finance projects that enhance airports\u2019 capacity, safety, security, and noise mitigation.", "There are two categories of AIP grants\u2014apportionment and discretionary. Apportionment grants are distributed by formula to commercial airports (with more than 10,000 annual passenger enplanements) and states. Discretionary grants can generally be used for any eligible airport development project. The Congress has earmarked or \u201cset-aside\u201d some AIP discretionary funding for certain types of projects or airports. About 3,300 (18 percent) of the nation\u2019s airports are eligible to receive AIP grants. All airports receiving AIP grants must provide a \u201cmatching share\u201d, ranging from 10 to 25 percent of a project\u2019s total cost, depending on the type of project and size of the airport.", "In fiscal year 1995, AIP grants to commercial airports totaled more than $1.2 billion, or about 80 percent of all grant obligations. The remaining 20 percent was directed to general aviation airports. A larger airport would generally receive more in airport grants than a smaller airport because larger airports enplane more passengers and have greater funding needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Passenger Facility Charges Augment Grants", "paragraphs": ["To augment grants from the AIP, in 1990 the Congress authorized commercial airports to impose a PFC. This authorization enables airports to charge each passenger a $1, $2, or $3 facility charge per trip segment up to a maximum of four segments per round trip. After determining which projects to fund with PFCs, an airport must apply to FAA for approval. Large and medium hub airports that collect PFCs must forgo up to 50 percent of their AIP apportionment funding, most of which is used to provide additional funding for smaller airports. As of February, 1996, just 4 years after the first PFC was approved, FAA had approved PFC collections at 244 airports. In 1995, PFC collections totaled about $1 billion.

Bond market professionals and a recent FAA study estimate that if airports did not have tax-exempt status, the interest rate on their debt would be about 2 percentage points higher. Bonds are the largest single source of capital for large and medium hub airports. From 1985 through mid-1995, over $42 billion in new and refinanced airport bonds were issued in the United States. According to one credit rating agency, an estimated $25 billion in bonds is currently outstanding. Airport bonds, which are issued by airport sponsors, are one of two types. The most common for larger airports are revenue bonds, which are secured by airport revenue. Less common are general obligation bonds, which are secured by the taxing authority and the full faith and credit of the issuing public airport owner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agreements With Airlines and FAA Rules Place Limits on Airport Revenue", "paragraphs": ["Airport revenue is unlike other sources of airport capital for two reasons. First, airport revenue is used to fund both current operating costs as well as capital investment. Second, future airport revenue is typically used to secure outstanding airport debt and, therefore, may not be fully available to secure new debt issues or directly fund capital projects.", "Most commercial airports have agreements that define their financial relationship with tenant airlines. These agreements, commonly termed \u201cairport use agreements\u201d are often long-term, sometimes running 20 years or more, although there has been a trend towards shorter-term agreements. Typically, these agreements set airline rates and charges using either a \u201cresidual\u201d or \u201ccompensatory\u201d cost approach or a combination of both approaches. With the residual approach, the airlines collectively assume significant financial risk by agreeing to pay any costs of running the airport that are not allocated to other users or covered by nonairline revenue. Any surplus revenue is credited to the airlines and any deficit is charged to them in calculating their rates and charges for the following year. With the compensatory approach, the airport operator assumes the major financial risk of running the airport and sets rates and charges to recover the costs of the facilities and services that the airlines use.", "Under FAA\u2019s rules regarding rates and charges to airlines, landing fees must be based on formulas which only permit an airport to recover the historic costs of its airfield assets (generally the cost to acquire land and develop the airfield), including debt-related expenses. Therefore, an airport may not revalue airfield assets in the absence of modifications or improvements to those assets. Also, that portion of assets acquired with AIP or PFC funds is not considered airport assets for the purpose of cost recovery through airline fees."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Infrastructure Privatization Efforts in the United States", "paragraphs": ["Infrastructure privatization initiatives extend across local, state, and federal governments and include such diverse services as education, housing, utilities, and transportation.

Under this order, local and state governments (where permitted by law) would be able to recover the unadjusted dollar amount of their portion of an asset\u2019s total costs from sale or lease proceeds. From any remaining proceeds, the federal government would receive its share of grants associated with the asset, less the depreciated value of the asset. In 1994, the President issued a subsequent order on infrastructure investment, Executive Order 12893, which directs executive agencies to minimize regulatory and legal barriers to private participation in providing infrastructure facilities and services.", "Despite these executive orders and other federal initiatives, very few sales or leases of federally funded infrastructure assets have occurred. In 1995, the first and only privatization under Executive Order 12803 occurred, with the long-term lease of a waste water treatment plant in Hamilton, Ohio. According to a privatization expert, the federal government waived its share of the lease proceeds because it considered the plant to be fully depreciated.", "Legislation was introduced in the 104th Congress to expand the private ownership of public infrastructure. In 1995, bills were introduced in both the House and Senate (H.R. 1907 and S. 1063, \u201cFederal Aid Facility Privatization Act of 1995\u201d) that would waive the federal government\u2019s claim to any proceeds from privatizing any locally owned or state-owned facility that had received federal aid.

To measure private and public sector participation in airport operations, we surveyed 69 large and medium hub airports and requested the number of private and public full-time-equivalent positions there. We received responses from all 69 airports. To assess the levels of private and public financing, we analyzed several sets of data, including FAA\u2019s information on federal grants and airport enplanements, Van Kampen American Capital Management\u2019s information on 85 airports\u2019 financial statements, and the Securities Data Company\u2019s information on all airport bonds issued between 1985 and 1994. While we did not audit the accuracy of the databases, we did some limited cross-checking of information and found that it was accurate. To obtain information on privatization in foreign countries, we relied on a study by the World Bank, a survey by Public Works Financing, and studies of international airport finance.We also spoke with officials of two foreign countries and four airport management companies concerning planned or completed privatizations and reviewed pertinent studies and documents relating to airport operations and financing.", "To assess the incentives and barriers to privatization, we spoke to a broad array of interested parties, including officials representing 13 airports, airport and airline interest groups, airlines, airport management firms, investment banks, credit rating agencies, the Department of Transportation, and FAA. Among the 13 airports we selected to visit are 9 that have at one time considered privatization. At these airports, we reviewed any feasibility studies and legal analyses they had conducted relating to privatization. We surveyed representatives from 13 domestic airlines to obtain their positions on airport privatization and their reasons for supporting or opposing the concept. We also met with representatives of four of the largest airport management firms operating in the United States and airport consultants to discuss impediments they have encountered in structuring privatization bids. Similarly, we met with representatives of three major credit rating agencies and several firms active in municipal finance to discuss economic benefits and impediments to privatization. Finally, we met with lawyers active in airport law and FAA counsel to discuss legal impediments to privatization. We also researched all applicable federal statutes, FAA policies, legal opinions, and court cases to determine how various laws may affect the sale or lease of airports.", "We also assessed the possible implications and policy considerations of selling or leasing airports on airlines; passengers; and local, state, and federal governments.

Also, the Secretary must determine that the sale or lease agreement would meet several conditions, including the following: the airport would remain available to public use; airport operations would not be interrupted if the operator went bankrupt; the private owner or lessee would maintain and improve the facilities; airline fees would not increase faster than the rate of inflation, unless a higher amount is approved by 65 percent of the airlines that service the airport; general aviation fees would not increase faster than airline fees; safety and security would be maintained at the highest levels; and noise and environmental effects would be mitigated to the same extent as at a publicly owned airport.", "An airport would remain eligible for the pilot program and any associated exemptions to revenue diversion, grant repayment, or surplus property requirements as long as its facilities continue to be used for airport purposes. The Secretary may, however, revoke an exemption upon determining that the owner or lessee knowingly violated any of the conditions set forth in the statute governing the pilot program.", "According to FAA and aviation industry officials, it is too early to know which airports might be interested in applying for this pilot program or if any airports could qualify for it and gain the support of their tenant airlines. However, the public owners of two airports\u2014Allegheny County Airport, a general aviation airport in Pennsylvania, and Stewart International Airport, a former military air base in New York\u2014have expressed interest in the program\u2019s innovative arrangements. The Department of Transportation and FAA are charged with reporting to the Congress within 2 years after the first application is approved on the pilot program\u2019s implementation and are authorized under the program to audit a private owner\u2019s or lessee\u2019s financial records and operations in order to monitor its compliance with the program\u2019s requirements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Private Management Contracts and Leases for the Operation of Publicly Owned Airports in the United States", "paragraphs": ["Airport Group International (AGI)", "Direct and indirect costs, plus a management fee of $331,680 (inflation adjusted)", "Johnson Controls World Services, Inc.
