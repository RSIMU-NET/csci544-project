Many cases it does investigate are unproductive because the business does not owe the return IRS expects. GAO was asked to assess (1) the data challenges of estimating the business nonfiler tax gap, (2) how recent program changes have affected IRS's capacity to identify and pursue business nonfilers, and (3) additional opportunities for IRS to use third-party data. GAO reviewed IRS's tax gap estimates, nonfiler program processes and procedures, and matched closed nonfiler cases with various other data."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["IRS cannot develop a comprehensive estimate of the business nonfiling rate and associated tax gap because it lacks data about the population of all businesses. However, IRS could develop a partial estimate using its business nonfiler inventory. IRS identifies several million potential business nonfilers each year, more than it can thoroughly investigate. IRS could take a random sample of its inventory, thoroughly investigate those cases, and use the results to estimate the proportion of actual nonfilers in its inventory of potential nonfilers. Until recently IRS has not had a way to prioritize cases in its large inventory. IRS modernized its business nonfiler program in 2009 by incorporating income and other data in its records indicating business activity. Active businesses generally have an obligation to file a return. IRS's Business Master File Case Creation Nonfiler Identification Process (BMF CCNIP) now assigns each case a code based on this data. IRS uses the code to select cases to work with the goal of securing tax returns from nonfilers and collecting additional revenue. This is a significant modernization, but IRS lacks a formal plan to evaluate how well the codes are working. IRS has performance information on its individual nonfiler program but less on its business nonfiler program. Key management reports needed to provide program data are under development but no deadline has been set. IRS could also use more information on why many nonfiler cases are unproductive. This could potentially lead IRS to identify actions that could reduce IRS resources used on these cases and associated taxpayer burden. GAO identified several opportunities including the following to enhance IRS's identification and pursuit of business nonfilers. (1) The new BMF CCNIP selection codes provide a quick way to verify taxpayer statements that a business has ceased operations and does not need to file a return. Collections staff have been instructed to use the codes when making case closure decisions. They were previously instructed to use other income data but GAO's analysis indicated this may not have been done in all cases. (2) Non-IRS data on businesses including federal contractors could be used to verify taxpayer statements about whether a tax return should have been filed. GAO's analysis of cases in two states that were closed as not liable to file a return found 7,688 businesses where non-IRS data showed business activity as measured by sales totaling $4.1 billion. GAO also found cases closed as not liable to file a return involving 13,852 businesses on the federal contractor registry. GAO's analyses illustrated the potential value of non-IRS data but GAO did not assess which non-IRS data would be most useful nor examine the capacity of IRS's systems to use such data on a large scale."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue develop a partial business nonfiler rate estimate; set a deadline for developing performance data; develop a plan for evaluating the selection codes; reinforce the need to use income data and selection codes in verifying taxpayer statements; and study the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of using non-IRS data to verify taxpayer statements. In written comments on a draft of this report IRS agreed that identifying and pursuing active business nonfilers is key to enforcement efforts and acknowledged that our recommendations could assist these efforts. IRS agreed with four of GAO's recommendations and indicated some steps it would take to address the other four."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2009, businesses filed 14 million income tax returns and   30 million employment tax returns and remitted over $1 trillion in federal  taxes.

On its EIN application, a business  gives IRS information about its structure and whether or not it has  employees. Based on this information, IRS establishes an account for the  business, notifies the business of its EIN and filing requirement, and  records its filing requirement on IRS\u2019s BMF. The filing requirements on the  BMF are the basis for IRS\u2019s efforts to ensure that businesses file their  required returns. Businesses may have to file several types of returns. A  business that does not file the return in IRS\u2019s records by the due date  including any extensions is considered by IRS to be a potential nonfiler.  This is the case including where the business has filed a different return  than the one IRS expects, e.g., where a partnership has restructured itself  as a corporation and filed a corporate return.

A business with employees, regardless of its structure, is generally  required to file employment tax returns.

Businesses structured as C corporations are generally  required to file annual income tax returns including when they did not  have taxable income. C corporations pay the corporate income tax. Other  types of businesses including businesses structured as S corporations and  partnerships are required to also file annual returns, but their income is  not taxable at the business level.

The Strategy further noted that IRS did not apply resources to  more productive business nonfiler cases but rather to cases closed with a  determination that the taxpayer did not owe IRS a tax return. As one of  several goals, the Strategy proposed to expand the use of third-party  information and research tools to enhance identification, selection and  resolution of nonfiler cases. The Strategy also set a goal of developing and  implementing consistent Servicewide performance and outcome measures  to determine the impact of its initiatives on filing compliance.", "To provide Servicewide oversight for all IRS nonfiler initiatives and  actions, IRS established the Nonfiler Executive Advisory Council  (NFEAC), a Servicewide body chartered by the IRS Enforcement  Committee and consisting of representatives from all IRS divisions.

This number should increase once information return requirements for  reporting businesses credit card payments go into effect in 2012 and  requirements for reporting service payments made to corporations go into  effect in 2013. Even after these payments are reported to IRS, certain other  payments made with cash or by check will not be subject to information  reporting. However, there are a number of private sector companies that  maintain business activity data, such as data on a business\u2019s gross sales  and number of employees, which might help IRS identify business  nonfilers and help it determine whether a business is required to file tax  returns. While IRS does not use private sector data to help it determine  whether a business should file a tax return, it does have contracts with  private sector companies for locating taxpayers\u2019 assets and obtaining  credit reports on taxpayers that can be used by its collection field staff  during their investigations.", "To test whether private sector data on business activity could be useful for  determining whether businesses are liable for filing tax returns, we  matched tax year 2007 nonfiler cases that IRS closed as not liable to file  returns with a calendar year 2007 Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) database of  businesses located in California and Illinois.

This initiative gives IRS for the first  time a way to set priorities among its voluminous inventory by making use  of information return and other IRS data to predict the likelihood that IRS  will secure additional returns and revenue. This initiative should help IRS  choose cases to work, but without an estimate of the business nonfiler tax  gap, IRS does not have a data-driven basis for allocating resources to its  business nonfiler efforts.", "While IRS has made good progress in implementing BMF CCNIP, it has not  calculated the performance measures or planned the evaluations it would  need to assess success. IRS also has little data on why it identifies millions  of potential business nonfilers only to find that many of them do not owe  IRS the return IRS is expecting based on its records.

The  intent of our recommendation, however, was to have IRS develop an  estimate of the number of businesses that were actually liable for filing  returns, which would exclude businesses that were not liable to file  returns. It is not clear from IRS\u2019s response whether it intends to do the  study we recommended or if IRS plans to report only the results currently  available from its business nonfiler program.

We analyzed Business Master File Case Creation Nonfiler  Identification Process (BMF CCNIP) inventory data to determine the  number of potential business nonfilers IRS identifies and analyzed IRS\u2019s  fiscal year 2009 Collection Activity Reports to determine the number of  business nonfiler cases IRS closed as not liable to file returns.

We  also reviewed Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) sections dealing with  handling taxpayer responses to delinquent return notices and procedures  for closing business nonfiler cases and IRS documents on its Nonfiler  Strategy and its implementation. We interviewed IRS officials from SBSE  to understand the various operational features and processes associated  with the BMF CCNIP. To understand how IRS handles responses to  delinquent return notices from businesses, we observed IRS\u2019s collections  functions at IRS\u2019s Philadelphia service center.", "To assess what opportunities exist for IRS to improve its use of third-party  information returns or other sources to identify and pursue business  nonfilers, we identified non-IRS data sources\u2014including government  contractor data and private sector data\u2014that could have information on  business nonfilers and assessed the potential of this information to help  IRS better identify and pursue business nonfilers. To test whether  information return income could be useful in making case closure  decisions under BMF CCNIP, we matched IRS\u2019s calendar year 2007  Aggregated Information Return (AIR) file, which is used in BMF CCNIP  and contained summaries of information returns that were received by  IRS, to IRS\u2019s Nonfiler Measurement file that contained data on all tax year  2007 cases that were closed as not liable to file partnership (Form 1065)  and corporation (Form 1120) returns. We limited our analysis to tax year  2007 cases that had information return income of $1,000 or more.  According to IRS officials, tax year 2007 business nonfiler cases were  selected prior to the implementation of BMF CCNIP. Our analysis showed  that about 96 percent of the cases were closed in 2008 and 2009 while the  remaining 4 percent were closed in 2007 and 2010. In doing this match we  eliminated all cases that were closed because they were subsidiaries of  other businesses and thus would not have been required to file returns  under their Employer Identification Numbers (EIN). We did not follow up  on any of the closed cases to determine whether using the information  return income data would have resulted in a closure different than not  liable to file a return. To determine whether these businesses would have  been liable to file returns would have required IRS to reinvestigate the  cases. To determine whether the data in IRS\u2019s Nonfiler Measurement file  were of sufficient reliability for our analysis, we reviewed the program  documentation associated with the file and discussed the various data  elements with the IRS staff responsible for the file. As a result of our  review and discussions, we determined that the data in this file were of  sufficient reliability to be used in our analysis.", "To test whether private sector data on business activity could be useful for  determining whether businesses may be required to file partnership,  corporation, and employment tax returns, we matched IRS\u2019s tax year 2007  Nonfiler Measurement file of nonfiler cases that IRS closed as not liable to  file returns to a Dun and Bradstreet (D&B) file of businesses located in  California and Illinois. We judgmentally selected these two states to get a  geographic mix of states that had sufficient cases that were closed as not  liable to file tax year 2007 returns to test the viability of using private  sector data. The D&B file contained various data on business activity  including name, address, sales, and employment information. Combined,  California and Illinois had 130,336 or about 14.3 percent of the 914,505  corporations, partnerships, and employment tax cases that were closed as  not liable to file tax year 2007 returns. Since the D&B files did not include  the businesses\u2019 EINs, the match was made on the businesses\u2019 name and  address, which included the street address, state, and ZIP code. To make  the name and address matches, we used D&B\u2019s onsite matching software  program, which can be used to associate records with differences in name  and addresses to a particular entity. Each match is assigned a confidence  code from 0 to 10, with 10 being the highest confidence score and 0 the  lowest or no match. According to D&B documents, scores of 8 to 10 are  considered high-quality matches and were the matches we used for our  analysis. Our match of the 130,336 California and Illinois cases resulted in  40,223 high-quality matches (9,740 corporations and partnerships and  30,483 employment tax cases). Of the 9,740 partnership and corporation  cases, 7,688 cases had either little or no information return income. Of the  30,483 employment tax cases, 4,523 had employees.", "Also, to determine whether private sector data could be useful in  identifying active businesses that IRS had not identified as nonfilers, we  matched the D&B data files of California and Illinois businesses to a  Business Master File (BMF) extract of 176,061 entities on the BMF that  had been established in calendar year 2006 but had no filing requirements  as of September 2009, which was when IRS produced the extract for us. As  a data reliability check on this no filing requirement extract, both GAO and  IRS staff spot checked selected output from this extract to IRS\u2019s National  Accounts Profile (NAP) file, which contains all valid taxpayer names,  addresses, taxpayer identification numbers, and filing requirements. These  checks showed that the names were valid and that the businesses did not  have any filing requirements. The match of D&B data to the no filing  requirement extract produced 39,920 cases that were considered to be  high-quality matches (i.e., they had confidence scores of 8 to 10) and were  the ones we used for our analysis. Since D&B is a commercial business,  we were not able to validate the sales and employment data contained in  the file. However, according to data D&B officials provided to us, D&B  collects its data through direct investigations, such as phone calls to  businesses, and reviews of trade records on payment and financial data,  public records, and government registries, and Web sources and  directories. Also, since D&B data are used by various federal agencies, we  determined that the data were of sufficient reliability to be used in our  analysis.", "To test whether other federal data sources could be useful for identifying  business nonfilers, we analyzed the 2007 Central Contractor Registration  (CCR) file, which we received from the General Services Administration,  which contains data on businesses that must register at least annually to  compete for federal contracts. We tested this file because it contains  various entity data such as name, address, and EIN, which could be readily  matched to IRS\u2019s records. Businesses that want to vie for federal contracts  must submit a valid EIN for inclusion onto the CCR. The EINs are  validated against IRS\u2019s records before they are included in the CCR. Also,  the CCR file contains various self-reported data on business activity data,  such as total revenue and number of employees for each business, which  could be useful for making decisions on whether a business would be  required to file returns. We matched the calendar year 2007 CCR file,  which consisted of 441,467 records, to IRS\u2019s tax year 2007 Nonfiler  Measurement file of cases that were closed as not liable to file returns to  determine whether CCR data would identify potential federal contractors  that had business activity data that would indicate that they may have  been required to file returns. The match identified 3,589 entities on the  CCR file with reported revenue that were closed as not liable to file  partnership (1,210 cases) or corporation (2,379 cases) returns. The match  also found that 10,263 entities on the CCR file reported that they had  employees that were closed as not liable to file either Form 941 (8,694  cases) or Form 940 (1,569 cases). We did not verify the accuracy of the  data on the CCR file because these data are self-reported by businesses  entering the data onto the CCR database.
