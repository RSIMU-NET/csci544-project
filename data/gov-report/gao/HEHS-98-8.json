Unlike fee-for-service, where Medicare usually makes a separate payment for each service provided, Medicare pays risk-contract HMOs a capitated\u2014or fixed per patient\u2014payment to cover all health services. Medicare HMO enrollment is growing by more than 100,000 beneficiaries per month. More than 12 percent, or almost 4.9 million, of the approximately 38 million Medicare beneficiaries are now enrolled in risk-contract HMOs. Proponents of managed care state that HMOs offer the potential to coordinate all the services needed to treat a patient and to ensure the appropriate use of services. Critics, however, argue that Medicare HMOs may withhold necessary services to save money.", "Given the increasingly important role of managed care in Medicare and your interest in the ability of HMOs to meet the needs of vulnerable populations, you asked us to examine home health services provided by Medicare HMOs. In the fee-for-service program, home health services are used intensively by some of Medicare\u2019s sickest and most functionally impaired beneficiaries. In contrast, relatively little is known about the use of home health services by Medicare HMO enrollees. Therefore, you asked us (1) to examine how Medicare HMOs provide and manage home health services, as compared to fee-for-service providers, and (2) what is known about the appropriateness of home health services provided to HMO enrollees, especially to vulnerable populations.", "To address these questions, we visited six Medicare HMOs, which together account for about 10 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in risk-contract HMOs. At these HMOs, we interviewed utilization review and quality assurance staff and gathered documents relating to these areas. We also interviewed staff from eight home health agencies that contract with these HMOs. Most of these agencies also provide services to Medicare fee-for-service patients and thus were able to describe their experiences with home health under both the HMO and fee-for-service programs. We also interviewed officials from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), which manages the Medicare program; reviewed a sample of appeals from Medicare HMO enrollees who were denied home health services; and reviewed pertinent laws, regulations, HCFA policies, and research by others.

The program provides protection under two parts. Part A, the hospital insurance program, covers inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, home health, and hospice services. Part B, the supplementary medical insurance program, primarily covers physician services but also covers home health care for beneficiaries not covered under part A. Although most of the 38 million Medicare beneficiaries receive their health care from fee-for-service providers, the nearly 5 million beneficiaries enrolled in HMOs participating in Medicare\u2019s risk-contract program receive home health care through their HMOs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Medicare Fee-for-Service Home Health Program", "paragraphs": ["To qualify for home health care, a Medicare beneficiary must be homebound, that is confined to his or her residence; require intermittent skilled nursing, physical therapy, or speech therapy; and be under the care of a physician. In addition, the services must be furnished under a plan of care that is prescribed and reviewed at least every 62 days by a physician. If these conditions are met, Medicare will pay for skilled nursing; physical, occupational, and speech therapies; medical social services; home health aide visits; and durable medical equipment and medical supplies. As long as the care is reasonable and necessary and meets the above criteria, there are no limits on the number of home health visits or length of coverage.", "The home health benefit is one of the fastest growing components of Medicare fee-for-service spending. From 1989 to 1996, part A fee-for-service expenditures for home health increased more than 600 percent\u2014from $2.4 billion to $17.7 billion. The number of beneficiaries receiving home health care more than doubled, from 1.7 million in 1989 to about 3.9 million in 1996. While the Congress liberalized the Medicare home health benefit in 1980, the dramatic growth in these services is primarily the result of changes to HCFA\u2019s home health guidelines made in 1989. HCFA was ordered by a federal court to make these changes in response to a court decision that invalidated HCFA\u2019s interpretation of the coverage requirements. The 1980 statutory amendments removed the requirements that home health visits under part A be preceded by a hospital stay of at least 3 days and be for a condition related to the hospitalization. The amendments also abolished the 100-home-health-visit limitation under parts A and B. The new guidelines issued in 1989 allowed home health agencies to increase the frequency of visits by clarifying the definition of \u201cpart-time\u201d or \u201cintermittent\u201d care, making it easier to qualify for skilled care, and increasing the standard of review before payment for services could be denied. These changes made the home health benefit available to more beneficiaries, for less acute conditions, and for longer periods of time.", "Under Medicare fee-for-service, providers are paid for each home health visit and, except for durable medical equipment, beneficiaries do not share in the cost. Therefore, neither providers nor beneficiaries has financial incentives to control the number of services used. At the same time that home health expenditures have been growing rapidly, funding for program safeguards, such as reviewing claims, decreased sharply. The recent enactment of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-191) has increased future funding for program safeguards. After adjusting for inflation, however, per-claim expenditures for program safeguards will remain below the 1989 level.

For instance, while Medicare fee-for-service requires that patients be homebound to qualify for home health services, Medicare HMOs can waive this restriction. In addition, HCFA guidance states that the HMO is allowed to direct the delivery of care. In contrast, a patient in fee-for-service may, in consultation with a physician, seek home health services without obtaining authorization from a third-party\u2014a requirement most HMOs impose.", "Medicare patients may appeal an HMO refusal to provide health services they believe are covered or medically necessary. If a patient appeals such a denial, the HMO must reconsider its initial decision. If the HMO\u2019s reconsideration is not fully favorable to the patient, the HMO must forward the appeal for independent review by a HCFA contractor\u2014the Center for Health Dispute Resolution, formerly the Network Design Group\u2014which makes the final reconsideration decision.

The reports from the two groups suggest that these HMOs emphasize shorter-term, rehabilitation goals, while fee-for-service providers may give more emphasis to social and environmental factors affecting service needs, especially in their use of home health aides. The coverage criteria for Medicare\u2019s home health benefit allow providers enough latitude to interpret the criteria in a manner that favors their financial interests. While HMOs control services more closely than fee-for-service providers, home health agencies that serve both HMO and fee-for-service patients told us they were generally able to obtain approval to provide services they considered sufficient to HMO enrollees.

They told us that HMOs tend to focus more on shorter-term goals that allow the HMO to discontinue services as soon as possible. Staff at several HMOs we visited reported that their goal for home health services is to help patients function independently and not rely on home health care. To do so, they establish specific rehabilitation goals focused on a patient\u2019s needs. For instance, if a patient needs to climb six stairs to reach the bathroom at home, then the home health therapist will focus on this goal. Once the patient attains the specific goal, HMOs may terminate home health services if the patient does not require any other skilled nursing or skilled therapy care.", "Home health agencies also seek to achieve independence for their fee-for-service patients. However, in contrast to HMOs, some home health agencies reported taking a broader approach to patient functioning, providing additional services\u2014especially supportive or aide services\u2014that take into consideration the patient\u2019s overall condition and environment. With fee-for-service patients, home health agency staff said they tend to provide services over a longer period to ensure patients are fully healed and knowledgeable about the medical condition involved. In contrast, they said an HMO may authorize the home health agency only a certain number of visits to teach a patient about his or her other medical condition, even if environmental factors, such as family stress, suggest that the patient may have difficulty absorbing the information within the HMO\u2019s time frame.", "A nurse manager in one home health agency explained that under managed care, home health agencies are learning to focus on the problem at hand rather than trying to give patients services for unrelated or other chronic conditions. She explained that in fee-for-service, the home health agency\u2019s goal has been to resolve every condition that a patient had. For instance, if home health services were initiated because a diabetic patient had a wound that required skilled nursing care, a home health agency might review educational materials about diabetes with the patient, even if the patient had had diabetes for a number of years. In contrast, HMOs tend to focus on the specific condition that initiated the home health episode."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Incentives and Interpretation of Coverage Criteria Influence Use of Home Health Services", "paragraphs": ["Because HMOs are at risk for service costs that exceed the capitated payment, they generally seek to provide enough services to maintain or restore patient health and prevent the need for more expensive care, while not providing more care than necessary. While there are financial incentives to limit services, discontinuing services too soon could become more costly if patient conditions worsen. Balancing these financial and health interests can influence the use of home health services. For example, an HMO may not believe it necessary for a home health nurse to continue to visit a wound patient until the wound is completely healed, while a fee-for-service provider may.", "Applying the definitions of skilled services is not always straightforward and is based on clinical judgment in many cases. For example, the management of a care plan is considered a skilled service if it requires the skills of a nurse or therapist to ensure the patient\u2019s medical safety and recovery\u2014even if all other services in the care plan are unskilled. Since such criteria are based on judgment and are open to interpretation, providers faced with borderline cases may make decisions that favor their financial interests. The executive director of one home health agency noted that the definitions for certain types of skilled nursing and therapy services are vague and inconsistently interpreted in fee-for-service. The director for admissions at another home health agency said that there are always gray areas in the coverage guidelines and that fee-for-service providers tend to provide more services, while HMOs tend to provide fewer.", "HMOs report that they use their flexibility to provide additional benefits or waive Medicare requirements for their Medicare enrollees to provide more cost-effective care. In general, the Medicare HMOs we visited reported that they occasionally covered more benefits than patients are entitled to in the Medicare fee-for-service program. For example, one HMO did not require that patients be homebound to receive home health services. Four other HMOs reported that while they formally required patients to be homebound, they would make exceptions if it would be cost-effective for the HMO and beneficial for the patient. In addition, two HMOs reported that if a patient had no skilled need, but could not be at home without assistance, they would, in rare cases, provide aide services for a short period until other arrangements could be made."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of Home Health Aides Differs", "paragraphs": ["HMO and fee-for-service providers also differ in their use of home health aides. While custodial care\u2014personal care that does not require the continued attention of trained professional staff\u2014is generally excluded from Medicare coverage, Medicare can cover a home health aide to provide ongoing personal care services if the home care patient also requires intermittent skilled nursing or therapy services. Prior to the 1980 statutory changes and the 1989 court-ordered coverage guideline changes, the part A home health benefit had been used primarily for acute conditions following a hospitalization and not for chronic care. Many Medicare fee-for-service patients still receive home health services following hospitalization, but a growing number are receiving home care and aide services for long-term, chronic conditions not related to an acute episode. In a recent briefing, we reported that in the fee-for-service program, aide visits accounted for almost half the total of home health visits in 1994 and that the percentage of patients receiving more than 90 visits tripled between 1989 to 1993, from 6 to 18 percent.", "In contrast, HMO staff told us they believe that Medicare home health services should not be expected to be used as long-term care for patients. Staff at many of the HMOs we visited expressed the belief that patients can become dependent on the assistance provided by aides and expect such services indefinitely. In their view, the fee-for-service system sometimes blurs the line between skilled and custodial care, creating unrealistic patient expectations about eligibility for Medicare home health services. In addition, some HMO and HCFA staff expressed the belief that home health aides are sometimes provided in the fee-for-service program as much for social reasons as for health reasons. A study of Medicare home health claims from 1993 also suggested that many fee-for-service aide visits may be for social and custodial care and only tangentially related to medical care.", "While the HMOs we visited generally do not provide home health aides for custodial purposes, most had a social service department or designated staff that would try to arrange for community services. Several HMOs also had special programs that provided supportive social services not directly related to health. For example, one HMO provided a respite benefit to full-time caregivers in the home to prevent caregiver burnout. Another HMO received a grant from a health care foundation to create a service credit bank, where enrollees who provide assistance, such as meal preparation and transportation, to frail enrollees are given credits that can be used to purchase similar assistance when needed. The same HMO also helps enrollees access a friendly visitor program and a telephone reassurance program to provide social interaction and support.

One home health agency noted that it now puts more emphasis on patient education, while another reported that it no longer seeks to attain maximum functional levels for patients before they are discharged from home health care. The latter also noted that it now provides services for shorter periods and it looks for community resources to provide assistance if a patient needs long-term assistance with some tasks, such as preparing insulin shots.", "Home health agency staff also told us that although they were usually able to negotiate acceptable levels of service with HMOs, HMOs occasionally \u201cpush the envelope\u201d in terms of providing the fewest possible services.", "Some were concerned that HMOs occasionally have unrealistic expectations about how quickly certain patients can function independently and may lead the patient to do more than he or she is able to do. For example, one home health agency reported that a local Medicare HMO, which was not part of our sample, may expect too much from the elderly population. The HMO has recommended clinical guidelines for coronary artery bypass surgery that call for patients to be discharged 4 days after surgery and only authorizes one home health agency visit following discharge. Because these patients generally are overwhelmed by the surgery and recovery, few can absorb all the necessary self-care information provided in this one visit. As a result, home health agency staff said that they have begun doing follow-up calls to these patients on their own initiative. Other home health agencies noted that some HMOs may require certain wound care patients to provide their own wound care before they are able to.", "At the same time, some home health agencies noted beneficial changes in patient management that they believe arose from the influence of managed care. The director of one home health agency said that working with HMOs has taught her staff to develop reasonable, measurable goals and to focus their care on those goals.

In contrast, only a small percentage of claims in the fee-for-service program are actually reviewed by Medicare to assess whether they are reasonable and necessary. Moreover, these reviews are primarily paper reviews, which yield insufficient information to determine if the services provided are appropriate and meet Medicare criteria. Many fee-for-service home health agencies seek to manage patient care appropriately and cost effectively, but others may provide unnecessary services.

At each HMO we visited, case managers generally review patient cases every few days to 2 weeks, depending on the patient\u2019s condition, to determine how much more care is needed. In the Medicare fee-for-service program, home health care plans must be reviewed by a physician at least every 62 days. While some home health agencies may develop shorter care plans, others routinely develop 62-day care plans for their fee-for-service patients. Moreover, when the initial 62-day period ends and a new care plan is written, the Medicare contractors who process fee-for-service home health claims do not routinely review the updated plans.", "HMO staff reported that their closer scrutiny of each patient is intended to both prevent the unnecessary utilization of services and improve the quality of care. However, contracted home health agencies also noted that the scrutiny can sometimes be excessive and believe that it would save providers time and effort if they did not have to seek approval for care after two or three visits when it is obvious that certain patients, such as stroke patients, need additional visits. At one home health agency, a staff member noted that there is a difference between managing utilization and actually managing care. She noted that some HMOs focus more on managing utilization and have no direct contact with patients, which precludes them from assessing the individual needs of patients.", "Medicare HMOs vary in terms of their organization, payment mechanisms for physicians and home health agencies, and authorization processes. These factors also influence the utilization levels and management of home health services. For example, some HMOs employ their own physicians and nurses and have no preauthorization requirements for home health services; however, many HMOs contract with large numbers of independent physicians and have more restrictive preapproval processes to control the use of services.

For example, one HMO monitors its contracted physician groups for underutilization and overutilization of services, using established benchmarks or HMO averages. The HMO identified one medical group with low utilization of home health services compared to the HMO average and asked the group to explain the disparity and provide any available information on patient satisfaction or patient outcomes. Another HMO has established screens, such as dehydration or readmission to a hospital, to identify instances of poor patient outcomes.

This arrangement allows HMO and home health agency staff to work closely with each other to provide active oversight of the care provided. Two other HMOs are in the process of shrinking their home health agency networks to allow their staff to spend more time on site at these facilities, provide closer oversight of the care provided, and work with the contractors to manage enrollee care.

HCFA is currently collecting encounter data in one state as a pilot project but has no definitive plan to collect these data on a nationwide basis.", "To date, research comparing the health outcomes of HMO and fee-for-service patients has been limited, partly because of the difficulty in defining and measuring an array of health outcomes that consider both skilled and unskilled services. The 1995 HCFA-funded study comparing home health utilization of Medicare HMO and fee-for-service patients was the only study we identified that attempted to measure patient outcomes. The results suggest that HMO patients may experience slightly worse outcomes than fee-for-service patients. However, because the study includes only patients who were beginning a home health episode and only followed them for 12 weeks, it may not include many patients receiving home health services for chronic conditions.", "HCFA recently announced that within the next few years it plans to collect some outcomes data from all home health agencies that provide care to Medicare HMO or fee-for-service patients through a standardized patient assessment data set, known as OASIS (Outcomes and Assessment Information Set). The OASIS data set will collect information on a number of health status measures, such as ability to walk after hip replacement surgery; mental status; and ability to perform activities of daily living, like bathing or eating. HCFA may use OASIS data to monitor HMOs and the effectiveness of home care they provide. Patients with chronic illnesses and conditions, however, may not experience the types of substantial improvements or restoration of functions that can be measured easily through such outcomes data. The needs of the chronically ill for ongoing assistance to maintain health status and functional ability may also conflict with medical necessity standards used by some managed care plans that focus on rehabilitation. Some state Medicaid programs have recognized similar concerns in contracting with managed care plans for disabled recipients. They have included an explicit definition of medical necessity in HMO contracts that includes services necessary to maintain a patient\u2019s existing level of functioning."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appeals Provide Little Information", "paragraphs": ["Data on the number and results of appeals filed by Medicare patients who are dissatisfied with HMO care decisions are one of the few currently available indicators that might be useful in evaluating HMO home health care. We reviewed 48 home health appeals filed by Medicare HMO patients during a 2-1/2-year period and found that HCFA\u2019s appeals contractor upheld most of the HMOs\u2019 denials. However, the usefulness of such data as an indicator of patient satisfaction may be limited by several factors. First, the small number of home health appeals limit their reliability as an indicator. In 1996, HCFA\u2019s appeals contractor received only 165 appeals involving home health services from the approximately 4 million Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in risk-contract HMOs. Second, in 60 percent of the cases we reviewed, the HMO appeals contractor decided the case based on whether the HMO and the patient followed correct administrative procedures, rather than the appropriateness of the HMO\u2019s clinical decision or the sufficiency of the services provided. Finally, because of weaknesses in the appeals system\u2014including incomplete HMO compliance with the appeals process, limited enrollee awareness of appeal rights, and beneficiaries\u2019 ability to disenroll rather than appeal a denial\u2014not all enrollee concerns about access to home health care reach the appeals contractor."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["HMOs\u2019 more active management of home health services and their focus on shorter-term rehabilitation likely contribute to their Medicare enrollees receiving fewer services than their fee-for-service counterparts. Currently, however, HCFA has little data available to evaluate if differences in home health care utilization are appropriate. Given the growth in Medicare HMO enrollment, ensuring that HMOs meet the home health needs of all enrollees, particularly those with chronic conditions, will become increasingly important. HCFA plans to collect outcomes data for home health services; however, this information will not be available for several years and may provide only a partial picture of the care provided by HMOs. Still, without such data, it is difficult to determine to what extent utilization differences are appropriate or represent unnecessary services provided in fee-for-service or insufficient services provided by HMOs. In the meantime, HCFA cannot determine whether the needs of particularly vulnerable beneficiaries\u2014such as those with medically complex needs and chronic conditions\u2014are being met in HMOs.", "While there are no generally accepted standards regarding the appropriate level of services for home health patients, identifying and reviewing HMOs and patient groups with aberrant utilization patterns could help focus oversight on potential problems\u2014a technique that has been used successfully in the Medicare fee-for-service program. In addition, recognizing the unique needs of chronically ill enrollees and defining expectations for their care may assist beneficiaries with chronic conditions in deciding whether to enroll in an HMO, as well as facilitate HCFA\u2019s oversight of the care provided these enrollees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HCFA officials, who suggested that we clarify that HCFA\u2019s 1989 changes to its home health coverage regulations were made in response to statutory changes and court order.

We interviewed staff from HCFA\u2019s central office and several of its regional offices. We also reviewed pertinent laws, regulations, HCFA policies, and research comparing utilization and outcomes between Medicare HMO and fee-for-service patients. We conducted our study from March 1996 to July 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards; however, we did not independently verify the utilization data obtained from one home health agency.", "The 6 HMOs we visited accounted for about 10 percent of all Medicare enrollees in the 292 risk-contract Medicare HMOs as of August 1, 1997. We chose the specific HMOs to include a variety of HMO models and a variety of contracting relationships with home health agencies, but they should not be considered representative of all Medicare risk-contract HMOs. Three of the six HMOs were nonprofit and three were for-profit. Two were group/staff model HMOs, two were independent practice association (IPA) models, and two represented mixed IPA/group models. Two HMOs shared common corporate ownership with the home health agencies that provided essentially all home health services for the HMOs\u2019 Medicare enrollees. The remaining HMOs contracted with a variety of independent home health agencies. In selecting HMOs, we also sought some geographic diversity\u2014three of the HMOs are on the East Coast and three are on the West Coast. Given the number and diversity of HMOs and home health agencies that participate in the Medicare program, we cannot generalize from the small number that we visited.", "At each HMO we interviewed case managers, utilization review staff, quality assurance staff, and other knowledgeable staff about how the HMO manages home health services. At one HMO, which capitates payments to its physician groups and delegates the utilization management function to the physicians, we also interviewed case managers at two of the contracted physician groups. We also interviewed staff at 10 home health agencies that provide services to the HMOs we visited to discuss the management of Medicare HMO home health patients compared to Medicare fee-for-service patients; 8 of the 10 provided services to both. In most cases, we interviewed at least two home health agencies that contracted with the HMOs we visited\u2014some of which contracted with more than one of the HMOs.", "Finally, we reviewed a sample of appeals filed by Medicare HMO patients and decided by HCFA\u2019s HMO appeals contractor, the Center for Health Dispute Resolution (CHDR). The Medicare HMO appeals process is a two-step process, in which the HMO itself first reconsiders its original denial. If the HMO\u2019s reconsideration is not fully favorable to the beneficiary, the HMO is required to forward the appeal to CHDR to make the final reconsideration decision. We did not review HMO-level appeals because HCFA does not maintain data on appeals at that level, making it impossible to identify the universe of appeals and to draw a sample. However, the six plans we visited reported that nearly all appeals in the past year involving home health services were forwarded to CHDR.", "From a universe of 254 home health appeals decided by CHDR between January 1, 1994, and August 23, 1996, we selected a random sample of 48 cases, or 18.9 percent of the 254 cases involving home health. The appeals came from all Medicare HMOs, not just the six we visited. While this sample is representative of all CHDR-level appeals cases decided during the sample time frame, it should be noted that the appeals that reach CHDR represent only a fraction of all disputes because not all initial HMO denials are appealed or even recognized, and others may be overturned at the plan level. As noted in the body of this report, HMO patients may choose not to appeal an HMO denial, either because they are not aware of their appeal rights or because they choose to disenroll from the HMO.
