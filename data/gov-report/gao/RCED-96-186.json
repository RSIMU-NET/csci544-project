The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 amended and recodified the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended. The 1995 act reaffirmed the principles of the original act and gave new responsibilities to OMB and executive branch agencies. Like the original statute, the 1995 act requires agencies to justify any collection of information from the public by establishing the need and intended use of the information, estimating the burden that the collection will impose on the respondents, and showing that the collection is the least burdensome way to gather the information. at the end of the fiscal year, and agency estimates of the burden for the coming fiscal year.", "The 1995 act also makes several changes in federal paperwork reduction requirements. For example, it requires OIRA to set goals of at least a 10-percent burden reduction governmentwide for each of fiscal years 1996 and 1997, a 5-percent governmentwide burden reduction in each of the next 4 fiscal years, and annual agency goals that reduce burden to \u201cthe maximum practicable\u201d extent. The act also redefines a \u201ccollection of information\u201d to include required disclosures of information to third parties and the public, effectively overturning the Supreme Court\u2019s 1990 Dole v. United Steelworkers of America decision. Finally, the 1995 act details new agency responsibilities for the review and control of paperwork. For example, it requires agencies to establish a 60-day public notice and comment period for each proposed collection of information before submitting the proposal to OMB for approval.", "OIRA uses the ICB information to assess whether agencies\u2019 burden reduction goals are being met. OIRA classifies changes in burden-hour estimates as caused by either \u201cprogram changes\u201d or \u201cadjustments.\u201d Program changes are additions or reductions to existing paperwork requirements which are imposed either through new statutory requirements or an agency\u2019s own initiative. Adjustments are changes in burden estimates caused by factors other than changes in the actual paperwork requirements, such as changes in the population responding to a requirement or agency reestimates of the burden associated with a collection of information. OIRA counts both program changes and adjustments when calculating an agency\u2019s burden-hour baseline at the end of each fiscal year. However, OIRA does not count changes that are due to adjustments in determining whether an agency has achieved its burden reduction goal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes in Paperwork Burden Over Time", "paragraphs": ["Figure 1 shows changes in reported burden-hour estimates governmentwide and at IRS between September 30, 1980, and September 30, 1995\u2014the day before the new act took effect. rose dramatically in 1989, and rose every year since then with the exception of 1993. In each year since fiscal year 1989, IRS\u2019 paperwork burden has accounted for more than three-quarters of the governmentwide total. Increases or decreases in IRS\u2019 total number of burden hours have had a dramatic effect on the governmentwide total. For example, the near tripling of the governmentwide burden-hour estimate during fiscal year 1989 was primarily because IRS changed the way it calculated its information collection burden, which increased its paperwork estimate by about 3.4 billion hours. Because the IRS paperwork burden is such a large portion of the governmentwide total, the success of any governmentwide effort to reduce burden largely depends on reducing the burden imposed by IRS.", "Figures 2 and 3 show the changes in the paperwork burden at EPA and OSHA, respectively, during the same 1980 to 1995 period.", "Statement  Paperwork Reduction: Burden Reduction Goal Unlikely to Be Met Burden hours (in millions)", "Statement  Paperwork Reduction: Burden Reduction Goal Unlikely to Be Met Burden hours (in millions)", "EPA\u2019s burden-hour estimate rose sharply in the late 1980s, fell somewhat in 1991 (because third-party information collections were no longer being counted as a result of the Dole decision), and rose again between 1991 and 1995.

Some of the proposals at OSHA and EPA were third-party and public disclosures that had previously been removed from the agencies\u2019 estimates because of the Dole decision. Other proposals, particularly those at OSHA, were third-party and public disclosures that had been added after the Dole decision. By getting these third-party and other proposed information collections approved before the act\u2019s effective date, agencies were able to avoid the new requirements imposed by the act, including the 60-day public notice and comment period at the agencies. OIRA approved some of these collections of information for less than 1 year so that the agencies would have to clear the collections under the new process during fiscal year 1996.", "However, submitting the proposals for review and approval before the act took effect also raised the burden-hour baseline against which the agencies\u2019 paperwork reduction goals would be judged. For example, the increase in OSHA\u2019s burden-hour baseline from about 1.5 million hours to about 208 million hours between June and September 1995 meant that OSHA had to cut more burden hours to achieve a 10 percent reduction (20.8 million hours) than it would have had to cut before the increase (about 150,000 hours)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Burden Reduction Goals Not Set and Reductions Likely to Fall Short of Act\u2019s Target", "paragraphs": ["One of the key features of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 is the requirement that OIRA set both governmentwide and agency-specific burden reduction goals for fiscal year 1996 and for the next 5 fiscal years.

As a result of such requirements, some agencies contend that they are limited in the amount to which they can reduce their paperwork burden.

Initially, EPA estimated that its January 1995 baseline was about 81 million burden hours, so a 25-percent reduction would bring the agency\u2019s total to about 61 million hours. In March of this year, we provided a statement for the record to the House Committee on Small Business indicating that, despite these planned reductions, EPA projected that its burden-hour total would increase to about 117 million hours by September 30, 1996\u2014an increase of about 44 percent from EPA\u2019s January 1995 baseline. projection for September 30, 1996, from 117 million hours to about 100 million hours.

As you can see, despite EPA\u2019s burden-reduction efforts during this period, EPA\u2019s burden-hour estimate at the end of this fiscal year is expected to be about what it was at the start of those efforts. This is because, at the same time EPA has been reducing its January 1995 paperwork inventory, new burden hours have been added to that inventory. According to EPA, those additions are primarily third-party burden hours that are now being counted as a result of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and new information collections associated with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992.", "Statement  Paperwork Reduction: Burden Reduction Goal Unlikely to Be Met Burden hours (in millions)", "Does not include about 9 million hours of third party burden.

If these figures are accurate, EPA would need to eliminate the 8 million burden hours it had identified and identify and eliminate about 2 million more hours to reach its goal of reducing its 101 million burden-hour baseline by 25 percent.

Therefore, an agency that initially submits a high estimate and later revises it downward does not get credit from OIRA for the reduction. Conversely, if an agency initially submits a low paperwork estimate and later increases the estimate, OIRA never counts the increase against the agency for goal attainment purposes. In fact, the governmentwide increase of about 1 billion burden hours between 1990 and 1995 was primarily driven by adjustments that never counted against agencies\u2019 goals. OIRA staff told us they were not aware of any evidence that agencies were systematically underestimating the burden associated with their information collections and then revising them upward. interpreting the official burden-hour statistics. Most or all of the burden-hour increase may have actually existed since 1980 when the original Paperwork Reduction Act became effective.
