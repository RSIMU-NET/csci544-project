In addition, the departments are engaged in short-term initiatives involving existing systems.

However, they have faced considerable challenges in these efforts, leading to repeated changes in the focus of their initiatives and target completion dates. Currently, the two departments are pursuing both long- and short-term initiatives to share health information. Under their long-term initiative, the modern health information systems being developed by each department are to share standardized computable data through an interface between data repositories associated with each system. The repositories have now been developed, and the departments have begun to populate them with limited types of health information. In addition, the interface between the repositories has been implemented at seven VA and DOD sites, allowing computable outpatient pharmacy and drug allergy data to be exchanged. Implementing this interface is a milestone toward the departments' long-term goal, but more remains to be done. Besides extending the current capability throughout VA and DOD, the departments must still agree to standards for the remaining categories of medical information, populate the data repositories with this information, complete the development of the two modernized health information systems, and transition from their existing systems. While pursuing their long-term effort to develop modernized systems, the two departments have also been working to share information in their existing systems. Among various short-term initiatives are a completed effort to allow the one-way transfer of health information from DOD to VA when service members leave the military, as well as ongoing demonstration projects to exchange limited data at selected sites. One of these projects, which builds on the one-way transfer capability, developed an interface between certain existing systems that allows a two-way view of current data on patients receiving care from both departments. VA and DOD are now expanding the sharing of additional medical information by using this interface to link other systems and databases. The departments have also established ad hoc processes to meet the immediate need to provide data on severely wounded service members to VA's polytrauma centers, which specialize in treating such patients. These processes include manual workarounds (such as scanning paper records) that are generally feasible only because the number of polytrauma patients is small. While these multiple initiatives and ad hoc processes have facilitated degrees of data sharing, they nonetheless highlight the need for continued efforts to integrate information systems and automate information exchange. At present, it is not clear how all the initiatives are to be incorporated into an overall strategy focused on achieving the departments' goal of comprehensive, seamless exchange of health information."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be a part of today\u2019s continuing dialogue on efforts by the  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense  (DOD) to share electronic medical information.

The interface was expected to compile requested  patient information in a virtual record (that is, electronic as opposed to  paper) that could be displayed on a user\u2019s computer screen.", "We reviewed the GCPR project in 2001 and 2002, noting disappointing  progress exacerbated in large part by inadequate accountability and poor  planning and oversight, which raised questions about the departments\u2019  abilities to achieve a virtual medical record. We determined that the lack  of a lead entity, clear mission, and detailed planning to achieve that  mission made it difficult to monitor progress, identify project risks, and  develop appropriate contingency plans. In both years, we recommended  that the departments enhance the project\u2019s overall management and  accountability. In particular, we recommended that the departments  designate a lead entity and a clear line of authority for the project; create  comprehensive and coordinated plans that include an agreed-upon  mission and clear goals, objectives, and performance measures; revise the  project\u2019s original goals and objectives to align with the current strategy;  commit the executive support necessary to adequately manage the project;  and ensure that it followed sound project management principles.", "In response, by July 2002, the two departments had revised their strategy,  refocusing the project and dividing it into two initiatives. A short-term  initiative, the Federal Health Information Exchange (FHIE), was to enable  DOD to electronically transfer service members\u2019 health information to VA  when the members left active duty. VA was designated as the lead entity  for implementing FHIE, which was completed in 2004. A longer-term  initiative was to develop a common health information architecture that  would allow a two-way exchange of health information. The common  architecture is to include standardized, computable data, communications,  security, and high-performance health information systems (these  systems, DOD\u2019s Composite Health Care System II and VA\u2019s HealtheVet  VistA, were already in development, as shown in the figure). The  departments\u2019 modernized systems are to store information (in  standardized, computable form) in separate data repositories: DOD\u2019s  Clinical Data Repository (CDR) and VA\u2019s Health Data Repository (HDR).  The two repositories are to exchange information through an interface  named CHDR.", "In March 2004, the departments began to develop the CHDR interface.  They planned to begin implementation by October 2005; however,  implementation of the first release of the interface (at one site) occurred  in September 2006, almost a year beyond the target date. In a report in  June 2004, we identified a number of management weaknesses that could  have contributed to this delay and made a number of recommendations,  including creation of a comprehensive and coordinated project  management plan. The departments agreed with our recommendations  and took steps to improve the management of the CHDR initiative,  designating a lead entity with final decision-making authority and  establishing a project management structure. However, as we noted in  subsequent testimony, the initiative did not have a detailed project  management plan that described the technical and managerial processes  necessary to satisfy project requirements (including a work breakdown  structure and schedule for all development, testing, and implementation  tasks), as we had recommended.", "In October 2004, responding to a congressional mandate, the departments  established two more short-term initiatives: the Laboratory Data Sharing  Interface, aimed at allowing VA and DOD facilities to share laboratory  resources, and the Bidirectional Health Information Exchange (BHIE),  aimed at giving both departments\u2019 clinicians access to records on shared  patients (that is, those who receive care from both departments). As  demonstration projects, these initiatives were limited in scope, with the  intention of providing interim solutions to the departments\u2019 needs for  more immediate health information sharing. However, because BHIE  provided access to up-to-date information, the departments\u2019 clinicians  expressed strong interest in expanding its use. As a result, the  departments began planning to broaden this capability and expand its  implementation considerably. Extending BHIE connectivity could provide  each department with access to most data in the other\u2019s legacy systems,  until such time as the departments\u2019 modernized systems are fully  developed and implemented. According to a VA/DOD annual report and  program officials, the departments now consider BHIE an interim step in  their overall strategy to create a two-way exchange of electronic medical  records.", "The departments\u2019 reported costs for the various sharing initiatives and the  modernization of their health information systems through fiscal year 2007  are shown in table 3.", "Beyond these initiatives, in January 2007, the departments announced a  further change to their information-sharing strategy: their intention to  jointly develop a new inpatient medical record system. On July 31, 2007,  they awarded a contract for a feasibility study. According to the  departments, adopting this joint solution is expected to facilitate the  seamless transition of active-duty service members to veteran status, and  make inpatient health care data on shared patients immediately accessible  to both DOD and VA. In addition, the departments believe that a joint  development effort could enable them to realize significant cost savings.

This task force, reporting on gaps in services provided to  returning veterans, noted problems in sharing information on wounded  service members, including the inability of VA providers to access paper  DOD inpatient health records. The task force stated that although  significant progress has been made towards sharing electronic  information, more needs to be done, and recommended that VA and DOD  continue to identify long-term initiatives and define the scope and  elements of a joint inpatient electronic health record.

Specifically, while VA\u2019s medical records are already  electronic, it must still convert them into the interoperable format  appropriate for its repository. DOD, in addition to converting current  records from its multiple systems, must also address medical records that  are not automated. As pointed out by a recent Army Inspector General\u2019s  report, some DOD facilities are having problems with hard copy records.  The report also identified inaccurate and incomplete health data as a  problem to be addressed.
