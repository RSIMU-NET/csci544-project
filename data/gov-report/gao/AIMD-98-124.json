To obtain this information, we developed and sent a data collection instrument to survey 42 federal departments and agencies, all states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. All the federal agencies and 39 of the state-level organizations responded to our survey during the first quarter of 1998. Many of the respondents were not able to provide consistent or complete data because they had only recently begun inventorying and assessing data exchanges and this data generally had not been centrally tracked and managed.

As computers play an ever-increasing role in our society, more information is being exchanged regularly. Federal agencies now depend on electronic data exchanges to execute programs and facilitate commerce. For example, federal agencies routinely use data exchanges to transfer funds to contractors and grantees; collect data necessary to make eligibility determinations for veterans, social security, and medicare benefits; gather data on program activities to determine if funds are being expended as intended and the expected outcomes achieved; and share weather information that is essential for air flight safety. To facilitate commerce, federal agencies regulate or provide oversight to organizations that use data exchanges extensively to process payments through the banking system; purchase or sell securities through stock exchanges and futures markets; and facilitate import and export shipments through ports of entry. We have reported on potential data exchange issues that could affect many of these activities (see the list of related products at the end of this report).", "An electronic data exchange is the transfer (sending or receiving) of a data set using electronic media. Electronic data exchanges can be made using various methods, including direct computer-to-computer exchanges over a dedicated network; direct exchanges over commercially available networks or the Internet; or exchanges of magnetic media such as computer tapes or disks. The information transferred in a data set often includes at least one date.", "Because many computer systems have been using a 2-digit year in the date format, the data exchanges have also used 2-digit years. Now that many formats are being changed to use 4 digits to correctly process dates beyond 1999, data exchanges using 2-digit year formats must also be changed to 4 digits or bridges must be used to convert incoming 2-digit years to 4-digit years or convert outgoing 4-digit years to 2-digits. These conversions generally involve the use of algorithms to distinguish the century (for example, 2-digit years less than 50 may be considered 2000 dates and 2-digit years of 50 or more may be considered 1900 dates). In addition to using bridges, filters may be needed to screen and identify incoming noncompliant data to prevent it from corrupting data in the receiving system.", "These conversions are not necessary if the data exchanges are designed to employ certain electronic data interchange standards (see appendix II for a glossary of data exchange standards used by some federal agencies). A data exchange standard defines the format of a specific data set for transmission. Some of these standards specify a 4-digit year format. Federal agencies often use exchanges that do not involve a standard format. Instead, the data exchanges consist of individual text files with a structure that is established by agreement between the exchange partners. Files using these formats are generally referred to as flat files.", "As part of their Year 2000 correction efforts, organizations must identify the date formats used in their data exchanges, develop a strategy for dealing with exchanges that do not use 4-digit year formats, and implement the strategy. These efforts generally involve the following steps.", "Assess information systems to identify data exchanges that are not Year 2000 compliant.", "Contact the exchange partner and reach agreement on the date format to be used in the exchange.", "Determine if data bridges and filters are needed.", "Determine if validation processes are needed for incoming data.", "Set dates for testing and implementing new exchange formats.", "Develop and test bridges and filters to handle nonconforming data.", "Develop contingency plans and procedures for data exchanges and incorporate into overall agency contingency plans. Implement the validation process for incoming data.", "Test and implement new exchange formats.", "The testing and implementation of new data exchanges must be closely coordinated with exchange partners to be completed effectively. In addition to an agency testing its data exchange software, effective testing involves end-to-end testing\u2014initiation of the exchange by the sending computer, transmission through intermediate communications software and hardware, and receipt and acceptance by receiving computer(s), thus completing the exchange process.", "Resolving data exchange issues will require significant efforts and costs according to federal and state officials. At an October 1997 summit, federal and state information technology officials estimated that about 20 percent of Year 2000 efforts will be directed toward correcting data exchange problems. This could be significant considering the magnitude of expected Year 2000 costs. According to OMB\u2019s February 15, 1998, Year 2000 status reports of 24 federal agencies, the federal government\u2019s Year 2000 costs are estimated to be about $4.7 billion. Based on estimates provided by states to NASIRE, the states\u2019 Year 2000 costs are estimated to be about $5.0 billion.", "If Year 2000 data exchange problems are not corrected, the adverse impact could be severe. Federal agencies exchange data with thousands of external entities, including other federal agencies, state agencies, private organizations, and foreign governments and private organizations. If data exchanges do not function properly, data will not be exchanged between systems or invalid data could cause receiving computer systems to malfunction or produce inaccurate computations. For example, such failures could result in the", "Social Security Administration not being able to determine the eligibility of applicants or compute and pay benefits because it relies on data exchanges for eligibility information and payment processing. This could have a widespread impact on the public since the agency processes payments to more than 50 million beneficiaries each month, which in fiscal year 1997 totaled about $400 billion;", "National Highway Traffic Safety Administration not being able to provide states with information needed for driver registrations, which could result in licenses being issued to drivers with revoked or suspended licenses in other states;", "Department of Veterans Affairs not being able to determine correct benefits and make payments to eligible veterans;", "U.S. Coast Guard not receiving weather information necessary to plan search and rescue operations; and", "Nuclear Regulatory Commission not receiving information from nuclear reactors that is needed to trigger emergency response actions.", "The overall responsibility for tracking and overseeing actions by federal agencies to address Year 2000 issues rests with OMB and the President\u2019s Council on Year 2000 Conversion that was established in February 1998.

At the summit, federal agency and state representatives agreed to establish a contiguous 4-digit year date as a default standard for exchanges. They also agreed that federal agencies will take the lead in providing information on exchanges with states, any planned date format changes, and timeframes for any changes. In addition, joint federal and state policy and working groups were established to continue the dialogue on exchange issues.", "To implement these agreements, OMB issued instructions in January 1998 for federal agencies to inventory all data exchanges with outside parties by February 1, 1998, and coordinate plans for transitioning to Year 2000 compliant data exchanges with exchange partners by March 1, 1998. OMB also set March 1999 as the target date to complete the data exchange corrections. In addition, for the February 15, 1998, quarterly reports, OMB required the federal agencies to describe the status of their efforts to inventory all data exchanges with outside entities and the method for assuring that those organizations will be or have been contacted, particularly state governments. However, OMB did not require the agencies to report their status in completing key steps for data exchanges, such as those listed earlier in this report.", "According to its Year 2000 Coordinator, NASIRE plans to continue implementing the agreements reached at the October 1997 summit through active participation in joint policy and working groups and by holding additional state/federal meetings on data exchange issues.

Almost 90 percent of the exchanges were reported by the Federal Reserve and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) which reported having 316,862 and 133,567, respectively. The Federal Reserve exchanges data with federal agencies and the private sector using software it provides to these entities.

For each noncompliant exchange, the agency must reach agreement with the exchange partners on whether they will (1) change the date format to make it compliant or (2) agree to retain the existing 2-digit format and use bridges as an interim measure. To resolve Year 2000 data exchange problems, all federal agencies have chosen to adopt a contiguous 4-digit year format; however, some agencies plan to continue using a 2-digit year format for some of their exchanges in the near term. If a 2-digit exchange format is retained but the agency\u2019s system will be using 4-digit years, the agency must develop, test, and implement (1) bridges to convert dates to a useable form and (2) filters to recognize 2-digit years and prevent them from entering agency systems. In addition, the agencies should identify the exchanges where there is a probability that, even though agreements have been reached to exchange 4-digit years, one partner may not be compliant. In these cases, agencies must develop contingency plans to ensure that mission-critical operations continue.", "The status of activities to contact and reach agreement on Year 2000 readiness with exchange partners varies significantly among federal agencies.

OMB has taken an important step by issuing this directive. However, the May progress reports showed that federal agencies are making slow progress in their Year 2000 activities and this reinforces the need for OMB to provide clear directions on this critical issue. Because of the risk that exchange partners may not be able to make their systems and exchanges Year 2000 compliant and the importance of developing effective contingency plans, OMB should provide explicit directions to ensure that agencies devote sufficient management attention and resources to this critical activity. Such directions should clearly require agencies to perform the key tasks associated with initiating the project, preparing business impact analysis, developing contingency plans, and testing the plans.", "Regarding our recommendation that OMB require agencies to report their status in completing key steps for data exchanges as part of the regular Year 2000 status reports, OMB stated that the posting of data exchange status information on a web site, as discussed above, will be used rather than imposing an additional reporting requirement on agencies. OMB explained that it and NASIRE have agreed to this approach because it (1) provides sufficient information at a policy level to ensure that the work is getting done, (2) promotes the greatest exchange of information at the working level, and (3) minimizes duplication of reporting. As we previously stated, establishing this status reporting process is a positive step; however, the website will contain information on thousands of data exchanges with states and must be summarized and analyzed for it to be useful in managing and monitoring the time-critical activities to resolve data exchange issues. Also, as previously noted, this reporting requirement only covers the status of exchanges with states and thus excludes the other data exchanges that constitute over 80 percent of the total exchanges.", "OMB agreed with our recommendation that agencies should give priority to installing the filters necessary to prevent the corruption of mission-critical systems and said that it plans to update its guidance to agencies to make sure they recognize this priority as well.", "OMB did not agree that agencies need to notify their exchange partners of the implications to the agency and the exchange partners if they do not make date conversions in time to meet the schedule for testing and implementing Year 2000 compliant data exchange processes. OMB stated that exchange partners are well aware of the implications of failing to make date conversions. Although exchange partners are aware of the general implications of date exchange failures, the partners will not know the implications if they do not meet testing and implementation schedules for specific exchanges, unless the agencies notify their exchange partners. Knowledge of these implications is important because the exchange partners have many competing demands for Year 2000 resources and may have to decide which activities will be completed on time and which will be deferred. Therefore, exchange partners need to know the implications of data exchange failures, including the actions that will be needed under contingency plans if the partners do not meet key milestones for testing and implementing data exchanges.", "OMB also disagreed with our recommendation that the federal CIO Council (1) identify the areas in which adequate forums on Year 2000 issues are not available for our international trade partners and (2) develop an approach to promote Year 2000 compliance activities by these trading partners. OMB said that the Chair of the President\u2019s Council on Year 2000 Conversion agreed that international implications of the Year 2000 problems are of the gravest concern, but disagreed that the CIO Council would be the right place to begin addressing these problems. According to OMB, the Chair has met with representatives from two international organizations to encourage them to be more involved in Year 2000 activities and with the Secretary of State who agreed to have ambassadors conduct outreach efforts in each country. OMB also said that the Chair has asked agency heads to encourage international organizations to cooperate in addressing Year 2000 problems. The steps taken by the Chair to promote international actions on Year 2000 problems represent progress but much more organized, concerted, and continuous effort are needed to adequately address this far-reaching and complex issue\u2014one that the Chair has acknowledged as being of gravest concern.
