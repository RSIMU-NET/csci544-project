It grew into the nation\u2019s largest direct delivery system.", "Veterans\u2019 health care benefits include medically necessary hospital and nursing home care and some outpatient care. Certain veterans, however, have a higher priority for receiving care and are eligible for a wider range of services. Such veterans are generally referred to as Category A, or mandatory care category, veterans.", "More specifically, VA must provide hospital care, and, if space and resources are available, may provide nursing home care to certain veterans with injuries related to their service or whose incomes are below specified levels. These mandatory care veterans include those who have service-connected disabilities, were discharged from the military for disabilities that were incurred or aggravated in the line of duty, are former prisoners of war, were exposed to certain toxic substances or ionizing radiation, served during the Mexican Border Period or World War I, receive disability compensation, receive nonservice-connected disability pension benefits, and have incomes below the means test threshold (as of January 1995, $20,469 for a single veteran or $24,565 for a veteran with one dependent, plus $1,368 for each additional dependent).", "For veterans with higher incomes who do not qualify under these conditions\u2014called discretionary care category veterans\u2014VA may provide hospital care if space and resources are available.

Only veterans with service-connected disabilities rated at 50 percent or higher (about 465,000 veterans) are in the mandatory care category for comprehensive outpatient care. All veterans with service-connected disabilities are in the mandatory care category for treatments related to their disabilities; they are also eligible for hospital-related care of nonservice-connected conditions, but, with the exception of veterans with disabilities rated at 30 or 40 percent, they are in the discretionary care category. Most veterans with no service-connected disabilities are eligible only for hospital-related outpatient care and, with few exceptions, are in the discretionary care category.", "From its roots as a system to treat war injuries, VA health care has increasingly shifted toward a system focused on treating low-income veterans with medical conditions unrelated to military service. In fiscal year 1995, only about 12 percent of the patients treated in VA hospitals received treatment for service-connected disabilities. By contrast, about 59 percent of the patients treated had no service-connected disabilities. About 28 percent of VA hospital patients had service-connected disabilities but were treated for conditions not related to those disabilities.

Delaying or stopping activations is, however, a difficult political decision, particularly for those projects already under way.", "In its analysis of the resources needed to maintain current services in the next 7 fiscal years, VA assumed that it will continue to incur additional costs, add staff, and attract new users through facility activations. For example, VA\u2019s estimate that it will need $20.9 billion in the year 2000 to maintain current services includes increases of over $993 million and 10,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees for activations. In other words, the inclusion of activation costs overstates the resources VA will need in the year 2000 to maintain current services by almost $1 billion.", "In addition, the funds VA seeks for activations may be overstated because the activations planning process is not integrated with the resource planning and management (RPM) system workload forecasting process. VA sought about $108 million and 1,509 FTEs in its fiscal year 1996 budget submission to support a projected increase in the number of veterans seeking care. These estimates, based on workload forecasts developed through RPM, reflect historical trend data that could include workload increases resulting from prior years\u2019 facility and program activations. In other words, the resources requested for workload increases projected using RPM likely include resources for some of the estimated workload to be generated through fiscal year 1996 activations.

For example, a hospital\u2019s buying an infrequently used diagnostic test from another hospital is often cheaper than buying the needed equipment and providing the service directly. Similarly, a hospital that uses an expensive piece of equipment only 4 hours a day but has staff to operate the equipment for 8 hours can generate additional revenues by selling its excess capacity to other providers.", "To use federal agencies\u2019 resources to maximum capacity and avoid unnecessary duplication and overlap of activities, VA is authorized to sell excess health care services to DOD. In addition, VA can share specialized medical resources with nonfederal hospitals, clinics, and medical schools. VA may sell medical resources to DOD and the private sector only if the sale does not adversely affect health care services to veterans. As an incentive to share excess health care resources, VA facilities providing services through sharing agreements may recover and retain the cost of the services from DOD or private-sector facilities.", "In fiscal year 1995, VA sold about $25.3 million in specialized medical resources to private-sector hospitals and about $33.0 million in health care services to the military health care system. Although VA facilities received separate reimbursement for the workload generated through these sharing agreements, the workload was nevertheless included in VA\u2019s justification of its budget request.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, VHA said that VA provided care to about 45,000 unique sharing agreement patients in 1994. VHA said that even though its base workload counts do include sharing, the levels are small and its inclusion of sharing makes no material difference in VA\u2019s workload presentations.

The savings resulted because VA pharmacies handled over 15 million fewer prescriptions. Although VA encouraged its medical centers to implement multimonth dispensing in response to our January 1992 report, not all potential savings have occurred because medical centers have been slow to adopt multimonth dispensing.", "Purchasing services from community providers when they can provide the care at a lower cost could also produce savings. VA has encouraged its medical centers to establish \u201caccess points\u201d to improve accessibility for veterans and encourage the shift to primary care. Access points can be established as VA-operated outpatient clinics as well as through contractual or sharing agreements. To date, only a few medical centers have established such access points, but many others are developing plans. Early indications are that access points established through contracts with community providers can often provide services at lower cost than VA outpatient clinics. The ultimate effect of access points on overall VA spending depends, however, on such issues as the extent to which the access points attract new users and to which current users increase their use of VA services in response to improved accessibility.", "VA should save over $225 million in 7 years by adopting Medicare fee schedules. VA\u2019s IG compared the amount paid by VA under its fee-basis program with Medicare fee schedules and found that VA paid more than the Medicare rate in over half of the cases reviewed. VA plans to adopt Medicare fee schedules for both its outpatient fee-basis payments and for payment of inpatient physician and ancillary services at non-VA  hospitals. VA expects to begin using Medicare fee schedules by July 1996.", "By establishing primary care teams, VA hospitals should be able to reduce veterans\u2019 inappropriate use of more costly specialty clinics and achieve significant savings in staff costs. As we reported in October 1993, VA hospitals allow many veterans to receive general medical care in specialty care clinics after their conditions are stabilized. Transferring such veterans to primary care clinics in a timely manner would allow lower cost primary care staff to meet their medical needs rather than higher cost specialists.", "By purchasing specialized medical care services, such as positron-emission tomography scans and lithotripsy, from community providers rather than buying expensive, but seldom used, equipment, VA could reduce its cost of providing such services while it improves accessibility of such care for veterans. For example, although the Albuquerque VA medical center treated only 24 veterans for kidney stone removal in fiscal years 1990 through 1992, the hospital purchased a lithotripter, equipment that breaks up kidney stones so that they can be eliminated without surgery, at a cost of almost $1.2 million. During its first year of operation, 34 veterans received treatment. A private provider in the same city offered lithotripsy services for $2,920 a procedure. Thus, the hospital could have met the 34 veterans\u2019 needs at a cost of about $100,000 compared with its expenditure of $1.2 million plus operating costs. Although the hospital sold lithotripsy services to more nonveterans than it provided to veterans, the hospital has used the equipment at less than one-fifth of its normal operating capacity.", "VA also expects to save costs by establishing a national drug formulary.", "Historically, each VA facility has established its own formulary\u2014that is, a list of medications approved for use for treating patients. VA noted that establishing a national formulary should increase standardization, decrease inventory costs, heighten efficiency, and lower pharmaceutical costs through enhanced competition. VA has not estimated the possible savings, but it could save $100 million if using the national formulary could reduce the cost of purchasing medications by 10 percent. In commenting on a draft of this report, VHA said that $100 million probably overstates the possible savings. Savings realized through volume-committed contracting would, in VHA\u2019s opinion, be offset by the costs of new therapies. (See VHA\u2019s comment 17 in app. II.)

The task force expected that these facility integrations could reduce service and staffing duplication, integrate clinical programs, achieve economies of scale, and free resources to invest in new services. As of March 1996, about one-third of the recommended integrations had been approved. VA allows the facilities, however, to reinvest the savings into providing more clinical programs.

Nonacute admissions to the 50 randomly selected VA hospitals studied ranged from 25 to 72 percent. The study suggested several reasons for the higher rate of nonacute admissions to VA hospitals than to private-sector hospitals, including the following:", "VA facilities do not have financial incentives to make the transition to outpatient care; the VA system, unlike private-sector health care, does not have formal mechanisms to control nonacute admissions, such as mandatory preadmission review; and the VA system, unlike private-sector health care, has a significantly expanded social mission that may influence the use of resources for patients.", "A 1993 study by VA researchers reported similar findings. At the 24 VA hospitals studied, 47 percent of admissions and 45 percent of days of care in acute medical wards were nonacute; 64 percent of admissions and 34 percent of days of care in surgical wards were nonacute. Reasons cited for nonacute admissions and days of care included nonavailability of outpatient care, conservative physician practices, delays in discharge planning, and social factors. Although the study cited VA eligibility as contributing to some inappropriate admissions and days of care, the study recommended only minor changes in VA eligibility provisions. Rather, it suggested that VA establish a systemwide utilization review program.

At some point, closing a hospital and providing care either through another VA hospital or through contracts with community hospitals may become less costly. Closing hospitals and contracting for care, however, entail some risk. Allowing veterans to get free hospital care in community hospitals closer to their homes could result in increased demand for VA-supported hospital care, offsetting any savings achieved through contracting.", "The feasibility of closing underused hospitals was demonstrated when VA recently closed the Sepulveda VA medical center, which was damaged in an earthquake, and transferred the workload to the West Los Angeles medical center. VA\u2019s IG found that the reported numbers of inpatients treated at both Sepulveda and West Los Angeles had declined significantly over the prior 4-year period and that the declining workload may have been even greater than VA reported because the facilities\u2019 workload reports were overstated.
