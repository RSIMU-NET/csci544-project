For example, SEC has developed and implemented procedures for identifying and assessing FINRA program risks, which then inform its annual oversight plan and activities for FINRA. In 2012, GAO found that SEC's approach to developing a risk-based approach to oversight of FINRA did not incorporate all the components of a risk-management framework. GAO recommended that SEC follow all components of a risk-management framework. While SEC has taken some actions, this report found that SEC's risk-based oversight program could be more robust and consistent with risk-management and federal internal control standards. Specifically, SEC has yet to", "develop specific performance goals and measures, with corresponding targets to monitor its progress toward the goal of enhancing FINRA oversight;", "formalize procedures for documenting its oversight determinations, such as selecting FINRA areas for inspections and any changes made to planned oversight activities; and", "Complementary to its implementation of risk-assessment procedures to assist in selecting FINRA programs and operations for oversight, SEC also has taken a number of other steps to enhance its oversight of FINRA. One such step was creating and filling the position of Senior Special Counsel-FINRA and New Markets to work with SEC management in coordinating FINRA oversight activities and reviewing information to inform the risk assessment. Another step was the transition of its FINRA district office inspections, which evaluate various FINRA regulatory programs, from a set schedule (or cycle-based) model to a risk-focused model. Under this risk-focused model, staff analyze information and data, such as the number of high-risk firms in a district, to identify risks and make recommendations for which offices to inspect. A third step SEC took was revising its process for assessing FINRA's broker-dealer examinations to inform its assessment of FINRA program risks.", "SEC also recently completed inspections of each of the areas listed in Section 964 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), such as governance and executive compensation. The inspections GAO reviewed were conducted in a manner generally consistent with Government Auditing Standards and the information gathered was further used to inform SEC's FINRA risk assessment.

Under this system, privately  funded nongovernmental entities, commonly referred to as self-regulatory  organizations (SRO), such as national securities exchanges and  associations, perform much of the day-to-day oversight of the securities  markets and broker-dealers under their jurisdiction. SROs are primarily  responsible for establishing standards under which members conduct  business; monitoring how that business is conducted; and bringing  disciplinary actions against members for violating applicable federal  statutes, SEC rules, and SRO rules.

We selected these  two agencies for comparison purposes because, among other things,  they have established written guidance for conducting their risk-focused  examinations of regulated entities and have specific guidance for  programs and operations similar to some of the selected FINRA areas  under Section 964 of the Dodd-Frank Act.

According to Market Oversight staff, one purpose of  monitoring is to actively track FINRA developments to inform future  FINRA risk assessments and oversight activities. Through the risk- assessment process, Market Oversight management may select a  specific FINRA program(s) for monitoring. For example, in fiscal year  2014, Market Oversight selected an area for monitoring\u2014which included  the review of FINRA reports and meetings with FINRA officials. Similarly,  completed inspections can also inform which issues are selected for  future monitoring.", "Furthermore, OCIE created and filled, within Market Oversight, the  position of Senior Special Counsel-FINRA and New Markets to monitor  FINRA generally and coordinate its FINRA oversight activities.  According to Market Oversight staff, a primary objective of the position is  to coordinate with Market Oversight management in gathering information  on FINRA from a variety of sources to inform the risk-assessment  process and oversight decisions. The Senior Special Counsel reviews  the information collected and provided by FINRA and works with Market  Oversight management to identify any issues that may require further  oversight and create a draft risk assessment. The draft risk assessment is  then used by Market Oversight\u2019s senior management (associate director  and assistant directors) and the counsel to make final risk-assessment  and oversight activity determinations.", "OCIE also has transitioned its FINRA district office inspections to a risk- focused model and centralized responsibility for the inspections in Market  Oversight. Previously, OCIE conducted comprehensive inspections of  each office on a 3-year cycle. Under the risk-focused model, Market  Oversight staff now conduct risk-focused inspections targeting particular  areas, district offices, or both. Market Oversight staff scope and plan the  district office inspections and prepare the final reports. Staff from Market  Oversight and SEC\u2019s regional offices carry out the inspections and  provide input throughout the process. According to Market Oversight  documents, in making recommendations to management as to which  FINRA district offices to inspect in the most recent round of inspections,  staff reviewed information and data requested from FINRA regarding  general organization, regulatory operations, enforcement program,  cooperation with state securities regulators, and internal auditing of  FINRA\u2019s 15 district offices, among others. The staff also spoke with  various SEC offices and divisions to learn about any material risks these  offices noted in their work with FINRA. In selecting offices for inspection,  staff considered individual risks to the office, types of risk, and location.  Market Oversight documents also show that staff analyzed a variety of  information in making their recommendations, such as the number of  cause examinations and enforcement matters, the number of branch  offices, and the number of high-risk firms in a district office\u2019s jurisdiction.", "Finally, OCIE recently began including a review of the outcomes of  FINRA\u2019s broker-dealer examinations as a factor in all of its broker-dealer  examinations.

The office provides  guidance on issues such as personal and financial conflicts of interest,  post-employment restrictions, securities holdings and transactions, the  receipt of gifts, and adequate financial disclosure.
