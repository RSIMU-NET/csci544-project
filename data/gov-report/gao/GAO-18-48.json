To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant sections of title 5 of the U.S.C; analyzed MSPB and OPM data, and interviewed, among others, agency officials and subject-matter experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Chapter 75 of title 5 of the U.S. Code specifies the formal legal process that most agencies must follow when taking adverse actions, i.e., suspensions, demotions, reductions in pay or grade, and removals, for acts of employee misconduct. Chapter 75 details the built-in procedural rights certain federal employees are entitled to when faced with adverse actions.", "Depending on the nature of misconduct, an agency may use utilize alternative discipline approaches traditionally used in government to correct behavior. Alternative discipline is an approach to address misconduct that is available to agencies in lieu of traditional penalties (e.g., letters of reprimand and suspensions of 14 days or less). An example is a last chance agreement, whereby an employee recognizes the agency's right to terminate him or her should another act of misconduct occur.", "Based on the data collected by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), agencies formally discipline an estimated 17,000 employees annually under Chapter 75, or less than 1 percent of the federal workforce, for misconduct. Based on OPM data, in 2016, agencies made 10,249 suspensions, 7,411 removals, and 114 demotions for misconduct. However, because of weaknesses in OPM's data on employee misconduct, which is provided by the agencies, OPM is unable to accurately target supervisory training to address misconduct, and decision-makers do not know the full extent or nature of this misconduct.", "Key lessons learned can help agencies better prevent and respond to misconduct. For example, tables of penalties provide a list of the infractions committed most frequently by agency employees, along with a suggested range of penalties for each to ensure consistent treatment for similar offenses. However, not all agencies have a table of penalties, including OPM, nor are agencies required by statute, case law or OPM regulations. Subject-matter experts we contacted identified additional promising practices that agencies can use to respond employee misconduct. Some of these are presented below.", "Agencies are accountable for providing required training to their managers.

While  this number is relatively small, even a few cases of employee misconduct  can have significant impacts on workplace morale and impede an  agency\u2019s efforts to achieve its mission. Indeed, according to a 2008 study  by the Merit System Protection Board (MSPB), \u201cMisconduct affects not  only the employee and the supervisor; it also impacts those who interact  with the employee.\u201d To that end, it is important for agencies to timely and  effectively address cases of employee misconduct while simultaneously  respecting employees\u2019 procedural and due process rights.", "The term \u201cemployee misconduct\u201d does not have a general definition in a  statute or government-wide regulations. Agencies may elaborate on types  of misconduct in handbooks and other internal guidance.

According to OPM officials, the lack of a general definition of misconduct  gives agencies flexibility in the manner in which they address misconduct.  Ultimately, when an agency needs to take an adverse action against an  employee for inappropriate workplace behavior, it must do so \u201cfor such  cause as will promote the efficiency of the service\u201d as provided for in 5  U.S.C.

Poor performance can generally be described  as an employee\u2019s inability to carry out work responsibilities, while  misconduct can be described as an employee, willfully or otherwise,  violating stated policies or norms. In certain cases, however, employee  performance and misconduct can overlap, combining the two issues.  Sleeping on the job, for example, is both a failure to abide by norms of  conduct an agency would expect of an employee on duty and a failure to  perform.", "Our prior work on poor performers found that adverse actions, including  suspensions, demotions, and removals, take time to resolve and because  of a lack of internal support, concerns over litigation and other factors,  supervisors may be hesitant to initiate required procedures outlined in the  United States Code (hereinafter U.S.C.). Supervisors can address  misconduct through alternative discipline approaches which can shorten  the timeline and eliminate costly litigation if the employee decides to  appeal an adverse action. When used under the right circumstances,  alternative discipline may be more efficient and effective than traditional  discipline.", "You asked us to examine the process for addressing misconduct and to  identify any challenges to removing employees for misconduct. Our  objectives were to (1) describe the process that agencies are required to  follow in responding to employee misconduct in the federal service; (2)  identify alternative approaches to the formal legal process that agencies  can use to respond to misconduct, and assess what factors affect  agencies\u2019 responses; (3) describe trends in removals and other adverse  actions resulting from misconduct; and (4) identify key practices agencies  can use to help them better prevent and address misconduct.", "To address the first objective, we reviewed relevant sections of Title 5  chapter 75 of the U.S.C.

We  reviewed OPM regulations and documents to determine the legal  framework within which most agencies address employee misconduct in  the federal service, including formal procedural and employee appeal  rights. To describe and assess factors that affect an agency\u2019s response to  employee misconduct, we interviewed a panel of chief human capital  officers (CHCO) from selected agencies as well as current and former  human capital practitioners and other individuals and organizations with  expertise in working on employee misconduct issues.

The time range depends on whether the employee appeals their  case and other factors.", "Agencies may also incur litigation expenses if an employee decides to  appeal an adverse action. While there are costs to addressing  misconduct, agencies also incur indirect costs when misconduct goes  unaddressed in the workplace. These indirect costs include corrosive  effects on other employees\u2019 morale, higher employee turnover, reduced  productivity, and lower employee commitment to their work or agency.  Indirect costs also include redirecting management\u2019s attention away from  achieving the agency\u2019s mission.", "Employee misconduct in the federal government is regulated by a well- developed body of statutes and regulations as well as decisions from  MSPB and U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and Supreme  Court.

Ultimately, if an agency needs to take an adverse action for inappropriate  workplace behavior, it must do so \u201cfor such cause as will promote the  efficiency of the service\u201d as provided for in Title 5, Chapter 75. OPM has  also prescribed some regulations on employee responsibilities and  conduct.

Moreover, OPM maintains that supervisors have a responsibility to set  clear rules and expectations for employees in the workplace. It is  imperative that federal agencies manage their workforces effectively,  which includes the effective use of discipline when addressing employee  misconduct. In addition, employees may be disciplined for conduct that  that they knew or should have known was unacceptable. Similarly,  federal executive branch employees have a responsibility to adhere to  principles of ethical conduct and should avoid any actions that appear to  violate the law or ethical standards.", "Overall, the objective of discipline is to deal with employees who are  unwilling or unable to behave properly, and, where management deems it  possible and appropriate, correct deficiencies in employee conduct.

According to OPM officials, alternative  discipline approaches are not appropriate for egregious acts of  misconduct or when the employee is remorseless but rather lower level  offenses where an employee may show remorse for the misconduct and  demonstrate that she or he can be rehabilitated. Egregious acts of  misconduct may involve discrimination, reprisal or retaliation, or sexual  harassment. Alternative discipline approaches are also not appropriate  when the employee\u2019s continued presence in the workplace would pose a  threat to the employee or others.", "On a case by case basis, an agency may decide to provide counseling or  additional training as appropriate, depending on the facts and  circumstances that address specific acts of minor misconduct.  Additionally, agencies have flexibility in using alternative discipline as a  final effort before taking formal action such as suspension or removal.  However, in its 2008 report, MSPB found that managers had applied  alternative discipline approaches ineffectively, resulting in further  inefficiencies in the civil service. Specifically, MSPB recommended that  managers and human resources personnel consult with legal counsel  when drafting and implementing an alternative discipline agreement that  requires the employee\u2019s consent, adding that it is extremely important for  agreements to meet certain legal requirements to form a valid agreement.  CHCOs and subject-matter experts said managers and supervisors  should coordinate internally with human resources staff, employee  relations, and legal counsel when assessing whether an alternative  discipline approach would result in correcting improper behavior and  ultimately improve their workforce.", "Some subject-matter experts we interviewed expressed concern that  workforces would view alternative discipline measures as providing  opportunities for employees to avoid accountability or encouraging similar  negative behaviors from coworkers rather than penalizing the employee  more stringently through a formal adverse action process. These subject- matter experts identified community service, buy-outs, involvement in  process improvements, and clean-slate agreements as approaches that  had this kind of effect. Additionally, some subject-matter experts told us  that alternative discipline approaches such as community service and  paper suspension agreements could have the unintended effect of  benefiting the employee being disciplined. For example, community  service may allow the employee to serve the alternative discipline during  their scheduled duty time instead of performing their regularly assigned  duties. This may require the employee\u2019s co-workers to take on additional  work while the employee serves the alternative discipline. Additionally,  while a paper suspension limits interruption to work production, it also  allows the employee to work in a pay status while carrying out the  suspension. According to feedback we received from the CHCOs, some  of these alternative discipline approaches were used more often than  others and some approaches were more effective at addressing  employee misconduct. We did not evaluate how often or the extent to  which any of these approaches are used at agencies, nor did we consider  the propriety or legality of these approaches.", "According to the CHCOs and subject-matter experts, agency managers  and supervisors may be able to effectively resolve employee misconduct  cases through the use of alternative approaches, which can shorten the  timeline and simplify the adverse action process in a manner that has the  most potential to prevent additional harm to the workplace and avoid the  potentially high costs of litigating a misconduct case."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Several Factors Can Affect Whether and How an Agency Addresses Employee Misconduct", "paragraphs": ["Current and former agency officials and subject-matter experts we  interviewed told us in interviews that several factors can affect whether  and how an agency responds to misconduct.

Therefore, some cases include a mix of employee poor performance and  misconduct. OPM officials said they do not have a sense of how  frequently agencies use these (and other non-specific) nature of action  (NOA) codes for misconduct-related actions. According to OPM officials,  by establishing rules in terms of improving the efficiency of the service  and the types of actions that will require specific procedures, Congress  provided managers with maximum flexibility to pursue adverse actions  whenever it would promote the efficiency of the service, whether the  underlying impetus was a conduct issue or a failure to perform.", "OPM officials told us the Guide to Processing Personnel Actions directs  agencies to indicate the nature of personnel actions in the EHRI database  through the NOA codes. These codes indicate the employee type, the  nature of the personnel action to be recorded in EHRI, as well as the  underlying cause (e.g., conduct or performance) for the personnel action.  OPM performs validity checks on the NOA codes and legal authorities to  assure the agencies are compliant with OPM reporting  requirements.

To avoid these outcomes for both parties, an agency may  offer the employee a variety of settlement options to incentivize them to  willingly leave.

The officials described tables of  penalties as a listing of common infractions committed most frequently by  agency employees, along with a suggested range of penalties for first,  second and third offenses; however, the range of penalties should not be  too broad, and the penalties should be progressive, meaning that they  increase in harshness with each subsequent offense committed by the  employee. The CHCOs and subject-matter experts said a table of  penalties should also provide sufficient flexibility in the penalty range  (e.g., 1-day to 5-day suspensions for a first offense) to consider mitigating  and aggravating factors when considering discipline for misconduct. OPM  officials stated that where an agency elects to have a table of penalties, it  should serve as a guide in addressing misconduct, noting that it does not  serve as a substitute for management\u2019s judgment. According to OPM  officials, management must take into account the applicable Douglas  Factors, and must consider other appropriate circumstances not covered  by the Douglas Factors. Neither OPM nor MSPB provide any written  guidance to agencies in developing their tables of penalties. However,  OPM officials told us their agency is available to provide assistance upon  request to agencies that elect to use a table of penalties.", "Views on the usefulness of the tables of penalties were mixed among  agency officials and subject-matter experts. On the one hand, some  agency officials and other subject-matter experts told us the table of  penalties can assist agencies in determining an appropriate penalty and  ensure consistency of penalty selection from case to case. For that  reason, they said the tables can also help ensure the action taken is  legally defensible based on past similar cases. MSPB officials told us that  they believe table of penalties, which rely on the Douglas Factors, can  help human capital practitioners when making decisions about employee  misconduct cases.

It also ensures merit system principles  guide the process by providing penalty transparency, reducing arbitrary or  capricious penalties, and serve as a guide for managers and supervisors  who deal with these issues.", "With respect to our recommendations, OPM did not concur with our first  recommendation to explore the feasibility of improving the quality of data  on employee misconduct by providing additional guidance to agencies on  how to record instances of misconduct in OPM\u2019s databases. Specifically,  OPM noted that the OPM Guide to Processing Personnel Actions is a  thorough resource that has been and continues to be successfully relied  upon by agencies to document adverse actions as expressly defined in  Chapter 75. We acknowledge OPM\u2019s view that NOA codes were never  intended or designed to allow reporting of adverse actions down to the  degree of a particular kind of misconduct involved, but we maintain that  our recommendation would increase confidence in the data on  misconduct and make it more useful to OPM and agencies. Further,  OPM\u2019s non-concurrence with this recommendation seems inconsistent  with the Administration\u2019s own initiatives, including the May 2018  Executive Order Promoting Accountability and Streamlining Removal  Procedures Consistent with Merit System Principles, which was released  after OPM commented on our draft report. Specifically, the Executive  Order requires all federal agencies, beginning in FY18, and for each fiscal  year thereafter, to provide a report to the OPM Director containing  detailed data about how it addressed issues of misconduct. For example,  agencies will need to report out on  (i)  the number of civilian employees in a probationary period or otherwise  employed for a specific term who were removed by the agency;  (ii)  the number of adverse personnel actions taken against civilian  employees by the agency, broken down by type of adverse personnel  action, including reduction in grade or pay (or equivalent), suspension,  and removal; and  (iii) the number of decisions on proposed removals by the agency taken  under chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code, not issued within 15  business days of the end of the employee reply period.", "We maintain that enhanced data on the extent and nature of misconduct  will help strengthen OPM and congressional oversight and better position  agencies to address misconduct through management training and other  approaches.", "OPM partially concurred with our second recommendation to broadly  disseminate to agencies the promising practices and lessons learned,  such as those described in this report, as well as work with agencies  through such vehicles as the CHCO Council, to identify any additional  practices to help agencies better address employee misconduct. Indeed,  the President\u2019s Management Agenda (PMA) for 2018 states, \u201cAligning  and managing the Federal workforce of the 21st Century means  spreading effective practices among human resources specialists.\u201d In  response to this recommendation, OPM noted that some of the key practices and lessons discussed in this report are already part of OPM\u2019s  comprehensive accountability toolkit in addressing employee misconduct  across the federal government and are frequently communicated through  on-going educational outreach to federal agencies and available on  OPM\u2019s website. Specifically, OPM said it will decide which appropriate  measures it should take to obtain examples of practices agencies believe  are promising and will broadly disseminate any of these practices and  lessons learned as identified by OPM. We acknowledge OPM\u2019s existing  efforts to develop and disseminate promising practices and lessons  learned, and also maintain that OPM should also be open to considering  additional practices from other sources.", "OPM also partially concurred with our third recommendation to provide  guidance to agencies to enhance the training received by  managers/supervisors and human capital staff to ensure that they have  the guidance and technical assistance they need to effectively address  misconduct and maximize the productivity of their workforces. In its  response, OPM said it will continue to play its statutory role under 5  U.S.C. Chapter 41 and will support agencies on a cross-agency priority  goal, which it believes could be read to encompass training, pursuant to  the PMA, for example by providing guidance to agencies on training  requirements for managers, supervisors and human resources staff.  However, OPM notes that it is not responsible under current statute for  providing training to the federal workforce. As stated in the report, while  agencies are accountable for providing required training for their  supervisors, OPM has a key role in ensuring the training meets the needs  of supervisors. Further, OPM\u2019s position on this recommendation seems  inconsistent with the Administration\u2019s own initiatives, including the May  2018 Executive Order which states that \u201cthe OPM Director and the Chief  Human Capital Officers Council shall undertake a Government-wide  initiative to educate Federal supervisors about holding employees  accountable for unacceptable performance or misconduct under those  rules,\u201d following any final rules issued pursuant to parameters set in the  Order. Indeed, the PMA states, \u201cIn order to best leverage the workforce to  achieve our mission efficiently and effectively, Government needs to  remove employees with the worst performance and conduct violations.\u201d  By taking steps to help agencies improve the training they provide  supervisors and managers on addressing misconduct, OPM could help  those managers ensure they have the knowledge and skills to effectively  deal with misconduct in the workplace.", "OPM also provided technical comments, which we have incorporated as  appropriate.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

We included those additional approaches to the  list. We interviewed human capital experts from academia, unions, and  former and current human resources practitioners. We also interviewed a  panel of CHCOs to gain insight into the agency perspective on  addressing employee misconduct. To identify CHCO members, we asked  the Director of the CHCO council to select CHCOs that have knowledge  and experience in addressing employee misconduct. Agency size and  mission were also considered as part of the selection process to gain a  range of perspectives. Our panel of CHCOs was from the Departments of  Commerce, Defense, and Housing and Urban Development, the National  Science Foundation, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
