Federal law requires that foster children have a case plan designed to achieve placement in the least restrictive (most family like) and most appropriate setting available, consistent with their needs. States' efforts to ensure appropriate placements included more oversight of decisions to place children in congregate care and the length of stay; enhanced recruiting and training for specialized foster families to care for children with serious emotional, behavioral, or medical problems; and increased supports for families in crisis. Officials in the eight states generally credited these efforts with declines in their use of congregate care\u2014on average a 47 percent decline from fiscal years 2004 through 2013, based on the most recent available data from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

However, states have  flexibility and discretion to make decisions for each child on a case-by- case basis to ensure that the most appropriate placement is made and  the individual needs of the child are met.", "HHS issued a report on congregate care in May 2015 that stated that in  addition to federal law, child development theory and best practices  confirm that children should be placed in family-like settings that are  developmentally appropriate and least restrictive. The report also stated  that congregate care stays should be based on the specialized behavioral  and mental health needs or clinical disabilities of children, and only for as  long as needed to stabilize them so they can return to a family-like  setting. Furthermore, the report noted that congregate care should not be  used as a default placement setting due to a lack of appropriate family- based care, but as part of a continuum of foster care settings. Young  children need family-like settings to form healthy attachments to adults,  and older children need family-like settings to allow them to develop  autonomy, according to research. This is also in keeping with changes  in the field of congregate care, which is increasing its focus on stays in a  residential center as treatment interventions to meet specific needs rather  than a placement of last resort for foster children.", "However, a recent HHS study using AFCARS data on states\u2019 use of  congregate care found that for all children who entered foster care for the  first time in 2008 (first-time entry cohort focusing on first episodes), an  estimated 38,205 of these children experienced congregate care at some  point during a 5-year follow-up period.", "Of these children, 31 percent were aged 12 or younger when they  experienced congregate care at some point during the 5-year follow- up.

Based on  our analysis, we categorized these efforts into three areas: expanding  services that may prevent entry into foster care, increasing availability of  family-based placements in foster care, and revising how congregate care  is used. These are discussed in more detail below.", "Expanding services to avoid the need to remove the child in the first  place and to support children in family-based settings. When sufficient  resources are available and circumstances warrant it, caseworkers  may decide to provide services for at-risk families in the home to help  stabilize the family rather than remove the child from the home, as we  found in our previous work. In addition, other resources can help  ease the transition from congregate care to a family-based setting,  whether in the foster care system or the home from which the child  was removed.  Increasing the availability of family-based placement options.  Increased efforts to find relatives who can care for children who are  removed from their homes can help children remain in family settings,  according to one child welfare official. In addition, caseworkers may  also recruit or train foster families to serve as treatment or therapeutic  foster families. These terms generally refer to a model of care that  attempts to provide elements of traditional foster care with clinical  treatment of a child\u2019s serious emotional, behavioral, and medical  problems in a specialized foster home. One state child welfare official  told us that in the past, children and youth with significant behavioral  or other problems were often placed in congregate care because  foster families or relatives with the requisite skills to help the child  were not always available, nor were adequate supports available in  the community.", "Revising how congregate care is used for foster children. When  congregate care is considered as a placement by a caseworker,  specific policies can affect the level at which the final decision is  made, what criteria are used, the duration of stay, and if a plan for  transitioning out of the congregate care setting is established. One  child welfare official told us her state agency\u2019s efforts were often  meant to ensure that all other placement options had been exhausted  before congregate care could be considered, that the length of stay in  congregate care was as short as possible, and that the child received  appropriate treatment while in care. In addition, one congregate care  provider noted that the provider had developed new service delivery  models, which in some cases included providing services when the  child returned to the home and community.", "See table 1 for examples of selected state efforts and examples as  described by state officials.", "The eight states used a combination of policies and practices noted  above in their efforts to reduce or limit the use of congregate care.

According to officials, intensive family searches to locate family members  to care for youth has been a successful effort used by caseworkers in the  state to help reduce congregate care. The state and local child welfare  officials and service providers we spoke with placed emphasis on  placements with available family members or foster homes, even for  youth with a high need for treatment or other services. One official noted  that the emphasis on family placements first has been a longstanding  policy preference in the state. In addition, about 15 years ago,  Washington changed its model of care for how services are delivered by  congregate care providers. Officials said that the state changed its  contract with providers from a structure with a set number of beds and  service levels to a contract for an array of services which could be  delivered in multiple settings, such as congregate care, treatment foster  homes, regular foster homes, and family or relative homes.", "Kansas had the second lowest percentage of foster children in  congregate care of the eight states we reviewed with 5 percent as of  September 30, 2013. Officials attributed a 31 percent decline in their  congregate care population over the 9 year period to several factors. In  1996, according to officials, the state began contracting with private non- profit organizations to provide family preservation, foster care and  adoption services. State officials told us that prior to establishing these  contracts, up to 40 percent of their foster children were in congregate  care settings. Officials also cited as contributing factors the method of  payment to contractors and holding foster care providers accountable for  meeting outcome goals established by the state to place children in a  family-like setting when possible or face monetary penalties.", "New Jersey began reforming its child welfare system about 10 years  ago, and according to state officials, it has resulted in reductions in the  state\u2019s overall foster care population and congregate care. Officials  explained that the state adopted a new family model of care that included  extensive recruitment of foster, adoption, and kinship caregivers\u2014 referred to as resource families\u2014that helped to reduce the overall foster  care population and congregate care placements.  In this model, these  resource families are provided with extensive training and a resource  worker is assigned to help provide services to the child in the home. One  official told us that this is a new paradigm of care that is very intensive.  They work with the family and bring in as many community resources as  possible to keep children in their homes, which has been effective in  reducing the number of children entering foster care overall.", "Louisiana officials told us that following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, state  officials worked with the Annie E. Casey Foundation to improve  performance in key areas in child welfare. Hurricane Katrina caused  widespread destruction and displacement of youth. Many of the state\u2019s  foster children were temporarily displaced and child welfare officials did  not have current emergency contact information, which made it difficult for  them to find the foster families that had to evacuate. According to officials,  over a 2-year period, they reduced the number of children in congregate  care settings by approximately 200 youth through various efforts,  including: (1) focused efforts on stepping down youth placed in residential  levels of care into less restrictive placements; (2) recruited foster/adoptive  homes that could accept placement of youth stepping down when relative  resources were not available and recruited homes that could provide  placement to children/youth entering care without relative resources; (3)  increased availability of in-home services so that youth were stepped  down, the services would be in place to assist in supporting the  placement. To support the foster home recruitment piece, dedicated  recruiters were hired and placed in all 9 regions of the state with the sole  task of recruiting homes. Another effort officials described during this time  was the revision of the licensing regulations for residential facilities and  child placing agencies.", "Maryland launched a statewide initiative in 2007 called \u201cPlace Matters\u201d  that greatly affected the state\u2019s child welfare system and improved  outcomes for all children in the state, including those in congregate care,  according to state officials. The goals of the \u201cPlace Matters\u201d initiative  include: (1) providing more in-home support to help maintain children with  their families; (2) placing children in family settings (either with relatives or  family-based care); and (3) reducing the length of stay in foster care and  increasing the number of reunified families. By 2014, Maryland officials  reported a reduction in the number of children in out-of-home care by  over 50 percent and a reduction of children placed in congregate care of  almost 60 percent. Maryland officials also described changes in the  placement and review process that they said have helped reduce the  number of children in congregate care. For example, a placement  protocol was instituted to ensure that family settings were ruled out before  children could be placed in congregate care settings. According to  officials, several layers of review have also been added to ensure that  more restrictive placements are warranted and necessary based on the  child\u2019s needs. Maryland also instituted a state-wide initiative that included  an extensive search for relatives of a foster child, according to officials.", "Minnesota continues to explore alternatives to group settings for children  in foster care needing specialized services, such as behavioral and  mental health needs that a foster family may not be capable of providing,  according to state officials. The state is currently in the process of  developing intensive treatment foster care services, as provided for under  a Minnesota statute enacted in 2013, according to officials. These include  intensive treatment services that will be provided within a foster family  setting to help reduce the need for congregate care placements. In  addition, in January 2015, the state implemented Northstar Care, a  program intended to help children who cannot return home to find other  permanent families. Officials expect that with the implementation of  Northstar Care and other services, like treatment foster care services, the  number of children in congregate care will continue to decline.", "Connecticut officials told us that the primary impetus for their focus on  reducing congregate care was a change in leadership that occurred in  2011. At that time, the newly appointed head of the state child welfare  agency set a goal of reducing the percentage of foster children in  congregate care from 23 percent to 10 percent. Connecticut officials  described going through the case files of all youth in foster care and  working, in consultation with the youth, to identify possible options for a  home for the youth that may include family members or close friends.  Through this process, Connecticut officials told us they were able to place  some children into a home and out of a congregate care setting.  According to officials, targeted family outreach and also engaging people  not related by birth or marriage who have an emotionally significant  relationship with a child has also resulted in a significant reduction in the  number of children coming into foster care in general. Officials believe  that this shift in attitude around connecting youth to their families and  communities is leading to better outcomes for youth. Other efforts  described by officials included increasing the availability of community- based supports across the state to help prevent children from coming into  care. Specifically, officials said the state modified its contracts with health  care providers to increase access to emergency psychiatric services for  anyone in the state, including those who are not currently in foster care.", "Colorado had one of the higher percentages of youth in congregate care  among our eight states, according to HHS data. The state is currently  working with Casey Family Programs and the Annie E. Casey  Foundation to improve placements for children in congregate care by  finding creative ways of placing children into family homes. Colorado  state officials described changes and new ways of working with the  congregate care provider community to develop models of care that are  more treatment-oriented to help children transition back into a community  settings. For example, state officials held two forums with providers in  their state to educate them on how to adjust their services and the service  delivery expectations as the state is shifting towards using providers more  for treatment than just a placement. State officials said they are also  working with the judicial system to identify alternative options, such as in- home services, because according to these officials some judges are  used to ordering that children be placed into a congregate care facility,  often as a consequence of behavioral issues."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Cited Challenges in Developing Alternatives to Congregate Care and HHS Has Begun Efforts to Help States", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Developing a Sufficient Supply of Appropriate Family Placements and Needed Services While Transitioning to a More Treatment\u2013Based Model of Congregate Care Poses Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders we interviewed described challenges involved as efforts  were made to reduce reliance on congregate care where appropriate, or  as one child welfare foundation says, to \u201cright-size\u201d states\u2019 use of  congregate care.

While developing alternative  family placements is a part of states\u2019 efforts to reduce congregate care,  stakeholders we spoke with said that doing so posed challenges. Several  stakeholders told us that too few foster families were available generally,  and that traditional foster families can be overwhelmed by the needs of  some foster children and youth, such as those with behavior problems.  Officials in one state also told us that building capacity in appropriate  family placements to replace congregate care placements requires  recruitment and training of specialized foster families and training to  change caseworker\u2019s existing practices. A few stakeholders also told us  that this can require additional resources or a redirection of existing  resources. In addition, because congregate care placements typically  cost more than traditional foster families, less use of congregate care  should free up state resources for developing more foster families with  the training and skills to support children and youth with greater needs,  according to an expert we spoke with.", "A few stakeholders we spoke with agreed that a shift away from  congregate care must be planned and implemented carefully to ensure  that children are placed with families adequately prepared to meet their  needs and to avoid unintended consequences. For example, if a child  with significant needs that require more attention is placed in a traditional  foster family without adequate supports, the result may be multiple  unsuccessful placements, inappropriate medications to manage a youth\u2019s  behavior, or entry into the juvenile justice system, according to some of  the officials we spoke with. One expert said that, based on her  observation, one state had rushed to reduce congregate care without first  putting sufficient supports in place for foster families, which resulted in  unintended consequences, such as unsuccessful placements.", "Addressing shortages of needed services. In addition, several  stakeholders noted the shortage of services that can help bolster  supports for at-risk children and families before the child or youth is  removed from home or during foster care to help avoid or reduce the  length of a congregate care stay. This is consistent with the findings from  our 2013 report in which we reported that local child welfare systems use  existing community resources, which are sometimes in short supply,  leading to gaps in areas such as substance abuse treatment, assistance  with material needs, and mental health services. One stakeholder noted  there is a lack of more holistic support systems in some communities,  including access to behavioral and mental health services; crisis support  24 hours a day, 7 days a week; housing; and education that would  facilitate more use of family settings rather than congregate care.  However, Title IV-E funds are generally not available for services for  children and families not in the foster care system.", "Improving assessments. Having accurate information on a child or youth\u2019s  physical and mental health needs is a factor in identifying what, if any,  treatments and services may be needed, and the eight states we  reviewed told us they had assessment processes in place. While we did  not review the types or quality of the assessment processes in these  states, two experts we spoke with raised concerns about the variation in  types and quality of assessments performed nationwide. This is due in  part to insufficient caseworker training and large workloads in states and  localities generally, as we have also found in our previous work.  More  specifically, one of these experts said that some child welfare  assessments may result in an incorrect diagnosis due to lack of  understanding of trauma-based conditions and treatments. In this  expert\u2019s opinion, children in congregate care were sometimes diagnosed  with other conditions, such as bi-polar disorder, and were overmedicated  to contain the issue rather than treat it. In our previous work, we have  found that foster children may receive psychotropic drugs at higher rates  than children not placed in foster care. We found in the five states  analyzed that the higher rates do not necessarily indicate inappropriate  prescribing practices, as they could be due to foster children\u2019s greater  exposure to traumatic experiences and the unique challenges of  coordinating their medical care. However, experts that we consulted  during that work explained that no evidence supports the concomitant use  of five or more psychotropic drugs in adults or children, yet hundreds of  both foster and non-foster children were prescribed such a medical  regimen.", "Retaining capacity for congregate care. State child welfare officials in all  of the eight states told us that even though they have worked to reduce  congregate care placements, they believed that they still require some  amount of congregate care for children and youth with specific treatment  needs and that retaining sufficient congregate care capacity may be  difficult. In Washington, with its already relatively low use of congregate  care, some officials were concerned about retaining enough congregate  care capacity to meet the needs of children and youth they thought would  require some time in a group setting. One stakeholder noted that  adjusting to an appropriate level of congregate care can be challenging,  as congregate care providers generally need to be assured of a sufficient  level of \u201cbeds filled\u2019 to continue their operations. He added that some  providers have long-standing relationships with a state or county and  have an interest in continuing their operations. This stakeholder said that  in his view the number of \u201cbeds\u201d or openings in a congregate care setting  may have factored into the determination of where a child or youth is  placed in some situations. In such cases, he noted, the supply of  available beds may have driven the placement rather than the needs of  the child.", "However, according to a few stakeholders, congregate care providers are  beginning to diversify their services, which could include providing care in  a group setting as well as supports and services in a family setting. Two  congregate care providers told us that their business model had changed  in recent years, from predominantly caring for children residing in their  facilities to providing services to children in their foster or original homes,  and also planning for service provision when a child or youth left  congregate care. A few stakeholders we spoke with confirmed that  providers are re-evaluating their relationships with the states as states are  moving toward offering a continuum of services to help youth stay out of  or transition out of congregate care as quickly as possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Has Recently Taken Steps to Encourage States to Examine Their Use of Congregate Care, but Could Enhance Its Support to States", "paragraphs": ["HHS\u2019s Administration for Children and Families (ACF) recently took steps  to examine how states were using congregate care and as previously  mentioned issued a report in May 2015 to help inform states and  policymakers about the use of congregate care for foster children. HHS  officials told us that the report was their initial effort to understand  congregate care as a placement option for foster children because the  agency had not taken a national look at congregate care previously. In  the report, HHS raised concerns about some of its findings\u2014which we  discussed earlier\u2014about the use of congregate care for children aged 12  or younger and for placements for youth who do not appear to have high  clinical needs that might be better served in appropriate family settings. In  addition, while the report cited that the decline in the percentage of  children placed in congregate care nationwide suggested that child  welfare practice is moving toward more limited use of congregate care, it  also noted that the depth of improvement is not consistent across states.", "In addition to its findings in the report, HHS included a legislative proposal  in its fiscal year 2016 budget request to increase monitoring of  congregate care use and support family-based care as an alternative to  congregate care. More specifically, the proposal would, among other  things, amend Title IV-E to require (1) documentation to justify the use of  congregate care as the least restrictive setting to meet a child\u2019s needs,  and (2) judicial review every 6 months while a child is in that placement to  confirm that the placement remains the best option. It also would provide  support for a specialized case management approach for caseworkers  with reduced caseloads and specialized training for caseworkers and  foster parents to address the needs of children. HHS estimated that these  changes would increase costs in the first few years of the proposal going  into effect, and that overall it would result in a reduction in costs of Title  IV-E foster care maintenance payments. More specifically, HHS  estimated that this proposal would increase fiscal year 2016 funding by  $78 million and reduce foster care maintenance costs by $69 million over  10 years.", "Based on our discussions with stakeholders, we identified other areas in  which state efforts could benefit from additional HHS support,  independent of the legislative proposal. One stakeholder noted that the  information HHS currently collects does not focus on congregate care,  and there is a wide variation in state experiences, which our review of  AFCARS data and HHS\u2019s own May 2015 report confirm. However,  without more information on states\u2019 efforts to reduce their use of  congregate care, HHS is unable to fully understand states\u2019 activities in  this area, including relevant changes in the states\u2019 use of congregate care  and their effect on state child welfare systems. Although HHS conducted  some initial research in its May 2015 report, HHS has the opportunity to  further enhance its understanding of state efforts, for example, by  leveraging its CFSR process, its AFCARS database, and future research  activities. Internal control standards for the federal government call for  agencies to have the information needed to understand program  performance.", "Similarly, stakeholders noted that given the relative recency of some of  the state efforts and the potential for unintended consequences, HHS\u2019s  support in sharing best practices and providing technical assistance  would be helpful to the states as they make changes to their systems. For  example, consistent with the challenges we identified, states could benefit  from HHS\u2019s assistance in the areas of increasing capacity for specialized  foster family placements and working with congregate care providers to  diversify their services. As an HHS study has noted, system changes in  the child welfare area can be difficult, and require leadership, stakeholder  involvement, and capacity building, among other things, as well as time  and sustained attention to succeed. In addition, our previous work has  identified similar key practices that facilitate successful transformations,  including leadership from the top, focus on and communication of key  priorities, and monitoring progress, particularly because transformations  may take a long time to complete.", "HHS officials told us they did not currently have plans to provide  additional support for states related to congregate care, although with a  new Associate Commissioner of Children, Youth, and Families in place as  of August 2015, they may consider additional actions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["States\u2019 foster care systems are responsible for some of the most  vulnerable children in the nation. This includes responsibility for placing  children removed from their homes in the most family-like settings that  meet their needs. The eight states we reviewed reflect the downward  trend in the use of congregate care nationwide, which could be seen as a  sign of progress in states\u2019 \u201cright-sizing\u201d of congregate care. At the same  time, the wide variation in the percentage of foster children in congregate  care among our eight\u2014and all 50\u2014states suggests that more progress  could be made. HHS has taken an important first step by issuing its report  on congregate care and recognizing that additional information is needed  on how states use congregate care and what changes are appropriate. It  is important that HHS continues to progress in its understanding of the  national landscape of congregate care so that it can be better positioned  to support states through their transitions. Significant changes in child  welfare programs require thoughtful leadership, relevant information, and  sustained attention. HHS\u2019s continued leadership and support will be  needed, particularly by states facing challenges in developing alternatives  to congregate care, to make progress nationwide."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that HHS take steps to enhance its support of state  actions to reduce the use of congregate care as appropriate.

HHS stated that federal  law and policy make it clear that children who come into care should be  placed in the least restrictive setting possible. However, it noted that  states have the flexibility and discretion to make decisions for a child on a  case by case basis to ensure that the best placement is made and the  individual needs of the child are met.  HHS also noted that to assist states  in reducing their use of congregate care, the fiscal year 2016 President\u2019s  budget request includes a proposal to amend title IV-E to provide support  and funding to promote family based care for children with behavioral and  mental health needs as well as provide oversight of congregate care  placements, as we noted in the report.  Additionally, HHS stated that it  offers individualized technical assistance to help child welfare agencies  build capacity and improve outcomes for children and families, and it has  recently begun providing tailored services to two public child welfare  agencies working to reduce their use of congregate care through a Title  IV-E waiver demonstration program. HHS also stated it will continue to  explore research opportunities as well as how to build state capacity for  family placements.
