This, in turn, could impact the availability of 911 services.", "GAO was asked to review federal coordination with state and local governments regarding cybersecurity at public safety entities. The objective was to determine the extent to which federal agencies coordinated with state and local governments regarding cybersecurity efforts at emergency operations centers, public safety answering points, and first responder organizations involved in handling 911 emergency calls. To do so, GAO analyzed relevant plans and reports and interviewed officials at (1) five agencies that were identified based on their roles and responsibilities established in federal law, policy, and plans and (2) selected industry associations and state and local governments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The five identified federal agencies (Departments of Homeland Security, Commerce, Justice, and Transportation and Federal Communications Commission (FCC)) have to varying degrees, coordinated cybersecurity-related activities with state and local governments. These activities included (1) supporting critical infrastructure protection-related planning, (2) issuing grants, (3) sharing information, (4) providing technical assistance, and (5) regulating and overseeing essential functions. However, except for supporting critical infrastructure planning, federal coordination of these activities was generally not targeted towards or focused on the cybersecurity of state and local public safety entities involved in handling 911 emergency calls.", "Under the critical infrastructure protection planning activity, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) coordinated with state and local governments and other federal stakeholders to complete the Emergency Services Sector-Specific Plan. The plan is to guide the sector, including the public safety entities, in setting protective program goals and objectives, identifying assets, assessing risks, prioritizing infrastructure components and programs to enhance risk mitigation, implementing protective programs, measuring program effectiveness, and incorporating research and development of technology initiatives into sector planning efforts. It also addressed aspects of cybersecurity of the current environment. However, the plan did not address the development and implementation of more interconnected, Internet-based planned information technologies, such as the next generation of 911 services. According to DHS officials, the plan did not address these technologies, in part, because the process for updating the sector-specific plan will begin after the release of the revised National Infrastructure Protection Plan--a unifying framework to enhance the safety of the nation's critical infrastructure. A revised plan was released in December 2013, and, according to DHS, a new sector-specific plan is estimated to be completed in December 2014. Until DHS, in collaboration with stakeholders, addresses the cybersecurity implications of the emerging technologies in planning activities, information systems are at an increased risk of failure or being unavailable at critical moments.", "Under the other four activities, federal agencies performed some coordination related activities for public safety entities including administering grants for information technology enhancements, sharing information about cyber-based attacks, and providing technical assistance through education and awareness efforts. For example, the Departments of Transportation and Commerce allocated $43.5 million in grants to states over a 3-year period, starting in September 2009, to help implement enhancements to 911 system functionality. While these grants were not targeted towards the cybersecurity of these systems, cybersecurity was not precluded from the allowed use of the funds."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of Homeland Security collaborate with emergency services sector stakeholders to address the cybersecurity implications of implementing technology initiatives in related plans.

To provide these emergency services, public safety entities  use information technology that includes databases with geographic,  phone number, and location data. These technologies increasingly rely  on the Internet, which makes them susceptible to cyber-based threats  that could impact the availability of 911 services. Since 2003, we have  identified the protection of systems supporting our nation\u2019s critical  infrastructure (which includes the emergency services sector) as a  governmentwide high-risk area, and we continued to do so in the most  recent update to our high-risk list.", "At your request, we reviewed federal coordination with state and local  governments regarding cybersecurity at public safety entities.

Using a landline, wireless, mobile telephone, or voice over internet  protocol (VoIP) system, a caller dials 911 and the call is routed to a  communications provider facility that automatically forwards the call to a  public safety entity such as a PSAP. Next, the call taker/dispatcher talks  to the caller to determine the nature of the emergency and to determine  the necessary first responders, while working to send (or dispatch) the  appropriate first responders to the location. According to the National  Emergency Number Association, there are more than 6,000 PSAPs  nationwide, at a county or city level, that answer more than 240 million  911 calls each year. Figure 1 illustrates the public safety communications  and dispatch system, including how an emergency call is typically placed,  received, and processed.", "As illustrated in figure 1, once a 911 caller places an emergency call, the  communications provider receives and routes the call to the appropriate  PSAP. The system used to route the call depends on the type of  telephone used to make the 911 call. Specifically, for a call placed from a  landline, a router in the provider\u2019s central facility receives the 911 call and  accesses the Automatic Number Identification database to associate the  identifier with the phone number to determine the caller\u2019s address. Then,  based on the location information, the provider\u2019s Master Street Address  Guide database identifies the appropriate PSAP to receive the call. When  a cell phone is used, the location information is typically provided to the  PSAP through either cell tower triangulation technology or by Global  Positioning System technology. When using VoIP, where calls are carried  over digital subscriber lines, cable modems, or other Internet access  methods, the caller needs to register the address of the VoIP device in  advance. Current telecommunications and PSAP technology associate  the voice and data transmission with the identifier and location databases  and, based on the caller\u2019s location, routes the call to the appropriate  PSAP.", "When the caller\u2019s phone number, address, and voice are routed to the  appropriate PSAP, the call is automatically delivered with the phone  number and location. The trained 911 call taker/dispatcher assists the  caller and inputs information into additional IT systems and infrastructure  to begin the emergency response. For example, the call taker/dispatcher  may enter information into a computer-aided dispatch system. These  systems automate the call-taking process, provide questions and  responses for various scenarios, and send the first responders. Based on  the information put into the system by the call taker/dispatcher, the  computer-aided dispatch system interfaces with other systems for  identification and address, ascertains the nature of the assistance  needed, and transmits the information to the appropriate first responder.  To provide assistance to the first responder, the call taker/dispatcher may  also be able to use geospatial tools and systems that provide information  on utility placement, government facility types and locations, property  plats, mapping data, and aerial photographs. In addition, call takers may  use criminal justice information databases, Internet access, automated  vehicle locators to select the closest first responder, and radio and  telecommunications services to share and receive information as the  situation warrants.", "While a PSAP is to be available on a 24-hours, 365 day-a-year basis, an  emergency operations center, as noted, is typically only activated during  an environmental emergency or special event. It provides a single  location for key decision makers from state, local, and federal agencies  and multiple jurisdictions to gather and to react to events too complex or  too large for regular offices or communications centers or single  government agencies or jurisdictions to handle. From a single location,  the officials can support on-scene incident commanders (such as fire,  police, and emergency medical personnel), prioritize the allocation of  resources, collaborate on strategy and tactics, and manage the fiscal and  social consequences of an incident.", "Emergency operations centers require the same variety of information  and communications technology used by PSAPs to fulfill their mission:  Internet access, telecommunications services, geospatial tools, and radio  systems. In addition, these centers have access to and use public alerting  and warning systems to disperse information to citizens, such as sending  messages to registered devices (mobile telephones, pagers, electronic  mail, etc.), sirens, public address systems, and, in some cases, reverse  911 or similar products that can send warnings to entire communities  when the need arises."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Next Generation of Public Safety Communications Will Be Even More Reliant on IT", "paragraphs": ["Public safety entities are undergoing the process of implementing the  next generation of 911 services (known as NG 911) to, among other  things, improve their capabilities to communicate with callers, increase  resiliency of their 911 operations, and enhance information sharing  among first responders. NG 911 is expected to use Internet protocol- based, broadband technology that is capable of carrying voice plus large  amounts of varying types of data, such as instant messaging, wireline  calls, VoIP calls, photographs, live video feeds from an emergency scene,  and \u201ctelematics\u201d (such as advanced automatic crash notification data  collected from the vehicle\u2019s computer system). Some states have  implemented NG 911 functionality in selected PSAPs in order to ascertain  technology requirements and cybersecurity implications with the intention  of using multiple releases to eventually move to full NG 911 capability.  For example, in 2011, California began conducting multiple pilots to  evaluate different technology platforms for its NG 911 operations such as  hosted or cloud-based technology. In 2012, Vermont completed a 6- month pilot accepting text messages in lieu of voice 911 calls from a  wireless carrier. Vermont has also implemented a statewide 911 system  that transmits 911 calls to PSAPs using VoIP for its emergency services  network.", "In addition, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012  required the National Telecommunications and Information Administration  (NTIA) and Transportation\u2019s National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration to create a program to improve emergency  communications throughout the country by facilitating coordination and  communication among federal, state, and local emergency  communications systems, emergency personnel, public safety  organizations, telecommunications providers, and telecommunications  equipment manufacturers and vendors involved in the implementation of  911 services. The act established FirstNet as an independent authority  within the NTIA to develop a single nationwide, interoperable public safety  broadband network. The FirstNet network is intended to give users  functionality beyond current radio communications such as access to  video images of a crime in progress, downloaded floor plans of a burning  building, and rapid connection with first responders from other  communities. The network is expected to be IP-based and interface with  commercial networks to transmit voice, text, photographic, video, and  other digital data between PSAPs and first responders using  interoperable mobile devices and leveraging NG 911 technology.", "As of October 2013, the FirstNet network requirements had not been  developed; however, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of  2012 required functionality to include public Internet connectivity over  commercial wireless networks or the public switched telephone network.

Table 2  describes the types of exploits in more detail.", "In addition to cyber-based threats, the nation\u2019s public safety entities also  face threats from physical sources. Examples of these threats include  natural events (e.g., hurricanes or flooding) and man-made disasters  (e.g., terrorist attacks), as well as unintentional man-made outages (e.g.,  a backhoe cutting a communication line). For example, after a major  storm in June 2012, several cities and counties in Virginia experienced a  total outage of telephone service supporting 911 that continued for 5  days. The loss of commercial power and the subsequent failure of one of  the two backup generators in the common carrier\u2019s facilities were the  predominant causes of the service outage. In addition, the lack of  physical diversity in the telephone circuits supporting 911 and the failure  to monitor the telephone circuits contributed to the disruption of PSAP  operations during the outage.", "While not related to public safety entities\u2019 internal IT, these organizations,  specifically PSAPs, have been the target of attacks and pranks. For  example, in March 2013, the National Emergency Number Association  reported that more than 200 telephony-based attacks had been  identified. The attacks were part of an extortion scheme demanding  payment for an outstanding debt to be paid to an individual or  organization. When the request was not paid, the perpetrator launched an  attack that inundated the PSAP\u2019s administrative, nonemergency lines with  a continuous stream of calls for a lengthy period of time.", "In addition, PSAPs have received false emergency calls from pranksters  who use Internet protocol-based telephone technology to camouflage the  source of the call. In these cases, a caller reported a serious incident in  progress, such as an armed robbery or a home invasion, and a false  address or location information make it appear that the call is coming  from a different address. For example, in April 2013, news media reported  that multiple celebrities\u2019 homes were swarmed by police after fake 911  calls were made reporting a crime in progress involving people armed  with guns or bombs.
