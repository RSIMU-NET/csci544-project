State devoted about $255 million to personnel training in fiscal year 2010; the department's Foreign Service Institute (FSI) is the primary training provider for State's more than 66,000 Foreign Service, civil service, and locally employed staff (LE staff) worldwide. GAO was asked to examine (1) State's purpose and structure for training personnel and (2) the extent to which State's training incorporates elements for effective training programs. GAO reviewed and analyzed data and documentation related to the agency's training efforts; completed a training assessment using a tool developed based on prior GAO guidance; and interviewed officials in Washington, D.C., and at 12 overseas posts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["State's purpose for training personnel is to develop the men and women the United States requires to fulfill its leadership role in world affairs and to advance and defend U.S. interests. State guidance outlines key training roles, including FSI's primary role in developing training policies and facilitating necessary training, and the Bureau of Human Resources' role in assigning employees to training and working with FSI to help ensure it meets their needs. Other bureaus, offices, and posts also share responsibilities for training. FSI currently offers more than 700 classroom courses, and has recently increased its focus on distance learning. Overall, about 40 percent of personnel training over the last 5 fiscal years, on average, was in foreign language skills. Other training for personnel generally focused on developing leadership, management, and other professional and technical skills and knowledge. State has taken many steps to incorporate the interrelated elements of an effective training program--planning, design, implementation, and evaluation--into its extensive training for personnel; however, the department's strategic approach to workforce training has several key weaknesses. The department demonstrated a variety of ways in which it has endeavored to develop an effective training program, such as by compiling an annual training plan, and implementing a range of training evaluation mechanisms and a learning management system that can be used to track training delivery. However, GAO's analysis found several gaps in the department's efforts to strategically plan and prioritize training, ensure efficient and effective training design and delivery, and determine whether or how training and development efforts contribute to improved performance and desired results. For example: (1) State lacks a systematic, comprehensive training needs assessment process incorporating all bureaus and overseas posts. (2) State developed training continuums to provide information for employees about training opportunities, career paths, and how training can help employees attain career goals, but the continuums do not provide complete and accurate information, and other guidance does not cover all personnel. (3) State lacks formal guidance for curriculum design and for data collection and analysis, and thus cannot be assured that proper practices and procedures are systematically and comprehensively applied. (4) State could not sufficiently demonstrate consistent and appropriate support for training, because the department does not track detailed information on training cost and delivery that would allow for an analysis and comparison of employees in different groups, bureaus, regions, or posts. (5) State's performance measures for training generally do not fully address training goals, and are generally output- rather than outcome-oriented."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making several recommendations for State to improve strategic planning and evaluation of the department's efforts to train personnel, including for improvements to State's efforts to assess training needs and efforts to ensure training achieves desired results.

Akaka  United States Senate  As the lead department for U.S. foreign affairs, the Department of State  (State) plays the primary role in developing and implementing U.S. foreign  policy. In support of that role, State\u2019s personnel require certain knowledge,  skills, and abilities to equip them to address the complex security threats  and challenges of global interdependence that accompany 21st century  diplomacy. Recent departmental initiatives\u2014in particular, \u201cDiplomacy  3.0,\u201d a multiyear effort launched in March 2009 with a primary aim of  increasing the size of State\u2019s Foreign Service by 25 percent and the civil  service by 13 percent\u2014have underscored the importance of training to  equip personnel to fulfill State\u2019s leadership role in world affairs and to  advance and defend U.S. interests abroad. Nongovernmental organizations  such as the American Academy of Diplomacy have confirmed that  challenges facing the United States\u2014including the threat of Al-Qaeda and  other terrorist organizations, HIV/AIDS and other pandemics,  environmental degradation, nuclear proliferation, and failed states\u2014 require a significantly more robust foreign affairs capacity featuring skilled  professionals. In fiscal years 2006 through 2010, State\u2019s funding for training  personnel grew by about 62 percent, and the department requested more  than $266 million in fiscal year 2011 for programs providing training in  professional skills such as foreign language proficiency, area studies,  information technology, consular duties, and others needed for the  conduct of foreign relations.

While the results of this survey are not generalizeable, they provided  valuable insights into potential areas for improvement. We interviewed  key officials from nongovernmental organizations including the Center for  Strategic and International Studies and the Stimson Center, as well as from  26 State bureaus and offices in Washington, D.C., including FSI, the  Bureau of Human Resources, and the six geographic bureaus. We  conducted semistructured telephone interviews with State officials with  training-related responsibilities at 12 overseas missions. We selected a  nongeneralizeable sample of countries designed to ensure geographic  diversity; our criteria for selection also included factors such as the size of  the post and hardship differential. We also interviewed officials from  State\u2019s regional training centers located in Bangkok, Thailand; Ft.  Lauderdale, Florida; and Frankfurt, Germany.

According to State, in demonstration of its commitment to training, the  department dedicates almost 1.5 percent\u2014approximately $214 million in  fiscal year 2010\u2014of its program budget to personnel training. State\u2019s  Foreign Affairs Manual and Foreign Affairs Handbooks include  information on the department\u2019s legislative authorities and policies that  may relate to, or require training and development for, Foreign Service,  civil service, and LE staff. In addition, FSI publishes an annual schedule of  courses, which provides information for employees on the more than 700  classroom courses FSI offers, as well as approximately 190 custom- developed distance learning courses.", "Design. FSI highlighted its involvement of curricula and education experts  as well as subject matter or technical experts in the development of  courses as a positive practice. FSI officials stated all courses are designed  to meet specific learning objectives. The schedule of courses generally  includes information for each course such as a brief description, any  prerequisites, course objectives, and relevant competencies and  precepts. State has also designed programs that incorporate various  cross-training opportunities and targeted experiences. For example,  Foreign Service and civil service personnel may participate in rota assignments, congressional fellowships, OPM leadership seminars, or  programs through the National Defense University, among other  opportunities; and LE staff may participate in short-term details to other posts, or opportunities to \u201cshadow\u201d a more experienced employee,  according to State officials. Additionally, State has made an effort to  design and develop courses that use advances in technologies to enha nce  its training efforts, another example of a positive practice. The number of  distance learning offerings, as well as employee participation in distance learning, has increased in recent years. For example, State\u2019s latest annual  training plan reported that FSI developed 20 new custom distance learnin courses during the prior year. opportunities at some overseas posts, which may include group  instruction via videoconference alo FSI has also piloted \u201cblended\u201d learnin ng with online course content.", "In addition, during fiscal years 2006 through 2009, the total number of hours that  personnel spent completing distance learning courses more than doubled\u2014from about  113,000 hours in fiscal year 2006 to about 254,000 in fiscal year 2009. Data include hours  spent completing all distance learning course offerings, including custom-developed  courses, by Foreign Service, civil service, and LE staff over the time period. well as to encourage employees to accept the goals of training efforts and  apply knowledge gained through training on the job. For example, FSI has  an attendance policy requiring students to participate in 80 to 100 percent  of a classroom course\u2014depending upon duration and subject matter\u2014and  pass any applicable testing requirement in order to receive official course  credit. The employee\u2019s home bureau must generally reimburse FSI in the  event that an employee does not show up or complete a course. In  addition, FSI generally reviews and approves all applications for external  training. Employees generally must sign an agreement to reimburse State  if they do not complete an external training course they registered for, and  employees must complete a post-training evaluation for any external  training. Several posts we interviewed noted they have training  agreements in place for training provided to LE staff, which may require  personnel to submit a report to supervisors on the outcome of training or  reimburse State for costs such as travel in the event they do not  successfully complete a training course.", "Evaluation. State has a range of training evaluation mechanisms in place,  including mid- and post-training course evaluations, some incorporating  supervisors as well as employees. Efforts to evaluate training in order to  assess the extent to which it contributes to improved results is considered  an essential component of an effective training program. The department  also has a learning management system that can track delivery of training.  For example, as noted previously, State provided data to us on training  hours and courses completed by Foreign Service, civil service, and LE  staff over the past 5 fiscal years, including data on language and non- language classroom and distance learning, as well as external training.  Additionally, since 2006 FSI has conducted an annual training survey; for  example, FSI reported most respondents to the 2010 survey were, in  general, satisfied or very satisfied with training. Further, to comply with  an OPM mandate, according to State, in 2007 the department conducted  the biennial Quality of Work Life Survey, which addresses human capital  issues and trends. State reported that the 2007 survey found a majority of  respondents agreed with the statement, \u201cI receive adequate training to do  my job.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weaknesses Exist in State\u2019s Strategic Approach to Personnel Training", "paragraphs": ["Although State\u2019s training practices and procedures reflect numerous  attributes and indicators of an effective training program, we found gaps  in six key areas (see table 4). Each of these issue areas broadly relates to  multiple elements, attributes, and indicators throughout the interrelated  training and development process. While an agency\u2019s training program is  not necessarily expected to address every indicator identified in the GAO  guidance, based on our assessment, we identified strategic weaknesses  related to these six issue areas as particularly important to ensuring  effective planning, design, implementation, and evaluation of personnel  training.", "Although State has several practices in place to identify training needs, the  department lacks a systematic, comprehensive training needs assessment  process clearly incorporating all bureaus and posts, particularly at the  occupational and individual levels. Our previous work identifying elements  of effective training states that an agency can use organizational,  occupational, and individual training needs assessments to help ensure  training is connected to improving individual and agency performance in  achieving results. OPM guidance refers to this as a multilevel training  needs assessment process and states that to be successful, an assessment  process should be ongoing, involve management at all levels, and be  integrated into the agency\u2019s program planning and budgeting process.  Further, under Executive Order, agencies are to review, not less than  annually, programs to identify training needs, establish priorities for  training, and provide resources in accordance with those priorities. In  addition, State\u2019s Foreign Affairs Manual states that bureau executive  directors are responsible for identifying bureau training needs. State  guidance also notes that not conducting training needs assessments may  cause time and resources to be wasted in developing and teaching skills  that employees do not need, while true training needs and barriers may go  unaddressed.", "We found that State has some processes in place to identify broad or  cross-cutting training needs at the organizational level. For example, FSI  officials told us the institute identifies training needs and strategy in part  through FSI officials\u2019 participation in various departmental committees or  working groups that may address training issues or discuss training needs.  They noted that FSI\u2019s Director, who acts as the Chief Training Officer for  the department, attends the Secretary\u2019s weekly staff meetings and holds  monthly meetings with the Director General of the Foreign Service and  Director of Human Resources. The Deputy Director participates in  periodic meetings with the Bureau of Human Resources Office of Career  Development and Assignments. FSI officials added they were holding  weekly meetings with officials from the bureau on how to address training  needs related to the recent increase in hiring. Further, they said the Dean  of the School of Applied Information Technology participates in periodic  meetings with State\u2019s Chief Information Officer to stay abreast of  information technology training needs. According to State\u2019s Bureau of  Human Resources, State aims to identify training needs related in  particular to the department\u2019s foreign policy mission and emerging issues.", "However, State\u2019s processes for identifying both organizational, cross- cutting, and more specific occupational training needs do not clearly  incorporate all bureaus and posts. For example, officials from a number of  bureaus told us that their bureaus had not conducted formal training  needs assessments. Only one bureau indicated it had recently conducted  an assessment relevant to training needs. To help identify cross-cutting as  well as more specific occupational training needs, FSI officials said the  institute holds quarterly meetings with bureau training officers, providing  opportunities to discuss any bureau training needs and to share  information, for example, about upcoming course offerings. However,  several bureau training officials we met with noted that a bureau with a  specific training need would generally reach out to FSI on a case-by-case  or ad hoc basis. They said that FSI is generally responsive to ad hoc  requests regarding specific training needs, but discussions at the quarterly  meetings typically address topics such as training-related administrative  processes, rather than addressing bureau training needs.", "State\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) previously recommended that  State conduct annual training needs assessments and implement a more  comprehensive and systematic planning process for training incorporating  all bureaus and posts, such as by requiring a training section in the  department\u2019s annual bureau and mission strategic plans, to help identify  and address long-term training needs across locations and all categories of  employees in the department. To address prior OIG findings, State  reported that the department had added a training \u201cannex\u201d to all bureau  and mission plans. However, State officials indicated the plans no longer  include a training annex, owing to the department\u2019s decision to streamline  the strategic planning process in order to make it less burdensome for  bureaus and posts. As a result, officials noted some bureau and mission  plans include information on training goals, needs, or priorities, while  others include no reference to training. None of the 12 posts we  interviewed reported receiving guidance from headquarters that could  help the post prioritize, plan, and budget for training. Some bureau and  post officials stated they could benefit from additional guidance, and  indicated that a more systematic training planning process across bureaus  and posts could be helpful. However, several officials noted that such a  process could become a \u201cpaperwork exercise\u201d unless there were also a  commitment to follow-through with implementation.", "In addition, relevant to occupational training needs, the Foreign Affairs  Manual states that training officers in each bureau are responsible for  developing a bureau career guide outlining profiles of major occupations  in the bureau including descriptions of the knowledge, skills, and abilities  needed for each occupation and grade. However, most of the bureaus we  met with had not developed a bureau career guide. Officials indicated  they would generally rely instead on broader departmental guidance to  help identify relevant training. For example, State guidance states that civil  service employees must demonstrate competencies established by OPM.  In addition, State has broadly identified \u201ccore precepts\u201d for Foreign  Service entry-, mid-, and senior-level employees, which are updated  periodically. Technical competencies have also been identified for certain  groups of employees, such as administrative or post management officers.  Officials indicated that more specific roles and responsibilities, as well as  any skills or abilities\u2014though not necessarily training\u2014required for  different Foreign Service, civil service, and LE staff positions, are  generally identified in job announcements. They noted they also rely on  FSI guidance on training for employees in different career paths.", "Also, to help identify individual training needs, bureau and post officials  noted that Foreign Service employees generally rely on career  development officers, in addition to supervisors at post, to provide  guidance and counseling on training and development, including  identifying necessary training. However, some post officials noted this  support may vary. A number of Foreign Service employees responding to  the open-ended question on training in the 2009 American Foreign Service  Association survey also cited concerns about career development officer  support. For example, some said their career development officers  generally had too many people assigned to them and were ineffective at  disseminating relevant information; were not responsive to e-mails or  phone calls; and were more focused on filling positions than on supporting  Foreign Service Officers\u2019 career development. According to State\u2019s Bureau  of Human Resources, as of October 2010, State had 41 career development  officers (CDO), each supporting at least 250 Foreign Service generalists  and specialists. They noted that serving specialists and mid-level  generalists in particular, some CDOs support as many as 450 employees.  The bureau also has two dedicated staff\u2014an assignments officer and a  training officer\u2014who help ensure that entry-level personnel are enrolled  in required training. Human resources officials said that recent increases  in State personnel had presented challenges to the provision of career  development counseling, and that, although State had created new entry- level CDO positions as a result, the need for additional mid-level CDOs  was under review. They added that they have also been working to  streamline administrative and technical processes to allow officers to  spend more of their time providing individual guidance and counseling on  training.", "Further, although State encourages all employees to complete an  individual development plan (IDP), which can be a component of an  individual training needs assessment process, bureau and post officials  indicated that few Foreign Service or civil service employees have  completed an IDP. As a result, it is not clear whether Foreign Service and  civil service employees have adequate opportunity to discuss with their  supervisors any training they may need to improve individual performance  or prepare for future assignments. We previously reported that the use of  IDPs to identify both short- and long-term developmental needs of each  employee can help an agency incorporate employees\u2019 developmental  goals, and integrate the need for continuous and career-long learning, into  its planning processes. State requires only certain entry-level civil service  employees to complete an IDP. Some bureau officials stated they thought  the IDP should be a broader requirement. Officials from several of the  bureaus we met with noted that while the IDP is encouraged, it is not  widely used by domestic bureau personnel, although training needs may  be identified for civil service personnel as part of the annual performance  appraisal process. Bureau and post officials indicated that, although  training needs could be covered as part of the Foreign Service appraisal  process, in contrast to the civil service appraisal, the Foreign Service  appraisal form does not explicitly address training, and officials generally  have not seen it in the appraisals.", "Post officials from 11 of the 12 posts we interviewed said their posts use a  work development plan (WDP), similar to an IDP, for LE staff. Officials  noted that posts are generally responsible for coordinating and overseeing  LE staff training. Some of these posts said it is a general practice or  requirement for supervisors to work with LE staff at post to complete a  WDP, including identifying any training needs, as part of the annual  appraisal process. Post officials noted that they may review the employee  development plans or solicit broader input from supervisors or other  relevant personnel at the post, to help identify and prioritize training as  part of the post\u2019s annual budget and planning process. For example,  officials at one post noted they annually solicit training needs from all  sections at the post for the upcoming year and review the WDPs to  compile a prioritized list of training. However, the senior human resources  officer we spoke with at another post said that she primarily identifies  training needs and puts together an annual budget request for training  based on her own observations and oral discussions with relevant  personnel at the post. She noted that although she had attempted to solicit  broader, formal input from personnel at post on individual training needs,  she had received minimal response. She added that she will review WDPs  to help identify individual training needs, but because the WDP is not a  requirement at post she must rely largely on her own observations and  oral discussions with supervisors of LE staff.", "While State does not have a systematic, comprehensive training needs  assessment process, training officials we interviewed from several bureaus  and posts cited various areas of potential training need for Foreign  Service, civil service, and LE staff. For example, some bureau officials  cited a greater general need for training personnel in areas such as project  management, strategic planning, human resources, and budgeting, as well  as in English and computer skills for LE staff in particular. Post officials  also cited a general need for additional training in areas such as project  and contract management and for strategic planning, public-private  partnerships, NGO engagement, and enhanced coverage of certain  countries in geographic area studies, among other areas. Further, a  number of Foreign Service employees responding to the open-ended  question on training in the 2009 American Foreign Service Association  annual survey cited a range of potential training needs. For example,  respondents cited needs for additional training for generalists relevant to  their particular areas of work; additional training for specialists, including  for Office Management Specialists; additional and enhanced leadership  training; and improved and expanded language training, including  expansion of language training overseas. Respondents also cited the need  for a greater focus on training through their careers, such as by  establishing and enforcing minimum requirements at various career stages  beyond the current mandatory requirements. State officials noted that  State has increased attention to LE staff training and development in  recent years, although some officials noted in the past, LE staff often  received little or no training despite significant need for training at some  posts. Because Foreign Service employees generally rotate to a new post  every 2 years, LE staff often provide the longevity, continued presence,  and support that are critical to the successful day-to-day operations of  overseas missions. In June 2009, FSI conducted a survey of post  management to identify LE staff training needs. Several bureau and post  officials told us they considered the results of the survey in planning LE  staff training. For example, officials representing the Bureaus of Near  Eastern Affairs and South and Central Asian Affairs said that as a result of  the survey, they identified a particular need for supervisory skills training  for LE staff working at certain posts in those regions, and offered two  relevant workshops in the region in fiscal year 2010. FSI officials noted  that as a result of the 2009 survey, they have been working to increase  training offerings at posts by expanding the number and reach of adjunct  faculty. They added that FSI plans to repeat the needs assessment  periodically, though they have not set any specific time frames as of  November 2010.", "Since 2007, State human resource reports also noted that bureaus have not  formally conducted annual training needs assessments, and identified this  as an issue that should be addressed to help provide a realistic basis for  planning, budgeting, and directing training. According to the reports, the  Bureau of Human Resources intended to form an interoffice working  group to develop a comprehensive plan and implementation guidance to  support a department-wide effort for assessing training needs. State  officials said they had recently begun developing a plan to address the  reports\u2019 findings, though they had not yet formed an interoffice working  group as of November 2010."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FSI Training Continuums Include Some Inaccurate and Incomplete Information", "paragraphs": ["We found that documents on training\u2014known as training continuums\u2014 that FSI developed for employees do not include accurate and complete  information on training. The continuums generally identify training and  development for entry-, mid-, and senior-level employees, and contain  other information related to career planning. We previously reported that  providing transparent information for employees about career maps and  paths, how training opportunities could help employees attain career  goals, competency models, and training or professional requirements, can  help agencies communicate the importance of training and their  expectations for training programs to achieve results. FSI has developed  and published various training continuums for State\u2019s Foreign Service,  civil service, and LE staff, including the Training Continuum for Civil  Service Employees, the Training Continuum for Foreign Service  Generalists, the Training Resource Guide for Foreign Service National  Employees and Locally Employed Staff, and the Leadership and  Management Training Continuum, among others.", "State\u2019s OIG reported that FSI began developing these training continuums  in part to provide a framework for a departmental policy of mandatory  training, as well as to provide road maps tailored to the particular needs of  employees in various positions throughout their careers. In addition, the  continuums state they were designed to provide a broad overview of  appropriate training that should be considered as employees plan their  careers in the department. For example, the training continuums provide  information on leadership skills training requirements that State  established under former Secretary of State Powell for mid-level and  higher-ranked Foreign Service and civil service employees. The  continuums also generally include information on other mandatory  personnel training requirements, such as cyber security training, as well as  information on recommended and suggested courses for employees.  Specifically, the continuums state that required courses are defined as  mandatory; recommended courses should be taken to provide knowledge  and skills for successful job performance; and suggested courses are more  specialized and should be taken depending upon job duties. In addition,  the continuums generally include information on career development  opportunities. For example, they note that State\u2019s civil service, mid-level  rotational program provides opportunities for civil service mid-level  employees to rotate to other bureaus to broaden their skills, increase their  knowledge, and enhance their personnel and professional growth. They  also provide information on State\u2019s Career Development Program for  Foreign Service employees, which established certain mandatory and  elective professional, leadership, language, and technical skills  requirements that personnel must meet to be eligible for promotion to the  Senior Foreign Service.", "However, we found several issues that raise questions about the  usefulness and reliability of the continuums as resources for employees in  planning their training and development. For example, although we found  that the Training Continuum for Civil Service Employees lists diversity  awareness, ethics, and orientation training as \u201crequired\u201d for certain groups  of employees, and as \u201crecommended\u201d for other groups, a key official from  FSI\u2019s executive office stated that these courses are in fact mandatory  requirements for all civil service employees. The official added that these  mandatory requirements would also apply to Foreign Service personnel  and are among the few across-the-board training requirements that State  considers mandatory, along with cyber security and \u201cNo FEAR Act\u201d  training. In addition, LE staff have minimal mandatory training  requirements other than cyber security and ethics training. The FSI official  clarified that even though we found that some of the continuums list other,  more specialized courses as required for certain employees, the  department officially considers training mandatory, and tracks  completion, only if the training is listed as such by statute. The FSI official  said that in some cases, decisions regarding what courses would be listed  in continuums as required, recommended, or suggested were not fully  vetted throughout the agency, and that, as a result, the information may  not be entirely accurate or complete.", "In addition, while officials noted that bureaus and posts may designate  specific courses as required for certain groups of employees, we found  that these requirements are not always identified in the training  continuums or other guidance for employees. Several bureau and post  officials noted that personnel would generally rely on the training  continuums to identify necessary training, including any specialized  training that may be required or helpful to them in performing their jobs.  However, officials from the Bureau of International Organizations said that  although FSI\u2019s course on mulitilateral diplomacy is required of all  International Organizations personnel, it is not listed in the continuums.", "Training officials from the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and  Labor said Foreign Service labor officers must take the FSI labor officer  skills course, though it is not listed as a requirement in the continuum.  Some bureau officials said that employee supervisors are generally  responsible for ensuring that employees are aware of and take the  required training. Although some bureaus and posts had developed their  own training guidance\u2014for example, on available or suggested training  opportunities, or on procedures required to register for training\u2014the  guidance generally did not include information on any specific training  designated as required, recommended, or suggested by the bureau or post  for different employee groups.", "The official from FSI\u2019s executive office acknowledged that the continuums  do not include complete and accurate information for employees on  training, and noted they have not been reviewed to ensure they uniformly  reflect departmental policies or standards. The official added that some of  the continuums have not been updated in several years, there are not  continuums for every employee group, and because the continuums  include some discrepancies or inaccuracies, they should not be viewed as  formal or official guidance. The official also noted that FSI was  considering shifting to a new, standardized format for the training  continuums going forward that would hopefully improve the process and  make the continuums easier to update in an ongoing basis in the future.  However, greater involvement and collaboration from other bureaus  would be required in order for FSI to facilitate a comprehensive process to  develop official continuums for each job series, and the official noted that  some bureaus had not been very responsive to FSI\u2019s requests for input in  the past.", "FSI officials noted that information included in the continuums regarding  State\u2019s Career Development Program is official, as these program  requirements have been formally approved by the department. The  officials said that State has also developed separate guidance, called  playbooks, for certain groups of Foreign Service employees regarding  Career Development Program requirements. State officials noted that  both the continuums and the playbooks are resources that can be used by  employees to identify training and help plan career development, although  the continuums were developed for general informational purposes and  were not approved by agency management, unlike the playbooks.  However, the Career Development Program only applies to State\u2019s Foreign  Service employees. In addition, although the playbooks generally provide  information on mandatory or elective leadership or technical skills  training required for promotion, they do not provide broader information  that is included in the continuums, such as information on recommended  training that may not be relevant to promotion under the Career  Development Program.", "Although State has not established mandatory training for all employees at  every career stage, some bureau and post officials said that specific  training requirements and additional guidance for different employee  groups could be helpful. In response to the State OIG\u2019s prior  recommendation that the department establish specific mandatory  training for all employees at every career stage, State reported it intended  to eventually mandate specific training for all employees throughout their  careers; however, the mandatory training the department subsequently  established initially focused on the leadership skills training. State also  noted that although the department viewed training as critical to assuring  that employees have the necessary skills to support State\u2019s mission,  implementing broader mandatory requirements would have serious  resource implications. Nevertheless, some bureau and post officials we  interviewed indicated that improved guidance on training priorities by  career track, as well as possibly establishing additional specialized  mandatory training requirements, could heighten the focus on training and  help ensure that employees get the training they need."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Has Not Developed Formal, Comprehensive Curriculum Design Guidance", "paragraphs": ["Although State provided some examples of ways in which it aims to  incorporate effective design practices for training and development  efforts, we found that the department has not developed comprehensive  written guidelines and criteria to be followed throughout the course  design process. Our prior work identified several key indicators of  effective training programs related to the training design process, such as  mechanisms, procedures, or explicit criteria for    determining whether to design training programs in-house or obtain  services from a contractor or external source;   comparing merits of different delivery mechanisms (e.g., classroom or  computer-based training) and for determining the appropriate mix of  mechanisms to ensure efficient and cost-effective delivery;   ensuring an environment conducive to effective training through  employment of quality instructors, facilitators, mentors, and coaches; involvement of line managers, technical experts, human capital  professionals, and others to develop an integrated way to address specific  performance gaps; and incorporating measures of effectiveness into course designs.", "State has made an effort to incorporate effective design practices into its  training for Foreign Service, civil service, and LE staff. For example, in  demonstration of its efforts to identify cost-effective and robust options  for designing training and development, State shared sample letters of  obligation, such as a letter regarding its decision to provide in-house  training services for an FSI language course following a streamlined cost  competition. State also noted that its training includes a mix of delivery  mechanisms, including classroom, distance learning, and on-the-job  training, as delineated in its training continuums and schedule of courses.  According to FSI officials, FSI employs civil service training experts and  Foreign Service subject matter experts or technical experts to teach  courses, and FSI\u2019s Curriculum and Staff Development Division in the  School of Professional and Area Studies offers courses for staff on training  design and delivery. They noted that all FSI instructors and course  managers are required to take training in theory and best practices in adult  learning. In April 2007, FSI launched an adjunct faculty program, which  allows State personnel who demonstrate appropriate qualifications to  provide training domestically or overseas for FSI course credit. In  addition, to help ensure the integrated development of training to help  address specific performance gaps, according to State, FSI utilizes  working groups comprised of curricula and education experts, as well as  technical experts and practitioners of the subject matter in the course  design process. As a specific example, State developed and implemented a  plan to provide a combination of classroom and distance learning,  auditorium sessions, user guides, and deskside assistance to domestic and  overseas personnel to ensure the successful launch of a new technology  platform for combining cables and e-mails. Also, officials provided some  examples in which results of course evaluations were incorporated into  subsequent course offerings.", "Nevertheless, although FSI officials said that FSI generally follows  accepted industry standards in developing courses, they stated that FSI  does not have comprehensive, documented guidance or standards to be  followed throughout the curriculum design process for personnel training.  While FSI has developed some instructional and curriculum guidance that  is included in its Administrative Procedures Handbook, the sections  relevant to course development are specific to distance learning and not  classroom training. In addition, the handbook notes that the sections  containing course development process and style guides for distance  learning are under development and not available. Further, the handbook  does not include clear guidance for determining appropriate training  delivery mechanisms or whether to design training in-house or obtain  outside services, or for incorporating training evaluation results into  course designs. Because of the lack of formal curriculum design guidance,  FSI\u2019s permanent staff, as well as those who may be on temporary  assignment or working under contract to develop training, may be  unaware of and not applying consistent and appropriate practices and  standards across the board throughout the training design process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Lacks Data Needed to Assure That Support for Training Is Consistent and Appropriate", "paragraphs": ["Although State collects some information on the cost and delivery of  training, the department does not collect data needed for an analysis and  comparison of training provided to employees in different groups,  bureaus, regions, or posts. As a result, State cannot be assured that it is  providing consistent and appropriate support and funding for training and  development. Our prior work highlights the importance of quality data to  evaluating the quality and effectiveness of training and development  efforts, and found that tracking the cost and delivery of training is a key  attribute of an effective training program. We also found that the ability  of an agency to demonstrate consistent and appropriate support and  funding for training, and evidence that the agency provides needed tools  and resources to managers and employees for training, are indicators of  effective training programs.", "While State provided data on overall funding for training personnel that  showed some trends, the department does not track data that would allow  a more detailed analysis and comparison across various employee groups  and locations. State provided data on overall funding for training State  personnel from fiscal years 2006 to 2011, which showed the training  budget increased from about $157 million in fiscal year 2006 (adjusted for  inflation, expressed in 2010 dollars) to around $255 million in fiscal year  2010 (adjusted for inflation, expressed in 2010 dollars). (See table 5.)", "State officials noted that FSI\u2019s budget makes up the majority of funding for  training State personnel and includes resources for training space,  technology, instructors, curriculum development, salaries of full-time  students at FSI, and FSI-funded external training costs. Bureaus also allot  some money for external training not covered by FSI\u2014bureau allotments  ranged from a total of about $3 million in fiscal year 2006 to about $4  million in fiscal year 2009. However, according to State officials, the  estimated funding for 2006 through 2009 does not fully reflect State\u2019s  efforts to train personnel, due to the way State tracks funding. Specifically,  the amounts do not include  funding spent by posts for training offered at post or for travel per diem  for Foreign Service, civil service, and LE staff to participate in training  regionally or in Washington, D.C.; funding spent by bureaus other than FSI for internal training-related  efforts; or   some additional training-related costs that may not be detailed as training- related in State\u2019s operating budget.", "In addition, State officials said that State does not collect detailed data  showing funding spent for internal and external training; funding for  training Foreign Service, civil service, and LE staff, and for employees in  certain specific employee groups; and funding by bureau, region, and post.", "State officials noted that although they lack a detailed breakdown of  training funding, they track some data on employee participation in  training. However, these data also do not allow for a complete or detailed  analysis and comparison of training for employees in different groups or  locations. Although State provided data on training hours and courses  completed by Foreign Service, civil service, and LE staff for FSI  classroom, distance learning, language, and external training from fiscal  years 2006 through 2010, State officials said that a more detailed  breakdown of this information by bureau, region, post, or employee group  is not available. Further, although FSI\u2019s training continuums provide some  guidance for personnel on required, recommended, and suggested training  for employees in different groups, officials said that State generally only  centrally tracks employee completion of certain specific training  mandated by statute, such as cyber security training, as well for the  required leadership skills courses. State does not generally track  participation in other required, recommended, or suggested training. As a  result, for example, State could not provide data regarding the percentage  of foreign affairs or political officers that had completed required,  recommended, or suggested training for their areas of work. This type of  data could provide information on potential variations or inconsistencies  in training and help ensure employees are given sufficient and appropriate  training and development opportunities. For example, data that State  provided on the percentage of mid- and senior-level Foreign Service and  civil service personnel who had completed the respective required  leadership courses as of May 2010 showed some differences among  employee groups (see table 6). The data showed that 100 percent of  Ambassadors had completed the Ambassadorial Seminar. In addition, the  data showed that a majority of Senior Foreign Service and Senior  Executive Service, as well as Foreign Service and civil service GS-13 to  GS-15 equivalents (FS-03 to FS-01), had taken the required leadership  training, however, a greater percentage of civil service at each level were  unenrolled or untrained. State reported that Foreign Service employees  who are recommended for promotion to the next level must complete the  respective requirement within a year or the promotion will not become  effective; in comparison, civil service personnel are informed of the  requirement but monitor their own compliance.", "Although State tracks some data related to training funding and delivery,  the department does not have sufficient information that could be used to  ensure consistent and appropriate support for training, or to help  determine whether managers and employees have needed training tools  and resources. This is especially important given evidence of variances in  training across the department. Training officials we interviewed at a  number of bureaus and posts cited varying support for employee training  and development. While some bureaus and posts indicated they had  sufficient funding and support for training, others noted they faced  significant resource challenges that impacted the ability of employees to  get necessary training. For example:    Bureaus. Officials from several bureaus said that finding time or resources  for training generally was not a challenge. However, this was not the case  for other bureaus. For example, officials representing two of State\u2019s  regional bureaus noted that a lack of time was a main constraint  preventing employees from taking needed training. A training official  representing two other bureaus said that taking employees away from  their day-to-day work for training poses significant challenges, given that  some employees have heavy workloads. The official added that in her  experience, although a majority of bureau civil service supervisors have  fulfilled the mandatory leadership training requirements, supervisors  sometimes enroll but cancel owing to the \u201ccrisis of the day.\u201d In addition,  although officials from two bureaus said they provide individual guidance  or counseling to each Foreign Service and civil service employee in the  bureau, officials representing some other bureaus indicated their  competing responsibilities do not allow them to spend much time  providing guidance or counseling, and that their primary role was to  process training requests.", "Posts. Training officials we interviewed at 12 posts cited varied support  and resources for training. While several posts said they had enough  funding for training, other posts said funding was insufficient or had  fluctuated in recent years. Further, officials at most of the posts we  interviewed said finding time for training can be a challenge at post. Only  one post said time was not an issue, because the post has a policy that  allows each employee to set aside up to 2 to 3 hours a week for training.  Officials from several posts, as well as a number of respondents to the  2009 American Foreign Service Association survey noted although Foreign  Service personnel are generally expected to obtain needed training in  between tours, personnel may not have time for the training due to the  departing post\u2019s holding onto staff as long as possible and the subsequent  post\u2019s requiring staff to arrive as soon as possible. In addition, while two  posts noted they benefited from having personnel dedicated to training full  time, training officials from the majority of posts we interviewed said their  posts had no one dedicated to training full time. For example, the  mission training officer at one large post said she is only able to spend  about 10 percent of her time on training-related responsibilities.", "Regional training. State also has regional centers that provide training,  among other services, in partnership with FSI in three locations: the  Western Hemisphere Affairs Training Division at the Florida Regional  Center (Florida center) in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida; the Frankfurt Regional  Support Center (Frankfurt center) Training and Development Center in  Frankfurt, Germany; and the Regional Employee Development Center  (Bangkok center) in Bangkok, Thailand. Officials noted these centers  primarily support training for LE staff in their respective regions, and they  offer training on-site and at other posts in their regions. However, support  for the centers varies, and the centers do not formally serve employees  working in each of State\u2019s regions worldwide. For example, the Florida  center is the only center with a formal agreement with FSI; under the  agreement, the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs funds an FSI staff  member to direct and provide training through the Florida center. Officials  from the Frankfurt center said they did not need a formal agreement in  part because they already have personnel with adjunct faculty status. In  contrast, officials from the Bangkok center said that they hoped to  establish a more formal agreement that would allow for an FSI  representative to be assigned to the center to help them further develop  their program and obtain adjunct faculty status for their two full-time LE  staff trainers. Officials from the Bankgok center noted these two trainers  currently cannot teach any FSI courses and can only teach courses  developed by the center that would not be eligible for FSI course credit.  In addition, officials from the regional centers indicated that regional  training services for the Bureaus of African Affairs, Near Eastern Affairs,  and to some extent South and Central Asian Affairs are currently ad hoc,  given that they are not formally served by any of the above centers.  Officials from the Frankfurt center said that demand for their training  from regions not formally covered by other centers, including from  employees who work at posts in the African Affairs and Near Eastern  Affairs regions in particular, often exceeds what the Frankfurt center can  provide. For some general services operations courses, the officials said  they have had 120 applicants for 10 to 25 spots."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Has Not Developed a Formal Plan for Evaluating the Effectiveness of Training", "paragraphs": ["Although State has various training evaluation mechanisms in place, the  department lacks a training data collection and analysis plan. As a result, it  is not clear whether or how State systematically makes decisions  regarding how training programs will be evaluated using different methods  or tools, or how results will be used. Our prior work highlights the  importance of planning and conducting evaluations of the effectiveness of  training and development efforts and notes that a data collection and  analysis plan can set priorities for evaluations and systematically cover the  methods, timing, and responsibilities for an agency\u2019s data collection.  While State has implemented mechanisms to evaluate training, including  course evaluations and an annual training survey, these mechanisms do  not fully incorporate LE staff, and primarily focus on participant  satisfaction or reaction to training, rather than desired results, such as  improved quality or efficiency of work.", "State has a range of training evaluation mechanisms and procedures to  obtain feedback from supervisors and employees on training, such as FSI\u2019s  annual training survey, and mid- and-post-training course evaluations. FSI  has developed and updated lists of evaluations used for different courses,  which generally include information such as the intended recipients (e.g.,  students or supervisors), frequency, and timing of the course evaluation,  as well as responsibilities for compiling the evaluations and for reviewing  responses received. FSI also provided several examples of adjustments to  training efforts in response to feedback received through its course  evaluation efforts. For example, the course manager for Office  Management Specialists training provided a November 2009 memorandum  summarizing a number of changes made to the entry-level training as a  result of course evaluations, among other factors. In addition, FSI  provided a summary of results of an October 2009 offering of the Iraq  Provincial Reconstruction Team course. The summary highlighted  changes that had been made prior to the October offering as well as  recommendations for modifications to be made in the subsequent offering  of the course.", "However, while FSI has compiled lists of evaluation mechanisms used for  different courses, these lists do not include guidance on setting priorities  for training evaluations, or how to determine appropriate methods, timing,  or responsibilities for evaluating training and development efforts. They  also do not include guidelines to help ensure State makes an ongoing  effort to improve the quality and breadth of data gathered. We found  several potential gaps and areas for improvement in State\u2019s efforts to  evaluate personnel training. For example, FSI\u2019s annual training survey is  sent to a random sample of State\u2019s Foreign Service and civil service  employees and eligible family members but not LE staff. Likewise, several  training-related questions are also included in the department\u2019s biannual  Quality of Work Life Survey, which is sent to a random sample of Foreign  Service and civil service employees but not to LE staff. In addition,  although FSI conducted a June 2009 survey of LE staff training needs, the  survey was sent to post management, not to LE staff, and FSI had not set  specific time frames for repeating the survey as of November 2010. Several  officials noted that LE staff often identify training needs or issues through  the process of creating a Work Development Plan, but not all of the posts  we interviewed required these plans.", "In addition, respondents to the 2010 Annual Training Survey indicated they  were generally satisfied overall with FSI training delivery, programs  offered, and customer service. However, relatively fewer respondents  indicated they were satisfied with the number of courses offered and their  ability to attend courses in their geographic region. Additionally, some  respondents said that they did not receive training that would have been  helpful, such as tradecraft (e.g., consular, political, or public diplomacy),  leadership and management, language, or information technology end-user  training. However, despite the diverse training needs and requirements of  State personnel, FSI officials told us they were not able to break out  responses to determine whether there were any differences, for example,  between responses of Foreign Service and civil service employees, or  those serving at headquarters or in overseas regions.", "Course evaluations used by FSI\u2019s schools vary and generally focus on  participant satisfaction or reaction to training, rather than knowledge  gained, behavior change, or impact of the training. We reviewed  examples of course evaluations used by each of FSI\u2019s schools\u2014 the  Leadership and Management School, School of Applied Information  Technology, School of Language Studies, and School of Professional and  Area Studies\u2014as well as within each of the 10 divisions under the School  of Professional and Area Studies. We found that courses generally  incorporated mid-course and end-of-course student surveys, while some  also included post-training surveys (e.g., typically several months after the  end of the course), and a few included supervisors. The surveys included  various numbers of multiple choice and open-ended questions and  generally addressed participant satisfaction or reaction to training but less  frequently included the types of questions that could be used to help  determine on-the-job behavior change or impact of training. For example,  for the Stability Operations division under FSI\u2019s School of Professional  Area Studies, we reviewed several end-of-course surveys and post-training  surveys. We found one end-of-course survey (Iraq Familiarization)  included only questions regarding participant satisfaction with course  content; one end-of-course survey (Foundations of Reconstruction &  Stabilization Operations) included questions regarding participant  satisfaction with training as well as self-assessments of knowledge gained;  and four others (Afghanistan Familiarization, Afghanistan and Iraq  Provincial Reconstruction Team end-of-course, and Afghanistan Provincial  Reconstruction Team post-training) included the above types of questions  as well as a question regarding on-the-job behavior change resulting from  training.", "While some of FSI\u2019s training evaluation mechanisms include questions that  relate to on-the-job behavior change or the impact of training, FSI\u2019s  Director of Curriculum and Staff Development said that the institute\u2019s  course evaluations tend to focus primarily on participant reaction to  training. The official noted that the evaluations focus to some extent on  knowledge or skills gained, and less on behavior change or impact of  training.

State has many training  practices and processes in place reflecting the elements of effective  training programs, including the development of an annual workforce  training plan and hundreds of classroom and distance learning offerings,  as well as cross-training and other career development opportunities for  personnel. State has incorporated the use of technology to enhance  training efforts, and implemented oversight mechanisms such as training  agreements to help ensure employees take advantage of legitimate  training. In addition, State has various mechanisms in place to evaluate  training, such as an annual training survey and course evaluations.", "However, we found strategic weaknesses and room for improvement in  several key areas. First, without a systematic, comprehensive assessment  of training needs, State cannot be assured training is connected to true  needs and priorities. Second, without transparent, complete, and accurate  information for all employees on training opportunities, including on any  required or recommended training for specific positions, State employees  may be hampered in their efforts to plan for training and development  throughout their careers. In addition, without taking several steps to  address weaknesses in State\u2019s efforts to evaluate personnel training, it is  not clear that State is sufficiently able to assess whether employees have  the information, competencies, and skills they need to work effectively.  For example, it is not clear that State\u2019s training performance measures  provide meaningful information to help the department determine the  quality and effectiveness of training efforts. State also lacks a plan for  training data collection and analysis, as well as adequate mechanisms for  determining whether the department is providing consistent and  appropriate support and funding for training all employees\u2014including LE  staff.", "State\u2019s budget and focus on training have increased in recent years, but the  department has also faced, and will likely continue to face, fluctuating and  constrained resources and competing priorities when determining what  training is critical to its mission.

Specifically, we examined State  documents and data relevant to each of the 32 attributes identified in the  GAO guidance, and the indicators associated with each attribute. We used  the results of this assessment to identify strategic weaknesses in State\u2019s  training based on criteria contained in GAO and the Office of Personal  Management (OPM) guidance, as well State and other legislative and  regulatory guidance and policy. We reviewed training evaluation  mechanisms used by each of the four FSI schools\u2014the Leadership and  Management School, School of Applied Information Technology, School of  Language Studies, and School of Professional and Area Studies\u2014as well as  within each of the 10 divisions under the School of Professional and Area  Studies.
