In some cases, FWS has required project proponents to take specific steps to avoid, minimize, or compensate for a project's potential impacts on the ABB or its habitat.

For example, to avoid impacts on ABB habitat, FWS may suggest that project proponents\u2014public and private entities\u2014relocate the project or part of the project to another location. If complete avoidance is not possible, FWS may suggest ways to minimize the potential impacts, such as reducing soil disturbance during construction or limiting the use of pesticides. If avoidance and minimization actions are impractical or inadequate, then FWS may suggest compensatory mitigation strategies, which allow project proponents to choose to compensate for the potential adverse impacts of their projects.", "FWS uses several types of compensatory mitigation strategies, including (1) conservation banks, in which third parties invest up front in protected lands that are conserved and managed for a species, and then sell mitigation credits to project proponents, and (2) in-lieu fee programs, in which third parties generally collect money from several project proponents and conduct conservation activities for the species in a location away from the project site after the project's potential impacts have occurred. FWS has used two conservation banks in Oklahoma and three in-lieu fee programs in several states specifically to conserve the ABB. FWS tracks key information about its conservation banks, such as the location and mitigation credits available, and uses this information to help manage activities. However, FWS has not fully implemented its plan to track in-lieu fee programs. FWS signed an interagency agreement with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in February 2016 to modify its Regulatory In-lieu fee and Bank Information Tracking System (RIBITS) to enable FWS to track its in-lieu fee programs. However, FWS has not obligated funds for the necessary modifications or developed a timetable for doing so. Federal internal control standards provide that management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks. To accomplish this, federal internal control standards recommend that management define the time frames for how objectives will be achieved. Until FWS collects relevant and reliable data on its in-lieu fee programs, the agency will not be able to evaluate the effectiveness of its programs and determine the most effective strategy for conservation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that appropriate plans are made to obligate funds, GAO recommends that FWS establish a timetable with milestones for modifying RIBITS to incorporate FWS's in-lieu fee program information.", "FWS concurred with this recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Historically, the American burying beetle (ABB), a large scavenger insect  native to North America, was present in more than 30 U.S. states and  parts of Canada. However, as of the late 1980s, two known populations of  the ABB remained\u2014one on Block Island, Rhode Island, and the other in  eastern Oklahoma. Consequently, in 1989 the Department of the  Interior\u2019s U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) listed the ABB as an  endangered species, providing it certain protections under the  Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA). Since listing the ABB, FWS has  taken steps to conserve the ABB and has used several strategies to  mitigate potential harm to the species from the construction of new roads  or oil and gas pipelines and other projects. In some cases, FWS has  required project proponents to take specific steps to avoid, minimize, or  compensate for a project\u2019s potential impacts on the ABB or its habitat.  When project proponents make financial contributions to compensate for  the impacts of these projects, FWS generally refers to it as compensatory  mitigation.", "FWS has used different compensatory mitigation strategies for the ABB,  including in-lieu fee programs and conservation banks. Generally, under  in-lieu fee programs, project proponents make financial contributions to a  third party that conducts off-site conservation activities (i.e., in a location  away from the project site). These third parties generally bundle  contributions and, once they obtain sufficient funds, they conduct their  conservation activities. As a result, conservation activities usually occur  after the project\u2019s potential impacts on endangered and threatened  species or their habitat have occurred. In contrast, conservation banks,  in accordance with FWS-approved conservation bank instruments, are  protected lands that are conserved and permanently managed for species  that are endangered, threatened, candidates for listing, or at risk.  Conservation banks, also in a location off-site from the project, are to  offset the adverse impacts to these species in advance of the project.  For example, land may be purchased and set aside as an ABB reserve.  Conservation bank sponsors then sell credits to project proponents who  are seeking to mitigate the potential impacts of their projects.", "Scientists have found it difficult to study and understand the ABB because  of its unique life cycle. Specifically, the ABB lives for approximately  1 year; is typically inactive underground for 6 to 9 months; and, when  active, emerges from the ground only at night. As of October 2016, ABB  populations were known or believed to exist in nine U.S. states,  predominantly in the Midwest, including as part of reintroduction  programs and experimental populations. FWS expects to complete a  national-level scientific evaluation of the ABB\u2019s current condition in 2017  and then, in response to a petition to delist the ABB, make a  determination about the ABB\u2019s status as an endangered species.", "You asked us to examine how FWS uses compensatory mitigation  strategies for endangered or threatened species, including the ABB. This  report examines (1) how FWS has sought to avoid and minimize potential  adverse impacts on the ABB from construction and other projects and  (2) what is known about FWS\u2019s compensatory mitigation strategies and  how FWS has used two of these strategies, in-lieu fee programs and  conservation banks, for the ABB. In addition, you asked us to review the  contributions and disbursements for a specific in-lieu fee program for the  ABB.

ABBs depend on dead animals for food and reproduction. The ABB is an  annual species that lives underground and emerges nocturnally when  surface temperatures consistently exceed 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Once  emerged, the ABB seeks a suitable carcass and competes for a mate.  The mated pair then buries the carcass, which the ABB uses to sustain its  young. The ABB is a winged insect, and, according to FWS\u2019s evaluation  of available research, it can travel up to 18 miles in one night. The ABB  pair raises its young underground using chemical secretions to preserve  the carcass for its offspring. Figure 2 shows two ABB specimens.", "Through its actions to find and bury carcasses in the soil, ABBs are  beneficial in controlling pests, converting carcasses into soil nutrients,  and aerating the soil. To preserve the carcasses of their prey, ABBs  secrete chemicals that researchers are studying for applicability in  treating bacterial infections, preventing fungal growth, and preserving  meat at room temperature for human consumption. According to  scientists, ABBs also benefit human health and agriculture by reducing  disease vectors. Specifically, ABBs limit outbreaks of flies and other  animals that could affect livestock production. ABBs are one of the few  insects that provide parental care for their offspring. In addition, ABBs are  considered an indicator species that is useful in evaluating the overall  health of the environment. Figure 3 shows the life cycle of the typical  ABB.", "According to FWS documentation, the ABB, which was once found in  more than 30 states, had disappeared from over 90 percent of its  historical range by March 2008. The exact reasons for the decline of the  ABB are unknown. However, according to FWS documentation, biologists  have identified some potential reasons for the decline, such as the  elimination or decline of appropriate-sized carcasses, habitat loss and  fragmentation due to widespread agriculture and development, and  increased competition from other animals and invasive species.  According to officials at FWS, the agency improves its knowledge about  the ABB through research and scientific surveys to detect and record the  presence of the ABB in specific locations, which must be conducted  during the ABB\u2019s limited active season.

The first step in this hierarchy of actions is to avoid any impact on the  listed species, such as by relocating the construction site outside the  species\u2019 habitat. The second step is to minimize the impact on the  species, such as by placing restrictions on when construction or other  activities can occur. According to FWS documentation, FWS can recommend a combination of avoidance and minimization measures to  protect listed species.", "FWS has worked with project proponents to develop avoidance measures  for the ABB in an effort to help ensure that projects do not have a direct or  indirect adverse impact on the ABB. For example, some Ecological  Services field offices recommend that project proponents conduct  presence surveys for the ABB if the project is located where ABBs may  be present, and, according to FWS officials, project proponents often  choose to conduct such surveys. According to FWS documentation, if  surveys indicate that no ABB are present within the project area, the  project proponent may conduct its project at the proposed location with  concurrence from FWS that the project is not likely to adversely affect the  ABB. Other examples of avoidance efforts for the ABB include the  following:", "Officials in the South Dakota Ecological Services Field Office said that  sometimes project proponents have relocated their projects to avoid  potential harm to the ABB. For example, in 2009 a project proponent  selected a site for a wind development project outside the ABB\u2019s  range in South Dakota, and officials said that ABB presence was likely  one factor that influenced the selection of that site. According to these  officials, project proponents in South Dakota are able to select  alternative project sites to avoid potential impacts on the ABB, in  general, because ABB are known to be present in only a few counties  in the state, where little development occurs.", "In 2011, the New England Ecological Services Field Office and a  project proponent agreed that the project proponent could avoid  harming the ABB for an airport lighting project on Block Island in  Rhode Island by eliminating certain activities that could cause ground  disturbance. For example, the project proponent agreed, among other  things, to leave buried cable in place and decided not to excavate  existing lighting poles in areas where ABB could be living.", "Officials in the Oklahoma Ecological Services Field Office stated that  they provide project proponents in Oklahoma with the option to avoid  take of the ABB by locating projects in habitat unfavorable to the ABB  or where surveys indicate no ABB presence in the area. For example,  FWS considers land to be unfavorable to the ABB if it is tilled on a  regular basis or located in urban areas with paved surfaces or  roadways.", "FWS has also worked with project proponents in other cases to minimize  potential impacts on the species when avoidance was not feasible. For  example, some incidental take statements included in FWS biological  opinions discuss reducing disturbances to soil in areas considered  suitable habitat for the ABB and require restoration of any soil that is  disturbed in these areas to its natural state after construction as ways for  project proponents to minimize their projects\u2019 potential impacts on the  ABB. Other examples of minimization efforts for the ABB include the  following:  In 2009, the Kansas Ecological Services Field Office required a  project proponent to mow vegetation in areas that would be directly  disturbed during the installation of a water pipeline. According to  FWS\u2019s biological opinion for this project, mowing vegetation on at  least a monthly basis during the ABB\u2019s active period would make the  area less attractive to the ABB and therefore help minimize potential  adverse impacts on the species by reducing the likelihood that ABB  would be present in the areas where the project proponent would be  disturbing the ground.", "In 2010, the South Dakota Ecological Services Field Office issued a  biological opinion to the Federal Highway Administration for stream  crossing projects. The incidental take statement included in the  biological opinion required that the agency use construction practices  that would minimally impact suitable habitat for the ABB adjacent to  the project area.", "In 2014, the Oklahoma Ecological Services Field Office developed the  Oil and Gas Industry Conservation Plan. According to that plan, its  purpose is to provide a voluntary process for oil and gas project  proponents to obtain permits for incidental take of the ABB from their  projects that are not funded, authorized, or carried out by federal  agencies. In order to be eligible for a permit under the plan, project  proponents must agree to implement certain measures to minimize  potential impacts on the ABB from their projects. For example, project  proponents must agree to reduce the use of motor vehicles,  machinery, or heavy equipment, which can result in take of the ABB.", "In 2015, the Nebraska Ecological Services Field Office conducted a  section 7 consultation with the Western Area Power Administration for  a wind energy development project in Nebraska. In the course of this  consultation, the Nebraska Ecological Services Field Office and the  project proponent agreed to several measures, including minimizing,  to the extent possible, the use of artificial lighting that can attract  insects like the ABB and result in take of the species. The project  proponent also agreed to minimize the use of pesticides and avoid  using them during the ABB\u2019s active season, and incorporated both of  these measures into its project proposal.", "If a federal agency is involved in authorizing, funding, or carrying out a  proposed project, FWS\u2019s discussions with project proponents about  options to avoid and minimize potential adverse impacts on the ABB can  occur within the context of consultations under section 7 of the ESA. To  help monitor actions, FWS tracks information on its formal section 7  consultation activities using its TAILS database. Table 2 shows the  number of ABB-related formal section 7 consultation activities by FWS  regions and field offices from fiscal years 2008 through 2015. The  Oklahoma Ecological Services Field Office conducted 46 out of 118 of the  formal consultations on the ABB during this period\u2014more than one-third  of those conducted nationwide.", "FWS also uses TAILS to track informal activities conducted under section  7 of the ESA, such as informal consultations and technical assistance, but  FWS officials said that Ecological Services field offices differ in how they  interpret and record these informal activities. According to FWS officials,  FWS field offices also work with project proponents to avoid and minimize  potential adverse impacts on the ABB and other listed species for projects  that are not funded, authorized, or carried out by a federal agency, but the  details of the technical assistance through such discussions are not  always included in TAILS. According to FWS officials, FWS is planning  to develop standard operating procedures for using TAILS to improve the  reliability of the data. According to these officials, FWS anticipates  completing these standard operating procedures for TAILS in 3 years.", "While avoiding and minimizing are FWS\u2019s preferred alternatives, they  may not always be practical for project proponents. For example, it may  not be practical to relocate a road project or an oil and gas well to avoid  ABB habitat or to wait for the ABB\u2019s active period to conduct a presence  survey.

As a result of these  discussions, a project proponent may incorporate compensatory  mitigation strategies into its project, and FWS may also require them in  the nondiscretionary terms and conditions of incidental take statements  included in biological opinions or in habitat conservation plans and  incidental take permits, according to FWS officials.  FWS uses several  compensatory mitigation strategies, including conservation banks and in- lieu fee programs. These strategies may involve project proponents  providing financial support for mitigation in other locations (i.e., outside  the boundaries of the proposed project) to offset some or all of the  project\u2019s impacts. For conservation banks and in-lieu fee programs,  project proponents provide money to a third party to conduct the  conservation activities. Responsibility for conducting the conservation  activities is transferred to the third party.", "In addition, FWS uses other strategies, including habitat credit  exchanges, permittee-responsible mitigation, and other third-party  mitigation (see table 3). FWS gives project proponents options to  conduct mitigation on their own or through other arrangements, such as  purchasing conservation bank credits or contributing to an in-lieu fee  program, if those options exist and the project proponent is eligible under  the terms and conditions of those arrangements. FWS officials said that  when conservation banks or in-lieu fee programs have been available as  mitigation options, nearly all project proponents choose to use these  options over other compensatory mitigation strategies, such as permittee- responsible mitigation, because of issues of mitigation costs and liability.", "FWS has issued guidance to its regional offices for the establishment and  use of conservation banks but has not finalized guidance that addresses  operational considerations for in-lieu fee programs and other types of  compensatory mitigation strategies. According to the guidance FWS  issued in 2003 for establishing and using conservation banks as a  compensatory mitigation strategy, conservation banks must conduct  conservation for species in advance of any project development.  Conservation banks should also obtain a permanent conservation  easement on the mitigation lands, establish a management endowment  that will support the perpetual management of the mitigation land, and  establish a time limit for fully funding the endowment. Furthermore,  according to this guidance, conservation bank proposals that are  submitted for FWS approval must contain a conservation bank agreement  that establishes a monitoring program, such as an annual reporting  requirement, a long-term management plan, and a dispute resolution  process to be used if the banks\u2019 owners fail to meet their obligations.", "According to an FWS official, the lack of guidance addressing the  establishment or use of in-lieu fee programs and other types of  compensatory mitigation strategies has led to differences in the structure,  monitoring, and oversight of these strategies across FWS. In September  2016, however, FWS issued a draft policy for public comment in the  Federal Register on ESA compensatory mitigation strategies that covers  all these compensatory mitigation strategies. This draft policy is  intended to align with departmental directives and a 2015 presidential  memorandum on mitigating impacts on natural resources from  development. It establishes standards for compensatory mitigation and  minimum criteria for achieving these standards. The draft policy stresses  the need to hold all compensatory mitigation strategies to equivalent and  effective standards, but it would not apply to mitigation arrangements that  have already been approved unless the in-lieu fee program, conservation  bank, or other arrangement is modified or amended. In addition,  according to FWS\u2019s website, the draft policy seeks to improve  collaboration and coordination among all interested parties when FWS is  engaged in the planning and implementation of compensatory mitigation  strategies.

In addition, FWS is limited in its ability to  evaluate whether in-lieu fee programs are an effective strategy for  conservation. However, FWS headquarters officials we interviewed said  that FWS recognizes the need to track and monitor its in-lieu fee  programs to provide better oversight. In February 2016, FWS signed an  interagency agreement, which will be in effect for 5 years, with the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers to, among other things, modify its RIBITS  database so FWS can track all in-lieu fee programs across regions and  field offices.

According to representatives of The Nature Conservancy, it preserves the  Tallgrass Prairie Preserve as a native tallgrass prairie habitat through the  management of a bison herd that serves as a keystone species to restore  the ecosystem. The Nature Conservancy manages the preserve to  conserve all native species, but the representatives stated that the ABB  benefits from this protected, heterogeneous grassland habitat. According  to representatives from The Nature Conservancy, it used the American  Burying Beetle Conservation Fund for various habitat management  activities, including conducting prescribed burns to manage the  grasslands and controlling invasive species, such as feral pigs.  Representatives from The Nature Conservancy said that ABB populations  have increased in both size and distribution across the preserve since  ABBs were first found at the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in 1999.

Representatives for both of the banks told us that they  undertake activities to manage ABB habitat, rather than specifically  managing for the species. For example, they said they use prescribed  burns and control invasive species, such as eastern red cedar and red  imported fire ants, which, if not managed, can reduce quality habitat for  the ABB.", "According to FWS officials, the process of approving and establishing a  conservation bank can take several years and requires up-front  investments from bank sponsors. These officials told us FWS only  reviews and approves applications and does not propose or initiate  conservation banks. Conservation banks are private enterprises that are  proposed by potential conservation bankers. Officials also told us that  conservation banks are used in places where there is a strong demand  for compensatory mitigation. FWS requires that offsets occur within a  designated service area. Therefore, project proponents use  conservation banks within the approved service area for the project or  impact site. However, according to FWS officials, in Oklahoma, if there  are no conservation banks in a project\u2019s service area, project proponents  can purchase credits at other conservation banks. As of November 2016,  Oklahoma was the only state where conservation banks existed for the  ABB. According to FWS officials, this is due to the market created by the  relatively high density of the ABB population; large areas of suitable  habitat; and numerous development projects, such as oil and gas well  drilling and pipelines.", "According to representatives of the oil and gas industry in Oklahoma,  companies prefer to purchase conservation bank credits rather than  conduct their own permittee-responsible mitigation to avoid project delays  and minimize long-term liabilities. However, representatives of the oil and  gas industry we interviewed said they are concerned about the high costs  of the conservation bank credits, which the conservation banks set on the  basis of changing market conditions. Oil and gas industry representatives  noted that from 2009 to 2012, FWS recommended contributions to the  American Burying Beetle Conservation Fund that were significantly less  than the current cost of credits from either of the two approved  conservation banks. According to FWS officials, FWS has no control over  the cost of conservation bank credits. Those costs are negotiated  between the conservation bank and the purchasers. In contrast, the  contributions to the American Burying Beetle Conservation Fund were  based on expected survey costs, which were not always commensurate  with the cost of mitigating impacts of a proposed project. According to oil  and gas industry officials, the high cost of bank credits is one major  reason they supported a petition to delist the ABB. According to  conservation bank officials, the petition to delist the ABB has created  uncertainty regarding the market for bank credits, since project  proponents would no longer have a need to mitigate potential harm to the  ABB to move forward with their projects if FWS delisted the ABB."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["FWS does not track information about its in-lieu fee programs across  regions and field offices.

We requested data  from FWS regarding all current FWS in-lieu fee programs for endangered  and threatened species, but we determined that the data FWS provided  were not sufficiently reliable for our purposes because of missing  information and other errors. For example, we determined that the data  FWS provided included information on some in-lieu fee programs that had  been terminated, included information on some compensatory mitigation  strategies that are not in-lieu fee programs, and excluded at least one in- lieu fee program that is currently in operation.

In Ohio,  FWS has attempted to reintroduce the ABB since 1998, when it began  transporting naturally occurring ABB from Arkansas for release in Ohio.  FWS officials said that their reintroduction efforts in Ohio have been  unsuccessful, in part, because the ABBs from Arkansas that were used in  the reintroduction program may not be adapted to conditions that occur  further north in Ohio. FWS is now using ABB from Nebraska instead of  Arkansas to test if these ABB are more accustomed to colder winters,  according to FWS officials. In Missouri, FWS has transported and  released a non-essential, experimental ABB population in the  southwestern part of the state since 2012. FWS has documented an  increasing number of ABB in Missouri each year since the reintroduction  program began.", "FWS has not designated critical habitat for the ABB, in part, because the  species is a habitat generalist, and it is still unknown what habitat type is  essential for ABB conservation, according to FWS officials.
