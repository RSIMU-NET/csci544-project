Using guidance issued by DOJ, agencies are generally required to develop recipient guidance and/or an LEP plan outlining steps for ensuring that LEP persons can access federal services and programs. As requested, GAO (1) determined which agencies have completed their recipient guidance and LEP plan, (2) assessed the extent to which the selected agencies have implemented the Executive Order consistent with DOJ's guidance, and (3) examined DOJ's and the three selected agencies' efforts to enhance collaboration. GAO analyzed the Executive Order and agencies' recipient guidance and plans posted on LEP.gov; selected the IRS, FEMA, and SBA for this review because of the amount and significance of their interaction with LEP persons; and reviewed documentation of agencies' collaborative efforts to provide access to federal services."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As of February 2010, 22 agencies have completed their recipient guidance. Additionally, DOJ has reported receiving LEP plans from 58 federal agencies. However, the total number of agencies required to complete recipient guidance and an LEP plan cannot be determined because the Executive Order makes agencies responsible for determining the need for guidance and a plan based on their interaction with LEP persons and does not require agencies to report on the results of their determination. Consequently, some agencies may determine that drafting a recipient guidance or an LEP plan is not necessary. Further, although the Executive Order requires agencies to make recipient guidance public, the same requirement does not exist for plans. DOJ's guidance contains four elements for improving access to federal programs and services by LEP persons. IRS has fully addressed each of these elements, while FEMA and SBA have made less progress, as shown in the table below. IRS has centralized its language access services within one office, overseen by an agencywide executive council. Additionally, IRS regularly identifies the LEP populations it serves, administers a variety of targeted language access services, and monitors these services for potential improvements. FEMA has demonstrated agency commitment, identified LEP populations, and delivered services during disasters, but it lacks a structured approach to monitor these services. While SBA is continuing to draft its LEP plan, the agency does not conduct a needs assessment, and provides limited monitoring of services to LEP populations. Among the three agencies GAO reviewed, FEMA collaborates with SBA and IRS to provide LEP persons a centralized location for receiving assistance during a declared disaster. Additionally, these agencies (along with 21 other federal agencies), participate in an Interagency Working Group on LEP issues. GAO identified a potential shared services approach agencies could use for translation and interpretive services."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to 2007 U. S.

Persons with limited English proficiency (LEP) may be unable to access  federal programs and services that they are otherwise eligible to receive,  which in turn could affect individual LEP persons or entire LEP  communities.", "Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides that no person in the  United States shall be discriminated against on the basis of race, color, or  national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial  assistance. On August 11, 2000, President Clinton issued Executive Order  13166, which extended the principles of meaningful access for limited  English proficient persons embodied in Title VI to federal agencies\u2019  programs and services. Executive Order 13166 required federal agencies to  examine how to improve access for LEP persons to programs, services,  and activities conducted by both federal agencies as well as state, local,  and regional entities that receive federal financial assistance (a group  referred to in the Executive Order as \u201crecipients\u201d). While the Executive  Order does not prescribe specific approaches for improving access for  LEP persons, it does require federal agencies that provide federal  assistance to state, local, or regional programs and services to develop  guidelines (referred to as recipient guidance) that clarifies their Title VI  obligations. It also requires agencies to prepare LEP plans outlining the  steps they will take to ensure that eligible LEP persons can access their  programs and activities.

As  agreed with your offices, we (1) determined which executive branch  agencies have completed recipient guidance and plans; (2) assessed the  extent to which three selected agencies have implemented the Executive  Order consistent with DOJ\u2019s guidance; and (3) examined DOJ\u2019s and the  selected agencies\u2019 efforts to enhance collaboration to improve access to  federal programs and services for LEP populations, as well as other  potential opportunities for collaboration.", "To determine which executive branch agencies have completed recipient  guidance and LEP plans, we reviewed the recipient guidance and LEP  plans published on LEP.gov, a Web site created and maintained by DOJ to  implement the Executive Order. We also reviewed the requirements of the  Executive Order and DOJ\u2019s guidance that was issued to assist agencies in  developing their recipient guidance. Additionally, we interviewed DOJ  officials regarding the technical advice they provided to federal agencies  on preparing recipient guidance and LEP plans. We assessed whether the  selected agencies implemented four elements discussed in the DOJ  guidance, specifically (1) agency commitment, (2) needs assessment,   (3) service delivery, and (4) monitoring. These elements were assessed to  determine whether they were fully implemented, partially implemented, or  not implemented. For example, an agency would be assessed as having  implemented the \u201cagency commitment\u201d element if it had completed its  recipient guidance and/or LEP plan and had incorporated into its agency  mission, strategic plans, processes, and resource allocation. Additionally,  if its recipient guidance and/or LEP plan had not been formalized and/or it  had not integrated its language access efforts into all aspects of its plans,  processes, or resources, the agency would be assessed as having partially  implemented the agency commitment element. An agency would be  assessed as minimally implementing this element if it had taken no actions  or minimal actions to address the element.", "To review the extent to which selected agencies have implemented the  Executive Order consistent with DOJ guidance, we selected three agencies  to obtain a range of different types of interactions with, and services  provided to LEP populations, as well as a mix of agencies with diverse  missions and size. Specifically, we reviewed the following agencies:  Internal Revenue Service (IRS), with 90,647 full-time equivalents and a  budget of $11 billion as of fiscal year 2008, which interacts with all  taxpayers nationwide. All persons earning an income are subject to  paying taxes regardless of citizenship, immigrant status, or level of  English proficiency.", "Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), with 2,765  permanent full-time equivalents and several thousand part time  disaster assistance employees and a budget of $20 billion as of fiscal  year 2008, which leads federal efforts to prepare for, prevent, respond  to, and recover from all hazards. It provides life-sustaining and life- saving services and information to LEP and non-LEP persons affected  by presidentially declared disasters.", "Small Business Administration (SBA), with 3,636 full-time equivalents  and a budget of $1.6 billion as of fiscal year 2008, which provides  services and grants to LEP and non-LEP persons seeking assistance to  start and build upon their small businesses. Additionally, it assists  small businesses in recovery from disasters through its disaster  assistance program.", "Because these agencies were a nonrandom selection, the results cannot be  generalized to other federal agencies. For each of the three agencies, we  analyzed the selected agencies\u2019 recipient guidance for their funding  recipients, their LEP plans and language access policies, and their  strategic and human capital plans, and interviewed agency officials  responsible for implementing the Executive Order.", "To review DOJ\u2019s and the three selected agencies\u2019 collaborative efforts, we  reviewed DOJ, IRS, FEMA, and SBA documentation of these efforts and  compared those programs with practices that we have identified that  enhance collaboration. Additionally, we interviewed officials who  participate in interagency language groups and programs as well as  officials from the selected agencies that collaborate with other agencies.  To examine additional opportunities for collaboration, we interviewed  officials from the National Virtual Translation Center (NVTC), created by  statute and housed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which makes  translation services available to 15 federal intelligence agencies on an as  needed basis.", "To observe the agencies\u2019 language access services and collaborative  efforts and to obtain views of agency officials who interact directly with  LEP persons, we interviewed IRS, FEMA, and SBA officials in California,  Georgia, Louisiana, North Dakota, Texas, Washington, and Washington,  D.C. We selected these states because of the nature and significance of  agencies\u2019 field office interaction with LEP persons and the diversity of the  LEP populations in these locations.", "In addition to this report, we have recently issued other reports addressing  the federal government\u2019s foreign language capabilities. These reports  cover several federal agencies\u2019 efforts, including the Department of  Transportation\u2019s efforts to serve their LEP customers; Health and Human  Services\u2019s (HHS) Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services translation of  documents and HHS\u2019s Child Care Bureau process for sharing information  to improve access to LEP families; services for English language learners  administered by the Departments of Education, Labor, HHS, and National  Institute for Literacy; and the foreign language capabilities of the  Department of Defense and the Department of State. A list of these related  GAO products is provided at the end of this report. Together, these reports  provide a broad perspective on the extent to which the federal government  is developing the necessary foreign language capabilities and cultural  sensitivities to face the nation\u2019s emerging foreign language challenges.", "Because these reports broadly cover federal agencies capabilities and  recipient issues, we excluded these agencies from this review.

While the Executive Order does not prescribe specific  approaches to language access services, it does require federal agencies to  prepare plans (referred to as LEP plans) outlining the steps they will take  to ensure that eligible LEP persons can access their programs and  activities. According to DOJ, these LEP plans are important because they  outline the steps agencies will take to ensure that eligible LEP persons can  access federal programs and activities.", "Federal agencies that provide financial assistance to state, local, or  regional programs and services are also required to develop guidance  (referred to as recipient guidance) that clarifies the funding recipients\u2019  obligations under Title VI. Rather than express uniform rules of  compliance, DOJ\u2019s guidance incorporates \u201creasonableness\u201d as its guiding  principle by suggesting agencies assess their programs, services, or  activities using four factors: (1) the number or proportion of LEP persons  eligible to be served or likely to be encountered by the program or  recipient; (2) the frequency with which LEP persons come in contact with  the program; (3) the nature and importance to people\u2019s lives of the  program, activity, or service provided by the recipient; and (4) the  resources available to the recipient and the costs of language access  services. By instructing agencies to use this four-factor analysis, DOJ\u2019s  guidance intends to create a balance between ensuring meaningful access  to critical services for LEP persons and not imposing undue burdens on  federal agencies or the small businesses, local governments, or nonprofits  that may be receiving federal assistance.", "The Executive Order required agencies to develop and implement their  LEP plans by December 11, 2000. Agencies were required to send copies of  their LEP plans to the Coordination and Review Section (COR) of DOJ\u2019s  Civil Rights Division, which is responsible for serving as a central  repository for agencies\u2019 plans. Additionally, COR is responsible for  providing technical assistance to federal agencies in developing LEP plans  and recipient guidance. Agencies\u2019 recipient guidance was to be submitted  to DOJ for review and approval by December 11, 2000. Following DOJ\u2019s  approval, each agency was required to publish its recipient guidance in the  Federal Register for public comment.

The Executive Order does not  assign DOJ the responsibility for ensuring agencies complete recipient  guidance or LEP plans. Rather, under the Executive Order, executive  branch agencies are responsible for determining the need to develop  recipient guidance based on whether they provide financial assistance to  entities that provide federal services to LEP populations. Likewise,  agencies are responsible for determining if they must draft LEP plans by  assessing whether they have frequent or significant contact with LEP  persons. If an agency determines that it is not required to draft recipient  guidance, an LEP plan, or both, the agency is not required to report that  determination to DOJ. DOJ has, however, provided technical assistance in  many of these determinations and issued numerous reminders to agencies  regarding their responsibilities under the Executive Order. For example,  on November 12, 2002, the Civil Rights Division issued a memorandum to  heads of federal agencies, general counsels, and civil rights directors.  Section II of that memorandum asks that each federal agency draft or  update LEP plans and urged each agency to place a copy of that plan on its  Web site and provide COR with the link so that it could be placed on  LEP.gov. Other DOJ letters, speeches, and memoranda have encouraged  agencies to publish recipient guidance and to issue or update LEP plans.", "Although the Executive Order requires agencies\u2019 recipient guidance to be  placed in the Federal Register for public comment, there is no similar  requirement that agencies make their LEP plans publicly available. Rather,  DOJ officials stated that, while it has encouraged agencies to post LEP  plans and provide links to those plans on LEP.gov, agencies are given the  discretion to make their LEP plans public.

Additionally, on December 8, 2009,  OMB issued a memo directing agency heads to promote transparency and  accountability by providing the public timely access to information on the  activities of federal agencies. As such, publicly available LEP plans could  help ensure that federal agencies appropriately focus on the needs of LEP  communities by enhancing the transparency of agencies\u2019 efforts and  allowing for stakeholder scrutiny.

Our prior work has found that by collaborating on crosscutting issues,  federal agencies are able to deliver results more efficiently than when  acting alone. As part of that effort, we have identified practices that  agencies can employ to improve their collaboration. Of these practices,  we found the following four practices applicable to agencies\u2019 efforts to  improve language access services:    Define and articulate a common outcome through identifying a  compelling rationale for agencies to collaborate;    Establish mutually reinforcing or joint strategies by aligning agencies\u2019  activities, core processes, and resources to accomplish the common  outcome;    Agree on roles and responsibilities, including how the collaborative  effort will be led, clarifying who will do what, organizing their joint and  individual efforts, and facilitating decision making; and  Identify and address needs by leveraging each others\u2019 resources, thus  obtaining additional benefits that would not be available if agencies  were working separately.", "Our work found that these collaboration practices are employed by the  Federal Interagency Working Group on LEP, a network of federal agencies  established in 2002 by DOJ to help foster governmentwide collaboration  for serving LEP communities. The working group\u2019s invitation list includes  46 different federal agencies. DOJ estimates that approximately 24 federal  agencies participate actively.

The group\u2019s mission is to build awareness  of the needs and methods for ensuring that LEP persons have meaningful  access to federal and federally funded programs and activities.", "The working group meets approximately twice a year to discuss topics  such as language access services in emergency preparedness, promising  practices in a variety of contexts, enforcement, and other cross-cutting  language access issues. The working group also consists of committees  that meet on a more frequent basis to work on various implementation  issues. The working group\u2019s Federally Conducted Committee, for example,  developed a guide of suggested practices for implementing language  access services based on a survey it administered to federal agencies. In  addition, the working group convenes larger conferences covering a  broader range of issues, such as stakeholder partnerships, dealing with  limited budgetary resources, and leveraging technology. COR coordinates  these meetings, committees, and conferences.", "The working group and its committees have sought to improve access for  LEP populations by promoting collaboration among federal agencies and  state and local government entities. These efforts include sharing  information through the production and distribution of informational  brochures and videos as well as surveying federal agencies about their  initiatives to improve access for LEP persons. Additionally, the working  group has sought to increase understanding and dissemination of language  data from the U.S. Census Bureau and to strengthen enforcement efforts.  According to DOJ officials, the working group reports that their efforts  have improved inter-agency understanding of LEP issues, and in some  cases, have helped to keep the implementation of the Executive Order and  language access services a priority within agencies.", "The working group\u2019s Web site, www.LEP.gov, which is maintained by  COR, shares the information it has collected and the practices it has  developed. The Web site includes information on Executive Order 13166, a  list of links to agency recipient guidance, as well as some of the published  LEP plans that agencies have sent to DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division. Agencies  are able to share and learn from the information available on the LEP Web  site and the site can be used as a resource by other agencies or  organizations when creating their own LEP plans and recipient guidance.  Moreover, the Web site posts best practices, planning and technical  assistance tools, other tools and samples, and links to resources on topics  such as interpretation, translation, and civil rights. For example, the  general planning and technical assistance tools include information on  how to access census data, a selection of census data on LEP populations  by state, and an introduction to choosing language service providers,  among other information. These efforts to share information have assisted  agencies in addressing the executive order and in providing meaningful  access to LEP populations. The Federally Conducted Committee has  considered building upon these efforts by exploring the possibility of  sharing resources among agencies, which is not currently done by the  members of the working group. According to an official from the working  group, the committee has discussed the possible benefits of creating an  entity that would allow federal agencies to share translation and  interpretation services as well as services for training translators and  interpreters.", "In addition to these efforts to share information, the working group has  begun exploring how agencies might share resources to improve access to  federal programs and services by LEP persons. Our prior work has  examined how federal agencies have shared resources for various support  services, such as human resource management, financial management,  and other administrative services. A shared services approach enables  agencies to leverage their resources by allowing multiple agencies to use  the same service provider to meet a common need rather than each agency  individually identifying and managing those services. Moreover, we have  also found that this approach holds promise for enhancing the economy  and efficiency of federal operations in an environment of increasingly  constrained federal resources."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selected Agencies Have Collaborated on LEP Access During Disaster Recovery", "paragraphs": ["Efforts at the Disaster Recovery Centers (DRC) demonstrate the four  applicable collaboration practices.

A third example is the use of a shared services  approach, which is used to leverage foreign language capabilities among  the federal intelligence community. The National Virtual Translation  Center (NVTC), created by statute and housed by the Federal Bureau of  Investigation, makes translation services available to 15 federal  intelligence agencies on an as needed basis. Intelligence agencies  requiring linguists in critical foreign language skills, such as Arabic or  Somali, may use NVTC\u2019s services through reimbursable agreements or  military payment arrangements. NVTC uses independent contractor  linguists with security clearances to provide these translation services. To  reduce costs, these contractors work from locations across the country,  either from their homes or nearby government offices. Documents needing  translation are distributed to the contractors via secure channels. Rather  than each agency expanding its own workforce to include additional  translators with critical foreign language capabilities, this collaborative  effort enables the intelligence community to share these capabilities more  efficiently while meeting the demands of their missions. Although the  NVTC illustrates a possible shared services approach for providing  translation services among domestic agencies, this approach may be  limited due to the technical nature of some of the documents needing  translation, such as IRS\u2019s tax forms and instructions.

Furthermore, although not required by the Executive Order, publicly  available LEP plans could provide LEP communities and other  stakeholders the opportunity to review agencies\u2019 strategies for improving  access to federal programs and activities by LEP persons. By increasing  the transparency of these LEP plans, agencies could obtain additional  feedback from stakeholders on potential improvements to their efforts for  serving LEP persons.", "Aside from the preparation of their LEP plans and recipient guidance, we  identified other opportunities to improve how the three selected agencies  implement the Executive Order. For example, assessing the needs of LEP  persons is integral to understanding the demand for services, and can be  effective when needs assessment incorporates diverse strategies. Both IRS  and FEMA conduct needs assessments that profile LEP persons at a  national and local level. In regard to SBA, because it does not conduct a  systematic needs assessment, the agency cannot determine if offices and  funding recipients are fully meeting the needs of LEP persons.", "Unlike IRS, FEMA has not developed criteria for determining which of its  documents are vital. Translating vital documents would ensure that LEP  persons can have meaningful access to federal programs and services.  Implementing a policy for classifying documents considered vital might  include criteria for translating documents, including regularly assessing  the language needs of the populations frequently encountered or  potentially affected by the program or activity. Additionally, the policy  could include a process for ensuring that the FEMA office responsible for  managing language access services has complete and accurate information  about the agency\u2019s efforts to translate documents classified as vital.", "With respect to monitoring their efforts, while TAS collects limited  information on its service provisions, it could take additional steps to  collect more comprehensive and verifiable data to identify opportunities  to improve service delivery. By collecting and using more comprehensive  data as part of the existing data collection efforts, TAS will be better  positioned to ensure that the local taxpayer advocate offices are not  missing LEP populations in their jurisdictions or inadequately addressing  the needs of existing LEP populations. TAS may want to assess whether it  would be beneficial to collect this data from its funding recipients to  identify potential improvements to the services provided to LEP persons.  The limited information that FEMA collects from internal and external  stakeholders after completing disaster response and recovery activities is  not systematic enough to substantively improve current activities. SBA  does not monitor or evaluate its services to LEP populations.

Furthermore, the DHS stated that its Office of Civil Rights and  Civil Liberties has assumed responsibility for completing the agency\u2019s LEP  plan and will collaborate with FEMA to develop criteria for determining  what documents should be translated and the mechanism to be used for  monitoring and evaluating services to LEP populations.", "Although the IRS/Taxpayer Advocate Service agreed with our  recommendation that the Taxpayer Advocate Service determine whether  any potential service improvements could be derived from requiring Low  Income Taxpayer Clinics collect more detail data on LEP populations they  serve, the IRS/Taxpayer Advocate Service stated that the Low Income  Taxpayer Clinics lack resources to collect detailed data on the LEP  populations that they serve.", "SBA agrees with our recommendations to finalize and issue its recipient  guidance and LEP plan and conduct a national needs assessment.  SBA  stated that it is initiating actions to implement the recommendations and  provide more meaningful access to SBA\u2019s LEP populations.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretaries of the Departments  of Homeland Security and Justice, the Commissioner of the Internal  Revenue Service, Administrators of the Federal Emergency Management  Agency and the Small Business Administration and other interested  parties.

We also reviewed the requirements of the Executive Order and DOJ\u2019s  guidance and interviewed DOJ officials regarding the technical advice they  provided to federal agencies on preparing recipient guidance and LEP  plans. We assessed whether the selected agencies implemented four  elements discussed in the DOJ guidance, specifically (1) agency  commitment, (2) needs assessment, (3) service delivery, and (4)  monitoring. These elements were assessed as to whether they were  implemented, partially implemented, or not implemented. For example, an  agency would be assessed as having implemented the \u201cagency  commitment\u201d element if it had completed its recipient guidance and/or  LEP plan and had incorporated services to LEP populations into its agency  mission, strategic plans, processes, and resource allocation. Additionally,  if its recipient guidance and/or LEP plan had not been formalized and/or it  had not integrated its language access efforts into all aspects of its plans,  processes, or resources, the agency would be assessed as having partially  implemented the agency commitment element. An agency would be  assessed as not implementing this element if it had taken no actions or  minimal actions to address the element.", "To assess how specific federal agencies have implemented the Executive  Order, this review, we considered federal agencies based on the amount  and significance of agency interaction with LEP populations, the types of  services provided, agency size, agency mission, the status of each agency\u2019s  LEP plan and/or recipient guidance, and the diversity of LEP populations  served. To avoid duplication, we also coordinated our selection of  agencies with work being conducted by other GAO teams in this area.  Based on these criteria, we selected the IRS, FEMA, and SBA, as agencies  that would provide a broad perspective on how a diverse group of  agencies are addressing the Executive Order.", "To review the extent to which these three agencies implemented  Executive Order 13166 consistent with DOJ\u2019s guidance, we reviewed and  analyzed the Executive Order, DOJ\u2019s guidance, the agencies\u2019 LEP plans  and recipient guidance, and agencies\u2019 language access plans. The  information contained in these documents explained the agencies\u2019  strategies for providing access to their programs and services. To better  understand the agencywide language access policies and standard  operating procedures for providing language assistance services to LEP  populations, we also interviewed headquarters officials to obtain an  understanding of the process used to develop recipient guidance and LEP  plans for agencies and their components.", "To determine how the selected agencies provide services to LEP  populations, we interviewed senior officials at the three agencies\u2019  headquarters who were responsible for implementation of LEP plans and  recipient guidance, such as civil rights officers, disaster assistance staff,  and individuals responsible for providing language access services. We  also conducted field visits at agency locations described below to observe  the agencies\u2019 language assistance services and to obtain views of agency  officials who interact directly with LEP persons. In consultation with  senior agency officials responsible for language assistance services, we  chose our field site visits based on opportunity to see direct service being  provided to LEP persons.", "To examine how IRS provides direct service to LEP populations, we  visited IRS Call Centers, Taxpayer Assistance Centers, Low Income Tax  Clinics and Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Centers in Atlanta, Georgia;  Austin, Texas; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Los Angeles, California. We  also visited Taxpayer Advocate Service locations in Atlanta and New  Orleans. We interviewed staff in the Los Angeles local taxpayer advocate  service office on the phone.", "To examine how FEMA serves LEP populations in disasters, how that  process has changed, and what lessons could be applied to future  disasters, we included past and current disasters in different phases of  recovery. We visited the Louisiana Transitional Recovery Office in New  Orleans, Louisiana (for information regarding Hurricane Katrina in 2005);  and Joint Field Offices in Austin, Texas (for information regarding  Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008); and Bismarck, North Dakota (for  information regarding the North Dakota floods of 2009).", "To examine how SBA provides access to its programs and services for LEP  populations, we visited Women\u2019s Business Centers and Small Business  Development Centers in Atlanta, Georgia, and New Orleans. We spoke to  Pacific Asian Consortium Employment (PACE) in Los Angeles, California  on the phone. In addition, we visited SBA\u2019s Office of Disaster Assistance,  which is co-located with FEMA\u2019s joint field offices in Austin and Bismarck.", "To assess ongoing collaborative efforts to support and improve agencies\u2019  language access services, we reviewed selected agency documentation of  these efforts and compared the efforts with GAO-identified practices that  help sustain and enhance collaboration. In short, GAO\u2019s practices that  enhance and sustain collaboration are:    define and articulate common outcomes;  establish mutually reinforcing or joint strategies;  identify and address needs by leveraging resources; agree on roles and  responsibilities;  establish compatible policies, procedures, and other means to operate  across agency boundaries;    develop mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on results;   reinforce agency accountability for collaborative efforts; and   reinforce individual accountability for collaborative efforts.", "For the purpose of this review, we focused on the practices that were most  applicable to federal agencies seeking to collaborate on providing  language access services to LEP persons and communities. As such, we  selected the following four of the eight collaboration practices as criteria  for this review:    Define and articulate a common outcome through identifying a  compelling rationale for agencies to collaborate;    Establish mutually reinforcing or joint strategies by aligning agencies\u2019  activities, core processes, and resources to accomplish the common  outcome;    Agree on roles and responsibilities, including how the collaborative  effort will be led, clarifying who will do what, organizing their joint and  individual efforts, and facilitating decision making; and  Identify and address needs by leveraging each others\u2019 resources, thus  obtaining additional benefits that would not be available if agencies  were working separately.", "Additionally, we interviewed officials who convene interagency language  groups and officials from the selected agencies that participate in those  efforts, specifically senior officials of the Federal Interagency Working  Group. During interviews with officials from DOJ\u2019s Coordination and  Review Section, we sought suggestions for other federal entities involved  with acquiring and maintaining foreign language capabilities. DOJ officials  suggested that we interview the Director of the National Virtual  Translation Center to gain an understanding of how the intelligence  agencies collaborate and leverage foreign language capabilities for a  common goal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the U.S. Small Business Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Steven Lozano and Kisha Clark managed this engagement.
