We supplemented the information from the survey with discussions with VA officials and community and state veterans nursing home administrators. Also, we reviewed cost reports to identify the relative costs to VA for each type of nursing facility, previous studies on nursing home costs and quality, and VA policies and procedures on monitoring nursing home care and cost reporting. In addition, we visited 2 VA, 10 community, and 5 state veterans nursing homes. Our review team included a registered nurse (RN) who interviewed nursing home personnel and reviewed the care provided to 95 veterans in the facilities we visited drawing on Medicare provider certification and survey procedures. The patients were randomly selected to be a representative sample from the VA and state veterans nursing homes.

VA also pays a portion of the cost of care for veterans served in state veterans nursing homes. Because most veterans receive care financed through other government programs (Medicare or Medicaid), private insurance, or personal assets, however, these VA programs provide only a portion of the nursing home care that veterans receive.", "VA serves veterans essentially on a first-come, first-served basis up to the limits of VA\u2019s budget authority for nursing home care. VA is authorized to pay for care in community nursing homes for a period generally not longer than 6 months for nonservice-connected veterans and for an indefinite period for veterans with service-connected conditions. No maximum service period exists, and only higher income, nonservice-connected veterans must contribute to the cost of their care in VA nursing homes. State veterans homes establish their own admissions policy, and, although they receive per diem payments from VA, state homes generally rely on patient cost sharing to help cover expenses. VA operates 129 VA nursing homes (in 45 states), contracts with 3,766 community nursing homes (in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico), and pays a portion of the costs for veterans served in 80 state veterans homes (in 38 states).", "Obligations for VA and state veterans nursing homes have increased each year from 1985 through 1995; obligations for community nursing homes have fluctuated over the same period.

The patient distribution goal is 30 percent in VA nursing homes, 40 percent in community homes, and 30 percent in state veterans homes.", "Management of nursing home resources in VA is changing with the reorganization of the VA health care system. The reorganization involves trimming unnecessary management layers, consolidating medical services, and using more community resources. Called the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN), the reorganized VA health care system will be administered and provided through 22 local network service areas and encompass the assessment, planning, and budgeting aspects of providing VA nursing home care in each service area. Implementation of the VISN will shift nursing home resource management decisions from individual VA medical centers to VISN directors.

Appendix I shows, by state, the number of nursing homes that VA uses and the average daily census by each type of facility in fiscal year 1995.", "The distribution pattern has also shifted considerably over the years. In fiscal year 1985, for example, about 40 percent of veterans (figure based on the average daily census) receiving VA-financed or -provided nursing home care were cared for in community nursing homes. Also, VA\u2019s average daily census in community nursing homes was over 3,000 patients greater in 1985 than in 1995. Figure 2 shows the average daily census in the three types of nursing homes from fiscal years 1985 through 1995.", "The distribution shift was the result of major reductions in expenditures for community nursing homes that occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s. For example, in 1989 VA delegated community nursing home budget decisions to VA medical centers. Some medical center directors left their programs intact, while others used community nursing home funds for other medical center activities. Most community nursing home programs shrank considerably. According to a VA official, in fiscal year 1990, VA reversed its decision to delegate budget authority to medical centers because VA medical centers did not support the community nursing home program. VA\u2019s use of community nursing homes has not returned to pre-1989 levels, however. From fiscal years 1988 to 1993, the average number of community nursing homes under contract to each VA medical center decreased from 24 to 21, and the average number of veterans placed in community homes by each VA medical center decreased from 183 to 129.", "Community nursing home funds have also been used to meet VA budget emergencies and to fund VA-sponsored noninstitutional care programs. According to VA budget documents, in fiscal year 1992, $35 million of VA\u2019s community nursing home program budget was reprogrammed to meet the increased costs of special pay rates for physicians and dentists. According to a VA official, the reprogramming of these funds was cleared by OMB and VA appropriations committees. Also, in fiscal year 1993, VA\u2019s Homemaker and Day Care programs, alternatives to institutional care, began to share community nursing home budget resources.

Actual costs are unknown, however, because VA data systems neither reflect all costs nor captured all costs in a consistent way to make accurate cost comparisons.", "We have reported that VA\u2019s cost accounting system distributes costs inconsistently and is generally not reliable as a source for precisely comparing VA program costs. We have also noted that VA cost reports are not subject to audit and rely on each medical center to determine the distribution of costs among different activities. VA budget and program officials we contacted recognize that cost reports do not provide useful, reliable cost information.", "Because decisions on staff allocation costs and, in some cases, workload are made at the facility level, data are inconsistent among facilities. For example, VA\u2019s cost data do not include the cost of all services provided to community nursing home patients by VA medical centers, such as radiology and laboratory services, clinical visits, and medications. In addition, VA\u2019s costs for transporting veterans between community nursing homes and VA medical centers for treatment are generally excluded from VA\u2019s cost data for community homes. The inconsistent distribution of costs among VA cost centers leads to both overallocation and underallocation of overhead and variable costs (such as laundry, linen, janitorial, and administrative services) to VA nursing home units. Information was not available to determine the overall effect of cost distribution inconsistencies on VA nursing home daily costs.", "Factors that contribute to cost differences between VA and community nursing homes include patient case mix differences and more intensive staffing patterns in VA homes than in community nursing homes. For example, VA\u2019s Nursing Home Cost Study issued in August 1996 reported that among patients sampled as of October 1, 1995, about 16 percent of VA nursing home patients were in a heavy care category requiring special rehabilitation services (thus requiring more care and higher costs) compared with 3 percent of community nursing home patients. Conversely, more community nursing home patients were in a less resource-demanding category\u201422 percent for community nursing home patients compared with 17 percent for VA nursing home patients.", "The study also noted that VA nursing homes have an overall higher level of staffing than community nursing homes (.69 patient care personnel per resident at VA facilities compared with .58 at community nursing homes) and that facilities have different types of staff.

Aides, on the other hand, make up 67 percent of the staff at community nursing homes but only 32 percent of the staff at VA facilities.", "In July 1995, VA began implementing a decision support system (DSS) at 38 hospitals. Current VA plans call for the deployment of DSS to all VA hospitals by fiscal year 1998. Such support systems in the private sector have proved to be an effective management tool for improving quality and cost- effectiveness, and VA expects DSS to do the same for its health care operations. DSS can compute the cost of services provided to each patient by combining patient-based information on services provided with financial information on the costs and revenue associated with those services. VA expects DSS to provide VA managers and health care providers with variance reports identifying areas for reducing costs and improving patient outcomes and clinical processes.", "In a September 1995 report on the implementation of DSS, we noted that VA had not developed a business strategy for effectively using DSS as a management tool. We also noted that VA had not yet developed business goals and associated plans to guide the organization, determine the proper location and use of resources, and provide a framework for using management tools such as DSS. VA is developing business plans that should be completed by December 1996. For example, one VISN work group charged with developing the network\u2019s long-term care business plan was directed by the VISN leadership to consider consolidating, contracting, or closing of all VA nursing homes in the service area.

VA has several initiatives under way to improve its access to community nursing home beds by improving the competitiveness of its rates but needs better information on specific locations where rate adjustments would be appropriate.

According to a 1996 study by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), Nursing Staff in Hospitals and Nursing Homes, the demand for nursing home services continues to grow as the number of aged and chronically ill people increases. IOM reported that in most areas of the country, the demand for nursing home services has surpassed the supply of beds, especially in relation to the growth in the oldest of the elderly population. In 1990, the United States had approximately 32 million people aged 65 years or older. This number is projected to double by 2030. The number of elderly needing nursing home care is expected to triple from about 1.8 million in 1990 to about 5.3 million in 2030. The median occupancy rate for U.S. nursing facilities was about 93 percent in 1994, the most current year for which data were available.", "As demand for nursing home resources grows, VA\u2019s access to community nursing home beds varies by community. VA has identified seven geographic areas where it has problems securing community nursing home beds: California, the District of Columbia, Florida, New Hampshire, New York, South Carolina, and Virginia. In other parts of the country, though, VA does not appear to have such problems. According to our questionnaire respondents, for example, the availability of community nursing home beds in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Kansas City, Missouri, exceeded the number of veterans needing beds. A VA planning official in Salt Lake City, Utah, also mentioned that this service area has always had a large number of community nursing home beds available.", "To make informed nursing home resource management decisions, VA needs reliable demand and capacity data. The VA Inspector General and we have criticized VA for consistently undercounting available community beds and not basing its nursing home construction or expansion projects on reliable data. VA has in fact overstated its nursing home construction needs. For example, we noted in August 1995 that VA\u2019s planned conversion of the former Orlando Naval Hospital to a nursing home and the construction of a new hospital and nursing home in Brevard County were not the most prudent and economical uses of its resources. Furthermore, we noted that VA could purchase care from community nursing homes to meet veterans\u2019 needs more conveniently and at a lower cost.", "The VA Inspector General noted in 1994 that regional planners had excluded suitable and available community nursing home beds and used questionable community data in needs assessments.

This rate is intended to cover all necessary services, both routine daily services (room, board, and nursing services) and special and ancillary services (primary and specialty physician services, diagnostic tests, and equipment). The rate is based on each state\u2019s daily Medicaid rate for basic nursing home care, plus an additional 15 percent. VA medical centers may negotiate with community nursing homes to provide higher reimbursements for extra care cases (that is, costly special and ancillary services).", "Other payers, such as private insurers, Medicare, and Medicaid, generally do not reimburse community nursing homes on a daily-rate basis. The nursing home market generally reimburses on a unit-of-service basis. For example, the Medicaid program allows providers to bill for medical services, such as physician care and diagnostic tests, on a unit-of-service basis.", "In some communities, VA reimbursements are not competitive with other payers. Community nursing home administrators in the facilities we visited informed us that VA was not paying what was necessary to care for some veterans, particularly those patients with heavy care needs. For example, an administrator of a Salt Lake City home indicated that although VA\u2019s contract rate is adequate for most patients, it is inadequate for patients on intravenous or feeding tubes. Another administrator in Richmond, Virginia, indicated that although the nursing home has the capacity to admit additional veterans, it would turn away veterans requiring heavy care involving high treatment costs because VA\u2019s reimbursement is inadequate. Nursing home administrators and VA questionnaire respondents told us that veterans with behavioral problems, alcohol or drug dependencies, or conditions requiring the use of a ventilator were most likely to be refused admission to a community nursing home.", "Nursing home administrators said that they make trade-offs between serving veterans at potentially lower reimbursement rates and serving private pay, Medicare, and Medicaid patients whose ancillary service costs can be billed separately. The 1993 National Survey of VA Community Nursing Home Program Practices conducted by VA\u2019s Midwest Center for Health Services and Policy Research noted that only 29 percent of VA medical centers indicated that the Medicaid plus 15 percent reimbursement rate was adequate to cover community nursing home costs in their area.", "VA policy allows medical centers to negotiate reimbursement rates higher than the standard Medicaid plus 15 percent rate, and VA\u2019s May 1995 Evaluation of the Enhanced Prospective Payment System noted that 20 percent of community nursing homes were paid higher rates. Some VA medical centers do not pursue higher rates because negotiating contracts is burdensome and obtaining approval for such rates from the VA regional level sometimes takes 2 to 4 months. The study concluded that these increasingly difficult negotiations sometimes soured relations with community nursing homes. As a result of the study, VA changed its policy on community nursing home rate exceptions, allowing local VA medical center director approval, except for subacute care.", "In addition, VA is a small purchaser of nursing home care in most markets, providing little incentive for nursing homes to engage in lengthy negotiations. For example, in May 1995, VA\u2019s Management Decision and Research Center noted that no veterans were placed in one-quarter to one-third of the community nursing homes with which VA had contracts during fiscal years 1988 through 1994.

Multistate contracting is intended to enhance VA\u2019s ability to access beds by easing the administrative requirements on community nursing homes and offering prospective providers a large volume of patients. VA plans to commit $34 million to these contracts or about 10 percent of the community nursing home program budget. The multistate contracts specifically guarantee access for veterans up to the amount specified in the contracts.", "VA awarded six multistate contracts to private corporations on September 1, 1996, and also contracted with a provider with 20 facilities in California. The new contracts will provide VA access to 1,101 nursing homes in 43 states, and VA believes the contracts offer administrative and other cost efficiencies. Each corporation will provide five levels of care based on a state-specific pricing structure designed to achieve cost savings over the life of the contract.", "Since 1991, VA has also been pilot testing a prospective payment system based on Medicare reimbursement rates. EPPS, implemented in 8 of VA\u2019s 164 medical centers with nursing homes or contracts with community nursing homes, provides three levels of reimbursement\u2014superskilled, skilled, and intermediate-level care. Ancillary costs are also included in these rates, but speech, physical, and occupational therapies are reimbursed separately using rates established by VA\u2019s central office. A 1995 study by VA\u2019s Management Decision and Research Center estimated that the pilot system reimbursed nursing homes $3,402 more per patient than VA\u2019s normal reimbursement system. However, while data limitations made it inconclusive, the study suggested that these added costs were outweighed by savings to VA medical centers from moving patients from the hospital sooner to nursing homes, which provide a lower (and less expensive) level of care.", "VA will use the findings of the EPPS evaluation to collect information on nursing home market conditions and hospital utilization to determine whether special efforts are needed to become more competitive in community nursing home markets. VA medical centers may qualify to participate by meeting certain criteria based on cost, access, and administrative workload considerations. For example, medical centers will be allowed to participate if more than 50 percent of their community nursing home contracts require exceptions to the Medicaid plus 15 percent reimbursement rate. Other participation criteria include the inability to place more than 5 percent of patients who are considered appropriate for nursing home placement and a caseload that includes more than 50 percent of patients who need specialized care and require special negotiations before placement.", "In June 1995, VA changed its standard nursing home contract to provide for multiple reimbursement rates. These rates include the following categories of care: (1) reduced physical function, (2) basic, (3) heavy rehabilitation therapy, (4) special care, (5) clinically complex, (6) ventilator dependent, (7) human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and (8) Clinitron dependent. Rates are figured using the current Medicaid rate plus an amount to cover the use of additional supplies, services, and equipment associated with each category of care.", "Although these initiatives should improve VA\u2019s access to community nursing home beds, VA needs reliable information on the availability of community nursing home beds and the reasons for access problems in specific locations to make informed decisions about where adjustments to reimbursement rates are warranted. Without information on the reasons for access problems in specific locations, assertions of noncompetitive VA reimbursement rates could obscure medical center preferences for using VA nursing homes. Some of the information available is anecdotal and based on testimonial rather than quantitative evidence. For example, a 1993 VA Inspector General report on the EPPS pilots noted that two sites reported that the pilot rates were too high for their area, though the pilot sites had been selected because they had reported difficulty accessing community nursing home beds.

As VA implements the VISN structure, decisionmakers will need better cost- and care-based information on the nursing home services it provides or purchases.", "VA\u2019s implementation of multistate contracts and efforts to improve the competitiveness of its reimbursement rates should improve its access to community nursing home beds. VA\u2019s efforts to more accurately identify and report nursing home costs through DSS are incomplete.

The VA officials stated that the report complements VA\u2019s efforts to review options for providing long-term care for veterans and concurred with our findings and recommendations. VA is currently rethinking its nursing home patient distribution goals for the three types of facilities and is also considering greater emphasis on alternatives to long-term care for veterans such as home and community health care, day care, and other noninstitutional care options. To this end, VA has established an Advisory Committee on the Future of VA Long-Term Care, which will make recommendations to VA\u2019s Under Secretary for Health on the scope and structure of VHA\u2019s long-term care services and the changes necessary to ensure that services for veterans are available and effective in future health care settings. Committee members will be selected on the basis of professional expertise in various components of long-term care and will represent constituencies such as veterans service organizations, nursing home corporations, and university-based academic communities. VA expects recommendations from the committee in 1-1/2 to 2 years.", "VA agreed that its Cost Distribution Report is inadequate, and although better information on costs and local resources is available from data collected in conjunction with the new multistate contracts, VA still expects that full implementation of DSS will improve data on costs and patient outcomes. In addition, VISN networks have been provided a new population-based, long-term care planning model that is being used to develop network business plans.", "VA noted that it has initiated efforts to improve collection of data on community nursing home patients to compare their characteristics (including case mix) with VA nursing home patients. A Patient Assessment Instrument, now used for VA nursing home patients, will be applied to community nursing home patients and is currently used for patients referred to multistate contract facilities.
