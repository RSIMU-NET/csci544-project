GAO was asked to review what consumption in retirement looks like and how target replacement rates are developed.", "GAO examined (1) whether and how spending patterns vary by age, (2) key factors used to develop target replacement rates, and (3) the usefulness of information on such rates provided by DOL. GAO analyzed data from the BLS's 2013 Consumer Expenditure Survey, the most recent available; analyzed 59 articles and reports that discussed how to develop, calculate, or evaluate replacement rates; collected non-generalizable information from 14 retirement services firms and financial planners recommended by researchers and actuaries who have studied replacement rates; and reviewed DOL materials and interviewed officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Household spending patterns varied by age, with mid-career households (those aged 45-49) spending more than older households. For example, according to 2013 survey data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), mid-career households spent an estimated average of around $58,500, while young retiree households (those aged 65-69) spent about 20 percent less. While the share of spending was consistent for some categories, other categories had larger variations across age groups. For example, housing expenses comprised the largest share of spending regardless of age, while older households spent more out of pocket on health care than mid-career households. Spending was less variable across age for low-income households compared to other households. For example, there was not a significant difference in average spending between mid-career and young retiree households in the lowest income quartile, compared to an approximately $20,000 difference for the highest income quartile. These variations in spending patterns have implications for the resources households need to maintain their standard of living in retirement.", "Researchers and financial industry professionals develop target replacement rates\u2014the percentage of income to aim for in retirement\u2014 based on certain key factors, including spending, household characteristics, and pre-retirement earnings. GAO's analysis of the literature found that calculating an appropriate replacement rate can be complex. For example, there is debate over whether households that have raised children should target a lower replacement rate than households that have not. In addition, a worker's pre-retirement earnings could be defined as earnings at the end of the worker's career or as average earnings over the course of the career. Despite these complicated considerations, target replacement rates cited in the articles and reports GAO reviewed typically range between 70 and 85 percent. Some financial industry professionals told GAO that they develop customized targets that take into account workers' assets and expected spending, while others questioned the usefulness of replacement rates.", "The information and tools on replacement rates that the Department of Labor (DOL) provides may be too limited to help workers understand how to use such rates for retirement planning. DOL's Employee Benefits Security Administration's (EBSA) website provides information and tools to help American workers better plan for retirement, including a tool to help workers calculate their retirement income needs as a percentage of preretirement income. While EBSA's materials note that a target replacement rate can vary based on individual circumstances, they do not include specific examples of demographic groups that research indicates can result in higher or lower income replacement needs, or how much a replacement rate might need to be adjusted for those groups or for other individual circumstances. Without additional information, workers may not understand how to adjust target replacement rates when planning for retirement. Further, EBSA's worksheet and online tool for calculating how much to save use a default replacement rate with no opportunity for a user to adjust the rate based on individual circumstances.

In recent years, numerous studies on the  replacement rates that households should target have not resulted in a  consensus recommendation, in part because estimates are heavily  dependent on the underlying assumptions used to develop them. To  accurately interpret the implications for retirement adequacy it is  important for policy makers and individuals to better understand how  these targets are developed.", "You asked us to review what consumption looks like in retirement and  how replacement rates are defined, calculated, and used to assess  retirement preparedness.

The CE is a sample  survey designed to be representative of the total U.S. noninstitutionalized  civilian population and is used to collect data on consumers\u2019  characteristics and buying habits. We conducted a cross-sectional  analysis to see how spending patterns vary across different age groups.  We also conducted a regression analysis to understand how the effects of  age vary by spending category, such as health care and housing, and  household income level.

We  reviewed abstracts, when available, to identify which articles (1)  contained information on target replacement rates or assumptions  needed to calculate a replacement rate and (2) were published in or after  2005 in academic journals or by research centers or international  organizations. We determined 59 articles and reports met these criteria  and included them in our analysis. In addition, we used a questionnaire\u2014 coupled with interviews\u2014to assess whether financial firms use target  replacement rates and, if they do, what factors financial industry  professionals considered when developing these targets. To determine  which firms to contact, we relied on suggestions from several researchers  and actuaries who have studied replacement rates. In total, we collected  information from 14 firms\u20147 service providers, 3 retirement services  consulting firms, and 4 financial planners. While these firms provided  valuable insight into target replacement rate recommendations, our  findings are not generalizable to the full population of service providers,  retirement consulting firms, and financial planners.

Our analysis focused on total replacement rates\u2014the  ratio of all income in retirement (including Social Security, pension  benefits, and retirement savings) to pre-retirement earnings. We sought  to identify a number of considerations that researchers, policy makers,  and financial professionals incorporate into their assumptions when  developing, calculating, or evaluating target replacement rates.

In recent years,  employment-based retirement plan coverage, especially in the private  sector, has shifted from defined benefit to defined contribution plans.  Under \u201ctraditional\u201d defined benefit plans, workers typically receive  benefits\u2014based on factors such as salary and years of service\u2014in the  form of a lifetime annuity that provides a guaranteed monthly payment.  Defined benefit plans are, in most cases, financed by employers, who are  responsible for managing plan assets. Defined contribution plans and  IRAs are two primary types of retirement savings vehicles in which  benefits accrue in the form of account balances, which grow from  contributions made by workers (and sometimes by their employers) and  investment returns. Workers and employers who contribute to retirement  savings accounts generally receive favorable federal tax treatment, such  as tax deductions for contributions and tax-deferred or even tax-free  returns on investment. In addition to tax advantages, defined contribution  plans and IRAs provide portability of savings and transparency of known  account balances. However, they also place the primary responsibility on  individuals to participate in, contribute to, and manage their accounts  throughout their working careers. Moreover, individuals must manage  their savings throughout retirement, including deciding whether and how  to convert an account balance into an income stream, in order to avoid  running out of money.", "This shift in responsibility is further compounded by the low levels of  financial literacy in the United States. As we have previously reported,  numerous studies have found that many Americans lack basic financial  literacy, including an understanding of fundamental investment concepts,  such as the benefits of compounding interest and risk diversification and  the potential impact of inflation. We concluded that such basic financial  literacy is necessary for making well-informed decisions and evaluating  recommendations. Financial literacy research has also pointed to the  need to educate individuals to improve their investment decision-making  and savings outcomes. For example, one study found that a large  percentage of American workers has not conducted meaningful  retirement planning, even when retirement is in the near future. Another  study found that most workers acknowledge they do not know as much as  they should about retirement planning and that many workers actually  guessed at their retirement savings needs. Further, our past work has  found that ensuring income in retirement requires workers to make  difficult choices and that workers may not have sufficient information to  determine which choices are in their best interest.", "Many studies have evaluated the retirement readiness of workers and the  economic well-being of retirees. These studies have used a variety of  benchmarks for assessing retirement readiness or well-being, including  assorted measures of retirement saving, income, consumption, wealth,  and standard of living. Economists broadly agree that a conceptual  benchmark measure for adequate retirement saving is an amount that  will, along with other sources of retirement income, allow a household to  maintain its pre-retirement standard of living into retirement. A key  concept underlying such a measure is the lifecycle model of savings,  which suggests that individuals will adjust their saving and spending to  ensure a consistent level of consumption over their lifetime.", "Income replacement rates, measured as a percentage of pre-retirement  income, are one common method for analyzing the retirement readiness  of individuals and providing information to help individual workers plan for  retirement. Plan sponsors and researchers have long used them to  assess the adequacy of pension plan benefit levels. Replacement rates  can also show the extent to which individuals are able to replace their  pre-retirement earnings with other sources of income in retirement, such  as Social Security benefits, pension benefits, or retirement savings. While  there is no consensus about how much income is required to ensure a  stable standard of living, economists and financial planners generally  agree that many retirees do not need to replace 100 percent of their pre- retirement income to maintain their standard of living because most  retirees probably have reduced expenses relative to when they were  working. For example, spending on transportation may be reduced for  those who no longer need to commute to work. As a benchmark of how  much income will be needed in retirement, a target replacement rate can  help alert workers about how much to save as well as how long to work or  how much to spend. However, while a replacement rate provides an  individual with important information for developing a long-term savings  goal, it does not provide a plan for achieving it. Converting a target  replacement rate to a savings plan\u2014such as how much to set aside from  each paycheck\u2014over a number of years is a complicated exercise and  may prove daunting, especially in light of the limited financial literacy of  many Americans.", "DOL is responsible for providing guidance on retirement income savings  for workers.

We also analyzed spending across two broader  age groups: pre-retirement households (aged 50-64) and post-retirement  households (65-79) (see table 1). We found that the difference in  spending between broader age groups was similar to the comparison  between mid-career and young retiree households using 5-year age  groups.

The average household size for mid-career  households was about 2.9 people as compared to about 2.1 people for  young retiree households. The average household size was  approximately 1.7 people for mid-retirees and 1.5 people for older  retirees. Patterns in spending may also be affected by the age  composition of other members of the household. Lower spending for older  households could also be indicative of different priorities. For example,  one large relative difference in spending was attributable to the personal  insurance and pensions category. Mid-career households may be more  concerned with contributions toward retirement resources than older  households who could already be retired. Moreover, we found that in  2013, age groups varied in how much they spent, including on basic  needs, such as food, and non-essential items, such as entertainment.  Such fluctuations in spending have implications for the resources  households will need to maintain their standard of living.

More specifically,  young retiree households spent about 83 percent of the amount that mid- career households spent for housing, on average (see fig. 2). However,  the composition of homeowners varied widely by age group.

More specifically, the difference in average total  spending for low-income households between the mid-career and young  retiree age groups was not statistically significant, while the difference  across these same age groups was over $20,000 for the highest income  quartile.", "Though low-income households had much lower overall spending than  mid- or high-income levels, they spent a larger share on necessities like  housing and food, which could have implications for their respective  replacement rates.

In comparison, high-income  households in the same age group spent about $82,200, of which 31  percent was spent on housing and 12 percent on food. While spending  levels provide information on consumption, expenditures do not  necessarily equate to a household\u2019s level of consumption. For example, a  household could consume the same amount of food at different  expenditure levels based on the difference in cost between preparing  food at home versus eating out. Additionally, households may spend  money on goods they are not consuming themselves, such as charitable  contributions or gifts. Alternatively, some low-income families may receive  benefits from public assistance programs that allow for higher levels of  consumption than out-of-pocket spending indicates. For example,  households may be eligible for programs that offset some of the costs of  certain expenses, such as reduced-price school lunch or subsidized  housing.

According to the  articles and reports we reviewed, assumptions need to be made about  the direction and size of a number of expenses, including housing, health  care, entertainment, and consumer goods. For example, a retired  household may spend less on housing if it pays off a mortgage or  downsizes at retirement (see table 3). Alternatively, spending on housing  may increase if a retiree moves into specialized senior housing. The  amount a retired household will spend on health care may fluctuate  because health care costs can be variable and premiums and out-of- pocket medical costs may rise. Further, spending on entertainment and  consumer goods may also fluctuate, according to the articles and reports  we analyzed. Entertainment spending could increase because retirees  have more leisure time, or alternatively, it is possible that it decreases  due to the prevalence of entertainment-related senior discounts. In  addition, spending on consumer goods and services, such as ready-to- eat foods or car repairs, may be less in retirement than before because  retired households have more free time to engage in in-home production,  which includes activities like cooking and household chores and repairs.  Moreover, consumer durables purchased prior to retirement, such as  furniture or household appliances, may continue working well into  retirement and may not need to be replaced.", "Further, researchers make assumptions about why overall spending  might change in retirement and the role of socioeconomic status, or  income level, before retirement. For example, some researchers have  proposed that consumption, for which spending is a proxy, declines in  retirement and households are generally content with consuming less as  retirement progresses. Alternatively, households may aim to smooth their  consumption over their lifetime and, thus, the goal in retirement is to  maintain the same level of consumption or spending as prior to  retirement. Under this theory, households that spend less in retirement  may do so because of income constraints. Some researchers have  explored the role that socioeconomic status plays in determining target  replacement rates. They have found that targets may vary by income  level. Lower-income households may need a higher replacement rate  because they spend a relatively high proportion of their income on  nondiscretionary items, such as food. Theoretical perspectives about  spending could influence the assumptions used to calculate a target  replacement rate.", "Assumptions about households\u2019 tax liabilities also affect estimates of how  much income is needed to cover expenses in retirement, and target  replacement rates. Not only do tax liabilities vary across households, they  can also vary before and after retirement. For example, retirees may be in  a lower tax bracket after retirement.

For example, the presence of  children could also affect what a target replacement rate should be.  Researchers do not agree on how having had children affects a retired  household\u2019s income needs. According to some researchers, retirees will  focus on maintaining spending on themselves and will not need to replace  income that went toward their children\u2019s consumption. Further, some  researchers have hypothesized that after children move out, the  household will save more; and because the household saves more,  leaving less money to spend during its remaining working years, the  percentage of income that needs to be replaced in retirement is reduced.  On the other hand, other researchers have theorized that once children  move out, households may not actually consume less. Instead, the  parents may choose to use the money they had spent on their children on  themselves. Thus, the percentage of income needed to be replaced in  retirement may not be lower for retirees who had children versus those  who did not.", "However, household characteristics may not be static, making choosing a  target replacement rate even more complex. For example, spouses may  not retire at the same time.

Some of the  studies in our review developed different target rates for workers based  on earnings level before retirement. While these studies did not use the  same earnings-level groups, their conclusions were consistent.  Specifically, Aon Hewitt projected that workers earning under $30,000  would need a 98 percent replacement rate and that workers earning  $90,000 would need to replace 79 percent of their income. Lower  earners may need a higher replacement rate for three reasons. First, as  discussed earlier, they may spend a relatively high amount of their  income on non-discretionary items. Second, research has shown low- income households save less than higher-income households. Thus, the  reduction in saving in retirement will be less substantial for low-income  households and they may need a higher replacement rate. Third,  because low-income households pay little in taxes, they receive little in  the way of tax saving in retirement.", "In addition, how pre-retirement earnings are defined and calculated can  have important implications for target replacement rates. More  specifically, developers of target replacement rates must decide upon a  period of earnings to use (see table 5). Two options cited by the articles  and reports in our review are final average earnings and average  earnings over the course of a career. A final average earnings measure  uses the average of annual earnings for a period of time leading up to  retirement. Career average earnings measures, on the other hand, use  the average of annual earnings over the course of someone\u2019s career,  adjusted for inflation or wage growth. Furthermore, because different  definitions of earnings can affect the final target replacement rate, it is  important to understand how earnings were calculated and indexed. For  example, adding up separate replacement rates provided by defined  benefit plans and Social Security benefits to come up with a total  replacement rate may not be accurate if the two rates did not use the  same type of pre-retirement earnings or index these earnings the same  way.", "Other decisions may need to be made about how to account for work  histories or changes in earnings or phased retirement. For example,  women often have shorter careers than men. They tend to take a greater  number of breaks from the labor force to care for children and elderly  relatives. As a result, a replacement rate that uses career average  earnings could be distorted by these breaks. In addition, changes to  earnings late in a career can have a substantial effect on target  replacement rates if final average earnings are used to calculate pre- retirement income. Phased retirement could also change a target  replacement rate, depending on how it is incorporated into the calculation.  For example, if workers phase into retirement by reducing their hours and  earnings over a number of years, then using the average of the final 5  years of earnings could result in a much lower measure of pre-retirement  income than using career average earnings. Similarly, how retirement  income is defined can have implications for target replacement rate  recommendations.

The recommendations ranged from 43 to 476 percent of pre-retirement  income, with the majority of the references being between 70 and 85  percent of pre-retirement income; the median recommended target  replacement rate was 77 percent.", "Despite their inherent limitations, particular groups of workers may find  replacement rates to be a useful planning tool, making it important that  these groups receive clear information on replacement rate  recommendations, according to the articles and studies in our review. For  example, target replacement rates may be more useful for low- and  middle-income households in part because they are more likely to face  budget constraints in retirement and will likely need a higher replacement  rate compared to high-income households. Also, many individuals lack  basic financial knowledge, and lower- and middle-income individuals  scored lower on a recent national financial capability assessment.  Replacement rates may also be useful for younger individuals because  they can use a replacement rate as a metric to estimate if their projected  retirement savings are reasonable.", "Further, the 2011 MacDonald and Moore report concluded that the  replacement rate literature is becoming more sophisticated and capable  of providing better guidance. It found that incorporating some individual  characteristics\u2014such as income and family size\u2014could improve the  usefulness of replacement rate calculations. Customizable replacement  rates could be one alternative to universal target replacement rate  recommendations.

Given that variability, some  researchers have expressed concern that individuals may be unable to  identify tools that are relevant for their individual circumstances.

This document notes  that replacement rates might vary depending on an individual\u2019s  circumstances (see fig.5).", "The publication notes that no rule of thumb is appropriate for all  individuals and also includes information that some expenses may  change in retirement and descriptions of some lifestyle choices that may  affect how much income workers need to replace (see fig. 5). Despite  DOL\u2019s appropriate acknowledgement of such considerations, its  worksheet for calculating how much to save each year assumes a fixed  replacement rate of 80 percent. The worksheet assumes that Social  Security benefits will provide about 40 percent of pre-retirement income  and the remaining 40 percent would need to come from savings. While  the previous page explains that the replacement rate provided is an  estimate and the user may need more or less depending on their  circumstances, \u201cx .40\u201d is pre-printed in the worksheet for users to  calculate the amount of savings needed when they retire (see fig. 6).", "Similarly, in the interactive online version of Savings Fitness, the fixed  target replacement rate is coded into the calculation and cannot be  changed. DOL officials told us that they worked to balance accuracy with  simplicity by presenting information in a concise manner that will not  overwhelm users. Specifically, they said that they did not make the rate  adjustable in order to limit user flexibility and prevent too wide a range in  assumptions. They also indicated that they limited the information on  factors that could affect replacement rates to keep the document from  being too complex and cluttered. ERISA calls for DOL to provide on its  website \u201ca means for individuals to calculate their estimated retirement  savings needs based on their retirement income goal as a percentage of  their preretirement income\u201d. While the planning tool allows workers to  estimate their savings needs based on a percentage of their  preretirement income, they are constrained in setting an individual  retirement income goal as the replacement rate is preset by DOL. Without  the ability to adjust the replacement rate used in the tools, workers may  over- or under-estimate how much they need to save for retirement.", "In addition, the Savings Fitness explanations provided concerning the  replacement rate in the calculation do not include specific information on  demographic groups that studies suggest generally need higher or lower  replacement rates, such as low-income and single workers. For example,  one study found that the median optimal target replacement rate for  singles was 55 percent compared to 75 percent for married couples.  Also, we found no discussion in the EBSA materials about how much the  replacement rate provided might need to be adjusted for the examples of  circumstances that might affect an individual\u2019s desired replacement rate.  For instance, though it suggests that someone who wants to travel  extensively will need more money in retirement, there is no information on  how to adjust the replacement rate to account for such a situation. Such  information and guidance could help workers assess whether they need  to customize the rate used in their own calculations.", "Academic and industry-based researchers consistently state that there is  no one-size-fits-all target, and some note that averages can be  misleading and dangerous for personal planning purposes. They also  highlight particular demographic groups that often need higher or lower  income replacement (married vs. single; with/without children; by income  level). Financial literacy research highlights the necessity of using  relatable examples and realistic scenarios, targeting by income, and  tailoring communications as effective means of educating and motivating.  For instance, one review of retirement planning software suggests that  such tools should provide the user assistance in setting a target  replacement rate and should recognize the different needs of those with  and without children. Similarly, an ERISA Advisory Council report cited  research that found that communications specifically targeted to  participants based upon their interests, background, and/or economic  status were more successful than providing general communications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Income replacement rates may be a helpful gauge for younger workers  who have time to contribute more to retirement plans or adjust their  saving. They can also be a useful metric for low- and middle-income  households that may find they need to plan for replacing a substantial  portion of their pre-retirement income in retirement. These households, in  particular, may find they need to spend a sizable portion of their  retirement income on basic needs, such as housing and health care.  Social Security\u2019s progressive benefit structure will help these households,  but they will need other sources of income in retirement through defined  contribution plans, pension benefits, or other means to make up the  difference. At the same time, however, reports and articles we reviewed  demonstrate that developing a customized replacement rate requires  careful consideration to appropriately balance all of the underlying  assumptions, including those related to determining pre-retirement and  retirement income. The wide range of recommended target replacement  rates cited in research indicates that there is no rule-of-thumb that will  work for everyone.", "Given these factors, workers may have difficulty understanding what  target replacement rate to use based on their circumstances. Further,  workers may have trouble operationalizing this information into a realistic  savings strategy. This difficulty could be compounded by challenges in  understanding how to convert defined contribution account balances into  a potential income stream. If workers are unable to translate retirement  account balances into income replacement goals, the benefit of  replacement rates as a metric or guide is limited.", "Despite their complexity, replacement rates are used in some of the  retirement planning tools produced by the financial industry to give  workers a general sense of their progress toward achieving a secure  retirement. DOL\u2019s tools, however, lack targeted information and guidance  that could help different groups of workers make reasonable adjustments  to the replacement rates used in estimating their savings needs. This type  of clarifying information is particularly important given the challenges  workers may face in understanding the multitude of factors that could  affect a target replacement rate. Additionally, DOL\u2019s tools do not provide  flexibility to allow a user to customize or compare rates. Stating a rule-of- thumb target replacement rate, for example, and then using it in planning  tools without an option to adjust it, may inadvertently and implicitly  endorse a \u201cright\u201d rate. Without additional information and guidance on  how to estimate how much money they will need in retirement and the  flexibility to adjust the rate used in the calculations, workers could over- or  under-estimate how much they need to save. As a result, they may give  up on saving if estimates seem unattainable or they could unknowingly  save too little. In both cases, workers could reach retirement without  adequate savings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help workers make appropriate adjustments to the replacement rates  used in calculating their specific retirement income needs, the Secretary  of Labor should take the following two actions:  Include in its retirement planning tools information about examples of  individual circumstances that research has shown to result in higher  or lower income replacement needs (e.g., household characteristics  and income level) and guidance on the direction and magnitude of the  changes attributable to such circumstances as well as those due to  particular lifestyle choices.", "Modify its retirement planning tools to allow for some user flexibility in  adjusting the replacement rate used in calculating retirement income  needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this product to the Department of Labor (DOL),  Department of the Treasury, Social Security Administration, and  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

This was the most  recently available data at the time of our review. CE is a program that  consists of two ongoing surveys, the Quarterly Interview Survey and the  Diary Survey, that provide information on the buying habits of American  consumers, including data on their expenditures, income, and consumer  unit characteristics. The survey data are collected for the Bureau of Labor  Statistics (BLS) by the U.S. Census Bureau. Based on our interest in  conducting a broad analysis of spending patterns, we chose to use the  Interview Survey rather than the Diary Survey, since the Diary Survey is  designed to capture information on small, frequently purchased items. In  contrast, the Interview Survey is designed to collect data on major items  of expense, which respondents can be expected to recall for 3 months or  longer. In practice, the Interview Survey collects detailed data on an  estimated 60 to 70 percent of total household expenditures. In addition,  global estimates are obtained for food and other selected items, which  account for an additional 20 to 25 percent of total expenditures. The  Interview Survey does not collect expenses on housekeeping supplies,  personal care products, and nonprescription drugs, which contribute  about 5 to 15 percent of total expenditures. Thus, up to 95 percent of total  expenditures are covered by the Interview Survey.", "CE uses a probability sample of households designed to be  representative of the total U.S. non-institutionalized civilian population.  Prior to 2015, the sampling frame was generated from the 2000 Census  of Population. The Interview Survey is a rotating panel survey. According  to a BLS official, consumer units in each panel complete four interviews  conducted every 3 months and are then dropped. Each month new  consumer units enter the survey as other consumer units complete their  participation. The quarterly target sample size for the Interview Survey is  7,060 participating sample units. Data are weighted to adjust sample  estimates to national population estimates. The results for our weighted  data represent approximately 125.7 million households. We also  accounted for the number of months a household is interviewed. Sample  surveys are subject to two types of errors, sampling and non-sampling.  Sampling errors occur because observations are not taken from the entire  population. To estimate sampling error, we calculated 95 percent  confidence intervals. Total expenditure data estimates reported have 95  percent confidence intervals that are within +/- 17 percent of the estimate  itself, and additional confidence interval information on individual  spending categories are provided in appendix III. We followed BLS  guidance and estimated standard errors using a replicate weight  methodology, which involved taking the variance across 44 separate  values of differently weighted estimates. Non-sampling error can be  attributable to many sources, such as differences in interpreting  questions, inability or unwillingness of the respondent to provide correct  information, and mistakes in recording or coding data. These non- sampling errors can influence the accuracy of information presented in  the report, although the magnitude of their effect is unknown.", "We found the 2013 CE Interview Survey data to be reliable for the  purposes of our report. To assess reliability, we reviewed survey  documentation, compared results to published tables, and interviewed  agency officials to ensure the variables we analyzed were reliable for our  purposes. Estimates produced in this report may differ from published  BLS tables. For our analysis, we only analyzed Interview Survey data,  whereas BLS integrates some Diary Survey data into published tables.  For the purposes of our analysis, we used different age groups than those  in BLS published tables, which can also account for differences.

For the purposes of this report, we refer to  consumer units as households. Households were included in age groups  depending on the age of the reference person of the consumer unit. The  reference person is the first member mentioned by the respondent when  asked to identify the name of the person or one of persons who owns or  rents the home.", "We defined spending as direct out-of-pocket expenditures. In our  analysis, each household had an observation for each expenditure type.  Indirect expenditures, which may be significant, may be reflected  elsewhere. For example, consumer units with members whose employers  pay for all or part of their health or life insurance would have lower direct  expenses for these items than those who pay the entire amount  themselves. All monthly expenses were summed to obtain quarterly  estimates for each household. In cases where no expenditure was  reported, the expenditure was coded as a zero. We then multiplied  expenditures by four to annualize quarterly expenditure estimates.  Households in the four quarters of data were then averaged to obtain  annual expenditures. To analyze the shares of different categories of  spending, we grouped detailed level expenditures into broader  categories, such as health and housing, based on BLS\u2019s aggregation  method. One exception was that we combined some broad expenditure  categories into an \u201cother\u201d category for reporting purposes.", "The personal insurance and pensions category includes private pensions.  According to BLS officials, private pensions capture contributions to  defined benefit, defined contribution, and individual retirement accounts.

The  figures in this report that are based on our analysis of the Consumer  Expenditure Survey reflect data that are defined as expenditures in BLS  documentation. However, since mortgages can play an important role in  homeownership, we conducted an additional analysis where we added  lump sum and mortgage principal payments to housing expenditures to  understand the difference between housing outlays and expenditures. We  found that including mortgage outlays does not substantially alter the  spending patterns observed. For information on home mortgage outlays,  see appendix II. Property taxes are included in housing expenditures.  Lastly, income tax estimates are separate from expenditure variables.

Specifically, we looked at spending on  long-term care insurance; care in convalescent or nursing home; adult  day care; and care for elderly, those who are incapacitated, individuals  with disabilities, etc. However, there are challenges with measuring  household spending for long-term care because there is uncertainty  surrounding the extent to which households will need long-term care  services and how they will finance these costs. Since many people may  not have spending in this area, average spending levels are not  necessarily indicative of the potential costs people may face. Thus, to  better understand how long-term care costs would factor into retirement  considerations, we compared the results of four academic studies that  studied the potential effect of these costs on retirement resources.

Our regression model tested the effect of age on  expenditures while controlling for education, race, and ethnicity. We used  the natural log of expenditures as the dependent variable in order to  obtain results for the percentage effect of age on expenditures rather than  the absolute effect. Based on the results of our cross-sectional analysis,  which showed a parabolic pattern in expenditure levels by age, we used a  quadratic form of age.

While these firms provided valuable insight into  target replacement rate recommendations, our findings are  nongeneralizable. We asked the firms to respond to a questionnaire we  developed, either by completing the questionnaire and sending it back to  us or by going through the questionnaire during an interview. The  questionnaire asked about how, if at all, the firm uses replacement rates  in its work. If the firm uses target replacement rates, we asked a series of  questions about the origin of the target rate used by the firm, when and  how it was developed, and the various economic and demographic  factors considered, if any, when the firm developed the replacement rate.

However, it is difficult to plan for LTC costs as part of  income replacement in retirement because of challenges in determining  spending needs, high service rates, and limited government coverage for  financing costs. Average LTC spending is not necessarily indicative of the  potential costs individuals may face because the distribution of costs is  skewed. While many may not require LTC services, those who do may  have significant spending. For example, in our analysis of 2013  Consumer Expenditure Survey data, we found that only 3 percent of  households we analyzed had out-of-pocket spending on LTC-related  expenses. Estimated expenditures were sizeable in some age groups for  those who had spending on these services. For example, households  aged 80 and older that did have long-term care expenses spent an  average of about $6,900 in 2013. Further, LTC service rates can be  expensive. According to 2015 Genworth Cost of Care Survey data, the  national median annual service rate for nursing homes was $80,000 and  was $46,000 for full-time home health care.
