Some states have collected data in areas where federal data are limited, but these have been one-time studies. Federal data show that direct care workers who provide LTSS numbered an estimated 3.27 million in 2014, or 20.8 percent of the nation's health workforce. Federal data show that wages for direct care workers, while differing by occupation, are generally low, averaging between approximately $10 and $13 per hour in 2015. However it is unclear to what extent these wage data include direct care workers employed directly by the individuals for whom they care. The number of these workers, often referred to as independent providers, is believed to be significant and growing. Some states, in coordination with the federal government or on their own, have conducted studies about direct care workers and collected detailed information. These studies showed that a majority of independent providers worked for a family member or someone else they knew.", "The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which is responsible for monitoring the supply of and demand for health professionals, has developed some information on direct care workers. However, HRSA has not produced projections of this workforce or developed methods to address data limitations, which is in line with one of the goals in its strategic plan. HRSA's actions include sponsoring research and issuing a 2013 report that summarized federal data on different occupations, including direct care workers. While HRSA has recognized the limitations of existing data and cites these as reasons it has not developed projections for this workforce, the agency has not developed methods to address data challenges. Unless HRSA takes steps to overcome data limitations in order to make projections of supply and demand for direct care workers, policymakers will continue to be hampered in their ability to identify workforce trends and develop appropriate strategies to help ensure a sufficient number of qualified direct care workers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that HRSA take steps to produce projections of direct care workforce supply and demand and develop methods to address data limitations in order to do so.

Direct care workers\u2014 home health aides, psychiatric aides, nursing assistants, and personal  care aides\u2014are the primary providers of the paid, hands-on care received  by these individuals. High reported attrition rates and persistent  challenges recruiting and retaining direct care workers, however, have  fueled long-standing concerns by experts and policymakers about the  capacity of this workforce to meet LTSS demands.

For example, the Congressional Commission  on Long-Term Care reported in 2013 that a number of states have  experienced shortages and high attrition of direct care workers but lack  data to help them assess the size of the problem. The Commission  recommended that an appropriate federal agency, such as the Health  Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), initiate a process to  collect detailed data about the direct care workforce and launch  comprehensive data collection efforts. HRSA, within the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS), is responsible for ensuring that  Americans have access to a skilled health workforce.

We used the BLS\u2019s 2015  Occupational Employment Statistics and 2015 National Compensation  Survey to report data on direct care workers\u2019 wages and benefits,  respectively. For each source, we used the most recent data available at  the time we conducted our work. In addition, while direct care workers are  employed in both long-term care settings and acute care settings, such as  hospitals, we limited our analyses to certain industries in which LTSS are  likely provided. (For detailed information on our analysis methods and  federal data sources, see app. I.) We assessed the reliability of ACS and  BLS data by interviewing knowledgeable officials, reviewing relevant  documentation, and comparing the results of our analysis to published  data, as appropriate, and determined that these data were sufficiently  reliable to inform our objectives. We also gathered information about state  efforts to collect data on their direct care workforce by focusing on four  states\u2014Arkansas, Maine, Minnesota, and Oregon\u2014that had conducted  comprehensive surveys about their direct care workforce since 2012.  Three of the states\u2014Arkansas, Maine, and Minnesota\u2014conducted their  surveys as part of a multistate study funded by the Centers for Medicare  & Medicaid Services (CMS) and were selected because they had  achieved the highest survey response rates for their geographic regions.  Oregon collected data about direct care workers through its own survey  initiative and was selected for geographic variation and its high survey  response rate. For each state, we obtained copies of the survey  instruments used and documentation of the states\u2019 summary survey  results to the extent available, and we interviewed state officials about  their experiences collecting these data.

While the ACS separately  identifies personal care aides, it combines data for home health aides,  psychiatric aides, and nursing assistants into one occupational grouping,  so separate estimates for these occupations are unavailable. Another  limitation is that the number of these workers employed as independent  providers is unclear, because the ACS data do not separately identify  independent providers from other direct care workers.

HRSA officials told us that because of its large sample size,  the ACS is currently the best source of information about health workers  and provides reliable estimates of the direct care workforce, but noted  that there are significant limitations. Officials stated that they can use  ACS data to estimate the supply of personal care aides, but that it is not  possible to develop estimates for the other individual direct care  occupations because they are combined into one occupational group\u2014 nursing, psychiatric, and home health aides. We asked HRSA officials  whether the occupational grouping in the ACS data could be  disaggregated to estimate the supply of each direct care occupation  separately. Officials responded that when analyzing data, they use the  standard data set as supplied by the data sponsor, and they had not  asked the Census Bureau whether further disaggregation or special data  collection were possible now or in the future. We asked HRSA officials  further whether the supply of home health aides, psychiatric aides, and  nursing assistants could be estimated from ACS data using data from  other sources. For instance, BLS estimates the number of workers in  each direct care occupation for its National Employment Matrix by  determining the proportion of that occupation that is found in one survey  and applying these proportions to data from another survey.

In conducting our analyses, we made some adjustments due to  the data sources\u2019 differing structures. In addition, to focus our analysis on  direct care workers providing long-term services and supports (LTSS) (as  opposed to those providing any type of care, including acute care), we  used Census Bureau and BLS data to identify the industries and workers  most likely providing LTSS.

This would likely exclude direct care workers who provide  LTSS part-time as a secondary job, according to Health Resources and  Services Administration (HRSA) officials. While many direct care workers  work part-time, we do not know how many do so as a secondary job.  Another limitation of the ACS data is that individuals who are currently  unemployed are classified into the occupational group in which they were  most recently employed, which can be as far back as 5 years. This results  in counting approximately 472,000 currently unemployed individuals as  direct care workers even though they have not been employed in the past  12 months.

One difference between BLS and Census Bureau data is that Census  Bureau data use fewer detailed occupational codes.

Minnesota elected not  to survey employer organizations, as the state had conducted previous  surveys of these providers. All three NBIP states fielded a survey to  independent providers.

Overall response rates achieved  were 46 and 44 percent for Maine and Minnesota, respectively. The  results for these states showed, among other things, that the vast majority  of responding independent providers worked for a family member,  neighbor, friend, or someone else they knew. The data also showed large  differences in the education and income levels between independent  providers in the two states. For example, a little over one-third of  responding providers in Maine reported having had some college or  higher education, compared with over 60 percent in Minnesota, and over  half of responding providers in Maine reported having annual household  incomes of less than $22,000, while over 40 percent of independent  providers in Minnesota reported incomes over $50,001.
