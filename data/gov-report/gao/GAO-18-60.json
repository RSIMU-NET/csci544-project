As part of the process, BOEM may require approved \u201cincidental take\u201d authorizations from the Department of Commerce's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) or Interior's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), given the possibility such surveys may disturb or injure marine mammals. BOEM does not have statutory review time frame requirements for issuing permits, and officials said the agency starts its formal review once it determines that an application is complete. In some cases, the agency issued a permit on the same day it determined an application was complete.", "NMFS and FWS follow a similar general process for reviewing incidental take authorization applications related to seismic survey activities. From 2011 through 2016, NMFS and FWS reviewed 35 and approved 28 such applications across the three OCS regions, including some authorizations related to BOEM permits as well as research seismic surveys not associated with BOEM permits. NMFS was unable to provide accurate data for the dates the agency determines an application is adequate and complete\u2014and FWS does not record this date. For example, based on GAO's review of NMFS data, in at least two cases, the date NMFS recorded the application had been determined adequate and complete was after the date when the proposed authorization was published in the Federal Register . Federal internal control standards call for agencies to use quality information. Without guidance on how to accurately record review dates, agencies and applicants will continue to have uncertainty around review time frames. Further, under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the agencies are to review one type of incidental take authorization application\u2014incidental harassment authorization applications\u2014within 120 days of receiving an application for such authorizations. NMFS and FWS have not conducted an analysis of their review time frames. Not conducting such an analysis is inconsistent with federal internal control standards that call for agency management to design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks.

As noted previously, both agencies, per their guidance and  regulations, are to begin their formal processing of a request for an  incidental take authorization once an application is determined to be  \u201cadequate and complete.\u201d NMFS has general guidance on what  constitutes an adequate and complete incidental take authorization  application\u2014for both incidental harassment authorization and incidental  take regulation applications, as well as associated letter of authorization  applications.

Specifically, NMFS\u2019  guidance provides information on what should be included in an adequate  and complete application but does not include information on how or  when staff should record the date an application is determined to be  adequate and complete. NMFS officials we interviewed told us that while  they generally record these dates, they are not sufficiently accurate to be  used for an analysis of review time frames. These officials said that  determinations of whether an application is adequate and complete have  historically varied by staff member, with some staff waiting until all  outstanding questions are resolved with an applicant before deeming the  application adequate and complete, and others considering an application  to be adequate and complete if more substantive questions are answered  (e.g., the dates, duration, specified geographic region of, and estimated  take for the proposed activity), even if some less substantive questions  are still outstanding (e.g., contact information). In addition, NMFS officials  told us that, in some cases, staff might not enter into their system the date  they determine an application to be adequate and complete and might  instead enter the information in batches once they have a few  applications that are ready for data entry. This might mean that, in cases  where a staff member waits until an application is done being processed  and reviewed, the date recorded for the determination of adequate and  complete, and the date the incidental take authorization is published, may  be zero to a few days apart. Based on our review of NMFS data, in at  least two cases, the date NMFS recorded for the determination of  adequacy and completeness of an application was after the date when  the proposed incidental take authorization was published in the Federal  Register.", "While FWS has guidance on what applicants should include in an  incidental take authorization application, the guidance does not specify  how or when staff should record the date on which they determine an  application is adequate and complete. One FWS official we interviewed  told us that the agency does not record this date in the spreadsheet for  tracking incidental take authorization applications. According to this FWS  official, agency officials do not record this date because they do not wait  until the application is considered adequate and complete to begin their  review. Instead, they begin processing the application while working with  applicants to provide missing information and clarifications. By the time  FWS officials consider an application to be adequate and complete, the  officials said that they usually have a well-developed draft incidental take  authorization and are typically finalizing details with the applicant.  According to FWS officials, recording an adequate and complete date  would have little meaning.", "NMFS\u2019s and FWS\u2019s guidance does not specify how or when staff should  record the date an application is determined to be adequate and complete  to help ensure that such a date is recorded consistently. As a result, the  agencies are either not accurately recording the date an application is  adequate and complete or not recording that date. Thus, the agencies are  not able to determine how long their formal processing takes. This  outcome is inconsistent with federal internal control standards, which call  for management to use quality information to achieve agency objectives  and design control activities, such as accurate and timely recording of  transactions, to achieve objectives and respond to risk. Officials we  interviewed at both agencies told us that they work to help meet  applicants\u2019 project timelines\u2014for example, applicants might need an  incidental harassment authorization to be in place when their seismic  survey vessel becomes available to begin operations. Until NMFS and  FWS develop guidance that clarifies how and when staff should record  the date on which the agency determines the \u201cadequacy and  completeness\u201d of an application, the agencies and applicants will  continue to have uncertainty around review time frames for incidental take  authorizations.", "Further, NMFS and FWS do not know if they are meeting their statutory  time frames for reviewing one type of incidental take authorization  application\u2014incidental harassment authorization applications\u2014because  they do not assess the time it takes their agencies to review applications  and make authorization decisions. As noted previously, the MMPA  provides that NMFS or FWS shall issue incidental harassment  authorizations within 120 days of receiving an application. Industry  representatives, scientific researchers, and agency officials we  interviewed noted, however, that the agencies often take longer than 120  days to make a decision about whether to issue an incidental harassment  authorization. For example, NMFS and FWS officials we interviewed told  us they often do not complete incidental harassment authorization  reviews within the 120-day statutory time frame. According to NMFS and  FWS officials, reviews may take longer than 120 days in cases where the  agency determines that a threatened or endangered species under the  Endangered Species Act may be affected, because the agency generally  must request the initiation of a section 7 consultation, which by regulation  can take up to 135 days.", "More specifically, NMFS and FWS officials we interviewed were unable to  provide accurate estimates of how long it takes their agency to review  incidental harassment authorization applications because they said that  they do not conduct analyses of their review time frames.
