For example, according to officials from a provider association, telehealth can improve patient outcomes by facilitating follow-up care, while remote patient monitoring is helpful for treating patients with chronic diseases. With regard to factors that create barriers, the selected associations most often cited concerns over payment and coverage restrictions. For example, officials from a provider association noted that Medicare telehealth coverage restrictions limit the geographic and practice settings in which beneficiaries may receive services. While not indicating how significant these factors are to Medicare, officials with a payer association told GAO that they considered these factors\u2014also identified by the provider and patient associations\u2014as either encouraging use or creating barriers to the use of telehealth and remote patient monitoring.", "Medicare models, demonstrations, and a new payment program have the potential to expand the use of telehealth and remote patient monitoring. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), supports eight models and demonstrations in which certain Medicare telehealth requirements have been waived, such as requirements for the locations and facility types where beneficiaries can receive telehealth services. For example, the waivers allow beneficiaries to access telehealth in urban areas, or from their homes. Additionally, the use of telehealth and remote patient monitoring in Medicare may change depending on how many clinicians use them as a way to achieve the goals of the new Merit-based Incentive Payment System, which\u2014starting in 2017\u2014will pay clinicians based on quality and resource use, among other things.

Telehealth can be used to provide clinical care remotely by two-way video  for services such as psychotherapy or the evaluation and management of  conditions. Remote patient monitoring can be used to monitor patients  with chronic conditions, such as those with congestive heart failure,  hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and it  can also be used as a diagnostic tool, such as for some heart conditions.  Although the literature is mixed on the effectiveness of telehealth and  remote patient monitoring, a 2016 review of studies by the Agency for  Healthcare Research and Quality\u2014an agency within the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS)\u2014found that the most consistent  benefit of telehealth and remote patient monitoring occurs when the  technology is used for communication and counseling or to remotely  monitor chronic conditions such as cardiovascular and respiratory  disease, with improvements in outcomes such as mortality, quality of life,  and reductions in hospital admissions.", "In recent years there have been efforts to increase the use of telehealth  and remote patient monitoring in federal health care programs.

Officials from three of the top private payers (based on market share) told  us that providers can use remote patient monitoring in their health care  systems when it is indicated for a patient\u2019s condition.", "Officials from the three private payers told us they have limited data on  the extent to which remote patient monitoring is used. They told us they  did not have data available because, for example, remote patient  monitoring services are usually part of a care management program in  which charges are bundled and not billed and detailed separately. It is  therefore difficult to distinguish remote patient monitoring services from  services provided via telehealth, officials explained. Some of the health  plans of these three private payers reimburse for remote patient  monitoring on a fee-for-service basis, while others include it as part of the  services offered through integrated delivery systems that do not  reimburse for separate services.", "Officials from one private payer explained that they want physicians to  decide which patients, conditions, problems, and circumstances are most  suited to remote patient monitoring. This private payer does not  reimburse physicians on a fee-for-service basis, noting that incentives,  such as payment, can drive behavior. As an example, if the provider  receives reimbursement based on the amount of monitoring, the provider  may file more claims for monitoring, regardless of whether the use is  driven by evidence-based care processes. Instead, officials from this  private payer stated that their incentives focus on the care outcomes of  physicians\u2019 patients, and they pay physicians based on the quality of the  outcomes by disease population. Officials explained that they are  currently rolling out programs to track diabetic patients\u2019 blood sugar by  monitoring what they eat, the exercise they get, and how they live.  Additionally, this private payer has been using remote patient monitoring  for patients with heart failure for some time, and officials told us that data  gathered through monitoring of weight and blood pressure are good  predictors of early deterioration of heart conditions. Similarly, this private  payer has a program for patients with hypertension that monitors a  patient\u2019s stress level.", "Officials from a second private payer stated that they reimburse for  remote patient monitoring in a manner that is appropriate for the specific  condition being treated. For example, they reimburse for cardiologic  remote patient monitoring if the patient has symptoms that are indications  for the use of monitoring. If the condition does not indicate cardiologic  monitoring, the private payer does not reimburse for this monitoring.  Officials from this second private payer said they are reimbursing for  remote patient monitoring that is used in real time to monitor patients with  one or more chronic conditions and for high-risk patients. For example,  the service is used to monitor blood pressure for hypertension, weight  changes for congestive heart failure, and real-time blood sugar for  diabetes. According to these private payer officials, providers typically use  remote patient monitoring in the short-term and episodically, or to  retrospectively look at monitoring results to make a clinical decision.  Remote patient monitoring is also used to connect health plan members  with their care managers, and these managers can notify providers to  intervene if the monitoring indicates a need. This private payer also has  various pilot programs related to remote patient monitoring, including a  program for its members with varying levels of congestive heart failure.", "Officials from the third private payer told us that if remote patient  monitoring is indicated by a patient\u2019s condition, then the provider can  order its use. Some of the payer\u2019s private plans are integrated delivery  systems for overall care, and in these plans providers are not paid  separately for remote patient monitoring. According to officials, their  agreements with providers are designed to encourage providers to use  data from all sources, such as claims information, electronic medical  records, and remote patient monitoring. The private payer also contracts  with accountable care organizations and enters into payment  arrangements with provider groups. Those entities use remote patient  monitoring and the information obtained through monitoring as part of  their care management of patients.

According to a report by the Agency  for Healthcare Research and Quality, remote patient monitoring has been  shown to produce positive outcomes, such as reduced hospitalization,  when used as a part of care management for chronic conditions such as  diabetes and congestive heart failure.", "A June 2016 report by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission  (MedPAC) found that Medicare covers some services through its  Physician Fee Schedule that involve remote monitoring of a patient. For  example, MedPAC\u2019s analysis of 2014 Medicare data found that the  agency spent $119 million on remote cardiac monitoring services for  265,000 beneficiaries.

These relative values largely reflect estimates of  the level of physician work and the amount of practice expenses needed  to provide one service relative to other services. Physician work relative  values are based on the estimate of two main inputs: (1) the time the  physician needs to perform the service (including pre- and post-service  activities, or work performed before and after the service), and (2) the  intensity of the service (including the physician\u2019s mental effort and  judgment, technical skill and physical effort, and psychological stress).  Practice expense relative values are based primarily on estimates of (1)  direct practice expense inputs, which reflect the clinical labor, medical  equipment, and disposable supplies needed to provide a specific service  as well as the amount of time for which labor is required and equipment is  used, and (2) indirect practice expenses, which generally reflect overhead  expenses not associated with a specific service.", "Several characteristics of remote patient monitoring services have been  identified by some of the selected associations we interviewed as raising  challenges to valuation within CMS\u2019s methodology, such as the services\u2019  personnel and technology, and the operating hours and location of where  certain remote patient monitoring services are delivered.

Officials from an association representing certain providers of  remote patient monitoring services told us that Independent Diagnostic  Testing Facilities frequently perform remote patient monitoring services  that include patient diagnostic testing, but some personnel costs may not  be recognized in the Medicare valuation methodology because these  personnel are not considered clinical staff. For example, personnel  involved in remote cardiac monitoring at Independent Diagnostic Testing  Facilities include non-clinical administrative staff who the association  officials noted are not adequately accounted for in the CMS methodology.", "Technology. Officials from this same association also noted that the  costs of technology associated with remote patient monitoring may not be  fully captured by CMS\u2019s valuation methodology. For example, while  wearable remote devices only monitor one patient at a time, wireless  communication systems\u2014with their hardware and software costs\u2014that  can be used to remotely monitor multiple patients at a time are not  attributed to an individual patient when considering the direct practice  expense inputs. Therefore, this type of equipment is classified within the  indirect cost category (with overhead costs), resulting in lower payment  rates than if these costs were considered direct costs, according to  association officials. Additionally, other unique costs for remote patient  monitoring related to technology include such things as the cost of  delivering the monitoring device to the patient and the cost of the patient  returning the device after the monitoring period has ended.", "In addition, technology used to provide remote patient monitoring services  can vary among service providers and is evolving, contributing to  difficulties in developing valuation for the services. Officials with a payer  association said there is variation among the type of devices the patient  or provider must possess or that must be installed in the patient\u2019s home to  carry out remote patient monitoring, such as motion sensors to determine  if a patient has fallen or the components that transmit biometric  information such as blood pressure or weight back to the monitoring site.  Officials with a second provider association noted that remote patient  monitoring technology continues to evolve, and for such newly-developed  technology there is not a consensus in how to use and charge for the  multiplicity of delivery models, including the range of services and  procedures.", "Hours of operation and location. Some remote patient monitoring may  require a monitoring facility to operate 24 hours a day, 7 days per week.  An association representing certain providers of remote patient  monitoring services noted that Medicare\u2019s valuation methodology, which  CMS officials stated was designed for and primarily applies to services  furnished in standard physician offices during business hours, may not  fully incorporate costs associated with maintaining operations outside of  standard business hours and in non-physician office settings, such as at  Independent Diagnostic Testing Facilities or other types of remote  monitoring centers.", "Knowledgeable stakeholders. CMS works with a committee established  by the American Medical Association (AMA)\u2014the AMA/Specialty Society  Relative Value Scale Update Committee (RUC)\u2014three times a year  annually to review a subset of physicians\u2019 services, identified in part by  CMS and in part by the RUC, to develop recommendations to CMS on  the resources needed to provide those specific services. RUC members  generally represent physician specialty societies, such as those for  cardiology, family medicine, and internal medicine. However, for services  such as the cardiac monitoring services that are widely provided by  Independent Diagnostic Testing Facilities, representatives from  Independent Diagnostic Testing Facilities do not serve on the RUC and  do not officially participate in the RUC process as advisors regarding  these services, according to officials with the association representing  certain providers of remote patient monitoring services.", "CMS response to cited concerns. CMS officials agreed that the  payment rates that result from the application of the current Medicare  methodology may reflect relative resources for services furnished in the  typical physician office rather than other locations. Officials said that they  use CMS\u2019s annual rulemaking process for setting payment rates for the  Physician Fee Schedule to address services, such as remote patient  monitoring, that vary from the usual service delivery model. CMS  officials said this process affords members of the public an opportunity to  recommend codes to be considered for revaluation if they believe the  services are inappropriately valued. Some examples CMS officials cited  include the following:  In revisions to the Physician Fee Schedule for calendar year 2016,  CMS increased the input price for patient worn telemetry system  equipment, which is a factor in establishing the payment rate for  cardiovascular telemetry transmitted to a remote attended  surveillance center for up to 30 days. In response to a request  received in a public comment period during the annual Physician Fee  Schedule rulemaking, CMS increased the price from $21,575 to  $23,537 to account for the unique properties of the equipment,  including its use 24 hours per day and 7 days per week for an  individual patient over several weeks and its use primarily outside of a  health care setting.", "CMS has developed codes within the Physician Fee Schedule that  describe the non-face-to-face care management services that include  interactions furnished through communication technology. These non- face-to-face services are associated with managing the particular  needs of patients and are furnished over the course of a calendar  month."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Examples of Telehealth and Remote Patient Monitoring in Medicare Models and Demonstrations", "paragraphs": ["The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act created the Center for  Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (Innovation Center) within the Centers  for Medicare & Medicaid Services to test innovative payment and service  delivery models to reduce Medicare, Medicaid, and state Children\u2019s  Health Insurance Program expenditures while preserving or enhancing  the quality of care.
