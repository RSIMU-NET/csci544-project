This report examines (1) how CMS defines network adequacy and how its criteria compares with other programs, (2) how and when CMS applies its criteria, (3) the extent to which CMS conducts ongoing monitoring of MAO networks, and (4) how CMS ensures that MAOs inform beneficiaries about terminations. GAO reviewed CMS and other guidance on network adequacy, federal regulations, and standards for internal control.

Since 2011, CMS has defined an adequate MA provider network as meeting two criteria: a minimum number of providers and maximum travel time and distance to those providers. To reflect local conditions, the requirements are specific to different county types and a range of provider types. However, the MA criteria do not reflect aspects of provider availability, such as how often a provider practices at a given location. In contrast, other network-based health programs use provider availability measures to assess network adequacy. For example, federal Medicaid managed care rules address providers' ability to accept new patients and TRICARE criteria address appointment wait times for active duty servicemembers. Without taking availability into account, as is done in some other programs, MA provider networks may appear to CMS and beneficiaries as more robust than they actually are.", "CMS applies its network adequacy criteria narrowly. Rather than assessing all county-based provider networks against its criteria, CMS limits its annual application of the criteria to provider networks in counties that MA organizations (MAO)\u2014private organizations that offer one or more health benefit plans\u2014propose to enter in the upcoming year. From 2013 through 2015, CMS's reviews accounted for less than 1 percent of all networks. To facilitate its review of these networks, CMS has established standardized data collection via an automated system. However, CMS does little to assess the accuracy of the network data in applications MAOs submit, even though the submissions contain the same data elements as in provider directories, which have been shown to be inaccurate in a number of government and private studies. Until CMS takes steps to verify MAO provider information, as outlined in federal internal control standards, the agency cannot be confident that MAOs meet network adequacy criteria.", "For established provider networks, CMS does not require MAOs to routinely submit updated network information for review, but may learn of any adequacy issues through its broader oversight of MAOs. CMS recently required that MAOs disclose efforts to significantly narrow provider networks, allowing MAOs to determine when such disclosure is necessary. CMS also relies on complaints it receives to identify any problems related to network changes that are not otherwise identified. However, contrary to internal control standards, CMS does not measure ongoing MAO networks against its current MA criteria. Because a plan's providers may change at any time, CMS cannot be assured that networks continue to be adequate and provide sufficient access for enrollees until the agency collects evidence of compliance on a regular basis.", "While CMS requires that MAOs give enrollees advance notice when a provider contract is terminated, the agency has not established information requirements for those notices and does not review sample notices sent to enrollees. This lack of scrutiny appears inconsistent with the agency's oversight of other Medicare beneficiary communications and with internal controls. Without a minimum set of required information elements and a check on adherence to them, the agency cannot ensure that MAO communications are clear, accurate, and consistent."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["The Administrator of CMS should augment oversight of MA networks to address provider availability, verify provider information submitted by MAOs, conduct more periodic reviews of MAO network information, and set minimum information requirements for MAO enrollee notification letters.

In making this decision, beneficiaries typically face a trade-off between  affordability and provider choice. In FFS Medicare, beneficiaries pay a  premium, deductible, and any applicable cost sharing, and may elect to  receive covered benefits from any Medicare participating provider. In  contrast, beneficiaries who enroll in an MA plan receive Medicare covered  services, sometimes with extra benefits, and often pay lower out-of- pocket costs. MA enrollees\u2019 choice of providers is generally limited to  physicians, hospitals, and other providers that contract with their MAO.  Enrollees that use the MAO\u2019s network of providers typically incur lower  overall copayments or coinsurance than those enrolled in FFS Medicare.  In maintaining their networks, MAOs may take action to exclude providers  from a network at any time throughout the year.", "Competition for enrollees provides MAOs with incentives to reduce  expenses and control costs. Some MAOs have begun trimming existing  networks or offering health plans with narrower networks, in which  beneficiaries are limited to a smaller group of physicians and hospitals.  According to the trade association that represents MAOs, this may be  done in order to shape a network of high-quality, low-cost care providers  and to keep costs low for beneficiaries. MAOs may control costs by  excluding providers who charge higher fees or by negotiating with a  smaller set of providers for lower payment rates. According to industry  representatives, narrower networks also allow MAOs to better monitor  provider performance and impose guidelines more effectively.", "However, some professional medical associations and beneficiary  advocates have expressed concern about the narrowing of provider  networks and how disruptive changes to networks can be for MA  enrollees. Medical associations have questioned the way that MAOs  identify less efficient providers and their lack of transparency in decisions  to drop certain providers. Advocates note that beneficiaries are often  unaware of how broad or narrow their MA plans\u2019 provider networks are  and experience confusion over which providers are participating in which  plans. Because MA plans may not cover as much of the cost of services  obtained from providers out of their networks, enrollees who obtain  services from non-network providers could face higher out-of-pocket  costs. Beneficiaries notified that their providers will be terminated from  their MA plans\u2019 networks may decide to disenroll from MA or switch to  another MA plan during a designated period each year.

CMS has also developed requirements and policies regarding which  provider types must be included in plan networks, and when and how  MAOs should notify the agency, providers, and enrollees if certain  network reductions are imminent. In light of media reports about  reductions in provider networks and the effect those reductions might  have on access to care for MA enrollees, questions have been raised  about CMS oversight of MA plans\u2019 network adequacy.

In addition,  we interviewed CMS officials responsible for MAO oversight and network  adequacy policy, including officials at five regional offices directly  responsible for conducting reviews of the MAO submissions. We also  interviewed representatives from several primary and specialty care  medical associations that have recently commented on MA network  adequacy requirements, as well as beneficiary advocacy groups, and the  trade association that represents MAOs to obtain their perspectives on  CMS oversight. We reviewed the Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government and identified explicit criteria against which to  assess CMS policies.

However, in rural areas, MAOs may have difficulty organizing  an adequate network due to the more limited supply of providers in those  areas. To provide beneficiaries with wide access to MA plans, CMS  network adequacy requirements take into account differences in  utilization, patterns of care, and supply of providers in urban and rural  areas.", "In building their networks, MAOs contract directly with providers. To  establish or renew a contract, MAOs negotiate with providers to find  agreed-upon payment rates, terms, and duration. MAOs can initiate  contracts with providers at any point during the year and can also  terminate contracts with network providers at any point. These  terminations can be made \u201cfor cause,\u201d for such things as a loss of license  or breach in contract, or \u201cwithout cause\u201d\u2014requiring no explanation for the  termination. Under Medicare rules, MAOs must give providers written  notice at least 60 days in advance of terminating them without cause and  must offer providers a process for appealing contract terminations.

To determine the minimum number  of providers required, CMS considers such county-specific factors as  the total number of Medicare beneficiaries and historical data on MA  market share in similar counties. CMS sets minimum provider ratios  per 1,000 beneficiaries by provider type in each county, for both  primary care (including geriatrics and internal medicine) and specialty  care (such as cardiology, gastroenterology, and oncology). These  ratios differ by the county\u2019s geographic designation as large metro,  metro, micro, rural, or counties with extreme access considerations.", "Maximum travel time and distance. CMS\u2019s time and distance   criteria also vary substantially by provider type and county   geographic designation. CMS developed these measures\u2014such   as 10 minutes/5 miles for primary care providers in large metro  counties or 40 minutes/30 miles for primary care providers in rural  counties\u2014by juxtaposing beneficiary addresses with provider  locations. At least 90 percent of beneficiaries in a county must have  access to the appropriate number of providers within the required time  and distance maximums. To count toward the threshold, network  providers do not have to be located in the same county as  beneficiaries as long as they are within the required proximity.", "Each year, CMS updates its network adequacy criteria for each county  and provider type for the subsequent contract year. In advance   of contract year 2016, CMS required that MAO networks comprise   55 provider types, including 6 specific primary care provider types,   26 specialty care types, and 23 facility types. For the minimum number   of providers criterion, CMS counts each specialty care type separately,  but counts all primary care provider types together as one group for  mapping purposes. For example, in a metro county with nearly 32,000  total Medicare beneficiaries, each MAO\u2014regardless of the number of  plan enrollees\u2014must include in its network at least 7 primary care  providers, 2 cardiologists, 2 general surgeons, and 1 of each of the  remaining specialty care types. Each MAO in this metro county must also  include 47 acute inpatient beds per 1,000 beneficiaries, and one of each  of the facility and transplant program types. (For more information on  CMS\u2019s network adequacy criteria for contract year 2016, see app. I.)", "Health care researchers have noted that network adequacy criteria  measured by provider type and geographic designation serve to protect  beneficiary access while preserving MAO flexibility in provider network  design. Furthermore, some researchers have pointed out that  quantitative standards derived from sound research provide clarity and  certainty, and level the playing field among insurers. In addition, the CMS  regional office officials we spoke with expressed a preference for the  current criteria. Before 2011, the criteria CMS used were more  ambiguous and did not allow for the more objective and consistent  application they do now. One beneficiary advocacy group we interviewed  described the MA network adequacy criteria as acceptable and  appropriate parameters for the program.", "However, some medical associations we spoke with and recent research  by the HHS Office of Inspector General have noted shortcomings in  CMS\u2019s reliance on geography-based provider ratios. Medical associations  stated that CMS does not obtain information on whether providers in  MAO networks are accepting new patients or if the appointment wait  times reasonably ensure that patients can see a provider in a timely  manner. In commenting on CMS\u2019s draft Call Letter for contract year  2016, a number of medical associations collectively stated that a  provider\u2019s full-time equivalent status at a given location should be taken  into account to ensure access to care without unreasonable delay. As the  HHS Office of Inspector General recent study of Medicaid managed care  standards found, when provider availability is not factored into network  adequacy criteria, insurers may be able to meet network adequacy  criteria even if their network providers are not readily available to all their  enrollees.", "As noted by a Lewin representative, CMS\u2019s priority in updating MA criteria  has focused on the number and geographic distribution of providers over  other measures of access. She noted, for example, the challenge in  identifying network physicians who do not take new MA patients due to  practice capacity constraints. Although physicians may choose to  participate in multiple health plans or serve FFS patients, MAOs do not  require that they report on their practice capacity\u2014that is, the extent to  which they contract with other MAOs or the size of their patient panel.  Without such data it is difficult to determine the number of potential  beneficiaries providers could reasonably serve.", "Additionally, medical associations told us that CMS\u2019s provider type  classifications in the MA criteria mask distinctions within specialties that  could have consequences for how MAOs design their networks. The  American Academy of Ophthalmology noted that MAOs do not make  distinctions for retina or glaucoma specialties. Similarly, the American  Society of Retina Specialists reported that it can be challenging for MA  enrollees with certain eye conditions to receive treatment when MAOs are  not required to include retina specialists in their networks. The American  Academy of Dermatology said that dermatologists in plan networks may  include subspecialists whose practices focus on certain populations, such  as pediatric dermatology. Therefore, counting all specialists regardless of  practice focus, as CMS\u2019s criteria do, may overstate the actual number of  specialists available to serve MA enrollees. Lewin acknowledged the  difficulty in recognizing variation with medical subspecialties as the  provider identification data used to establish ratios does not account for  these type of breakdowns. For example, because retina specialists are  not identified separately from other ophthalmologists in CMS data, there  was no way for Lewin to develop subspecialty requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unlike MA, Some Other Programs Consider Provider Availability as a Component of Network Adequacy", "paragraphs": ["Network adequacy standards in other managed care programs we  examined cover a variety of approaches to setting network adequacy  criteria and differ, to some extent, from MA criteria. To measure the  adequacy of provider networks, these standards generally include  aspects of provider availability, along with time and distance maximums  and provider-to-enrollee ratios. Most of the programs\u2014NAIC\u2019s model act,  PPACA marketplaces, and Medicaid managed care\u2014establish minimum  network requirements, with states having flexibility to impose additional  standards.", "Since 1996, NAIC has made available to states a model act for network  adequacy. To update the model act, NAIC convened a group of state  insurance regulators and other interested parties and expects to issue a  new model act in 2015. The draft NAIC revised model suggests that  states incorporate aspects of provider availability, such as wait times for  visits with network providers. NAIC uses a subjective \u201creasonable access\u201d  standard instead of distinct time and distance maximums, which  accommodates state differences in geographic accessibility and  population dispersion. NAIC\u2019s model act also suggests that states  consider provider-to-enrollee ratios for primary and specialty care. While  some groups, such as consumer advocates, called on NAIC to establish  more quantitative requirements, it has chosen not to be as prescriptive as  these groups recommend.", "QHPs offered in the PPACA marketplaces (whether state-based or  federally facilitated) are subject to federal network adequacy standards,  which CMS updates in annual rulemaking. CMS used the 1996 NAIC  model act for network adequacy as the basis for the PPACA marketplace  standards and intends to use the revised model to update requirements  applicable to QHPs. States may also impose additional network adequacy  requirements on QHPs. Federal rules for PPACA marketplaces do not  address network provider availability. Federal regulations do specify that  services be accessible without unreasonable delay, but do not include  any maximum time or distance requirements. Also, federal regulations do  not set any provider-to-enrollee ratios, although QHPs are generally  required to contract with a sufficient number of essential community  providers, such as federally qualified health centers and other providers  that serve predominately low-income, underserved populations. A 2015  Commonwealth Fund study of plans in PPACA marketplaces found that  23 states have quantitative time or distance criteria, while fewer states  have quantitative criteria for appointment wait times (11 states) and  provider-to-enrollee ratios (10 states).", "Medicaid managed care organizations are subject to broad federal  network adequacy requirements, and states may impose additional or  more specific standards. Federal law generally requires a Medicaid  managed care organization to provide adequate assurances it has  sufficient capacity to serve expected enrollment in its service area.  Federal Medicaid regulations contain standards covering different aspects  of network adequacy, but do not include any quantitative measures. To  address provider availability, regulations require that states consider the  numbers of network providers who are not accepting new Medicaid  patients. While the rules do not set specific time and distance maximums,  regulations point to other access considerations\u2014means of transportation  and physical access to care for individuals with disabilities. Additionally,  the law does not set specific provider-to-enrollee ratios, but requires that  states consider other aspects that would factor into a ratio, including  anticipated enrollment, expected utilization, and number and types of  providers required to furnish services. In a review of 33 states with  Medicaid managed care programs, the HHS Office of Inspector General  reported that states typically set standards for appointment wait time,  travel time and distance, as well as provider-to-enrollee ratios. These  requirements varied widely among the states reviewed, with some  differentiation by provider type (primary or specialty care) and location  (urban or rural). For example, the states ranged from a maximum  appointment wait time for a routine primary care visit of 10 business days  in California and Pennsylvania to 45 calendar days in Massachusetts and  Minnesota. CMS recently issued a proposed rule that would amend  current Medicaid managed care standards to reduce variation in how  states evaluate and define network adequacy, and would impose  minimum time and distance standards for certain types of providers.", "TRICARE\u2019s managed care access standards generally have a more  quantitative approach. To address provider availability, TRICARE sets  appointment wait time limits for routine visits, well-patient visits or  specialty care referrals, and urgent care. TRICARE standards set  maximum travel times at 30 minutes for primary care and 1 hour for  specialty care under normal circumstances. The only aspect of network  adequacy standards that TRICARE does not set specific requirements for  are provider-to-enrollee ratios, where TRICARE generally requires a  sufficient number and mix of specialists to reasonably meet the  anticipated needs of enrollees.", "The inclusion of provider availability in other programs\u2019 network adequacy  requirements suggests CMS may be missing a key element for  measuring access. In addition, recent health care research we examined  and representatives of medical associations we spoke with have  suggested that provider availability is a key element for measuring access  to care, which most network-based programs have broadly incorporated  into federal standards, state standards, or both. While the federal or  nationwide requirements are largely broad and subjective, some states  have set more quantitative criteria. MA criteria are more robust than those  of other programs in terms of distinct travel time and distance for a  defined set of providers, but CMS does not assess whether those  providers are truly available to enrollees.

CMS  requires MAO applicants to report network data using the HSD table  format and transmit the data through the Health Plan Management  System (HPMS)\u2014the primary communication tool between CMS and  MAOs. The HSD table template has fields to record each network   provider\u2019s name, address, provider type, medical affiliation, and  employment status. Before submitting their applications to CMS in  February, MAOs are able to determine the adequacy of their provider  networks by comparing their HSD table data against the thresholds in the  HSD reference tables. For example, MAOs planning to enter Cook   County, Illinois, for contract year 2016 know from the HSD reference  tables that they need at least 92 primary care providers within 10 minutes  or 5 miles from at least 90 percent of beneficiaries\u2019 homes in that county,  and also know the thresholds for all other required provider types. If  MAOs do not meet all the thresholds in Cook County, they may choose,  among other options, to contract with more providers to build an adequate  network or to not enter that county.", "After MAOs submit their applications, CMS evaluates their provider  networks using an automated system. Through HPMS, CMS performs  automated checks, which rely on the HSD reference tables, to determine  whether provider networks meet each threshold and then generates two  reports on the data errors detected. One report lists problematic  address information, such as blank fields, duplicative records, and street  addresses and zip codes that are not recognized by the system. The  other HPMS report lists all providers shown as supporting the threshold  for more than one type of specialty care within a given network. CMS  regional office officials praised the automated checks for being far more  thorough than the manual review process used before contract year 2011  and for requiring significantly less of their time. Beyond these system- generated reports, CMS does little else to assess the accuracy of the  HSD data that MAOs submit.", "While the HPMS reports identify certain data errors and anomalies,  challenges remain with verifying MAO provider network data submissions.  In its review of provider submissions, Lewin raised concerns about the  validity of addresses in the HSD tables and the overstatement of  beneficiary access. In addition, CMS and MAOs both told Lewin they  had difficulty verifying provider data. They noted that commonly used  verification resources, such as public Medicare websites for comparing  physicians or hospitals against quality and cost ratings, often contain  incorrect data due to lags in updates and poor provider self-reporting. To  address these concerns, Lewin recommended that CMS develop data  verification tools to facilitate the accuracy and consistency of application  data submissions and HSD table reviews and include more information  on the strengths and limitations of commonly used verification resources  in its standard operating procedures. While CMS officials said they  developed a tool during the contract year 2015 application cycle to  facilitate the consistency of submissions, they told us they have no plans  to develop additional tools to determine the accuracy of submissions or  add information to the standard operating procedures.", "Federal internal controls call for management to obtain relevant data that  have a logical connection with, or bearing upon, identified information  requirements; be reasonably free from error and bias; and faithfully  represent what they purport to represent. For effective monitoring,  management must also evaluate the reliability of data sources.  However, CMS does not check the HSD data against other data sources  to identify inconsistencies and other indications of error. Officials from one  CMS regional office questioned the purpose of cross-checking the HSD  data, but officials from another regional office noted that they occasionally  call providers and perform Internet searches to verify the data. The lack of  data validation is notable because provider directories, which contain the  same elements as the HSD data, have been proven to be inaccurate, as  previously discussed. Because the HSD data and provider directories are  populated from the same source, according to the trade organization that  represents MAOs, the HSD data likely contain the same inaccuracies.", "Inaccuracies in provider directories\u2014and, as an extension, HSD tables\u2014 may be attributable to both MAOs and providers. According to the trade  organization that represents MAOs, it is a challenge for health plans to  ensure that provider directories are up-to-date and accurate because  providers often do not notify the plans of changes, such as retirements  and office relocations, in a timely manner. The American Academy of  Dermatology representatives explained that MAOs are responsible for  updating provider directories, in part because MAOs use networks to  attract consumers and sell their insurance policies. Representatives from  two medical associations reported that they were not aware of any MAO  contract requirements regarding updates to directory information. The  American Academy of Ophthalmology representatives told us that most  providers inform MAOs of address changes, for example, but such  notices are not always acted upon by the MAOs. To eliminate the hassle  of notifying multiple MAOs of changes in office hours or locations, the  representatives proposed the construction of an electronic portal  accessible by all health plans to allow providers to update their  information in one place. Medical association representatives also  contended that MAOs are in a better position to detect when directories  need to change, because the absence of claims for a specific period,  such as 30 days, would indicate whether a provider has, for example,  moved or died. In CMS\u2019s 2016 Final Call Letter, the agency reported  plans to conduct direct monitoring of online provider directories to verify  the information MAOs include about network providers. The agency also  indicated it will consider requiring MAOs to provide, and regularly update,  network information in a standardized, electronic format for eventual  inclusion in a nationwide provider database readily available to  beneficiaries and others."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Commonly Grants Permanent Exceptions from Its Network Adequacy Criteria When MAOs Offer Alternatives Consistent with Local Patterns of Care", "paragraphs": ["March  MAOs whose provider networks do not meet  CMS\u2019s network adequacy criteria are able to  request exceptions from the criteria.", "CMS allows MAOs whose proposed networks fail to meet the adequacy  criteria for a particular provider type in a county to request an exception  from the criteria.

If MAOs\u2019 provider networks do not initially pass the  automated checks, CMS notifies them and requests updated data, if  applicable. HPMS then generates a report that MAOs can use to prepare  exception requests for each provider type deemed insufficient. According   to CMS, exceptions are intended to be granted under limited  circumstances, primarily when its network criteria are not in line with local  patterns of care. CMS\u2019s standard operating procedure for reviewing  exceptions states that they may be allowed when an insufficient number  of providers are located in or near the county, the pattern of care in the  county does not support the need to have the required number of  providers, or the services of the provider type can be rendered by another  provider type.", "For each exception request, CMS requires MAOs to submit a detailed  plan for ensuring access to the services of the provider type for which the  exception is being made.

According to the reviewers we interviewed, it can take 5 minutes to up to  a day to review each one, depending on the experience and workload of  the reviewer, the complexity and thoroughness of the exception request,  and the availability of providers in a county. The reviewers may use  Internet search engines and mapping tools to confirm whether providers  are at the listed location and may call providers to determine the local  pattern of care in a county. Some reviewers told us they also examine  state and local medical board information, while others said they perform  only spot checks for well-written exception requests. Asked if they  considered analyzing Medicare FFS claims data for patterns of care,  reviewers from one regional office said such analyses would not be  helpful in determining where a county\u2019s beneficiaries customarily obtain  health services.

For contract years 2013 through 2015,  less densely populated counties accounted for most exception requests.  Approximately 23 percent of the requests were for provider types in  counties with extreme access considerations, 24 percent in rural counties,  18 percent in micro counties, 27 percent in metro counties, and 8 percent  in large metro counties. Although the time and distance requirements are  more generous in less populated areas, the pattern of care may be  unusual.

Of  the 2,304 exception requests CMS reviewed over the past 3 years,  specialists accounted for 78 percent, facilities for 20 percent, and primary  care providers for 2 percent. While the CMS approval rate for exception  requests was 78 percent for facilities, it was 95 percent and 96 percent for  specialists and primary care providers, respectively.

Officials from three of the five regional offices told us  that account managers regularly prompt MAOs to discuss network issues,  such as pending provider contract negotiations; officials at the remaining  two told us that network adequacy discussions occur only on an as- needed basis.", "Moreover, CMS does not routinely collect or review provider network  information from MAOs not subject to the application process, leaving  nearly all\u2014over 99 percent\u2014of ongoing county-based provider networks  unexamined against the current MA criteria. Internal control standards  stipulate that agencies should establish and operate ongoing monitoring  activities to assess quality performance over time; the standards also  note that operating information is needed to determine whether agencies  are achieving compliance with requirements under various laws and  regulations. Because a plan\u2019s network providers and enrollees change  from year to year, the lack of regular review means CMS cannot be  assured that MAO networks continue to be adequate, providing sufficient  access for enrollees. CMS also never examined the networks that existed  before 2011 against the current network adequacy criteria, and as a  result, lacks the requisite information needed for proper oversight of  network adequacy in the MA program. Lewin analyzed samples of these  pre-existing networks and found that most, but not all, of the provider  network specialties met current adequacy requirements. Lewin further  concluded that more regular assessments of provider networks against  the current network adequacy criteria could help ensure that MA plans  continue to meet network adequacy criteria and would not be overly  burdensome for MAOs. Lewin recommended to CMS that the agency  develop a rigorous network monitoring program to ensure that all MAO  networks\u2014not just those entering a county for the first time\u2014continue to  meet network adequacy criteria. For example, Lewin suggested that   CMS consider evaluating each MA plan on a cyclical basis, such as every  3 years. Additionally, officials from two regional offices noted that more  regular assessments of adequacy based on HSD data submissions would  be an effective monitoring tool.

In deciding whether a network reduction is significant,  CMS has not provided any explicit criteria but directed MAOs to take a  conservative approach. According to CMS, leaving the definition of  significant to each MAO stems from the lack of consensus among  stakeholders\u2014including beneficiary advocates and professional  associations\u2014about how to define a significant network change.", "In the event of a self-disclosed significant change, CMS requires MAOs to  provide information demonstrating their continued compliance with  network adequacy criteria, such as through the submission of updated  HSD tables or automated reports. In addition, it requires MAOs to develop  and submit a plan for ensuring continuity of care for affected enrollees. If  CMS determines that access for a large number of enrollees has been  impaired as a result of a significant network reduction, the agency may  approve an SEP. This would allow those enrollees to switch MAOs or  enroll in FFS Medicare outside the annual open election period. To make  this determination, CMS takes into account the number of enrollees  affected, the size of the area served, the timing of the termination, and  information related to the enrollee notification, but also requires that  enrollees demonstrate that they were affected by the loss of their network  provider. Some CMS officials we spoke with asserted that MAOs have an  incentive to self-disclose major provider network reductions because they  are subject to more severe compliance actions if they are not forthcoming  about changes impacting access to care.

Because CMS neither requires specific information elements  nor reviews notifications, enrollees may receive inconsistent and  potentially confusing or inaccurate information when their providers are  terminated from MAO networks. For example, communication we  examined indicated that enrollees had been told by their MAO to select a  new provider long before the effective termination date for their current  provider.

CMS does not consider whether  an MAO\u2019s contracted providers are part-time, work at their listed  locations, or are taking new patients.

Lewin\u2014the agency contractor that developed  the criteria\u2014explained that CMS had an original list of provider types that  it reviewed to see if the categorizations were appropriate. They found that  CMS\u2019s list was mostly aligned with frequently used facility types.

The five county classifications are  based on population and density estimates from U.S. Census Bureau and  Office of Management and Budget data. A county must meet both the  population and density indicators to be included as that county type. CMS  then multiplies three variables to determine the minimum number of  providers. The first variable is the 95th percentile of MA market  penetration rates for each county type. CMS chose the 95th percentile to  estimate market share through work conducted by Lewin, which  examined the market penetration in managed care and network-based  private fee-for-service (FFS) plans. The percentiles are updated each  year based on current enrollment. County type classifications and each  county\u2019s respective percentile for contract year 2016 are listed in table 5.", "The second variable in the formula is the number of Medicare  beneficiaries\u2014those in MA and FFS\u2014in a specific county. Each year,  CMS updates the total number of beneficiaries in each county. This  variable is multiplied with that year\u2019s 95th percentile of MA market  penetration in the respective county type to determine the number of  beneficiaries an MAO could reasonably serve in its initial year in the  proposed county. For example, the 95th percentile for metro counties in  contract year 2016 was 12.1 percent. For an MAO seeking to enter that  county, the 95th percentile (0.121) would be multiplied by the total  number of Medicare beneficiaries in the county the MAO proposes to  enter to develop the number of beneficiaries the MAO must cover.", "The third and final variable in the calculation is the established ratios of  provider types required per 1,000 beneficiaries for each county type. CMS  bases the established ratios on primary and secondary research of  utilization patterns and clinical needs of beneficiaries. To calculate the  minimum number of each provider type in each county, CMS multiplies  the ratio for each provider type by the number of beneficiaries an MAO  must cover and then rounds up to the nearest whole number. Table 6  illustrates the calculation for a minimum number of providers for primary  care in Muscogee, Georgia, which is a metro county.", "For maximum travel time and distance, CMS requires that MAOs ensure  that their networks meet specific geographic metrics. CMS uses geo- mapping software to determine the distance between the locations of  beneficiaries\u2019 addresses and network provider practices.
