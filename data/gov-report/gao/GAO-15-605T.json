For the 2014 report, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and USDA guidance; monitored online advertisements to sell formula in four metropolitan areas; reviewed a non-generalizable sample of policy manuals from 25 states, selected for their varied WIC caseloads and geography; and interviewed USDA and state and local officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) does not have data to determine the national extent of online sales of infant formula provided by the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Nevertheless, state WIC officials and GAO's own limited monitoring suggest that some WIC participants have offered formula for sale online. Of the officials we spoke with in 12 states, those from 5 states said that they have found WIC formula offered for sale online by participants. GAO monitored one online classified advertisements website in four large metropolitan areas for 30 days and found 2 posts in which individuals attempted to sell formula specifically identified as WIC\u2014from among 2,726 that advertised infant formula generally. A larger number, 481 posts, advertised formula generally consistent with the formula brand, type, container volume, and amount provided to WIC participants, but these posts did not indicate the source of the formula. Because WIC participants purchase the same formula brands and types from stores as non-WIC customers, monitoring attempted online sales of WIC formula can present a challenge. State officials GAO spoke with cited other challenges to monitoring online sales, such as the fact that individuals posting formula for sale online are able to remain relatively anonymous, and their posts may contain insufficient information to allow staff to identify them as WIC participants.", "USDA has taken some steps toward helping states prevent and address online sales of WIC formula but has not collected information that could assist states in determining cost-effective approaches for monitoring such sales. In December 2014, GAO found that USDA had not specifically directed states to tell participants that selling WIC formula was a participant violation, which could have led to participants making these sales without realizing doing so was against program rules. GAO also found that states were not required to report their procedures for controlling participant violations\u2014including sales of WIC benefits\u2014to USDA, leaving the department without information on state efforts to ensure program integrity in this area. Through interviews with state and local WIC agency officials from 12 states, GAO found that states varied in the method and level of effort devoted to monitoring these sales and lacked information to determine cost-effective approaches for monitoring. Without information on the national extent of online sales of WIC benefits or effective monitoring techniques, both USDA and the states are unable to target their resources effectively to address related risks. As a result, GAO recommended that USDA require state agencies to inform participants of the prohibition against selling WIC formula and describe to USDA how they identify attempted sales. GAO also recommended that USDA collect information about the national extent of attempted online sales of WIC formula benefits and determine cost-effective techniques states can use to monitor them. In response, USDA issued revised guidance in April 2015 stating that it expects states to (1) inform participants that selling WIC benefits violates program rules and (2) report their procedures for monitoring attempted WIC benefit sales to USDA. Also in April 2015, USDA officials reported that although they had not yet taken action to assess the national extent of online sales and determine cost-effective techniques to monitor them, they planned to explore ways to do so."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommended, in December 2014, that USDA better ensure WIC participants are aware of the prohibition against selling formula, require states to describe how they identify attempted sales, and assess online sales, including techniques for monitoring.

In fiscal year 2013,  the federal government spent approximately $6.5 billion on WIC, which  provided food, nutrition education, breastfeeding support, and health and  social service referrals to about 9 million low-income pregnant and  postpartum women, infants, and young children. U.S. Department of  Agriculture (USDA) regulations establish the types and maximum  amounts of food, including infant formula, participants may receive, and  state and local agencies administering the program establish policies and  procedures for determining specific amounts of WIC foods\u2014at or below  these maximum levels\u2014to provide to participants. WIC rules prohibit  participants from selling foods they receive from the program, including  infant formula, and participants who violate WIC rules are subject to  various sanctions, including repayment of the value of benefits and  disqualification from the program. In our 1999 study of WIC fraud and  abuse, we found that there were relatively few documented cases  nationwide of participants selling infant formula for cash, and generally  low rates of WIC participant fraud overall, in contrast to the relatively high  rate of WIC vendor fraud. However, the use of the Internet as a  marketplace has substantially increased in recent years, and news  reports suggest that some participants have attempted to sell WIC  formula online. Improper use of WIC benefits undermines the integrity of  the program and its ability to provide key nutrition assistance and services  to vulnerable populations.", "My testimony today will focus on (1) what is known about the extent to  which participants sell WIC formula online, and (2) what steps USDA has  taken to prevent and address the online sale of WIC formula.", "This statement is based on a report we issued in December 2014  addressing online sales of infant formula and includes updates conducted  in April 2015 on the actions USDA is taking to address our prior  recommendations. For our December 2014 report, we collected and  analyzed information using a variety of methods. We reviewed relevant  federal laws, regulations, and guidance from USDA to determine  requirements related to the provision of formula to infants receiving WIC  benefits, as well as to identify federal, state, and local roles related to  preventing and addressing online sales of WIC formula. In addition, we  assessed USDA\u2019s controls against GAO Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government. To determine the role USDA regulations and  guidance play in preventing and addressing online sales of WIC formula,  we reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 25 state WIC policy and  procedure manuals. While not generalizable to the U.S., we selected  these states primarily for their varied WIC caseloads and diverse  geographic locations. Also, as a group, these states provide services to  approximately two-thirds of all WIC participants in the U.S. We also  monitored online classified advertisements offering formula for sale using  one popular e-commerce website in four metropolitan areas over 30 days  between June and July 2014. We selected these areas based on (1) high  number of births, (2) high WIC caseloads, and (3) geographic dispersion.  In addition, we interviewed USDA officials, as well as 17 state and 2 local  WIC officials representing 12 states. More detailed information on our  objectives, scope, and methodology for our work can be found in the  issued report.

Authorized foods must be prescribed from the food  packages according to the category and nutritional needs of the  participants. USDA recently revised the food packages to align with  current nutrition science, largely based on recommendations of the  National Academies\u2019 Institute of Medicine.", "Infants who are not exclusively breastfeeding can receive formula from  WIC until they turn 1 year of age. While federal regulations specify the  maximum amount of formula different categories of infants are authorized  to receive, state and local agency staff also have some flexibility in  determining precise amounts to provide, depending on an infant\u2019s  nutritional needs. Staff at local WIC agencies play a critical role in  determining infants\u2019 feeding categories, and they have the authority to  provide them with less formula than the maximum amount allowed for  each category, if nutritionally warranted.

As part of its federal monitoring and  oversight obligations, USDA annually reviews the state plan for each  state WIC agency, which provides important information about the  agency\u2019s objectives and procedures for all aspects of administering WIC  for the coming fiscal year.

Specifically, we identified 2,726 posts that  included the term \u201cformula,\u201d and 2 of these posts explicitly stated that the  origin of the formula was WIC.

However, these posts did not state that the advertised formula was from  WIC, and while the formula offered for sale was generally consistent with  formula provided through WIC, we could not identify it as such.  Specifically, during our 30 days of monitoring formula advertisements, we  applied a number of criteria to narrow the broad pool of advertisements to  identify those that may have been selling WIC formula. First, because  state agencies are generally required to award single-source contracts for  WIC formula, we searched for posts advertising formula brands that  matched the state-specific WIC-contracted brand. We found that about  three-quarters (2,013 posts) fit this criterion. We then reviewed each of  these posts and determined that 346 of the posts fit each of three  additional criteria, which we chose because they are generally consistent  with WIC formula provided to infant participants.  1. The formula type, such as soy or sensitive, advertised for sale was  equivalent to one of the types provided to WIC participants in the state in  which the posting was made.  2. The volume of the formula container advertised was equivalent to the  volume of one of the containers provided to WIC participants in the state  in which the posting was made.   3. The amount of formula advertised represented a large proportion of the  maximum amount of formula authorized to be provided to fully formula- fed WIC infant participants each month, averaged across all ages.", "Beyond the 346 posts that matched these three criteria, we found another  135 that met at least one, but not all, of the criteria.

For example, a WIC participant may obtain the infant\u2019s full  monthly allotment of formula at one time; alternatively, non-WIC  parents may purchase formula in bulk at a lower cost to save money.  In either case, if the infant then stops drinking that type of formula,  parents may attempt to sell the unused formula.", "Individuals posting formula for sale online are able to remain relatively  anonymous, so WIC staff may not have sufficient information to link  the online advertisement with a WIC participant.

For example, in 2013, USDA proposed  regulations that would expand the definition of program violation to  include offering to sell WIC benefits, specifically including sales or  attempts made online. Earlier, in 2012, USDA issued guidance to WIC  state agencies clarifying that the sale of, or offer to sell, WIC foods  verbally, in print, or online is a participant violation. This guidance stated  that, in accordance with federal regulations, USDA expects states to  sanction and issue claims against participants for all program violations,  but it did not provide direction on ways to prevent online sales of WIC  foods, including formula. That same year, USDA also sent letters to four  e-commerce websites\u2014through which individuals advertise the sale of  infant formula\u2014requesting that they notify their customers that the sale of  WIC benefits is prohibited, and two of the companies agreed to post such  a notification.", "More generally, USDA has highlighted the importance of ensuring WIC  program integrity through guidance issued in recent years aimed at  encouraging participants to report WIC program fraud, waste, and abuse  to the USDA Office of the Inspector General (OIG). For example, in 2012,  USDA disseminated a poster developed by the OIG and attached it to a  guidance document describing its purpose, which includes informing WIC  participants and staff how to report violations of laws and regulations  relating to USDA programs. The following year, USDA issued additional  guidance that encouraged states to add contact information for the OIG to  WIC checks or vouchers, or to their accompanying folders or sleeves.  USDA indicated that both guidance documents were intended to facilitate  participant reports of suspected fraud, waste, and abuse to the OIG, but  neither specifically directed states to publicize the fact that attempting to  sell WIC benefits, either online or elsewhere, qualifies as an activity that  should be reported.", "Although WIC regulations require that state agencies establish  procedures to control participant violations, we found that states vary in  whether their required procedures include informing participants of the  prohibition against selling WIC formula. The WIC regulations require that  all participants (or their caretakers) be informed of their rights and  responsibilities and sign a written statement of rights and obligations  during the certification process. The regulations also require certain  program violations to be included in the information provided on rights  and responsibilities. However, according to USDA officials, the sale of  WIC food benefits is not required to be included, nor do the regulations  require participants be informed of this violation through other means. In  our review of rights and responsibilities statements from 25 states\u2019 WIC  policy and procedure manuals, we found that 7 did not require local  agency staff to inform participants that selling WIC benefits is against  program rules. Inconsistent communication to participants about this  violation conflicts with federal internal control standards, and  participants who are unaware of this prohibition may sell excess formula  online, thus inappropriately using program resources. Based on these  findings, we recommended in our December 2014 report that USDA  instruct state agencies to include in the rights and responsibilities  statement that participants are not allowed to sell WIC food benefits,  including online. USDA agreed with this recommendation, and in April  2015, department officials reported that they intend to revise WIC  regulations to require state agencies to include in participant rights and  responsibilities statements the prohibition against selling WIC food  benefits online. In the interim, USDA included this as a best practice in  the 2016 WIC State Plan guidance it disseminated to state agencies on  April 6, 2015. Department officials indicated that USDA expects states to  move forward on this action and not wait for regulations.", "In addition, we found that states vary in the ways they identify attempted  sales of WIC formula through monitoring efforts, and USDA has not  collected information on states\u2019 efforts to address these sales. Of the  officials that we spoke to from 12 states, those from 9 states mentioned  that they regularly monitor online advertisements. However, the method  of monitoring and the level of effort devoted to this activity varied across  states. For example, officials in one state said that a number of staff  within the state office, as well as a number of those in local agencies,  search social media websites daily. In contrast, officials from another  state said that staff spend about a half day each week monitoring online  sites for attempted sales of WIC food benefits, and an official from a  different state said that staff monitor for such sales only when time allows.  A USDA official told us that the department would like to provide more  support to states in pursuing likely cases of participant fraud related to the  online sale of WIC food benefits, but it has not yet determined how to be  of assistance.", "USDA officials indicated they believe states are monitoring attempted  sales of WIC formula online to identify this participant violation; however,  the department has not gathered information on the status of state efforts  to address online sales. Although USDA officials review each WIC state  plan annually to ensure that it is consistent with federal requirements, a  state\u2019s procedures for identifying participant violations are not among the  required elements for WIC state plans included in federal statute and  regulations. Because USDA does not require that state agencies  document their procedures for identifying participant sales of WIC foods,  including online sales of infant formula, USDA does not know whether or  how states are working to ensure program integrity in this area. The fact  that the department does not work more directly with states on this issue  is also inconsistent with federal internal control standards. We  recommended in our December 2014 report that USDA require state  agencies to articulate their procedures for identifying attempted sales of  WIC food benefits in their WIC state plans and analyze the information to  ascertain the national extent of state efforts. USDA agreed with this  recommendation, and department officials reported in April 2015 that they  intend to revise WIC regulations to require state agencies to include in  state plans their procedures for identifying attempted sales of WIC food  benefits. In the interim, USDA included this as a best practice in the 2016  WIC State Plan guidance it disseminated to state agencies on April 6,  2015.", "USDA and the states also lack information to determine cost-effective  approaches for monitoring these attempted sales. According to USDA,  state, and local WIC officials, because of the various challenges state  WIC staff face in distinguishing between WIC-obtained formula sales and  other sales, the return on investment for monitoring these sales is low.  One USDA official noted that it is difficult for states to prove that  participants are selling WIC food benefits, which increases the amount of  time and effort state staff need to spend to address these cases.  Officials from one state WIC agency and one local WIC agency we spoke  to said that efforts by state and local agency staff to identify and address  online WIC formula sales result in few confirmed cases and draw away  scarce resources from other aspects of administering the program. One  USDA official said that states that sanction a participant for attempting to  sell WIC formula without sufficient evidence that it occurred will likely  have the violation overturned during the administrative appeal process.  These cases also appear unlikely to result in court involvement, as when  we asked the 19 officials from 12 states how these cases were  addressed, only one said that a couple had gone through the legal  system. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should  design and implement internal controls based on the related costs and  benefits. According to USDA, because of the substantial risks associated  with improper payments and fraud related to WIC vendor transactions,  both USDA and the states have focused their oversight efforts in recent  years on addressing vulnerabilities in the management of this area, rather  than focusing on possible participant violations. However, because the  use of the Internet as a marketplace has substantially increased in recent  years and the national extent of online sales of WIC food benefits is  unknown, USDA and the states have insufficient information to assess  the benefits of oversight efforts related to this participant violation.  Because of this, we recommended in our December 2014 report that  USDA collect information to assess the national extent of attempted  online sales of WIC formula benefits and determine cost-effective  techniques states can use to monitor online classified advertisements.  USDA agreed with this recommendation, and department officials  reported in April 2015 that they plan to explore ways to assess the extent  of online sales of WIC formula and identify and share best practices, cost- effective techniques, or new approaches for monitoring online  advertisements with state agencies. To do this, they noted that they will  draw on funds designated for addressing high-priority programmatic  issues. We believe this approach will help states to strike the appropriate  balance of costs and benefits when determining how to target their  program integrity resources.", "Chairman Rokita, Ranking Member Fudge, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
