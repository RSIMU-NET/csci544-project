To varying degrees, each of these entities performs tasks associated with three of the administrative processes essential to the current operation of the school meal programs: (1) processing applications, (2) verifying income eligibility, and (3) counting the total number of meals served and claiming reimbursement. Some local program managers said that these administrative tasks are burdensome and costly. However, data on the costs of these tasks are not gathered or maintained. Because the Congress will consider reauthorizing the National School Lunch and the School Breakfast Programs in 2003, you asked us to develop cost estimates at the federal, state, and local (school food authorities and schools) levels associated with processing applications for free and reduced-price meals, verifying eligibility for free and reduced-price meals, and counting all reimbursable meals and snacks and claiming federal reimbursement.", "To obtain data on the costs of administering these school meal programs, we visited selected locations, including 5 state agencies, 10 school food authorities in public school districts, and 2 schools at each district. We chose sites that would provide a range of characteristics, such as geographical location, size of student enrollment, and type of meal counting system. We also obtained information from officials at FNS headquarters and one regional office. We interviewed program managers and staff at these locations to obtain information on tasks associated with the application, verification, and meal counting and reimbursement claiming processes for the 2000-01 school year. On the basis of this information, we calculated estimated costs relative to program dollars. (See app. I for further details about our scope and methodology and app. II for information on program dollars.) We did not verify the information collected for this study; however, we made follow-up calls in cases where data were missing or appeared unusual.

The school lunch and school breakfast programs are among the largest of these programs. The National School Lunch Program was established in 1946; a 1998 expansion added snacks served in after-school and enrichment programs. In fiscal year 2000, more than 27 million children at over 97,000 public and nonprofit private schools and residential child care institutions received lunches through this program. The School Breakfast Program began as a pilot project in 1966 and was made permanent in 1975. The program had an average daily participation of more than 7.5 million children in about 74,000 public and private schools and residential child care institutions in fiscal year 2000. According to program regulations, states can designate schools as severe need schools if 40 percent or more of lunches are served free or at a reduced price, and if reimbursement rates do not cover the costs of the school\u2019s breakfast program. Severe need schools were generally reimbursed 21 cents more for free and reduced-price breakfasts in school year 2000-01.", "The National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs provide federally subsidized meals for all children; with the size of the subsidy dependent on the income level of participating households. Any child at a participating school may purchase a meal through the school meals programs. However, children from households with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are eligible for free meals, and those from households with incomes between 130 percent and 185 percent of the poverty level are eligible for reduced-price meals. Similarly, children from households that participate in three federal programs\u2014 Food Stamps, Temporary Assistant for Needy Families, or Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations\u2014are eligible to receive free or reduced-price meals. School districts participating in the programs receive cash assistance and commodity foods from USDA for all reimbursable meals they serve. Meals are required to meet specific nutrition standards. For example, school lunches must provide one-third of the recommended dietary allowances of protein, vitamins A and C, iron, calcium, and calories. Schools have a great deal of flexibility in deciding which menu planning approach will enable them to comply with these standards. Schools receive different cash reimbursement amounts depending on the category of meals served. For example, a free lunch receives a higher cash reimbursement amount than a reduced-price lunch, and a lunch for which a child pays full price receives the smallest reimbursement. (See table 2.) Children can be charged no more than 40 cents for reduced-price meals, but there are no restrictions on the prices that schools can charge for full-price meals.", "Various agencies and entities at the federal, state, and local levels have administrative responsibilities under these programs. FNS administers the school meal programs at the federal level. In general, FNS headquarters staff carry out policy decisions, such as updating regulations, providing guidance and monitoring, and reporting program review results. Regional staff interact with state and school food authorities, and provide technical assistance and oversight. State agencies, usually departments of education, are responsible for the statewide administration of the program, including disbursing federal funds and monitoring the program. At the local level, two entities are involved\u2014the individual school and organizations called school food authorities, which manage school food services for one or more schools. School food authorities have flexibility in how they carry out their administrative responsibilities and can decide whether to delegate some tasks to the schools.", "To receive program reimbursement, schools and school food authorities must follow federal guidelines for processing applications for free and reduced-price meals, verifying eligibility for free or reduced-price meals, and counting and reporting all reimbursable meals served, whether full- price, reduced-price, or free. This means processing an application for most participants in the free and reduced-price programs, verifying eligibility for at least a sample of approved applications, and keeping daily track of meals provided. These processes comprise only a small part of the federal school meal programs\u2019 administrative requirements. According to a USDA report, school food authorities spend the majority of their time on other administrative processes, including daily meal production records and maintaining records documenting that the program is nonprofit as required by regulations. The data we were asked to obtain focus on the participant eligibility and meal counting and reimbursement processes and do not include estimates for other administrative tasks, which are outside the scope of the request.", "The federal budget provides funds separate from program dollars to pay for administrative processes at the federal and state level. In contrast, officials at the local level pay for administrative costs from program dollars that include federal and state funding and student meal payments.", "Districts and schools that participate in the school meal programs vary in terms of locale, size of enrollment, percent of children approved for free and reduced-price meals, and types of meal counting systems used.

Furthermore, instead of verifying a sample of applications, school food authorities may choose to verify all approved applications. Also, school food authorities can require households to provide information to verify eligibility for free and reduced-price meals at the time of application. This information is to be used to verify applications only after eligibility has been determined based on the completed application alone.

During the verification process, generally, household income information on the application is compared with related documents, such as pay stubs or social security payment information. When the income information in the application cannot be confirmed or when households do not respond to the request for verification documentation, the eligibility status of children in the program is changed. That is, children are switched to other meal categories, such as from free to full price. Children can also be determined to be eligible for higher benefits, such as for free meals, rather than reduced-price meals. At the locations we visited, the verification process resulted in changes to the eligibility status for a number of children. For example, at one school food authority in a small town with about half of its children approved for free and reduced-price school meals, 65 of 2,728 approved applications were selected for verification, and 24 children were moved from the free meals category to either the reduced-price or full-priced meals categories, while 1 child was moved to the free category. At another school food authority in the urban fringe of a large city, with about 40 percent of its children approved for free and reduced-price school meals, 40 of about 1,100 approved applications were selected for verification and 8 children were moved to higher-priced meal categories.

A USDA report, based on the agency\u2019s data on the number of children approved for free meals and data from the U. S. Bureau of Census, indicates that about 27 percent more children are approved for free meals than are income-eligible. As such, the federal reimbursements for the school meals program may not be proper. Furthermore, some other programs that serve children in poverty distribute funds or resources based on the number of children approved to receive free or reduced-price meals. For example, in school year 1999-2000 nine states used free and reduced-price meals data to distribute Title I funds to their small districts (those serving areas with fewer than 20,000 total residents). In addition, districts typically use free and reduced- price meals data to distribute Title I funds among schools.

The costs per program dollar ranged from 2 cents to 14 cents, compared with the costs per program dollar for the other processes, which were much more consistent\u2014from about half a cent to 3 cents for the application process and from less than 1 cent to 1 cent for the verification process.", "Various factors may contribute to this range of costs at the local level. For example, larger enrollments may allow economies of scale that lower the cost of food service operations. Use of an electronic meal counting system, as opposed to a manual system, has the potential to affect meal counting costs, since electronic systems require the purchase of equipment, software, and ongoing maintenance. Food service procedures may also have a bearing on costs, such as the number and pay levels of cashiers and other staff performing meal counting and reimbursement claiming tasks.", "The interaction of these factors and our limited number of selected sites prevents a clear explanation for the differences in estimated costs per program dollar incurred at the selected locations reviewed, except in a few instances. For example, at the local level, the school with the highest combined meal counting cost per program dollar for the school and its share of the school food authority costs (14 cents) had an enrollment of 636 children, relatively few of its children approved for free and reduced- price meals (14 percent), and a manual meal counting system. The school with the lowest combined meal counting cost (2 cents per program dollar) had about twice the enrollment, 96 percent of its children approved for free and reduced-price meals, and an electronic meal counting system. Both schools were elementary schools in mid-size city locales. For the remaining 18 schools in the sample, we saw no distinct relationship between cost and these factors."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service for review and comment.

To the extent that we could, we excluded from our analyses other federal child nutrition programs and nonprofit private schools and residential child care institutions, which also participate in the school meals programs. Our review included the paper application process and did not include the direct certification of children for free and reduced-price school meals. Our focus was school year 2000-01, the most recent year for which data were available. The data we collected relate to that year.", "National data on the costs of the application, verification, and meal counting and reimbursement claiming processes are not available for the federal, state, or local levels, since these costs are not tracked separately. Therefore, we developed estimates of these costs on the basis of cost information provided by program managers and staff.", "To obtain data on the costs related to applying for free and reduced-price school meals, verifying approved applications, and counting meals and claiming reimbursements, we visited selected locations, including 5 state agencies, 10 school food authorities in public school districts, and 2 schools at each district. We chose sites that would provide a range of characteristics, such as geographical location, the size of student enrollment, the rate of children approved for free and reduced-price meals, and the type of meal counting system. We selected districts with schools that were located in rural areas, small towns, mid-size central cities, urban fringe areas of mid-size and large cities, and large central cities based on locale categories assigned to their respective districts by the National Center for Education Statistics. To include districts of various sizes in our study, we selected 2 districts in each selected state\u20141 with enrollment over 10,000 and 1 with enrollment under 10,000, except in Ohio. In Ohio, we selected 2 districts with enrollments of less than 5,000, since almost 90 percent of the public school districts nationwide have enrollments under that amount. We also selected districts with rates of children approved for free and reduced-price meals that ranged from 16.7 to 74.5 percent and schools with rates that ranged from 10.5 to 96.5 percent.", "We worked with state and school food authority officials at our selected districts to select a mix of schools that had either manual or electronic meal counting systems. Electronic meal counting systems were used at 9 selected schools.", "We also obtained information from officials at the Food and Nutrition Service\u2019s (FNS) headquarters and one regional office. We selected one regional office that, according to FNS officials, had the best data available to develop estimates for the application, verification, and meal counting processes.", "We developed interview guides to use at selected sites. We also met with FNS and professional association officials to obtain their comments on these interview guides, and we revised them where appropriate. Using these guides, we interviewed program managers and staff at the selected locations to obtain information on tasks associated with the application, verification, and meal counting and reimbursement claiming processes for the 2000-01 school year. We obtained estimated labor and benefit costs associated with these tasks. We also obtained other estimated nonlabor costs such as those for translating, copying, printing, mailing, data processing, travel, hardware, software, and automated systems development costs. On the basis of this information, we calculated estimated costs associated with each process, that is, application, verification, and meal counting and reimbursement claiming.", "Using our cost estimates, we calculated costs relative to program dollars. Program dollars at the federal level for both FNS headquarters and the one region included the value of reimbursements for school meals and commodities, both entitlement and bonus, for public and nonprofit private schools and residential child care institutions because FNS was not able to provide program dollars specific to public schools. However, according to FNS officials, reimbursements and commodities provided to public schools make up the vast majority of these dollars. Program dollars at the state level included this federal funding specific to public school districts for school meals and state school meal funding. Information specific to public school districts is available at the state level because claims are made separately by each school food authority. At the local level, program dollars included the amounts children paid for the meals as well as federal and state funding. Since some school food authorities could not provide the dollar value of commodities used at selected schools, we assigned a dollar value of commodities to each of these schools based on their proportion of federal reimbursements. We included federal and state program funding and the amounts children paid for the meals because these are the revenues related to the sale of reimbursable meals.", "Because the definition of program dollars differed by level, we were unable to total the costs for the three levels\u2014federal, state, and local. However, since the definition of program dollars was the same for school food authorities and schools, we were able to calculate the cost per program dollar at the local level for each school. To calculate these costs we: (1) divided the school program dollars by the school food authority program dollars; (2) multiplied the resulting amount by the total school food authority costs for each process\u2014application, verification, and meal counting and reimbursement claiming\u2014to determine the portion of the costs for each process at the school food authority that was attributable to each selected school; (3) added these costs to the total costs for each of the schools; and (4) divided the resulting total amount by the program dollars for each selected school to arrive at the cost per program dollar at the local level for each school.", "We calculated a median cost per program dollar for school food authorities and schools separately for each process\u2014application, verification, and meal counting and reimbursement claiming. We also calculated a median cost for each process for school food authorities and schools combined to arrive at local level medians for each process.", "The cost estimates do not include indirect costs. For 2 of the 10 school food authorities, indirect rates were not available and in other cases, the rates varied significantly due to differing financial management and accounting policies. Also, for 2 of the 10 school food authorities, including indirect rate calculations could have resulted in some costs being double counted because during our interviews with staff, they provided estimates for many of the tasks that would have been included in the indirect rates.", "Depreciation costs for equipment, such as computer hardware and software, were generally not calculated nor maintained by states and school food authorities. Therefore, we obtained the costs for equipment purchased in the year under review. We did not obtain costs for equipment at the federal level because these costs could not be reasonably estimated, since equipment was used for purposes beyond the processes under review.", "We obtained information on the verification pilot projects from FNS officials. We also obtained information from the American School Food Service Association, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and the Food Research and Action Center on several options related to the program, one of which was the same as one of the pilot projects.", "We did not verify the information collected for this study.
