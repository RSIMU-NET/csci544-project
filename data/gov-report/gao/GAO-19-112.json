This report examines the extent to which certain agencies' improper payment risk assessments for selected programs provided a reasonable basis for determining their susceptibility to significant improper payments. GAO analyzed the most recent risk assessments, from 2015 through 2017, for the following five programs: USDA's Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage programs; HHS's Head Start; DOJ's Law Enforcement; and Treasury's Interest on the Public Debt and Home Affordable Modification Program.

GAO found that the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Treasury (Treasury), Justice (DOJ), and Agriculture (USDA) assessed the five programs GAO selected for review as at low risk for susceptibility to significant improper payments; however, HHS, Treasury, and DOJ lacked sufficient documentation to assess the extent to which their risk assessments provided a reasonable basis for their risk determinations. On the other hand, USDA's quantitative risk assessment of its program's susceptibility to significant improper payments provided a reasonable basis for its low-risk determination.", "Although HHS, Treasury, and DOJ considered, among other factors, the nine risk factors from IPIA and Office of Management and Budget guidance, they did not document or effectively demonstrate how these factors affected their programs' susceptibility to significant improper payments. These programs' risk assessments did not contain sufficient documentation to determine how the agencies arrived at their risk determinations for each risk factor, or how the total scores for all risk factors led to low-risk determinations. For example, HHS determined that its Head Start program was at high risk for several risk factors\u2014including complexity per transaction and volume of payments\u2014but did not document how these high-risk ratings informed its overall determination that Head Start was not susceptible to significant improper payments.", "Further, the agencies did not have documentation to demonstrate how they determined the weighting of each risk factor or the risk level ranges from the risk assessment templates as they relate to the programs' susceptibility to significant improper payments. For example, based on GAO's analysis of Treasury's risk assessment template, the agency could identify areas of risk related to each of the nine risk factors. But because of the assigned weights given to each risk factor, Treasury's final risk calculation would still not determine the program to be at high risk of susceptibility to significant improper payments. Without documenting the basis for the assigned weights, Treasury cannot demonstrate, and GAO cannot determine, that its process for determining its programs' susceptibility to significant improper payments was reasonable. Until HHS, Treasury, and DOJ revise their risk assessment processes to help ensure that they result in reliable assessments, they cannot be certain whether their programs are susceptible to significant improper payments and therefore whether they are required to estimate the amount of improper payments.", "GAO also found that HHS did not assess many of its programs and activities at least once during the 3-year period from fiscal years 2015 through 2017, as required by IPIA. Based on the analysis of HHS information, GAO identified at least 140 programs or activities that were not assessed during the 3-year period.

We analyzed this statute and guidance to  identify key criteria that agencies must meet when conducting improper  payment risk assessments. IPIA identifies seven risk factors and OMB  guidance includes two additional risk factors that agencies must consider,  at a minimum, in their improper payment risk assessments to determine  susceptibility to significant improper payments. IPIA also directs agencies  to conduct risk assessments for all programs and activities at least once  every 3 years. We also reviewed relevant internal control standards to  determine the relevant processes and procedures needed to help ensure  that agencies conduct effective improper payment risk assessments to  determine the susceptibility to significant improper payments.", "For this objective, we selected a nongeneralizable sample of 4 agencies  and five programs to review. To select the agencies, we considered data  for the 24 agencies subject to the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990  (CFO Act). Specifically, we considered the timing of the agencies\u2019  improper payment risk assessments, findings reported by the agencies\u2019  inspectors general (IG), the number of programs and activities for which  the agencies reported improper payment estimates for fiscal year 2017,  the types of programs and activities that the agencies administered, and  agency gross outlays in fiscal year 2017. To ensure we were including  agencies that had most recently conducted improper payment risk  assessments, we limited our selection to agencies that conducted  improper payment risk assessments for any programs or activities in  fiscal year 2017. In order to avoid duplicate efforts, we also eliminated  agencies that reported IG findings related to risk assessments. We then  selected a mix of agencies with and without improper payment estimates  for fiscal year 2017, and ultimately selected 4 agencies based primarily  on their fiscal year 2017 outlays for programs determined to be not  susceptible to improper payments. Specifically, we selected one agency  that did not report any improper payment estimates, one agency that  reported a few improper payment estimates (for three or fewer programs  or activities), and one agency that reported several improper payment  estimates (for five or more programs or activities). We also selected one  agency that administered eligibility-based programs in fiscal year 2017  because of the unique application and approval processes generally  associated with eligibility determinations and their increased risk of  improper payments.", "We then selected up to two programs or activities at each agency, for a  total of five programs.

Through our  selection process, we noted that the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) did not assess at least 140 of its programs and activities  in the 3-year period from fiscal years 2015 through 2017, and therefore  our program selection for HHS was limited to approximately 70 programs  or activities.", "To select programs, we considered outlay data, the timing of the most  recent improper payment risk assessment conducted for each program or  activity, and whether eligibility determinations were required for payments  under each program or activity. Our selection was primarily based on the  size of program and activity gross outlays reported for fiscal year 2017.  We focused on outlays because the overall impact of any issues identified  with an agency\u2019s risk assessment process may be greater for programs  and activities with higher gross outlays, as a higher volume of payments  or higher payment amounts could potentially involve higher improper  payments. Based on these data, we selected five programs for review.  Our findings are limited to the five selected programs and cannot be  generalized to all programs and activities at the 24 CFO Act agencies.  The agencies and relevant programs selected for review are shown in  table 3.", "We interviewed officials at the selected agencies on their processes for  conducting improper payment risk assessments and reviewed  documented policies and procedures. We obtained the most recent  improper payment risk assessments that the agencies conducted on the  selected programs during the latest 3-year period at the time of our  review (fiscal years 2015 through 2017). We then analyzed those risk  assessments against relevant IPIA requirements, OMB guidance, and  internal control standards to determine whether the agencies had  evaluated the appropriate risk factors for improper payments,  appropriately considered those risk factors in their risk assessments, and  provided a reasonable basis for the risk determination. For any agencies  that did not adhere to the improper payment risk assessment  requirements, lacked supporting documentation for their risk  assessments, or did not provide a reasonable basis for the risk  determinations, we interviewed appropriate agency officials to determine  the reasons they did not.
