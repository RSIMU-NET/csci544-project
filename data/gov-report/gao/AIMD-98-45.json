For example, each of FAA\u2019s 20 en route air traffic control facilities, which controls aircraft at the higher altitudes between airports, depends on about 50 interrelated computer systems to safely guide and direct aircraft. Similarly, each of FAA\u2019s almost 100 flight standards offices, responsible for inspecting and certifying various sectors of the aviation industry (e.g., commercial aircraft, repair stations, mechanics, pilot training schools, maintenance schools, pilots, and general aviation aircraft), are supported by over 30 mission-related safety database and analysis systems. Because of the complexity of the systems supporting FAA\u2019s mission, most of these systems are unique to FAA and not off-the-shelf systems that can be easily maintained by system vendors.", "FAA also has numerous, complex information processing interactions with various external organizations, including airlines, aircraft manufacturers, general aviation pilots, and other government agencies, such as the National Weather Service (NWS) and the Department of Defense. Over the years, these organizations and FAA have built vast networks of interrelated systems. For example, airlines\u2019 flight planning systems are linked to FAA\u2019s Enhanced Traffic Management System, which monitors flight plans nationwide, controls high traffic situations, and alerts airlines and airports to bring in more staff when there is extra traffic. As another example, FAA facilities rely on weather information from NWS ground sensors, radars, and satellites to control and route aircraft.", "FAA is headed by an administrator, who is supported by the chief counsel, assistant administrators responsible for each of its five staff offices, and associate administrators responsible for each of its seven lines of business. The chief counsel and five staff offices handle crosscutting management functions (e.g., system safety), while the seven lines of business are dedicated to specific services (e.g., airport funding). For the purpose of Year 2000 program planning, FAA refers to all of these 13 organizations as \u201clines of business\u201d.

For the past several decades, systems have typically used two digits to represent the year\u2014such as \u201c97\u201d for 1997\u2014to save electronic storage space and reduce operating costs. In such a format, however, 2000 is indistinguishable from 1900. Software and systems experts nationwide are concerned that this ambiguity could cause systems to malfunction in unforeseen ways, or to fail completely.", "Correcting this problem will not be easy or inexpensive, and must be done while such systems continue to operate. Many of the government\u2019s computer systems were developed 20 to 25 years ago, use a wide array of computer languages, and lack full documentation. Systems may contain up to several million lines of software code that must be examined for potential date-format problems.", "The enormous challenge involved in correcting these systems is not primarily technical, however, it is managerial. Agencies\u2019 success or failure will largely be determined by the quality of their program management and executive leadership. Top agency officials must understand the importance and urgency of this undertaking, and communicate this to all employees. The outcome of these efforts will also depend on the extent to which agencies have institutionalized key systems-development and program-management practices, and on their experience with such large-scale software development or conversion projects. Accordingly, agencies must first assess their information resources management capabilities and, where necessary, upgrade them. In so doing, they should consider soliciting the assistance of other organizations experienced in these endeavors.", "To assist agencies with these tasks, we have prepared a guide that discusses the scope of the challenge and offers a structured, step-by-step approach for reviewing and assessing an agency\u2019s readiness to handle the Year 2000 problem. The guide describes in detail the following five phases, each of which represents a major Year 2000 program activity or segment:", "Awareness. This phase entails defining the Year 2000 problem, gaining executive level support and sponsorship, and ensuring that everyone in the organization is fully aware of the issue. Also, during this phase, a Year 2000 program team is established and an overall strategy is developed.", "Assessment. This phase entails assessing the Year 2000 impact on the enterprise, identifying core business areas, inventorying and analyzing the systems supporting the core business areas, and prioritizing their conversion or replacement. Also, during this phase, contingency planning is initiated and the necessary resources are identified and secured.", "Renovation. This phase deals with converting, replacing, or eliminating selected systems and applications. In so doing, it is important to consider the complex interdependencies among the systems and applications.", "Validation. This phase deals with testing, verifying, and validating all converted or replaced systems and applications and ensuring that they perform as expected. This entails testing the performance, functionality, and integration of converted or replaced systems, applications, databases, and interfaces in an operational environment. Implementation.

This contributed to key awareness activities being delayed. Specifically, FAA experienced delays in establishing the agencywide Year 2000 plan needed for timely initiation and effective execution of the key awareness and assessment phase activities.", "Because FAA was slow to designate a program manager, it is only now finalizing its agencywide plan for achieving Year 2000 compliance. The September 1997 draft of this document outlines the FAA strategy and management approach to address the Year 2000 century date change. Specifically, it defines the Year 2000 program management structure and responsibilities; adopts the five-phase management process, including the awareness, assessment, renovation, validation, and implementation phases that are being used throughout the government to manage and measure agencies\u2019 Year 2000 programs; calls for awareness and assessment activities to be completed provides for completion of the three remaining program phases\u2014renovation, validation, and implementation; and establishes performance indicators and reporting requirements.", "FAA\u2019s Year 2000 project manager provided a draft of this plan to the Administrator on December 1, 1997, but does not have any estimate as to when this document will be signed by the Administrator and made final.", "Without an official agencywide Year 2000 strategy, FAA\u2019s executive management is without a road map for achieving Year 2000 compliance.", "Further, the lack of an approved strategy means that FAA\u2019s program manager lacks the authority to enforce Year 2000 policies. As a result, each line of business will have to decide if, when, and how to address its Year 2000 conversion, irrespective of agency priorities and standards. This reinforces our existing concerns with FAA\u2019s CIO not being in the proper place in the organization to develop, maintain, and enforce information technology initiatives. We have repeatedly recommended that FAA adopt a management structure similar to that of the department-level CIOs as prescribed in the Clinger-Cohen Act. The Department of Transportation (DOT) and FAA have disagreed with this recommendation because they believe that the current location of the CIO, within the research and acquisition line of business, is effective. We disagree. FAA\u2019s CIO does not report directly to the Administrator and thus does not have organizational or budgetary authority over those who develop air traffic control systems or the units that maintain them.

The Year 2000 Financial Oversight Team, established in October 1997, has been tasked with identifying the impact of Year 2000 failures on FAA\u2019s operations, programs, and priorities. This assessment will be focused primarily on key mission critical systems and is to be provided to FAA management in February 1998.", "On the basis of our discussions with FAA personnel, it is clear that FAA\u2019s ability to ensure the safety of the National Airspace System and to avoid the grounding of planes could be compromised if systems are not changed. For example, the Host Computer System, the centerpiece information processing system in FAA\u2019s en route centers, relies on the date to determine which day of the week it is when the system is initialized. This information triggers the use of different prescheduled flight plans. That is, carriers use different flight plans and times on a Monday than they do on a Saturday. Because January 1, 2000, is a Saturday, and January 1, 1900, was a Monday, uncorrected date dependencies could lead to the Host using incorrect flight plans. This could result in delayed flights.

FAA recently met with representatives from airlines, aircraft manufacturers, airports, fuel suppliers, telecommunications providers, and industry associations to discuss the Year 2000 issue. At this meeting, participants raised the concern that their own Year 2000 compliance was irrelevant if FAA was not compliant because of the many system interdependencies. Airline representatives further explained that flights could not even get off the ground on January 1, 2000, unless FAA is substantially Year 2000 compliant\u2014and that would be an economic disaster.
