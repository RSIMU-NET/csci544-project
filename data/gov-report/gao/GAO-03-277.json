This approach generally met commercial and government users' needs for spectrum. However, increased use of commercial wireless services, such as mobile telephones, and expanding government agency missions have created growing demand for spectrum resources. GAO found that concerns exist as to whether the current spectrum-management approach can adequately meet future needs for spectrum. The United States and most other countries that GAO spoke with are incrementally adopting market-based mechanisms for spectrum management. By invoking the forces of supply and demand, market-based mechanisms can help promote the efficient use of spectrum, especially in an environment with increasing and unpredictable demand. A prominent example of a market-based mechanism is the requirement for commercial spectrum users to bid at auction for the right to use spectrum. However, because of mission and system requirements, there is some question as to whether these mechanisms can or should be applied to certain government functions. Also, legal and technical limitations can, in some instances, hinder the application of these mechanisms to commercial users. GAO found several barriers to reforming spectrum management in the United States. While active dialogue among key stakeholders is ongoing, differing priorities have led to little consensus on appropriate reforms. In addition, the current spectrum-management structure--with multiple agency jurisdictions and a slow decisionmaking process--has hindered consideration of whether fundamental reform is needed. In the past, commissions--such as the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission--have been used to look at major policy change when complex problems arise."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The radiofrequency spectrum is a natural resource that is used to provide  an array of wireless communications services critical to the U.S. economy  and to a variety of government functions, such as scientific research,  national defense, homeland security, and other public safety activities. As  new technologies and services are brought to market in the private sector  and new mission needs unfold among government users of spectrum,  nearly all parties are becoming increasingly concerned about the  availability of spectrum for future needs, because most of the usable  spectrum in the United States has already been allocated. Along with this  concern, there is a growing view that current spectrum management in the  United States may not be able to respond adequately to the rapidly  changing needs and competing demands of spectrum users.", "To promote a more efficient use of spectrum, many countries, including  the United States, are incrementally adopting market-oriented approaches  to spectrum management. Examples of these approaches include requiring  commercial spectrum users to bid at auction for the right to use spectrum,  charging spectrum users market-based fees to use spectrum, and allowing  greater flexibility in how spectrum is used. However, market-oriented  mechanisms are not universally supported among interested parties. As a  result, increasing debate is emerging on how best to manage this scarce  spectrum resource to meet critical commercial and government needs,  both now and in the future.", "As agreed with your offices, this is our final report in response to your  request that we study a variety of spectrum-management issues. Our first  report, released in September 2002, provided an overview of the  development of the legal and regulatory framework for spectrum  management at the federal level and assessed key issues associated with  spectrum management at federal agencies. That report contained four  recommendations: (1) that the Chairman of the Federal Communications  Commission (FCC) and the Secretary of Commerce, who oversees the  National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA),  jointly develop a clearly defined national spectrum strategy; (2) that the  Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Chairman of FCC  jointly review the adequacy of the preparation process for the 2003 World  Radiocommunication Conference; (3) that the Secretary of Commerce  direct NTIA to analyze the human capital needs of federal agencies for  spectrum management, as well as develop a strategy for addressing any  identified shortcomings; and (4) that the Secretary of Commerce develop a  strategy for enhancing its oversight of federal agencies\u2019 use of spectrum.  FCC, NTIA, and the Department of State generally agreed that these  recommendations should be implemented.", "This report builds on that effort by examining market-oriented approaches  to spectrum management and other issues. Specifically, this report  discusses (1) concerns about whether future spectrum needs can be met,  given the current regulatory framework; (2) the advantages of market- based mechanisms and how they have been applied to help meet future  spectrum needs; (3) whether there are difficulties with using market-based  mechanisms; and (4) if it is found that fundamental spectrum reform is  needed, whether the current regulatory environment is conducive to  facilitating such reform. In addition, in appendix II we provide information  on certain stakeholders\u2019 views on auctions and spectrum royalties.", "To respond to these objectives, we reviewed a broad array of technical,  economic, and legal research related to spectrum management. For  example, we reviewed spectrum-management reports completed by  several foreign governments. In addition, we interviewed experts on  spectrum issues and officials from companies and from government  agencies, including FCC and NTIA. We also conducted semistructured  interviews and analyzed the results of these interviews with spectrum- management officials in 12 other countries: Australia, Canada, Finland,  France, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden,  and the United Kingdom. We selected these countries based on their  geographic size, gross national product per capita, population density,  level of mobile telephone penetration, primary methods for assigning  spectrum, and whether the country uses market incentives to encourage  government conservation of spectrum. For Canada and the United  Kingdom, which have both recently adopted certain market-based  mechanisms, we conducted more in-depth case studies of spectrum- management practices, interviewing not only spectrum managers but also  government users and commercial firms. We also surveyed representatives  to the Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC), which  represents 20 federal agencies that use spectrum, regarding their spectrum  use and their views on certain policy issues. Finally, we invited 10 experts  to participate in an expert panel (see app. VI for a list of panel members).  These experts participated in a day-long conference at GAO and discussed  a series of issues on spectrum-management concerns. For more detailed  information on how we chose the countries we reviewed, the panelists we  invited to serve on the expert panel, and other aspects of our research  methodology, see appendix I. We conducted our review from January 2002  through December 2002 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The radiofrequency spectrum is the medium that enables wireless  communications of all kinds. Although the radio spectrum spans the range  from 3 kilohertz to 300 gigahertz, 90 percent of its use is concentrated in  the 1 percent of frequencies that lie below 3.1 gigahertz, because these  frequencies have properties that make this portion of the spectrum well  suited for many important wireless technologies.", "Spectrum is used to provide a variety of services in the United States.  Companies are licensed to provide mobile telephone, paging, broadcast  television and radio, and various satellite services. Additionally, some  companies maintain spectrum licenses for a variety of private tasks,  including communication in a particular location (such as a large  industrial complex) or among remote vehicles of a company. A variety of  government users also employ spectrum to provide public safety services  and other functions of federal, state, and local government agencies. For  example, local and state police departments, fire departments, and other  emergency services use spectrum to transmit and receive critical voice  and data communications. Federal agencies use spectrum for varied  mission needs, such as law enforcement, weather services, aviation  communication, and national defense.", "Since the beginning of radio communications, concern about interference  among users has been a driving force in the management of spectrum at  the national and international levels. Interference among spectrum users  can occur when two or more radio signals interact in a manner that  disrupts or degrades the transmission and reception of messages.  Spectrum managers have worked to minimize interference through their  two primary spectrum-management functions, the \u201callocation\u201d and the  \u201cassignment\u201d of radio spectrum.", "The allocation process begins with the International Telecommunication  Union (ITU), a specialized agency of the United Nations, where member  nations identify spectrum bands for about 40 broad categories of wireless  services. The Department of State coordinates and mediates the views of  FCC and NTIA to reach a U.S. position on spectrum issues for  international discussions. Once spectrum-allocation decisions are made at  the ITU, regulators within each country will, to varying degrees, follow the  ITU decisions when allocating spectrum for particular types of radio  services or classes of users to meet domestic needs. In the United States,  spectrum allocation is handled primarily by two agencies: FCC\u2014an  independent agency that regulates spectrum use for nonfederal users,  including commercial, private, and state and local government users\u2014and  NTIA, an agency within the Department of Commerce that regulates  spectrum for federal government users. NTIA works in consultation with  IRAC, which is composed of representatives from federal agencies, to  manage the federal spectrum use.", "Once spectrum is allocated for specific uses, the spectrum-management  agencies assign portions of spectrum to specific users. Spectrum  assignment has generally been very proscriptive regarding how a specified  portion of spectrum can be used. That is, generally a license or assignment  specifies the frequencies the license holder may use, the length of time the  license covers, the geographic areas the license covers, and the services  that may be provided. FCC assigns licenses for commercial enterprises,  state and local governments, and others. NTIA makes frequency  assignments to federal agencies. In addition to licensed uses for spectrum,  FCC authorizes unlicensed use of spectrum in some frequencies.  Unlicensed spectrum has traditionally been used for low-powered devices  that operate in a limited geographic range, such as cordless phones, baby  monitors, and garage door openers, and it is increasingly being used to  provide services such as wireless access to the Internet.", "Over the years, FCC has used a variety of methods to assign spectrum for  commercial users. Sometimes spectrum has been assigned on a first-come,  first-served basis. When more than one party applies for the same license,  FCC has used several alternative approaches to assign the license. FCC  historically used comparative hearings, which give competing applicants a  quasi-judicial forum in which to argue why they should be awarded a  license instead of other applicants. In 1981, partially in response to the  administrative burden of the comparative hearing process, the Congress  authorized the use of lotteries, which allowed FCC to randomly select  licensees from the qualified applicant pool. In the Omnibus Budget  Reconciliation Act of 1993, the Congress authorized FCC to use auctions  to award spectrum licenses for certain wireless communications services.  Auctions, a market-based mechanism, grant a license to the company that  has bid the highest price for specific bands of spectrum. Since auctions  were put into place, FCC has conducted 42 auctions.", "Since nearly all of the usable radio spectrum in the United States has been  allocated already, accommodating more services and users often involves  having more than one user sharing spectrum, or reallocations of spectrum  from one use to another. \u201cSpectrum sharing\u201d\u2014one method of  accommodating more services and users\u2014enables more than one user to  transmit or receive radio signals on or near the same frequency band.  Within the United States, about 56 percent of the spectrum is shared by  federal and nonfederal users, while about 31 percent is designated  exclusively for nonfederal use and about 14 percent exclusively for use by  federal agencies. Another method of accommodating new users and  technologies is \u201cband clearing,\u201d or reclassifying a band of spectrum from  one set of radio services and users to another, which requires moving  previously authorized users off of the band. Band-clearing decisions that  affect federal and nonfederal users may require coordination between FCC  and NTIA to ensure that moving existing users off of a band is technically  feasible and meets the users\u2019 needs. Such moves often involve costs  because existing users of the band may need to modify or replace existing  equipment.", "In addition to spectrum-management policies directed at the allocation  and assignment of spectrum, advances in technology could also help to  accommodate more services and users. For example, by compressing  pieces of information, digital technologies are able to use less spectrum  than would analog technologies to transmit a given amount of spectrum.  Also, with appropriate technical standards, ultrawideband devices\u2014which  use very low power over very large bandwidths\u2014can operate using  spectrum occupied by existing radio services, in some cases, without  causing interference. This permits scarce spectrum resources to be used  more efficiently, as more than one service can use the same spectrum.

In particular, the availability of  spectrum has accommodated the dramatic growth of mobile telephone  service since it was first launched in the 1980s. Between 1985 and 2001,  subscribership increased from approximately 340,000 to over 128 million,  and wireless use (measured in minutes) grew by almost 800 percent  between 1996 and 2001 (fig.1). This growth resulted from an increase in  subscribership as well as a marked increase in the average number of  minutes used by each subscriber. In terms of revenues, the industry has  also mushroomed: in 1985 annual revenues were $482 million, and by 2001  annual revenues stood at over $65 billion. Finally, the number of people  employed in the mobile telephone sector grew from about 3,000 in 1985 to  over 200,000 by 2001.", "In addition to the rapid growth in wireless services, most observers believe  that wireless phone markets are highly competitive. According to a recent  FCC report, 94 percent of the U.S. population lives in counties with access  to 3 or more mobile telephone service providers, and 80 percent lives in  counties with at least 5 providers. Officials from the wireless companies  we spoke with and participants on our expert panel overwhelmingly  perceived wireless markets as competitive. Twelve of the 13 wireless  service providers that we interviewed said that mobile markets are  competitive. Even in rural areas wireless markets appear competitive. For  example, officials at the 3 rural companies we spoke with reported that  they were among 3 to 6 competitors in the small and rural markets they  serve. Similarly, all 10 of the participants on our expert panel reported that  wireless markets are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cmoderately\u201d competitive.", "A number of policy decisions implemented by the Congress and FCC have  helped to accommodate the rapid growth and competitiveness of wireless  markets. In the 1990s, the Congress mandated the transfer of over 200  megahertz (MHz) of spectrum from government use to nonfederal use.  This provided additional spectrum for commercial wireless services. Since  1994, FCC has conducted 42 auctions for spectrum dedicated to various  kinds of wireless services. Additionally, FCC\u2019s licensing scheme for mobile  telephone service helped ensure that many providers were available in  each market region.

NTIA, which manages federal spectrum,  is responsible for promoting the efficient use of that spectrum to the  maximum extent feasible. Our September 2002 report noted that it is not  clear that NTIA is able to ensure that spectrum is being used efficiently.", "NTIA currently charges federal government users a small spectrum- management fee for each frequency assignment the government user  holds. However, it is not clear how much these fees, which are designed to  recover 80 percent of the administrative costs in NTIA\u2019s spectrum- management budget, encourage government users to economize on their  use of the spectrum. Officials from two federal agencies that use spectrum  noted that the current charges\u2014approximately $55 per assignment\u2014were  not high enough to cause them to economize on their use of spectrum.  Recently, NTIA has expressed an interest in examining a fee structure that  provides a greater incentive to promote efficient use of spectrum than is  currently being used by NTIA.", "Federal agency officials told us that they have some nonfinancial  incentives to conserve spectrum. Officials from two of the agencies we  interviewed reported that because they are unlikely to get substantial new  spectrum from NTIA, they face internal pressures to conserve and  reshuffle current spectrum resources to meet new needs. Also, DOD  officials stated that the department\u2019s internal goal of being a responsible  steward of America\u2019s resources drives it to use spectrum efficiently.  Agencies we spoke with noted that NTIA requires that federal agencies  review their assignments every 5 years. However, in our first report,  released in September 2002, we noted that one agency official said that  these reviews are often perfunctory, there is no independent verification  of the reviews, and there is no other evidence that these reviews are  effective. Those we spoke with for this report did cite other audits of  spectrum use in the federal government\u2014including spectrum reviews by  the White House\u2014as incentives to use spectrum efficiently. Finally, NTIA  has required the adoption of certain technologies\u2014such as  narrowbanding and trunking\u2014that conserve spectrum. However, NTIA  officials told us that, in practice, it is difficult for NTIA to invoke its  enforcement authority because its primary enforcement tool is the ability  to remove frequency assignments from agencies not complying with  certain requirements. Because license removal is a radical measure that  could interfere with government agencies\u2019 ability to carry out important  missions, it is difficult for NTIA to use this approach.", "Some of those we spoke with also expressed concern that public safety  users do not employ the most efficient technologies and are therefore  wasteful with their spectrum. The head of a commercial wireless  organization noted that public safety communications equipment is often  antiquated. One public safety official we interviewed stated that public  safety officials often do not have adequate funding to update their  equipment to be more spectrally efficient.", "Concerns also exist that some nongovernmental users do not have  incentives to be efficient. In August 2001, FCC commenced an audit of  private land mobile radio stations licensed on frequencies below 512 MHz.  These license holders included industrial/business users and public safety  users. As part of the audit, FCC sent letters to over 260,000 licensees  seeking information to determine whether they (1) were meeting required  construction deadlines and (2) were operational. As of October 2002, FCC  had received responses from over 228,000 licensees, and these licensees  reported that over 33,000 licenses (7.9 percent of licenses) were not being  used and could be canceled.

An important focus of this regulatory  approach has generally been to minimize interference among users. Using  the ITU allocation tables as a starting point, individual countries have  traditionally allocated spectrum for particular uses and assigned spectrum  to particular users by licensing them to use the spectrum in specific ways.  Until the past 10 to 15 years, when some countries started using auctions  to assign spectrum, countries throughout the world assigned spectrum on  a first-come, first-served basis, or used some other administrative device  (such as comparative hearings) to decide among applicants who wanted  the same spectrum.

When resources  move to more valued uses, a form of efficiency known as \u201callocative  efficiency\u201d is advanced. For example, if, because of the development of  cable and satellite television, broadcast television were to lose viewers  and its spectrum were to become more valuable for other uses in higher  demand, such as mobile telephone service, then market forces\u2014that is,  market mechanisms in spectrum management\u2014would naturally lead to a  reallocation of some of that spectrum to these other uses.

Regulators can implement market- based mechanisms in a variety of ways. They can:    Create a market where none previously existed. For example, markets for  spectrum have been created over the past 10 to 15 years by adopting  auctions as a method for assigning spectrum licenses to mobile telephone  and other wireless service providers.", "Remove or relax rules and regulations that created barriers to the full  functioning of spectrum markets. For example, some countries reported  that they are considering rules and regulations to permit users to more  readily purchase or lease spectrum from other license holders, allowing a  more robust secondary market. Similarly, with more flexibility, spectrum  licensees can more readily make business decisions to change how they  use their assigned spectrum without having to get regulatory approval.  Implement a policy that artificially mimics the functions of a market. For  example, in some countries, regulators have developed fees that are based  on information about prices for spectrum that would likely exist under a  free market. These \u201cincentive-based fees\u201d differ from other regulatory fees  that are assessed only to recover the cost of the government\u2019s  management of spectrum.

Spectrum managers in the countries  we studied shared their views on the advantages of market-based policies,  which included their usefulness in  facilitating the reallocation and reassignment of spectrum to its most  efficient use;    allowing the market to handle the assignment and allocation of spectrum,  which some believe the market can do better than managers can;  requiring government agencies to pay market prices for spectrum just as  they do for other resources, such as land and electricity; and    addressing the challenges of spectrum management under conditions of  increasing demand and rising unpredictability of new opportunities for  using spectrum."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Countries Have Adopted Market-Based Mechanisms for Government and Commercial Users", "paragraphs": ["According to spectrum managers in Australia, Canada, and the United  Kingdom, these countries have adopted market-based mechanisms as part  of their spectrum-management approaches for both government and  commercial users. As table 1 shows, in addition to holding auctions, these  countries have instituted incentive-based pricing\u2014which is designed  specifically to provide an incentive to conserve on spectrum\u2014for  commercial and government spectrum. These countries have also  introduced greater flexibility and secondary markets for spectrum holders.  Of these three countries, Australia was the first to institute market  mechanisms, adopting auctions in 1994 and incentive-based pricing in the  early 1980s. Canada and the United Kingdom started using auctions at a  later time\u2014in 1999 and 2000, respectively. With regard to incentive-based  pricing, Canada has been using this mechanism since the late 1980s and  the United Kingdom since 1998. See appendix V for more information on  spectrum management in all of the countries we reviewed.", "The incentive-based pricing systems in these countries were designed to  encourage government spectrum users to recognize the market value of  the spectrum they use. Although officials told us that these fees have  been successful in providing incentives for government agencies to use  spectrum efficiently, part of that success was attributed to other factors.  In particular, political pressures and budgetary policies were key to  helping promote efficient spectrum use.", "In Australia, the fees paid by government and nongovernmental users  (including the military) are based on a formula that includes factors such  as the demand for frequency, amount of spectrum assigned, geographic  location, and power of transmission. Australian officials report that  government users appear to be able to fulfill their missions despite having  to pay for spectrum. When asked to explain the mechanism by which these  fees provide an incentive for government users to conserve on spectrum,  the spectrum manager we spoke with told us that the impact in Australia is  largely the result of synergy between the spectrum fees and declining  government agency budgets. Since the 1970s, budgets have been  constrained because of the government\u2019s attempt to recover some of the  benefits of the gains in efficiency arising from various government  management reforms. The official we spoke with believes that this  budgetary pressure, combined with more appropriate pricing of spectrum  licenses, leads government users to be more efficient with their spectrum.  This greater efficiency may manifest itself in government users\u2019  relinquishing spectrum that they do not currently need.", "Spectrum managers in Canada reported that they charge incentive-based  fees for most uses of spectrum, including many government uses.  Although the fees are currently based on the amount of equipment in use,  Canada is considering changing its fee structure to be based more on other  factors such as bandwidth, geography, and the degree to which spectrum  is shared. Spectrum managers in Canada reported that the fees have  helped some government agencies to use spectrum more efficiently and  that a number of licenses have been returned as a result of the fees. They  reported that some of these results might also have come about because of  their close working relationship with licensees.", "The United Kingdom developed an approach for determining spectrum  fees for all users, except those who had purchased their spectrum at  auction and certain providers of exempted services (such as certain  military functions). The approach considers alternative means to provide a  service that is currently being provided with certain assigned spectrum.  Then, an evaluation is made of how that service could be provided by  using alternative spectrum, or without any spectrum at all, if possible. A  key evaluation is made of the difference in cost between the current  means of providing the service and the next best means. Adjusted for  certain other factors, this difference represents the \u201copportunity cost\u201d of  the spectrum to the user\u2014that is, the value of the spectrum to that user.  As such, this dollar value is the basis for the incentive-based portion of the  fee the user must pay. Officials in the United Kingdom believe that  spectrum fees are working to improve the efficiency of government  spectrum use because agencies are generally facing budgetary restrictions  and therefore cannot easily finance spectrum fees through the budgetary  process.", "For commercial users, these countries are working to provide more  flexibility in licensing and to establish or improve secondary markets for  spectrum.", "In Australia, licenses may be traded, sold, or sublet. Some of these can  also be traded, sold, or sublet in portions based on geography, time, or  bandwidth. Australian spectrum managers have not been satisfied with the  speed of development of secondary markets in that country, however, and  spectrum managers are considering measures to stimulate these markets.  Payments among users are also allowed as part of the spectrum-clearing  process. Although government funding for moving incumbent spectrum  holders to alternative spectrum is not provided, new spectrum licensees  are allowed to pay incumbent license holders to induce more rapid  clearing of spectrum.  In Canada, licenses acquired through auctions have greater flexibility of  use than those acquired in other ways, which enables spectrum licensees  to more freely decide to modify how they use their assigned spectrum. For  example, licenses gained through the auction process have a broader class  of services that can be provided with the spectrum than licenses gained  through other assignment mechanisms. According to officials there,  Canada is planning to extend this flexibility to spectrum obtained in  comparative hearings as well.

Similarly, managers in Italy are currently  prohibited from charging fees above a cost-recovery level. Officials in  New Zealand reported that they had considered charging government  users an incentive-based value for spectrum, but decided against it  because they were concerned that determining the value of spectrum not  bought and sold in a commercial market would be too difficult.", "The United States has used auctions since 1994, shortly after  congressional legislation first authorized auctions to be used for  commercial spectrum assignment.

FCC plans to increase the flexibility of  its licenses, and it is considering liberalizing the right to engage in  secondary markets. In recent congressional testimony, an FCC official  noted that flexible spectrum rules, which allow companies to respond to  market conditions without government intervention, are essential in  today\u2019s dynamic world of wireless communications. With regard to  secondary market activity, spectrum trades in the United States generally  require regulatory approval from FCC. Despite this requirement, a majority  of companies we spoke with in the United States have either purchased  spectrum licenses from another company or traded spectrum licenses with  another company. FCC has an ongoing proceeding looking at ways to  encourage the growth of secondary markets. For example, FCC is seeking  to institute policies that would allow commercial users to sublease slices  of spectrum covered by a license for variable lengths of time.", "With regard to the use of market-based mechanisms for commercial users  in other countries, spectrum managers told us the following:    New Zealand was the first country to implement a market-based  mechanism to assign spectrum. Today, New Zealand assigns \u201cmanagement  rights\u201d to some spectrum it auctions. A winner of such a license is allowed  to assign the spectrum in various configurations to itself or others. As  such, auction winners essentially have a profit motive that gives them an  incentive to assign spectrum to its most valued use. Although licenses are  tradable in New Zealand without regulatory approval, spectrum managers  reported that because there is not a scarcity of spectrum in that country,  there is very little market activity.", "More recently, Italy has begun to use auctions to assign spectrum, but as  with many other European countries subject to certain restrictions on the  regulation of spectrum under European Commission law, Italy is moving  more slowly than Canada, Australia, and New Zealand to adopt certain  market mechanisms.

Officials in Hong Kong told us that they chose the  royalty method so that the government could share some of the risk  inherent in paying for spectrum in future years.

The purpose of market-based  mechanisms is to provide users with an incentive to use spectrum as  efficiently as possible. This may result in users\u2019 considering alternative  methods of providing services by adopting technologies that either (1) use  less spectrum, (2) use less congested parts of the spectrum, or (3) do not  require spectrum at all. Because of the primacy of certain government  functions\u2014such as homeland security and national defense\u2014charging  government users for these functions may not be desirable. In addition, if  particular users are unable to adopt any alternative method in a  reasonable time frame, market-based mechanisms, such as incentive- based spectrum fees, are not likely to result in reduced spectrum use. In  other words, market-based mechanisms can create an incentive for  spectrum conservation only if users can actually choose to undertake an  alternative means of providing a service. Government users provided  several examples of circumstances in which market-based fees might not  provide incentives:    Spectrum used for certain functions, such as air traffic control, has been  allocated internationally\u2014the same bands of spectrum are allocated for  this service around the world. The benefit of this in the context of air  traffic control is that airplanes on international flights can use the same  radio equipment and systems in every country, making air travel safer and  less costly than it would be if countries provided services on different  bands. If FAA wanted to use bands that are different from those allocated  in these international agreements, airplanes from the United States that  are making international flights would require multiple communications  systems and procedures, which would impose considerable additional  costs on carriers. In fact, the United Kingdom charges government users  incentive-based fees but exempts spectrum used for air traffic control  from these fees.  It may also be inappropriate to apply market-based mechanisms for  defense systems that involve international agreements. For example, the  United Kingdom does not charge the Ministry of Defence for spectrum  identified for North Atlantic Treaty Organization use. In addition, DOD has  publicly stated that the ability to operate certain systems depends on  international agreements with other countries that allow DOD to use  certain frequencies within other countries\u2019 borders. DOD officials note  that it is important for DOD to employ the same systems, and thus the  same portions of spectrum, inside the United States as it does overseas.  DOD officials said that it would be very difficult to renegotiate these  arrangements in response to spectrum reallocations, or to the  implementation of incentive-based fees for spectrum in the United States.", "Many government defense systems that use spectrum\u2014such as large  weapons systems, or satellite systems\u2014not only involve complex  international agreements, but are also large and complex from an  engineering perspective. These systems usually require years of  development, and spectrum may be only a small part of the total resources  used by a given system. Thus, once a system is designed and operational,  any benefits of conserving spectrum by redesigning these systems are  likely to be outweighed by the costs of making such modifications.  Consequently, imposing an incentive-based fee for spectrum employed in  projects with a long time horizon may not result in spectrum conservation.", "In some cases, charging government users a market-based fee for  spectrum may have the potential to make spectrum use more efficient,  such as in situations where a government user is providing a service  similar to that of a commercial vendor. Nevertheless, implementing  market-based incentives may still be challenging, for several reasons:   It is difficult to place prices on goods and services that are not traded in  the marketplace. For commercial users, spectrum prices are reflective of  the value of the services provided with that spectrum, as measured, in  part, by what consumers will pay for the service. Some government  services are unique and provide safety-of-life or national defense services.  For example, FAA\u2019s air traffic control services and DOD\u2019s precision  weapons\u2013guidance systems rely on spectrum, yet there are no equivalent  commercial services. Government spectrum users have said that services  without a direct commercial corollary cannot be easily valued. One  government representative noted that the value to the nation of spectrum  allocated to government services is difficult to measure through market  mechanisms.  If government users can obtain any needed funding for spectrum fees  through the budgetary process, market-based incentives are not likely to  be effective in conserving spectrum. Two of the three countries that  believed that their incentive-based pricing systems were providing some  financial incentives for government users to conserve on spectrum  reported that one factor contributing to this conservation was a  requirement for agencies to reduce their overall budgets while paying for  spectrum. Thus, agencies could not easily finance the increased cost of  spectrum through the budgetary process. In the United States, most of the  limits or caps on discretionary spending contained in the Budget  Enforcement Act of 1990 expired in fiscal year 2002. These limits or caps  would have constrained discretionary spending, including amounts  available for using the spectrum, if government users were charged for  that use.", "In the commercial sector, the profit motive typically provides an incentive  for individuals and companies to use spectrum efficiently. Government  users do not have a similar financial incentive to conserve on spectrum,  because spectrum efficiency is not directly rewarded within government  agencies. Thus, imposing fees may create some pressure, but does not  mimic a profit motive. Linking spectrum-efficient decisions to  performance contracts and individual awards could create greater  individual efforts to make such decisions.", "Another impediment to implementing market-based incentives for  government users may be the views of those users. Our survey of IRAC  agencies found that 7 of the 17 agencies responding to this survey did not  support greater flexibility of use for government spectrum users, 13 did  not support the practice of allowing agencies to buy or sell spectrum, 12  were opposed to allowing agencies to lease spectrum, and 13 were  opposed to paying fees for spectrum that exceeded regulatory costs.  However, 9 agencies were \u201cgreatly\u201d or \u201cmoderately\u201d supportive of allowing  commercial users to pay government license holders to relocate to  alternative spectrum, and 11 greatly/moderately supported creating a trust  fund to pay for spectrum reallocation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impediments Have Limited Implementation of Market- Based Mechanisms for Commercial Users", "paragraphs": ["Despite the potential benefits of adopting market-based mechanisms for  spectrum management, some impediments have limited the  implementation of these methods for commercial users.

Impediments to more widespread implementation of market-based  mechanisms\u2014such as auctions, secondary markets, and flexibility of  use\u2014include statutory restrictions, the degree to which the most highly- valued spectrum is already assigned, and the sometimes conflicting  interests of commercial entities.", "Auctions: FCC has auctioned off only a limited amount of the spectrum it  oversees. Because most of the spectrum is already assigned, the amount of  spectrum that could be auctioned without reallocating spectrum is quite  limited. Also, FCC has attempted to auction additional spectrum by  relocating some users to other parts of the spectrum. Relocation can  impose significant costs on the incumbent spectrum holder and sometimes  on the new entrant who may be required to fund the relocation. In  addition, FCC officials told us that there are statutory limits to their ability  to use auctions.", "Secondary markets: Further implementation of secondary markets in the  United States will require that the rights of licensees with regard to their  assigned spectrum be more clearly specified. In other resource markets\u2014 such as those for land\u2014commercial entities usually have the right, without  regulatory approval, to buy or sell the resource, or to lease the resource  from another entity that owns it. Although the Communications Act of  1934 prohibits the ownership of spectrum, companies have generally been  able to buy and sell spectrum licenses with FCC\u2019s approval. However,  according to an FCC official, it is unclear at this time whether, in general,  license holders can legally lease all or part of their spectrum rights to  other users for some limited period of time. The opposition of some  stakeholders, who are concerned that conferring any specific spectrum  rights will make it more difficult to release spectrum for new services and  technologies that might develop in the future, further complicates  providing rights to spectrum users. For over 2 years, FCC has been  considering these issues under a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on  secondary markets and hopes to resolve some of these issues shortly.", "Flexibility of use: Granting greater flexibility in the use of spectrum would  enable license holders to behave like other resource owners in having the  opportunity to make economic decisions that put their resource to its  most highly valued use. Although FCC is examining ways to improve  access to spectrum by providing additional flexibility, an FCC official told  us that only a small portion of the spectrum it assigns is held under  licenses that allow for considerable flexibility of use. FCC\u2019s ability to  introduce additional flexibility has been limited because most of the  desirable spectrum has already been assigned, making it more difficult to  change the rules embodied in these licenses. Moreover, there are  considerable disagreements among commercial users over the appropriate  degree of flexibility. In particular, some interested parties are concerned  that allowing greater flexibility could result in more interference among  users.

There must be  coordination and cooperation in order to determine how best to  accommodate users of spectrum. While any decisions involving spectrum  can be difficult, those involving spectrum allocations can be particularly  protracted. Because most of the desirable spectrum has already been  allocated, allocating spectrum for a new technology or service usually  requires that some existing users be moved to another part of the  spectrum. Since existing users are likely to experience costs for relocating  but little, if any, benefit, they are often reluctant to make a move. Even  within the jurisdiction of a single spectrum-management agency,  reallocations of spectrum may require lengthy negotiations. Moreover,  decisions involving the reallocation of spectrum between federal and  nonfederal users, and thus between regulatory jurisdictions, can be even  more difficult. Some examples of protracted spectrum decisions both  within and across regulatory jurisdictions include:  The reallocation of spectrum in the 700 MHz band. In 1997, the Congress  directed FCC to reallocate to public safety services the 24 MHz of the  spectrum that will be recovered from the transition to digital television,  and to put up for auction the remaining recovered spectrum. In 1999, the  Congress directed that the proceeds from these auctions were to be  deposited with the Treasury by September 30, 2000. Auctions for spectrum  in the 700 MHz band have been rescheduled several times. Several mobile  telephone companies supported a postponement of these auctions. Those  in favor of postponing the auction believed that because it was unclear  when the spectrum would be vacated, it would be difficult for companies  to determine the value of the spectrum. On June 18, 2002, the Congress  passed legislation removing the former statutory auction deadlines but  requiring FCC to auction, before September 19, 2002, 18 MHz of spectrum,  some of which was desired by rural carriers. This auction was completed  in September 2002. The auction of the remaining spectrum in the 700 MHz  range has been postponed indefinitely.", "The narrowbanding initiative for federal spectrum users. In 1992, the  Congress directed NTIA to adopt and implement a plan for federal  agencies with existing mobile radio systems to use more spectrum- efficient technologies. In 1993, NTIA responded to the Congress with a  report that included a plan for implementing narrowbanding\u2014a  technology that would use about half as much bandwidth as agencies are  currently using. NTIA set interim deadlines for the narrowbanding  requirements, which are to be fully implemented by 2008. The plan  required that some agencies move to spectrum occupied by another  agency. As a result, the plan provided a time line according to which each  agency would adopt narrowbanding because, as NTIA officials pointed  out, the implementation of narrowbanding by any given agency depends,  in part, on whether the other agencies have adhered to the schedules laid  out by NTIA. We recently asked NTIA about the progress of agencies in  meeting their narrowbanding requirements. NTIA was not able to tell us  how many agencies have complied with the interim deadlines, because  some agencies had not yet responded to NTIA\u2019s June 2002 request for  information on compliance with narrowbanding requirements.

In a letter in June  2001, FCC\u2019s Chairman wrote to the Secretary of the Department of  Commerce, \u201cIt is apparent that additional time is necessary to allow the  Commission and the Executive Branch to complete a careful and complete  evaluation of the various possible options\u201d for making spectrum available  for 3G. FCC\u2019s Chairman stated that the public interest would best be  served by providing additional time for informed consideration, even if  this resulted in some delay in reaching allocation decisions. Finally, he  requested relief from the 2002 statutory deadline for spectrum to be  auctioned. A task force was established, which included officials at the  Department of Commerce, FCC, Department of Defense, and other federal  agencies. In July 2002 the task force released a study concluding that 90  MHz of spectrum could be allocated to 3G without disrupting  communications services critical to national security. The deadline set  for the band clearing to occur is now 2008, although certain provisions  need to be met before DOD would be expected to relinquish its portion of  those frequencies. On November 7, 2002, FCC officials released a Notice of  Proposed Rulemaking that suggests service rules for the reallocated  spectrum. FCC officials stated that they would likely adopt an order  establishing the service rules by mid-2003 and would likely hold an auction  in 2004. Despite these developments, FCC officials have stated that  additional spectrum would need to be allocated to fully support 3G  services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCC and NTIA Are Attempting to Work in a More Coordinated Fashion to Address Difficulties in Spectrum Management, but Jurisdictional Responsibilities Differ", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing that the absence of a generally agreed upon national  spectrum strategy can make it difficult for FCC and NTIA to avoid  contentious, protracted negotiations when providing for future spectrum  needs, we recommended in our September 2002 report that the Secretary  of Commerce and FCC should establish and carry out formal, joint  planning activities to develop such a strategy to guide decisionmaking.  Both FCC and NTIA responded positively to this recommendation, and  they have recognized the need to address concerns about current  spectrum-management policies and procedures by establishing task forces  and working groups within their own agencies.

Some concerns have been  raised that the price companies are paying for spectrum under auctions  could drive up end-user customer prices. Some economists suggest that  one-time license payments\u2014such as those associated with auctions or  with participation in comparative hearings\u2014should not influence  customer prices, because these fixed costs do not vary with a firm\u2019s  output. As such, they do not influence a firm\u2019s decisions about how to set  its prices; such decisions are based on the firms\u2019 marginal, or incremental,  costs. However, other economists have pointed to reasons why auction  payments could influence consumer prices in certain cases. For example,  some or all companies might, because of an increased need to borrow  funds to participate in an auction, see their cost of financial capital rise.  Moreover, these economists argue that while firms may temporarily set  prices based on marginal costs, firms cannot survive in the long run  without considering fixed costs, and hence auction payments will be  reflected in consumer prices.", "Views among those we spoke with on this issue were mixed.

Some  observers argue that payment at auction for spectrum licenses would  encourage companies to deploy technologies and services faster, because  the companies would have devoted their own resources for the licenses  and would need to recoup the investment by using the spectrum in a  productive and innovative manner. Others, however, argue that the  auction payments for spectrum licenses could slow the deployment of new  technologies and services by diverting financial resources away from  direct investments in infrastructure.", "Officials at nine of the companies we spoke with said that the assignment  mechanism can influence the rate of deployment of new technologies and  services, because, for example, high auction prices can affect the firm\u2019s  access to financial capital. Alternatively, five companies said that the  assignment mechanism does not influence the deployment of new  technologies or services.

These  issues include (1) difficulty with citing cell towers because of problems  associated with local zoning; (2) FCC mandates for items such as  emergency 911 service, which require large financial investments that  divert resources away from the deployment of the firm\u2019s network; and (3)  FCC procedures, such as licensing spectrum that is encumbered (that is,  currently used by another licensee), that increase business uncertainty.  Finally, the United Kingdom\u2019s National Audit Office noted that the  remaining difficulties to be overcome for the roll-out of 3G services in that  country are mainly technical: for example, the development of suitable  base station and hand-set equipment.", "The effect of auctions on the ability of small businesses to obtain  spectrum licenses. Another concern about the adoption of auctions for the  assignment of spectrum licenses is that smaller companies will not be able  to compete for licenses with larger businesses. FCC addressed this  concern in a few ways. FCC allowed partitioning of some licenses into  relatively small pieces to facilitate small business participation in wireless  markets. Additionally, for some auctions, FCC provided special bidding  credits, allowed long-term installment payments, or designated certain  licenses as available only for acquisition by smaller companies, in order to  facilitate their participation and increase their opportunity to acquire  spectrum licenses.", "Among the companies and experts that we spoke with, several suggested  alternatives to the current spectrum-assignment mechanism to facilitate  small business participation. These alternatives included small geographic  areas, which can be better suited to the business models of small  companies, and revenue sharing. Alternatively, while FCC has taken steps  to promote small businesses in certain auctions, some observers do not  believe this necessarily leads to viable small business participation in  wireless markets.
