For parts that have military technology involving weapons, national security, or military advantages inherent in them, DOD requires the parts to be demilitarized so that the technology remains within DOD.

However, DOD investigations and our analysis of 264 judgmentally selected items available for sale at 5 DRMOs showed that the military services often assigned the wrong demilitarization codes to parts with military technology that needed to be protected. When parts are miscoded, there is a high probability that those without military technology will be unnecessarily destroyed and those with military technology will be inadvertently sold. Such actions waste time and resources; increase costs; and, in the latter case, inadvertently make weapons and military technology available to the public.", "DOD has had problems with the accuracy of assigned demilitarization codes for many years and has initiated several projects to address these problems. For example, DOD (1) established liaisons in 1991 with federal investigative agencies to help find miscoded parts with military technology that are in the hands of the public, (2) assigned its own investigators, also in 1991, to monitor DRMO activities and identify miscoded parts, and (3) validated demilitarization codes from 1993 to 1995 for various weapon systems.", "Despite these initiatives, DOD documents show numerous instances of military parts and equipment with military technology intact that continue to be made available to the public. For example, in 1995 and 1997, DOD investigators identified hundreds of items that contained military technology sold by disposal offices. Many of these items were classified at the secret or confidential levels. The items included grenade launchers, bomb ejector arming units, radar circuit card assemblies, a guided missile launcher, key components of intercontinental ballistic missiles, weapon system technical data, electronic warfare equipment, sophisticated weapon fire control equipment, entire missiles and missile launchers, automatic weapons, guided and cluster bombs, coders, decoders, encoders, rocket launchers, secure communications equipment, and military night vision devices.", "The Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service also provided us with a listing of 1,684 different items it identified as miscoded. The items contained military technology but were incorrectly coded as having no military technology implications. We obtained disposal office sales history information for 881 of these items. There were 7,702 transactions involving the sale of these 881 items to the public between 1995 and 1997. These items included parts for weapons, guided missiles, and sensitive circuit card assemblies.", "Our analysis of 264 judgmentally selected items at 5 DRMOs showed that the wrong demilitarization codes were continuing to be assigned to some parts. The 264 items were recorded as either sold or available for sale to the public. We selected these items because they were parts for weapons and weapon systems but were shown in the disposal offices\u2019 records as having no military technology that needed to be protected. We reviewed item characteristics and discussed the coding accuracy with disposal office personnel. Disposal office officials told us that, in their judgment, the demilitarization codes shown in the disposal offices records as having no military technology implications were likely inaccurate for 145 of the sample items.", "For selected items that appeared to be inaccurately coded, we contacted the item managers and equipment specialists and discussed the accuracy of the assigned demilitarization codes. The item managers and equipment specialists generally confirmed that the demilitarization codes for these items were inaccurate. For example, one of the items that was available for sale to the public at the DRMO in Kaiserslautern, Germany, was a waveguide assembly used in communications equipment. The item was coded as having no military technology implications. The equipment specialist confirmed that the assigned demilitarization code was incorrect because the part contained technology involving special military satellite communications. The specialist corrected the demilitarization code.", "According to officials at the five disposal offices visited, miscoded items account for 25 percent of their property management workload. They explained that, because of constant employee turnover, receiving personnel must be continually trained to screen for incorrect codes. Also, potentially miscoded items have to be reported to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service, and items with military technology requiring demilitarization must be stored apart from other items. Miscoding can have a significant impact on the disposal office workload. For example, the Kaiserslautern DRMO had a backlog of 29 semi-truck trailers full of material waiting to be processed for disposal. Officials stated that time spent on miscoded items significantly affected their ability to process the backlog and that more trailer loads of material were being received daily.", "DRMOs also inadvertently offered to sell some parts with military technology intact because DRMO personnel made errors in consolidating parts having military technology implications with parts not having these implications. This occurred when several single items were accumulated together and offered for sale as a batch lot. Although the batch lot was recorded as having no military technology implications, some individual parts in the lot contained protected military technology. For example, a batch lot of 42 weapons parts available for sale to the public at the Kaiserslautern DRMO contained 7 parts with military technology that should have been destroyed (see fig. 2). DRMO personnel subsequently removed the military technology items from the batch lot. DRMO supervisors stated that action would be taken to educate personnel on the required content of batch lots and that supervisory checks of batch lot contents would be made periodically to ensure that no parts with military technology are included in future batch lots.", "In our October 1997 report, we recommended that DOD improve the accuracy of assigned demilitarization codes by providing its personnel with guidance on selecting appropriate demilitarization codes that includes the specific details necessary to make appropriate decisions. DOD agreed with our recommendation and stated that it would work with the military services and the Defense Logistics Agency to determine the feasibility of departmentwide use of a worksheet that provides personnel with the specific details necessary to make prudent decisions on selecting the appropriate demilitarization codes. However, as of May 1998, DOD had not started using a worksheet departmentwide."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Systems Are Not Updated With Correct Codes", "paragraphs": ["Because DOD has had long-standing problems with the accuracy of assigned demilitarization codes, in 1993 the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service developed a program for disposal offices to identify and prevent items with military technology from being sold. However, the disposal offices continued to sell parts with military technology intact because personnel often did not update their data systems with corrected codes.", "Under the program, disposal office personnel check the assigned demilitarization code. If the personnel believe an item has been miscoded, the item is \u201cchallenged.\u201d They send a written report concerning the potential coding error to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service\u2019s challenge program office where the item is then recorded in the program\u2019s database as an open case. Challenge program personnel conduct research and discuss the assigned code with item managers and equipment specialists from the military services. After the correct code is determined, the item is recorded in the program\u2019s database as a closed case. Challenge program personnel are then supposed to manually enter the correct code to the data system used by disposal offices to manage surplus parts, and the equipment specialists are supposed to enter the correct code to the data system used by the military services to catalog the characteristics of the parts.", "The disposal offices continued to sell parts with military technology intact because the challenge program was not effectively implemented. Both program personnel and equipment specialists did not update their data systems with the corrected codes after challenge program cases were closed. For example, disposal office personnel challenged the code for an automatic machine gun firing mechanism, which indicated that the part was appropriate for sale to the public. Research by challenge program personnel revealed that the part should be destroyed because it is the mechanism that enables the machine gun to fire automatically. However, Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service sales records show that 10 of the automatic machine gun mechanisms were later sold at a public auction because challenge program personnel and military service equipment specialists did not update their data systems with the correct code.", "To determine if this problem continued to exist, we asked the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service to identify the number of instances in which either challenge program personnel or equipment specialists did not update their data systems with the corrected codes. Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service analyses showed that challenge program personnel did not enter corrected codes to the disposal data system for 2,920 of 35,981 (8 percent) closed cases. In November 1997, the Service corrected this problem by implementing a computer program that automatically updates the disposal data system when a case is closed in the challenge program. This automation eliminates the need for manual updates to the disposal data system. However, DOD has not corrected a larger problem involving cataloging data system updates that have to be made by the military services equipment specialists. The specialists had not updated the required changes for 26,278 of the 35,981 (73 percent) closed cases that the challenge program identified with incorrect codes. In June 1998, DOD officials stated that the equipment specialists had attempted to update the cataloging data system but the system did not accept the changes. They are researching the cause of the problem.", "We also asked the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service to determine the number of instances in which the same item had different demilitarization codes in the two data systems. In December 1997, the Service compared the demilitarization codes in the cataloging data system used by the military services with the codes for the same items in the data system used by the disposal offices. The comparison identified 86,217 instances in which the same item had different demilitarization codes. We did not make an analysis to determine which codes were correct. However, the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service official responsible for the challenge program believed the disposal office data system codes were more accurate than the codes in the cataloging data system because the latter system had not been updated with challenge program changes. The official said that only the military services can update the cataloging system with the correct demilitarization codes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Parts With Military Technology Are Not Adequately Destroyed", "paragraphs": ["DOD 4160.21-M-1, Defense Demilitarization Manual, provides instructions on how surplus parts with military technology should be destroyed. However, DRMOs do not always adequately destroy parts with military technology associated with weapons and weapon systems. In some cases, parts containing recoverable military technology have been sold to the public and foreign countries. Purchasers of demilitarized parts have put them back together or reverse engineered the technology and remanufactured the parts so they function as they did originally.", "According to DOD officials, the lack of adequate guidance to DRMOs on how to destroy the military technology inherent in some items has been a long-standing problem. For example, when DOD conducted a study in 1995 to determine if parts were being sold with military technology, it identified about 500 military weapons and weapon-related parts requiring demilitarization that were being resold by private companies. This listing included sensitive items such as F-18 guided missile launchers, technical data for Apache and Cobra helicopters, and F-15 inertial navigation systems. In some instances, the companies obtained the parts from disposal offices that did not adequately destroy the military technology before they sold the parts.", "Guidance to DRMOs on how to destroy the military technology inherent in some items continues to be inadequate. Officials at the five DRMOs told us that they still did not have adequate demilitarization instructions and, as a result, the demilitarization process is simply a trial and error process. For example, at the DRMO at Fort Hood, Texas, we noted a part used as an ammunition feeder for an automatic gun was coded for total destruction, but no specific guidance exists on how to destroy the part (see fig. 3). DRMO officials stated that their demilitarization process previously involved cutting the shaft of the feeder into two pieces. However, the officials discovered that, when the part is demilitarized in this manner, it can be welded back together and used as it was originally intended. The DRMO personnel then began cutting off all of the feeders\u2019 appendages, which rendered the part unusable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Plans to Take Corrective Action", "paragraphs": ["At each of the DRMOs we visited, officials stated that losing military technology through the disposal process is a serious problem that they work on daily to prevent. DRMO officials said, however, that until the accuracy of assigned demilitarization codes and the destruction guidance are improved, disposal offices will continue to inadvertently sell some items with military technology that could be used by the public. To overcome these problems, DOD is considering a proposal to assign the responsibility for attaining accuracy in demilitarization coding to a single office in the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service and is planning to provide the DRMOs with computerized images on how to destroy military technology in military parts.", "Historically, the military services have been responsible for assigning demilitarization codes to parts for new weapon systems and for ensuring that the assigned demilitarization codes are accurate throughout the life of the weapon system. According to DOD, over 3,000 personnel in dozens of locations are responsible for assigning demilitarization codes to approximately 12,000 new items entering the DOD supply system each month. These personnel are also responsible for validating code accuracy for items already in the system. In a 1997 report, DOD\u2019s Inspector General recommended that DOD consolidate the responsibility to assign, challenge, and maintain demilitarization codes into a single office within the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service. In its final comments to the Inspector General\u2019s report, DOD stated that it planned to proceed with the consolidation. However, DOD has tasked the Defense Science Board to study the entire DOD demilitarization program and plans to use the results of this study, expected later in 1998, in deciding whether to implement the consolidation.", "DOD also is developing a system to provide DRMOs with computerized images on how to destroy military technology in military parts. Defense Logistics Agency officials said that the imaging system will include instructions, illustrations, and destruction techniques on over 100,000 different parts. The officials said that the system will not need to include images for all parts that contain military technology because a destruction technique for a specific part in a weapon system can be used for all similar parts in other weapon systems. According to Defense Logistics Agency officials, the imaging system could be available to the DRMOs by late 1998 via the Internet. The officials also stated that the success of this system will depend on whether the military services provide the required instructions, illustrations, and techniques on how to demilitarize parts and whether this information is kept up to date.", "The Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service also has started two pilot projects to centralize the demilitarization process at fewer DRMO locations.

In some instances, the potentially dangerous parts reentered defense and civil aviation and may have been reused on aircraft. According to the Department of Transportation\u2019s Inspector General, for example, a parts distributor misrepresented severely worn aircraft parts as usable and sold them to a civil aviation industry customer for reuse.

DOD defines a flight safety critical aircraft part as any part, assembly, or installation containing a critical characteristic whose failure, malfunction, or absence could cause a catastrophic failure resulting in loss or serious damage to the aircraft, or an uncommanded engine shutdown resulting in an unsafe condition. In May 1995, the team identified six initiatives for the military services and the Defense Logistics Agency to follow when implementing the flight safety program. The program initiatives were to standardize and incorporate the definition for items with flight safety implications into regulations and directives and make procedural changes as necessary; identify parts considered flight safety critical; code items with flight safety implications in provisioning, cataloging and supply data systems and records, designating that special handling is required when the item is sent to disposal; maintain historical documentation on all flight safety items; require that historical documentation accompany parts sent to disposal offices and that flight safety items without historical documentation be destroyed before disposal; and require parts manufacturers to provide an Airworthiness Approval Tag for all flight safety items delivered to DOD that have both civil and military aviation applications and develop procedures for providing the Airworthiness Approval Tag to the disposal offices when such flight safety items are no longer needed by DOD.", "Under the program, parts with flight safety implications must either be accompanied by paperwork showing that the parts are safe to use or the parts must be destroyed.

DOD further stated that the action plan will incorporate milestones for completing the imaging system that will provide guidance on how to destroy the military technology inherent in items. Regarding our recommendation to establish milestones for complete implementation of the flight safety program, DOD stated that new milestones for fully implementing the program will be established no later than October 1998. Also, DOD stated that the military services and the Defense Logistics Agency will continue to report progress toward full implementation of the flight safety program on a quarterly basis to the Office of the Secretary of Defense.", "Regarding DOD\u2019s two concerns, our draft report recognized that DOD has initiated several projects to address problems with the demilitarization and flight safety programs. However, we modified the final report to further recognize this in our results in brief and conclusions. With regard to DOD\u2019s comment on information sources, DOD was referring to our discussions of demilitarization coding accuracy with disposal office and Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service personnel. DOD stated that the personnel are not technically qualified to make decisions on coding accuracy and that it is the equipment specialists who are responsible for assigning demilitarization codes. Our report notes that our analysis includes items that had been challenged and closed out after equipment specialists had determined that they had been miscoded. Also, as stated in the report, we judgmentally selected items for review to determine if they had been coded correctly. For those we identified as miscoded, we selectively confirmed our analysis with equipment specialists. Therefore, these steps provide us with confidence that our findings are adequately supported.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees; the Secretaries of Defense, the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force; the Director, Defense Logistics Agency; and the Director, Office of Management and Budget.", "Please contact me at (202) 512-8412 if you or your staff have any questions concerning this report.

We also reviewed policies, procedures, disposal and transaction histories, and related records obtained from the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Offices (DRMO) and item managers, and documented disposal practices. We interviewed policy officials, DRMO personnel, item managers, and equipment specialists.", "To obtain information on how surplus parts with military technology and flight safety implications are received and processed for sale, we performed work at five DRMOs, located in San Antonio and Killeen (Fort Hood), Texas, and in Germersheim, Kaiserslautern, and Seckenheim, Germany. We selected these locations because, according to DOD records, they sold large volumes of parts and equipment with military technology implications. We also collected information from item managers, equipment specialists, and policy officials at the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma; the San Antonio Air Logistics Center, Kelly Air Force Base, Texas; the Army\u2019s Aviation and Missile Command, Huntsville, Alabama; the Naval Inventory Control Point, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and the Defense Supply Centers, Columbus, Ohio, and Richmond, Virginia.", "To determine the adequacy of DOD\u2019s policies and procedures to identify and destroy parts with military technology, we discussed procedures, problems, and challenges with officials from the Defense Logistics Agency and the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service; obtained data and Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service analyses showing instances in which parts got into the wrong hands through the disposal process and had different demilitarization codes assigned to the same item in different data systems; and judgmentally selected 48 items at the Texas DRMOs and 216 items at the Germany DRMOs involving the accuracy of assigned demilitarization codes. We selected these items for review because they were parts for weapons and weapon systems but at the time of selection were coded in the DRMO\u2019s records as having no military technology content. We compared the assigned codes with the codes available in DOD\u2019s Demilitarization Manual and discussed the correct codes and military technology implications of the items with disposal office personnel, item managers, and equipment specialists.", "For historical perspective and illustrations of past problems, we reviewed the results of prior DOD internal studies and DOD Inspector General reports. We also used documentation and computer data obtained during our prior work on disposal operations.", "We used the same computer programs, reports, records, and statistics that DOD, the military services, the Defense Logistics Agency, and the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service use to manage excess and surplus inventories, make decisions, and determine the correct demilitarization codes. We did not independently determine the reliability of all of these sources. However, as stated above, we did assess the accuracy of the demilitarization codes by comparing the codes assigned to the same item in different data systems and by comparing assigned codes to the codes available in the Demilitarization Manual.", "To determine whether parts requiring demilitarization were being adequately destroyed, we reviewed available guidance, interviewed demilitarization personnel at the five DRMOs, and observed items being destroyed.", "To determine the status of DOD\u2019s flight safety program, we identified DOD\u2019s program initiatives and documented the military services and the Defense Logistics Agency\u2019s progress in implementing the program initiatives. We reviewed the policies, procedures, and related records of the military services and the Defense Logistics Agency and held discussions and performed work at the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Logistics). We obtained sales history information from the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service to determine if some of the parts that the military services have identified with flight safety implications were sold through DOD\u2019s disposal system without any paperwork showing that the parts were safe to use. To further determine whether the parts identified by the military services as having flight safety implications are being sold through the disposal process, we obtained a listing of the flight safety items identified by the Air Force and the Army. We compared these items with the listing of parts being offered for sale by the Kaiserslautern DRMO. We interviewed DRMO personnel to determine whether they were aware that the items we identified had flight safety implications.", "We performed our review between November 1997 and May 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Security and International Affairs Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": ["Roger Tomlinson Jackie Kriethe Bonnie Carter Frederick Lyles The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
