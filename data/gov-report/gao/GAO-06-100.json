In July 2004, we reported that data sharing between IRS and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has the potential to improve tax compliance as well as immigration eligibility decisions (GAO-04-972T). For this report, GAO determined (1) the potential benefits of data matching, and (2) the options and associated challenges."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Data sharing can help improve (1) tax compliance if businesses applying to sponsor immigrant workers are required to meet tax filing and payment requirements, and (2) the accuracy and timeliness of USCIS's immigration eligibility decisions if it obtained tax data from IRS to help ensure business sponsors meet eligibility criteria. As of December 2003, IRS databases showed 18,942 businesses (5 percent) applying to sponsor immigrant workers had $5.6 billion in unpaid assessments. Of this amount, businesses were not in installment agreements with IRS or otherwise making payments on $3.7 billion. If future business sponsors owe taxes and are required to meet their tax obligations, they would need to make arrangements with the IRS to come into compliance. Although USCIS officials acknowledge that no explicit prohibition exists in immigration laws against conditioning approval of employer applications on their tax compliance, USCIS officials said a statutory change is preferable because they have legal concerns about USCIS's authority to issue such a regulation absent specific authority. IRS data can help USCIS make more accurate eligibility decisions by better identifying businesses that may not have met eligibility criteria due to having unpaid assessments or not filing returns. In our nationwide selection, 67,949 of 413,723 (16 percent) business sponsors were in IRS's nonfiler database at the time of their application. A variety of options is available to IRS and USCIS for establishing and implementing data sharing. An applicant-initiated data-sharing arrangement could be implemented under existing Internal Revenue Code authority through taxpayer consent, whereby taxpayers authorize IRS to disclose their information. USCIS then could verify applicant-provided data by obtaining tax returns or tax transcripts. Treasury guidance suggests a small-scale pilot using consents as a way to make the business case for continued access to taxpayer information. In general, the more that data sharing could be done electronically, the more efficient the data sharing could be. However, achieving electronic data sharing may take longer than paper-based processes due to legal, technological, and cost challenges. Further, if business sponsors need to come into compliance, net tax collections might not increase if collecting their taxes displaces other IRS work. Establishing user fees to cover data-sharing costs could be a way to fund data sharing, but IRS lacks the authority to collect and retain a user fee to cover compliance-related costs associated with data sharing."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2000, federal agencies estimated that they saved at least $900 million  annually in program costs through data-sharing initiatives.  As we have  previously reported, federal agencies are increasingly using data sharing to  help verify applicant-provided information.  Many federal agencies use  financial information to make eligibility decisions or ensure compliance  with program requirements.  For instance, the United States Citizenship  and Immigration Services (USCIS) grants immigrants admittance into the  United States or allows immigrants to remain in the country based, in part,  on financial information provided by the applicant and/or their sponsors.   Likewise, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses financial information to  ensure that taxpayers are meeting their tax obligations.", "To facilitate data sharing, Congress has authorized a number of agencies to  access federal taxpayer information collected by the IRS to improve the  accuracy of eligibility decisions.  The Social Security Administration (SSA)  is one agency, for example, that has an extensive data-sharing relationship  with IRS, which aids in administering Social Security benefit programs and  ensuring taxpayer compliance.  At the same time, taxpayers\u2019 privacy must  be protected and various federal laws and agency policies regulate  agencies\u2019 use and disclosure of taxpayer and personal information. Internal  Revenue Code (IRC) Section 6103 allows IRS to disclose taxpayer  information to federal agencies and authorized employees of those  agencies, but only under specific conditions.  Such privacy protection is an  important component of continued voluntary compliance with the internal  revenue laws.", "Data-sharing arrangements between agencies can take different forms.   These arrangements can be applicant- or agency-initiated data sharing.   Applicant-initiated arrangements entail requiring an applicant for a benefit  or employment to secure proof from another agency to qualify for the  benefit or employment.  In these cases, the agency may share the eligibility  proof directly with the agency that would be providing the benefit or  employment.  Agency-initiated sharing can include matching data from two  agencies to help one agency or both agencies verify data accuracy.", "In our July 2004 testimony, we reported that data sharing between IRS and  USCIS has the potential to improve tax compliance as well as immigration  eligibility decisions.  You then requested additional information on  potential benefits and options for data sharing between IRS and USCIS.   For this study, our objectives were to determine the (1) potential benefits  of data matching for IRS and USCIS and (2) options for establishing and  maintaining a data-sharing relationship between the IRS and USCIS,  including any challenges associated with those options.", "In responding to the objectives, we performed work at several IRS offices,  including compliance and research, and at various program and district  offices, and service centers at USCIS.  We also contacted representatives of  two immigration advocacy groups to obtain their perspectives.  Our  findings are based on matching of immigration and IRS taxpayer data,  documents and various publications, and interviews with agency officials.   We used two sets of USCIS data to match with IRS taxpayer data to  determine the potential value for increased data sharing and matching.  We  matched taxpayer data to automated immigration applications and hard  copy immigration applications.  We used a nationwide selection of  automated USCIS applications from immigration applications submitted to  USCIS service centers from 1997 through 2004.  Approximately 3.4 million  of 4.5 million automated immigration records had Social Security numbers  (SSN) or employer identification numbers (EIN) that could be used to  match with SSNs and EINs in IRS databases.  We used these data to  determine whether businesses and others that had applied to sponsor  immigrant workers or immigrants applying to change their immigration  status had filed a tax return with IRS and, if so, whether they owed taxes to  IRS. Because the nationwide selection did not include any financial  information, we also selected a nonprobability sample of about 1,000  immigration hard copy applications for citizenship, employment, and  family-related immigration and change of immigration status filed by  businesses and individuals from 2001 through 2003 at four immigration  locations. We used the hard copy applications to build a database of  personal and financial information.  We used this sample as a second  source of examples of USCIS applicants who may not have filed tax returns  and may have owed taxes to IRS.  For this report, our discussion will focus  on businesses applying to sponsor immigrant workers because the  matching results from our July 2004 testimony identified business sponsors  as the most likely group in which benefits would result.", "We assessed the reliability of IRS\u2019s Individual Master File (IMF) and  Business Master File (BMF) data and the USCIS\u2019s Computer Linked  Application Information Management System, Version 3.0 (CLAIMS 3),  which is a database containing nationwide immigration data.  As part of our  annual audits of IRS\u2019s financial statements, we also assessed the reliability  of IRS\u2019s BMF and IMF data with respect to unpaid assessments by testing  selected statistical samples of unpaid assessment modules.

These checks include verifying  computations on returns, requesting more information about items on a tax  return, and matching information reported by third parties to income  reported by taxpayers on returns (i.e., document matching).  IRS's  document matching program has proven to be a highly cost-effective way  of identifying underreported income, thereby bringing in billions of dollars  of tax revenue while boosting voluntary compliance.", "IRC Section 6103, amended significantly by the Tax Reform Act of 1976, is  the primary law used to restrict IRS's data-sharing capacity. The law  provides that tax returns and return information are confidential and may  not be disclosed by IRS, other federal and/or state employees, and certain  others having access to the information except as provided in IRC Section  6103. IRC Section 6103 allows IRS to disclose taxpayer information to  federal agencies and authorized employees of those agencies for certain  specified purposes. Accordingly, IRC Section 6103 controls whether and  how tax information submitted to IRS on federal tax returns can be shared.  IRC Section 6103 specifies which agencies (or other entities) may have  access to tax return information, the type of information they may access,  for what purposes such access may be granted, and under what conditions  the information will be received.  For example, IRC Section 6103 has  exceptions allowing certain federal benefit and loan programs to use  taxpayer information for eligibility decisions. Because the confidentiality  of tax data is considered crucial to voluntary compliance, if agencies want  to establish new efforts to use taxpayer information, executive branch  policy calls for a business case to support sharing tax data.", "USCIS is part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which was  established by the Homeland Security Act of 2002.  USCIS is responsible  for administering several immigration benefits and services transferred  from the former Immigration Services Division of the Immigration and  Naturalization Service. Included among the immigration benefits and  services USCIS's offices oversee are citizenship, asylum, lawful permanent  residency, employment authorization, refugee status, intercountry  adoptions, replacement immigration documents, family- and employment- related immigration, and foreign student authorization. USCIS's functions  include adjudicating and processing applications for U.S. citizenship and  naturalization, administering work authorizations and other petitions, and  providing services for new residents and citizens. USCIS's employees who  review immigration benefit applications and determine if they should be  approved are its adjudicators.  USCIS's fraud detection units and Fraud  Detection and National Security immigration officers in the districts,  service centers, and asylum offices detect potential fraudulent applications  and any trends or patterns that suggest potential fraud. USCIS staff work  with applicants through the adjudicatory process beginning with initial  contact when an application or petition is filed, through the stages of  gathering information on which to base a decision. This contact continues  to the point of an approval or denial, the production of a final document or  oath ceremony, and the retirement of case records.", "Under current legislative authority, USCIS is not authorized to receive  taxpayer information from IRS directly.  USCIS currently obtains self- reported personal and financial information provided by (1) businesses,  religious organizations, non-profit entities and individuals applying to  sponsor immigrant workers; (2) individuals applying to sponsor relatives;  and (3) individuals applying to enter the country, extend their stay or  obtain citizenship.  USCIS also obtains information from third parties, not  including IRS, to verify applicants\u2019 self-reported data.

As  used in this report, data sharing means obtaining and disclosing  information on individuals between federal agencies (IRS and USCIS) to  ensure taxpayers have met their tax obligations or to determine eligibility  for immigration benefits.  Table 1 lists different forms of data sharing,  enabling authority, information gained, and related examples.", "An example of applicant-initiated sharing occurs via tax checks required by  some states.  A taxpayer may authorize a third party to receive his or her  IRS tax return information via consent. According to an IRS official, many  states may require consents to qualify for benefits or certain types of  employment. For example, the state of Missouri requires applicants to be  current on their state taxes before receiving a new professional license. An  example of agency-initiated sharing is an arrangement between IRS and  SSA for the Combined Annual Wage Reporting Program. SSA processes and  maintains W-2 and W-3 information on employees. IRS maintains personal  and financial information on employees. SSA and IRS conduct exchanges  of information to ensure employers are submitting accurate wage  information and to identify nonfilers.  The agencies have a direct data- sharing arrangement.", "Research shows that certain data-sharing programs have value for  increasing taxpayer compliance since these programs have identified  discrepancies in income reporting amounts and, in some cases, enabled the  assessment of additional dollars in unpaid taxes.  For example, matching  IRS\u2019s unpaid assessment database with the Treasury\u2019s Financial  Management Service\u2019s (FMS) records shows a substantial amount of  money that could have been collected by either IRS or FMS. In particular,  the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 allows IRS to continuously levy up to 15  percent of certain federal payments made to delinquent taxpayers. IRS\u2019s  continuous levy program adds tax debts to FMS\u2019s program for recovering  debts owed to federal agencies. For the levy program, FMS compares  federal payee information from agency payment records with extracts of  IRS\u2019s unpaid assessments. We estimated that IRS could recover at least  $270 million annually from about 70,000 delinquent taxpayers. In addition,  our analysis of a match between FMS\u2019s database on payments to  contractors and IRS\u2019s unpaid assessment database showed that about  33,000 contractors who received substantial federal payments from civilian  agencies during fiscal year 2004 owed a total of more than $3 billion in  unpaid taxes. We estimated that if FMS database deficiencies such as  erroneous Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINs) and invalid contractor  names were corrected, FMS could have collected at least $50 million more  than it did in fiscal year 2004.", "Although data-sharing arrangements can be useful, privacy advocates,  lawmakers, and others are concerned about the extent to which the  government can disclose and share citizens\u2019 personal information,  including sharing with other government agencies.  Historically, lawmakers  and policymakers have created legislation to address these concerns.  For  example, the Privacy Act of 1974 regulates the federal government\u2019s use  of personal information by limiting the collection, disclosure, and use of  personal information maintained in an agency\u2019s system of records.  The  Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 further protects  personal information by requiring agencies to enter into written  agreements, referred to as matching agreements, when they share  information that is protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 for the purpose of  conducting computer matches.", "User fees are collected from identifiable recipients of special benefits  beyond those accruing to the general public, and the amounts are based on  the recovery of costs of providing the service, the market value of goods, or  may be set by legislation.

Financial feasibility refers to the sponsor\u2019s ability to pay wages to or  financially support the individual being sponsored.  For example, if a  company is sponsoring an immigrant for employment, that company must  show that it has sufficient ability to pay the worker.  Information on tax  returns filed with IRS show income levels and these could be used to  validate applicant-provided information.  Legitimacy, in the case of  employment-based petitions, refers to whether a sponsoring business or  organization actually exists, has employees, and has real assets.

For example, at the time of application or during the adjudicatory process,  applicants may be required to provide additional documentation, such as  tax returns from IRS or unofficial copies to verify financial information  reported on immigration forms.  However, immigration officials we spoke  with in five field locations said applicants could alter or falsify those  documents.  According to USCIS officials, designing a data-sharing  arrangement that includes verification of applicant-provided data during  the adjudicatory process would be useful to USCIS adjudicators for the  financial feasibility and legitimacy tests and afford more accurate  immigration eligibility decisions.  Additionally, with an eligibility change as  discussed earlier, business sponsors would be required to file tax returns,  pay amounts due, or make payment arrangements with IRS before  qualifying for immigration benefits.  This, in turn, could result in a higher  likelihood of USCIS getting applications from business sponsors that have  met their tax filing and payment obligations, thereby more likely meeting  USCIS\u2019s financial feasibility and legitimacy criteria.

A representative from one advocacy group  expressed several concerns on behalf of business sponsors including:  Increased delays in the immigration process - from their perspective,  any additional step in the application process could lengthen the time  between when a business decides to sponsor a worker and obtaining  USCIS\u2019s approval.", "Problems with improving USCIS\u2019s technological capabilities \u2013 according  to the immigration advocate, USCIS is still mostly paper-driven and  therefore it is questionable as to whether they could share data  electronically.", "Special tax issues related to small businesses \u2013 many small business  sponsors file tax extensions and, therefore, may not have readily  available tax documents.  Additionally, newer small businesses have no  tax history.", "Adjudicator training \u2013 adjudicators need to understand how to read and  interpret business tax documents because many, in the advocate\u2019s  opinion, have no training in dealing with those complicated documents.", "A representative of another immigration advocacy group also voiced the  same concern about adjudicator training and added that implementing data  sharing may be more useful in dealing with small- and medium-sized  businesses because, based on their experience, larger businesses are less  likely to be involved in immigration fraud.  In addition, although not  mentioned by USCIS officials, one potential unintended effect of data  sharing might be an increased incentive to employ illegal workers.  That is,  if a business knew that its tax status would be checked by USCIS, or if it  was required to meet tax filing and payment obligations before sponsoring  immigrant workers, some businesses might decide to meet their labor force  needs with workers not properly authorized to work in the United States.   Smaller employers, who are more likely to have tax compliance problems  according to IRS, may be more likely to make this choice than larger-sized  businesses.", "According to USCIS officials, adjudicators would find IRS information on  small businesses particularly useful since they are limited in their ability to  assess these businesses\u2019 financial feasibility and legitimacy.  IRS has also  encountered problems in corroborating financial information provided by  small businesses and its research generally shows higher noncompliance  among its small business population.  Among our nonprobability sample,  25 of 43 business sponsors with unpaid assessments reported their net  incomes as less than $10 million on USCIS employment-based  applications.  Additionally, USCIS has begun a series of benefit fraud  assessments, which take a random sample of applications filed within  certain immigrant and nonimmigrant categories and assess them for fraud  by verifying key data reported.  Based on the results of their fraud  assessments, USCIS could focus on businesses that are more prone to  fraud to match IRS data against in determining their financial feasibility  and legitimacy.", "The type of taxpayer data USCIS adjudicators find useful could change  under a USCIS proposal to revise regulations for employment-based  immigration applications. USCIS officials are seeking to revise  requirements since they believe that (1) establishing the validity of the  sponsor is sufficient to meet immigration statutory requirements and (2)  adjudicators were spending too much time trying to establish a sponsor\u2019s  income levels for well-known or established businesses. In the interim, in  May 2004, USCIS issued updated guidance to adjudicators directing them  not to reestablish a sponsor\u2019s ability to pay with its USCIS Form I-485,  Application to Register Permanent Residence or to Adjust Status (see app.  II) to minimize processing delays.  If this regulatory change is made, IRS  taxpayer data could still help adjudicators establish the legitimacy or the  bona fide nature of a business sponsor.  According to USCIS officials, if the  proposed regulation were adopted, USCIS would still need tax documents  but would no longer need specific income information from tax returns.   USCIS adjudicators would need tax return information such as whether the  sponsor filed income tax returns, what years they filed, how many  employees they had, and if they paid taxes, and they would need to further  evaluate whether additional IRS information would be useful.  USCIS  would need specific income information from the tax return, such as  adjusted gross income, only in cases where the initial information provided  by IRS raised questions about the sponsor for USCIS (e.g., if the employer  had unpaid assessments or was a nonfiler).

According to adjudicators, it could take as long as 12 weeks to  receive responses from applicants for a certified IRS tax return, during  which time, the application file sits on a \u201csuspense\u201d shelf, thereby  extending the application processing time.  Due to this time gap, in certain  cases, background checks must be redone, which further lengthens the  application-processing time.

Further, Kansas  requires a tax check on all new and renewing vehicle dealership licenses.  A  March 2003 Kansas Legislative Audit Report found 514 motor vehicle  dealers who owed $7 million in state sales tax. Before a business can apply  or renew its dealership license at the state\u2019s Division of Motor Vehicles  (DMV), the business must present to the DMV proof that it fulfilled its state  tax filing and payment requirements. According to an official with the  Kansas Secretary of Revenue, for an active dealer, the threat of license  revocation provided an incentive to bring non-compliant businesses into  compliance. Businesses with unpaid assessments either paid their  assessments or set up a payment plan.  The state increased its car dealer  tax compliance rate by 97 percent, according to an official with the Kansas  Secretary of Revenue.", "As noted previously, IRS taxpayer consents can also be implemented  electronically.

USCIS officials are agreeable to using  taxpayer consents if they could be implemented electronically in a way  similar to an electronic verification pilot project that was undertaken by  IRS and the Department of Education (Education).  In the pilot, students  who wanted to qualify for financial aid authorized the IRS to release their  tax information to their academic institutions via the Internet.

Also, because the same business sponsor could file  applications more than once in a year, depending on how USCIS  implemented the requirement for a tax check, it could be valid for a certain  period of time according to whatever policy USCIS established.   Subsequently, the business would not have to undergo a tax check every  time it sponsored a worker, which would not strain USCIS\u2019s resources.", "Although use of tax data has helped some federal agencies better  administer their programs, some are concerned that widespread use of  taxpayer consents may undermine taxpayers\u2019 right to privacy and,  subsequently, voluntary tax compliance.  The confidentiality of tax data is  considered by many to be crucial to voluntary compliance.  The Joint  Committee on Taxation and Treasury\u2019s Office of Tax Policy warn that the  use of consents for programmatic governmental purposes potentially  circumvents the general rule of taxpayer confidentiality because the  taxpayer waives certain restrictions on agencies\u2019 use of the data.  When  such waivers are granted, agencies are not obligated to follow the  recordkeeping, reporting, and safeguard requirements that apply to tax  data, although the less stringent requirements of the privacy act may still  apply.

As  mentioned previously, some are concerned that disclosing taxpayer data  could affect the taxpayer\u2019s right to privacy and, subsequently, undermine  voluntary tax compliance. According to Treasury, the burden of supporting  an exception to IRC Section 6103 should be on the requesting agency,  which should make the case for disclosure and provide assurances that the  information will be safeguarded appropriately.  Table 6 lists the criteria  Treasury and IRS have applied when evaluating specific legislative  proposals to amend IRC Section 6103 for governmental disclosures.", "Technological Challenges of Electronic Data Sharing  USCIS must also address a number of technological challenges to lay the  foundation that would enable data sharing to take place between the two  agencies.  For example, in our July 2004 testimony, we reported that:  USCIS does not maintain any automated financial data on applicants.   Although USCIS automates certain personal information from benefit  applications, such as an individual\u2019s name and alien registration number,  it does not automate any financial data that are reported on the benefit  application or in accompanying documents such as tax returns.", "USCIS systems contain some inaccurate data.  We and the Department  of Justice\u2019s Office of Inspector General have criticized USCIS systems  because they contain some inaccurate data for identifying pieces of  information that identifies applicants (such as immigrants\u2019 addresses).", "USCIS and IRS databases do not always have a common numerical  identifier for tracking individuals or businesses.  USCIS uses alien  registration numbers as tracking identifiers whereas IRS uses SSNs or  EINs.  Although USCIS\u2019s systems capture SSNs/EINs if they are provided  on applications, USCIS does not require them to be entered into its  systems.  Thus, even though business sponsors should all have SSNs (if  sole proprietor) or EINs (if another form of business), USCIS may not  have entered the number into automated databases and therefore  cannot match directly to IRS records.", "These limitations in USCIS\u2019s record keeping would make electronic sharing  of data between USCIS and IRS less productive than it otherwise could be,  regardless of whether the data sharing was done directly between the  agencies pursuant to a change in IRC Section 6103 or whether done  through taxpayer consents.  USCIS officials recognize that these problems  could interfere with achieving data sharing in the fully electronic  environment that they hope to achieve for adjudicators, but if a policy  decision was made to share data, they believe that some form of electronic  data sharing could be achieved relatively quickly without major  technological improvements.  The officials believe that USCIS could  develop interim solutions while other USCIS transformation activities are  under way. For example, these officials said USCIS could modify its  existing automated systems to add a SSN/EIN identifier, and could adopt  procedures to ensure the identifiers are routinely entered in all locations.   They view this as a business process and policy challenge rather than a  technological challenge.  They also believe they could link the existing  USCIS record identifiers to SSNs and EINS to enable data sharing to take  place with IRS relatively quickly.", "Officials did offer some cautions about how quickly even these changes  could be implemented.  For example, they said that although adding a  SSN/EIN identifier to their existing systems may only take a few months,  changing immigration forms and notifying adjudicators and the larger  community about the change could take much longer.  As mentioned  previously, these officials contend that establishing a new immigration  requirement on applicants for a tax check will necessitate business process  and procedural changes by USCIS, as well as an education process to the  immigration community and the third parties that assist petitioners with  their applications, which could take years.  Finally, these USCIS officials  pointed out, and the agency\u2019s fiscal year 2006 budget request reflects, that  the agency\u2019s current priorities fall into three areas:  (1) enhancing national  security, (2) eliminating the immigration benefit application backlog, and  (3) improving customer service.  They stated that implementing changes to  enable data sharing with IRS might take a longer time because it is not one  of the agency\u2019s three main priorities.", "If data sharing were to occur, officials ultimately would prefer to have it  integrated into a transformed USCIS information technology (IT)  environment.  Since July 2004, USCIS has taken a number of steps to  improve IT capability.  In March 2005, USCIS unveiled its IT transformation  plan that USCIS describes as a large scale and complex program to  increase capabilities, streamline processes and support the collection of  service fees.  As such, the overall planned IT upgrade includes changes,  which will improve the agency\u2019s overall IT environment as well as facilitate  data sharing such as:   Moving from a paper to an automated environment;  Adding a unique identifier to track records for background checks; Implementing electronic adjudication whereby adjudicators will be able  to review immigration applications and supporting evidence online,  among the first increments of the IT upgrade.", "Of the many ongoing activities related to USCIS\u2019s IT transformation, USCIS  officials described three major projects under way to improve its ability to  receive and share data within the agency as well as with other agencies:   Data layer/repository \u2013 this project will present users with a  consolidated system to access information from 63 USCIS systems  rather than the current situation where users have to log onto separate  systems to obtain data.

However, these projects have not gotten  under way as scheduled; the start of the pilots is dependent on the data  layer and software updates being in place.  USCIS could not provide us  with a completion date for the data layer and e-adjudication pilots due, in  part, to uncertainty regarding future funding.  USCIS expects to complete  full implementation for its information technology transformation by fiscal  year 2010.  We are examining USCIS\u2019s technological improvements as part  of our ongoing work on immigration backlog and benefit fraud issues.", "Cost Challenges of Data Sharing  Estimating the cost benefit associated with establishing and maintaining a  data-sharing relationship can be complicated.   One reason developing a  cost estimate is difficult is because electronic methods of sharing data can  vary, and different costs are associated with different methods of sharing.   For example, USCIS may incur technological costs related to improving  their IT capability to enable data sharing, which can be processed by either  magnetic tape or computer file, each of which has different costs. However,  some of the necessary IT improvements are already planned and would be  funded as part of USCIS\u2019s comprehensive upgrade of its IT systems if data  sharing with IRS does not occur.", "Estimating the cost benefit is also complicated because of the difficulty  both agencies may encounter in establishing costs for providing the  service.  The Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 states  that no matching program can be approved unless the agency has  preformed a cost-benefit analysis for the proposed matching program that  demonstrates the program is likely to be cost effective. Similarly,  Treasury's criteria for considering whether a statutory change should be  made for the sharing of tax data stresses the importance of documenting  whether a substantial benefit is likely and what the resource demands on  IRS would be to support sharing the data.  In our July 2004 testimony, we  recommended that IRS and USCIS assess the benefits and costs of data  sharing to enhance tax compliance and improve immigration eligibility  decisions.  IRS responded by stating it would study the issues and work  with USCIS to identify possible solutions.  DHS/USCIS agreed with our  recommendation and said they were \u201cexploring a technical capability for  effectively and efficiently sharing data with the IRS on individuals who  apply for immigration benefits.\u201d  In addition, in 2004, we reported IRS did  not have a cost accounting system capable of providing reliable cost  information, and in 2004, we also reported USCIS had insufficient cost  data to determine the full extent of its operating costs.", "Finally, estimating the cost benefit is also complicated because of  uncertainty regarding the net benefits that would be gained from data  sharing.  For example, IRS is unable to pursue all of the current leads that it  receives from existing data corroboration efforts, like document matching.   Therefore, to the extent that obtaining and analyzing additional data from  USCIS developed more leads for possible enforcement actions, IRS likely  would only be able to pursue the portion of cases that exceeds thresholds  IRS uses in determining how many cases to pursue.  Further, apparent  noncompliance may not be substantiated.  For example, some of those who  appear not to have filed tax returns based on matching IRS and USCIS data  may indeed have filed but were not found in IRS\u2019s databases due to  inaccurate information in USCIS files or otherwise not have a filing  obligation.  Of business sponsors with unpaid assessments, some portion  likely would be unable to repay all taxes owed.  From USCIS's perspective,  although we found that many businesses may not have filed tax returns or  may owe taxes, some of these situations may not be significant enough to  affect a USCIS adjudicator's decision about their financial feasibility or  legitimacy.  For instance, some of the businesses applying to sponsor  immigrant workers that owe taxes may not owe enough to raise doubts  about their ability to pay the worker.

Although the agencies would benefit in differing ways,  establishing and implementing data sharing can be beneficial to both  agencies.  For tax compliance purposes, requiring a tax check\u2014 documenting whether a business sponsor has filed required returns and  paid required taxes\u2014likely would lead some businesses to come into  compliance because they would know that USCIS would consider this  information in determining whether the business can sponsor immigrant  workers.  However, because USCIS would only consider this information as  one indication of whether businesses qualify to sponsor workers, a greater  tax compliance increase is likely if businesses were required to meet tax  filing and payment obligations as a condition for sponsoring workers.   Given the billions of dollars of unpaid tax assessments among past  business sponsors, our matching results illustrate strong potential for  increased tax collections from changing immigration eligibility  requirements.  Although USCIS officials say no statutory provision  prohibits USCIS from changing its regulations to require business sponsors  to meet their tax filing and payment obligations, officials believe a statutory  change would better withstand a legal challenge.  Further, because  collecting the unpaid assessments of business sponsors would displace  other tax collections work, absent funding to cover its costs of bringing the  business sponsors into compliance, IRS might not realize a net increase in  overall tax collections.", "For immigration eligibility purposes, requiring business sponsors to meet  their tax filing and payment obligations would help ensure businesses  applying to sponsor immigrant workers are legitimate.

In order to develop a better  understanding of the implementation challenges and costs, to explore the  most practical options for full scale implementation of data sharing, and to  more completely assess benefits to IRS and USCIS from data sharing,  USCIS should undertake a pilot test of data sharing under existing  authority to use taxpayer consents to obtain tax data.   Such a study would  be consistent with congressional and executive branch policies that stress  that sharing of tax data be thoroughly justified given concerns about  possible adverse effects on tax compliance if the confidentiality of  taxpayer\u2019s data is compromised.  Additionally, a study could assess issues  raised by USCIS\u2019s Ombudsman and immigration advocacy groups.  A study  would provide executive and legislative policymakers better information  for determining the costs and benefits of data sharing and whether USCIS  should require taxpayer consents from all future business sponsors or  whether a change to IRC Section 6103 would better support efficient data  sharing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To improve taxpayer compliance and USCIS\u2019s immigration benefit  decisions, Congress should consider (1) changing immigration eligibility to  require businesses applying to sponsor immigrant workers to meet tax  filing and payment obligations to sponsor immigrant workers and  (2) authorizing a user fee to be collected and retained by IRS to cover the  costs of bringing non-compliant taxpayers into compliance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the accuracy and timeliness of USCIS\u2019s immigration eligibility  decisions absent requiring businesses to have met their tax filing and  payment obligations, we recommend the Secretary of the Department of  Homeland Security direct USCIS, in consultation with the IRS, to conduct a  pilot data-sharing test.  In the test, USCIS should require a tax check for  selected businesses and other entities applying to sponsor immigrant  workers before qualifying for immigration benefits.  The pilot test should  assess and document the costs and benefits of data sharing including key  issues such as using paper or electronic consents, or pursuing specific IRC  Section 6103 disclosure authority, assessing resource implications, and  considering how the agencies would allocate responsibilities for collecting  and allocating user fees from the business sponsors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The Commissioner of Internal Revenue provided written comments on a  draft of this report in a September 16, 2005, letter.  The Commissioner  agreed that data sharing between the IRS and USCIS within the Department  of Homeland Security may have many benefits.  IRS agreed to conduct a  small-scale pilot test, in conjunction with USCIS, to determine whether a  business case exists for supporting data sharing before pursuing legislation  or a large-scale taxpayer consent program.  The Commissioner also stated  an executive working group will determine the merits of applying user fees  for compliance data sharing.", "On behalf of the Secretary of DHS, the Director of DHS\u2019s Office of  Inspector General Liaison provided written comments on a draft of this  report in a September 26, 2005, letter.  The Director generally agreed with  our recommendation and acknowledged the pilot program would be  consistent with USCIS\u2019s desire to explore ways to streamline its processes  and could provide necessary information with respect to considering the  feasibility of initiatives such as data sharing on a larger scale.   He  appreciated GAO\u2019s recognition of the burden of paper taxpayer consent  forms place on USCIS and its reluctance to embark on a process that would  be largely paper-based.", "Although the Director generally agreed with our recommendation, his  agreement was contingent on the extent to which USCIS can lawfully  engage in a pilot program as we recommend.  The Director\u2019s letter did not  elaborate on his uncertainty regarding USCIS\u2019s ability to lawfully engage in  the recommended pilot program.  Based on supplemental communication,  his concern focused on USCIS\u2019s authority to require business sponsors to  consent to a tax check.  According to the Director, immigration laws  contain no explicit prohibition on conditioning employer petitions on their  tax compliance and doing so might be legally defensible.  Nevertheless, he  said USCIS has serious legal concerns about USCIS\u2019s authority to  promulgate regulations with such a requirement.", "The Director did not describe the legal concerns and therefore we do not  have a basis to evaluate them.  Consulting with IRS in determining how to  design the pilot test should help USCIS resolve these concerns.  We note  that Education requires taxpayer consents as a condition of participation in  certain student loan repayment programs.  Should USCIS ultimately  conclude that it does not have authority to require such a waiver, an option  for proceeding with the pilot test would be to ask selected business  applicants to voluntarily allow USCIS to directly obtain tax data from IRS.   Taxpayers may authorize others to obtain their tax data directly from IRS.", "The Director also expressed concerns about the impact of ongoing tax  disputes on immigration benefit decisions if those decisions are contingent  on a taxpayer being required to meet tax filing and payment obligations.   We believe consultations between USCIS and IRS in designing a pilot  program can address this issue.  For instance, officials might decide that  businesses with some minimal level of tax underpayment or businesses  with tax delinquencies that are actively participating in a payment  arrangement with IRS would not be disqualified from sponsoring  immigrant workers.  We would urge USCIS and IRS to develop data-sharing  policies that would minimize the impact of ongoing tax disputes on  immigration benefit decisions for business sponsors.", "In commenting on a user fee to be collected and retained by the IRS, the  Director agreed that IRS should be provided with adequate resources to  carry out its tax compliance mission but had serious concerns about the  user fee proposal.  The Director commented that policy considerations  have kept USCIS from completely using its authority to recover its full  costs.  He noted that Congress has mandated several additional fees for  certain employment-based applications and that, \u201cin short, the more  interagency functions the overall cost of an application to USCIS is  expected to support, the higher the cost to the applicant without  consequent improvements in USCIS services, the less likely it is that USCIS  will be able to increase its fees as may be necessary to fully recover its own  costs.\u201d   The Director also noted that we had previously reported that fee  collections are not sufficient to pay USCIS\u2019s full costs.", "We understand that many considerations must be taken into account in  setting USCIS\u2019s overall fees.  However, as our report indicates, obtaining a  benefit from IRS\u2019s perspective depends substantially on having sufficient  funds to bring business applicants that have outstanding tax filing or  payment obligations into compliance.  Further, as also indicated in our  report, USCIS access to IRS tax data for determining immigration benefit  decisions has the potential to improve service to USCIS\u2019s business  applicants because it could decrease rework and follow-up work with the  applicant that currently occurs.  This would help USCIS in minimizing  processing time for all business sponsors.  Ultimately, with more routine  access to IRS data, USCIS might not need to request as much financial  information from business applicants as it does now since USCIS officials  themselves see IRS data as more reliable than information provided by  applicants.  Finally, the GAO report cited by the Director did conclude that  USCIS fees were not sufficient to fully fund USCIS\u2019s operations.  The  insufficiencies, however, were not due to fees being collected for  interagency functions.  Rather, we said this resulted because USCIS\u2019s fee  schedule was based on an outdated fee study that did not include all costs  of USCIS\u2019s operations and costs had increased since the fee study was  conducted.", "Finally, the Director commented that the proposed user fee to cover IRS\u2019s  compliance related costs seemed to be different in concept from other  existing user fees.  As the Director noted, it was not within the scope of our  review to examine all user fee relationships between IRS and other  agencies.  Based on the work we did, we are not aware of another case in  which IRS receives a user fee to bring applicants for other agencies\u2019  benefits into compliance with their tax obligations.  However, Congress has  authorized new or expanded funding arrangements to help IRS deal with its  workload.  For instance, in Treasury\u2019s appropriations for 1995, Congress  specifically authorized IRS to establish new user fees or raise existing fees  for services provided in order to increase receipts.  More recently,  Congress also authorized IRS to use private collection agencies to assist in  collecting delinquent taxes and specified that up to 25 percent of money  collected can be used to pay the collection agencies and another 25 percent  can be retained by IRS.  Given the substantial unpaid taxes that we found  among businesses applying to sponsor immigrant workers, we believe that  it is appropriate for Congress to consider steps for effectively bringing  these taxpayers into compliance without unduly deterring IRS from  pursuing other noncompliant taxpayers.  As our report explains, for this to  occur, IRS\u2019s costs for bringing the noncompliant business sponsors into  compliance must be covered, otherwise IRS might experience a net  decrease in tax collections.   Consequently, our report put forth the user fee  as one option for Congress to consider for supporting a potential data- sharing arrangement between IRS and USCIS.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly release its contents earlier  we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from the date of  this letter.

As  part of our annual audits of IRS\u2019s financial statements, we also assess the  reliability of IRS\u2019s BMF and IMF data with respect to unpaid assessments  by testing selected statistical samples of unpaid assessment modules.  We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report.", "Our review was subject to some limitations.  We relied on IRS officials to  identify offices that use personal information because there is no central,  coordinating point within IRS for receipt of this type of information. We  relied on USCIS officials to identify immigration forms they believed would  most benefit from data sharing with IRS, and we relied on IRS and USCIS  officials\u2019 views on possible impediments or missed opportunities to verify  information, any additional data sharing and verification needs, and the  benefits of increased disclosure of taxpayer information. Because our  sample of 984 hard copy applications at selected USCIS field locations was  not a probability sample, we cannot make inferences about the population  of applications. In addition, because employer identification  numbers/social security numbers were only available for 3.4 million of the  4.5 million applications in our nationwide selection of automated  applications, our findings from these records are not representative of the  entire population. We did not assess the reliability or quality of taxpayer  information collected by IRS or the accuracy of information applicants  reported to USCIS.  Immigration applicants/taxpayers who were in IRS\u2019s  non-filer database could include individuals who did not meet IRS filing  requirements.  We relied on IRS\u2019s investigation of the 33 business sponsors  that were not in IRS\u2019s databases since disclosure rules limit our contact  with taxpayers. Since IRS searched its tax data for the last 5 years (1999\u2013 2004) and we collected 7 years of immigration data (1997-2004), an  unknown but likely small percentage of the businesses that submitted  applications during 1997 and 1998, but are unknown to IRS, could be no  longer in operation.  Additionally, we did not assess the reliability of IRS  data on the cost of paper taxpayer consents since we used this information  for background purposes.

First, we used a nationwide  selection of automated data on certain immigration applications: I-129  (Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker), I-140 (Immigrant Petition for Alien  Worker), and I-360 (Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special  Immigrant) submitted from January 1, 1997, through March 5, 2004, to  USCIS service centers for immigration benefits.  We used only those  applications in USCIS\u2019s Computer Linked Application Information  Management System, Version 3.0 (CLAIMS 3), a database containing  nationwide data that contained an individual\u2019s Social Security Number  (SSN) or a business\u2019s Employer Identification Number (EIN).  For the  matching process, 3.4 million out of 4.5 million records had usable SSNs or  EINs. We obtained automated data for those years because USCIS\u2019s  automated system had historical data not readily available in hard copy  files. We used these data to determine whether businesses and others that  had applied to sponsor immigrant workers or immigrants applying to  change their immigration status had filed a tax return with IRS and, if so,  whether they owed taxes to IRS. Because the nationwide selection did not  include any financial information, we could not use it to determine whether  USCIS applicants reported the same income amounts to IRS and USCIS.", "Second, we visited five USCIS field locations and selected a nonprobability  sample of 984 immigration files covering the period of 2001 through 2003 at  four of the locations because they contained personal as well as financial  information. These hard copy files were applications for citizenship,  employment, and family-related immigration and change of immigration  status applications. We used the hard copy immigration files to build an  automated database of certain personal information, such as the  individual\u2019s SSN or business\u2019s EIN and income reported to USCIS. We  obtained hard copy files for those years because the USCIS offices we  visited had immigration applications for those years on-site. Immigration  offices send older files to storage.  Since each district and service center  organized and stored its applications in a different way and immigration  officials could not always provide an updated count of applications by form  number, we developed an approach to selecting applications that included  pulling approximately every 50th file in immigration file rooms. We  generally selected approximately 50-75 files at each field location for the  following forms: I-129 (Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker); I-140  (Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker); N-400 (Application for  Naturalization); I-751 (Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence); I- 360 (Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant); and I-864  (Affidavit of Financial Support) that accompanies the I-485 (Application to  Register Permanent Residence or to Adjust Status). We planned to select 50  files for Form I-829 (Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions) but  only reviewed 12 files due to resource constraints and the voluminous  nature of the application files. The matching results for our nonprobability  sample included Form I-829s for a small number of individual immigrants  who had unpaid assessments or were nonfilers and none for business or  individual sponsors.", "To facilitate matching immigration and taxpayer data, we divided  immigration applicants into three groups:  business sponsors, individual  sponsors, and individual beneficiaries.  We matched the SSNs/EINs in our  nationwide selection of immigration applications and our nonprobability  sample of immigration applications with IRS's Business Master File (BMF)  and Individual Master File (IMF) and other subsets such as the Revenue  and Refunds Database.  We identified immigration applicants/taxpayers  that (1) matched with the IRS master files, (2) had unpaid assessments, (3)  were nonfilers, (4) were businesses/organizations that had no record of tax  activity in the last 5 years, and (5) did not match IRS master files.  Additionally, to ensure we identified only business and organization  sponsors whose EINs were unknown to IRS, we had IRS perform three  additional matches using its BMF Taxpayer Identification Number Cross- Reference File, the BMF Entity File and the IMF Entity File.", "We used this sample to determine whether USCIS applicants reported the  same income information to IRS as to USCIS and also as a second source of  examples of USCIS applicants may who not have filed tax returns and may  have owed taxes to IRS.", "Tables 1-3 show our results on business sponsors, individual sponsors, and  individual beneficiaries that have unpaid assessments or are nonfilers for  both our nationwide selection and nonprobability sample of immigration  files."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Internal Revenue Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, major contributors to this  assignment were Signora J.
