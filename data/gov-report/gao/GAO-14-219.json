Faced with aggressive timelines for distributing billions of dollars, they adopted a number of practices to foster accountability including (1) strong support by top leaders; (2) centrally-situated collaborative governance structures; (3) the use of networks and agreements to share information and work towards common goals; and (4) adjustments to, and innovations in, usual approaches to conducting oversight such as the increased use of up-front risk assessments, the gathering of \"real time\" information, earlier communication of audit findings, and the use of advanced data analytics. For example, in 2009, the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (Recovery Board) established the Recovery Operations Center which used advanced data analysis techniques to identify potential fraud and errors before and after payments were made. The Recovery Act's emphasis on accountability also presented challenges for several states and federal agencies. These included limited resources for oversight at the state and local levels, and the speed with which Recovery Act funds were distributed. One state addressed the challenge of limited resources by transferring funds from its central administration account to Recovery Act oversight. To facilitate the quick distribution of funds, maintenance-of-effort provisions concerning transportation projects (which prevented Recovery funds from being used for planned state projects) were rolled out before the Department of Transportation had time to issue sufficiently detailed definitions of what constituted \"state funding.\" To address this challenge, the department had to issue clarifying guidance to states seven times during the first year of the Recovery Act.", "Federal, state, and local officials also developed practices and encountered challenges related to the transparency of Recovery Act funds. An example of one good practice that was required by the Recovery Act was the creation of the Recovery.gov website. This site, as well as similar portals created by states and localities, demonstrated several leading practices for effective government websites. These included (1) establishing a clear purpose, (2) using social networking tools to garner interest, (3) tailoring the website to meet audience needs, and (4) obtaining stakeholder input during design. Efforts to increase transparency also led to challenges for several states and federal agencies. For example, some recipients lacked knowledge or expertise in using the data systems needed to report grant spending, while others faced challenges with reporting the same data to multiple systems. Early GAO reviews also found several problems with job reporting data including discrepancies in how full time equivalents were recorded and the capacity of recipients to meet reporting deadlines. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) addressed these challenges by issuing additional guidance and providing technical support. Finally, agencies receiving Recovery Act funds were required to submit performance plans that identified measures on a program-by-program basis. The level of detail and the specificity of outcomes in these plans varied greatly for the agencies GAO examined, making it difficult to determine the extent to which some were making progress toward their goals and demonstrating results."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making any recommendations in this report.

The Recovery Act required that we conduct these bimonthly  reviews of how these funds were used by selected states and localities.  This report also fulfills this requirement in that we examined the use of  Recovery Act funds in the previously mentioned states and cities. To  obtain a broader state perspective, we interviewed officials from the state  Recovery Act coordinators\u2019 network, which included key state officials  responsible for implementing the Recovery Act from several states.

The President assigned overall management responsibility for the  Recovery Act to the Vice President and appointed a former OMB deputy  director to head the newly-created Recovery Implementation Office with  direct reporting responsibilities to both him and the Vice President. The  former head of the Recovery Implementation Office told us that his  position gave him access to top leadership in the administration. This  official said he participated in daily morning staff meetings with the White  House senior staff, briefing them on any issues related to the Recovery  Act. He briefed the President directly approximately once a month. In  addition, he typically met with the Vice President\u2019s staff on a daily basis  after the President\u2019s staff meeting.

The former head of the Recovery  Implementation Office stated this was key to his ability to ensure  cooperation and coordination with other federal departments during the  Recovery Act. For example, he told us that senior government leaders  knew that his office had the authority of the President and Vice President  behind it, and if they did not do what was requested, they would have to  explain their reasoning to senior White House officials. This awareness of  the Recovery Implementation Office\u2019s line of authority helped to ensure  that federal officials coordinated and cooperated with the office. In turn,  the involvement and engagement of top leaders at individual federal  agencies was facilitated by OMB guidance that required each agency to  identify a senior accountable official\u2014generally at the deputy secretary or  subcabinet level\u2014to be responsible for Recovery planning,  implementation, and performance activities within the agency.senior agency leaders were regularly involved with overseeing and  reporting on Recovery Act efforts.", "At the state level, several governors demonstrated top leadership support  by establishing specific positions, offices, or both that were responsible  for state Recovery efforts.

This was done in two ways: (1) by soliciting feedback from state  and local partners when formulating and revising rules and policies  governing the implementation of Recovery Act programs and (2) by  developing its capacity to respond to questions from the many states and  localities that would be implementing those rules and policies. A senior  OMB official directly involved in this work told us the office had to move  out of its traditional role as mainly a policy-making organization to adopt a  more interactive and service-oriented approach. Under this approach, key  activities involved engaging with and obtaining feedback from states and  localities as well as providing technical support to these groups so that  they could meet the Recovery Act\u2019s numerous reporting requirements.", "For example, to obtain feedback from state and local partners when  developing key Recovery Act policies, OMB became actively involved in  weekly conference calls that included a diverse group of federal, state,  and local organizations.

These weekly calls were  scheduled after several of these organizations wrote to OMB and GAO to  express their strong interest in coordinating on reporting and compliance  aspects of the Recovery Act. An important outcome of this regular  information exchange was to make OMB aware of the need to clarify  certain reporting requirements. The Recovery Act required federal  agencies to make information publicly available on the estimate of the  number of jobs created and number of jobs retained as a result of  activities funded by the act. Our previous Recovery Act work in the states  raised the issue that some local officials needed clarification regarding  definitions when reporting on job data. The local partners participating in  these calls were able to corroborate what we reported and provide OMB  with specific information about what additional guidance was needed. To  obtain information to further guide refinements to the Recovery  implementation process, at the end of 2009, OMB officials said they (1)  interviewed and surveyed numerous stakeholders including governors  and state and local recipients, and (2) worked with GAO to identify best  practices. Based on these efforts, OMB subsequently revised its  guidance, which focused on lessons learned around enhancing recipient  reporting and compliance.", "To improve technical support provided to state and local governments  implementing the Recovery Act, OMB worked with the Recovery Board to  establish an assistance center based on an \u201cincident command\u201d model.", "One OMB official likened this approach to an extension of a traditional  response model used during natural disasters, where the country\u2019s  economic condition during the Great Recession was the \u201cincident\u201d and  the Recovery Act was the intervention to be rolled out through many  partners. To help implement this approach, OMB worked with officials  from the Department of Agriculture who offered the services of one of  their national emergency management teams to help set up and  coordinate this effort. Given the large number of state and local  governments that needed to be supported, OMB requested that each  agency with grant programs receiving Recovery Act funds contribute  personnel to support the center.

For example, in February 2013 we found that the Department of Energy (DOE) built on its Recovery  Act-related performance reviews and established quarterly performance  reviews, called business quarterly reviews, in 2011. Another control  DOE implemented for large dollar projects was a \u201cStage-Gate\u201d process,  which did not allow the funds to be disbursed all at one time.

Toward this end, the OIG conducted up-front risk  assessments by looking at its prior work to identify persistent  implementation issues going back to fiscal year 2003. The OIG then  issued a 2009 capping report that summarized these issues. This report  and additional risk assessments on Recovery Act-specific issues guided  the OIG's internal control audits that focused on the use of funds, cash  management, subrecipient monitoring, and data quality for Recovery Act  education programs.", "Shortly after the Recovery Act was signed, DOE\u2019s OIG reviewed the  challenges the agency would need to address to effectively manage the  unprecedented level of funding and to meet the goals of the Recovery  Act.

The  purpose of these capacity reviews was to enable the office to actively  address and work to resolve known issues before Recovery Act funds  were distributed to programs.", "At the state level, audit organizations also adjusted their usual  approaches when planning and conducting reviews of grant programs  that received Recovery Act funds. Several state auditors conducted extra  audit work of state programs up front in an effort to identify risks and  inform their work moving forward. For example, the Office of the  California State Auditor conducted \u201creadiness reviews\u201d that highlighted  known vulnerabilities in programs receiving Recovery Act money. The  office used the information coming out of these reviews to identify specific  issues to focus on in future work as well as to inform the oversight  committees of the state legislature and other state officials involved in  Recovery Act oversight and implementation. As a result of one such  review that focused on DOE\u2019s Weatherization Assistance Program, the  State Auditor was able to identify key implementation issues that needed  attention at a joint meeting of state and federal officials organized by the  Governor\u2019s Recovery Act Task Force. The readiness review identified  specific areas where the program needed to improve and informed the  frequency with which state auditors would go back to program officials to  check on progress. According to the California state auditor, among the  benefits of this approach was the feedback it provided to state agencies  on their level of readiness as well as the detailed information given to  both the state legislature and the Governor\u2019s Recovery Act Task Force on  the agency\u2019s progress.

Under this approach, members of the  oversight community looked for ways to inform program officials of  challenges and needed improvements much earlier in the process. For  example, as described previously in table 1, the Recovery Act specified  several roles for us, including conducting bimonthly reviews of selected  states\u2019 and localities\u2019 use of funds made available under the Act.

As we previously  reported, the NRTs were composed of FHWA staff\u2014separated from the  rest of FHWA\u2014to act as a neutral third party to conduct oversight. The  mission of the NRTs was to conduct quick reviews of FHWA programs  and assess processes and compliance with federal requirements in six  key risk areas: (1) preliminary plans, specifications, and estimates; (2)  contract administration; (3) quality assurance of construction materials;  (4) local public agencies; (5) disadvantaged business enterprises; and (6)  eligibility for payments. As a review progressed, the NRT discussed  findings with division office and state transportation staff. According to  FHWA officials, independent reviews had several benefits: a consistent, comparative perspective on the oversight regularly  conducted by division offices, and the collection of information at the  national level on both best practices and recurring trouble spots  across FHWA division offices; additional \u201cboots on the ground\u201d for project-level oversight and  increased awareness of federal oversight activity among states,  Metropolitan Planning Organizations, and other transportation  organizations receiving Recovery Act funds; and an independent outside voice to examine Recovery Act projects and  point out problems, keeping the partnering relationship between the  division offices and the state DOTs intact.", "Division offices and state officials with whom we spoke responded  positively to the NRT reviews.

According to OIG staff, these advisories informed the  department of issues or concerns shortly after they were discovered,  thereby permitting program staff to take corrective action much more  quickly.", "In our first report on our bimonthly reviews of the use of Recovery Act  funds by selected states and localities, we determined that the Single  Audit process needed adjustment to provide the necessary level of focus  and accountability over Recovery Act funds in a timelier manner than the  current schedule. Subsequently, we recommended that the director of  OMB adjust the Single Audit process to provide for review of the design of  internal controls during 2009 over programs to receive Recovery Act  funding, before significant expenditures in 2010. In response, in October  2009 OMB implemented the Single Audit Internal Control Project\u2014a  collaborative effort between 16 volunteer states receiving Recovery Act  funds, their auditors, and the federal government\u2014to achieve more timely  communication of internal control deficiencies for higher-risk Recovery  Act programs. The project encouraged auditors to identify and  communicate significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal  controls over compliance for selected major Recovery Act programs 3  months sooner than the 9-month time frame required under statute. The  project allowed program management officials at an audited agency to  expedite corrective action and help mitigate the risk of improper Recovery  Act expenditures. In May 2010, we reported that the project met some of  its objectives and was helpful in identifying critical areas where further  OMB actions were needed to improve the Single Audit process over  Recovery Act funding.", "Auditors at the local level also communicated their findings early. For  example, the Denver City Auditor\u2019s Office adopted new practices to  provide more timely information on Recovery Act programs to the Mayor  and other key officials, particularly on issues affecting compliance with  Recovery Act reporting requirements. Using a tiered notification process,  the auditor\u2019s office would initially notify the appropriate city department  informally through e-mail or a similar means of potential issues they were  finding during an on-going audit. The auditor\u2019s office would revisit the  issues later and, if the office determined the issue had not been  addressed, it would then formally communicate any substantive issue on  a real-time basis through an \u201caudit alert.\u201d These alerts were typically brief  documents and went to the affected departments as well as directly to the  Mayor\u2019s work group that oversaw the city\u2019s Recovery Act implementation.  If appropriate action was still not forthcoming, the city auditor might issue  a public alert or maybe a full public audit report. According to a senior city  audit official, the alerts were beneficial because the city auditor did not  have to conduct a full audit to communicate risks and findings to decision  makers, allowing them to more quickly address problems. The city auditor  issued its first audit alert in October 2009 and subsequently issued  another one in February 2010 when problems from the first one had not  been addressed.

Specifically, predictive analytic technologies can be used to identify  potential fraud and errors before payments are made, while other  techniques, such as data-mining and data-matching of multiple  databases, can identify fraud or improper payments that have already  been awarded, thus assisting agencies in recovering these dollars. In  October 2009, the Recovery Board established an innovative center to  analyze the use of Recovery Act funds by employing data analytics (see  figure 3).

With oversight capacity already strained in many states, the situation was  further exacerbated by increased workloads resulting from  implementation of new or expanded grant programs funded by the  Recovery Act. For example, Massachusetts officials explained that the  state oversight community faced budget cuts of about 10 percent.  According to officials from the OIG and the State Auditor\u2019s office, their  budgets are almost entirely composed of salaries, and any cuts in funding  resulted in fewer staff available to conduct oversight. As a result of the  cuts, the Inspector General stated that his department did not have the  resources to conduct any additional oversight related to Recovery Act  funds. Further, the Massachusetts State Auditor described how his  department had to furlough staff for 6 days in fiscal year 2009. In  recognition of this situation and reflective of the state\u2019s desire to pursue  fraud in the Recovery Act program, for state fiscal years 2009 through  2012, the Massachusetts Recovery and Reinvestment Office allocated  funds from the state\u2019s central administration account to the Attorney  General, State Auditor, and OIG offices to ensure that oversight would  take place.", "The California State Auditor also cited the lack of federal funding for state  and local oversight as a challenge to ensuring accountability in the  implementation of the Recovery Act.

As a result, under the  Recovery Act\u2019s accelerated rollout requirements, some federal agencies  and states faced oversight challenges.", "For example, DOT and states faced numerous challenges in  implementing the Recovery Act\u2019s maintenance-of-effort oversight  mechanism due to the accelerated rollout of funds. The Recovery Act  contains maintenance of effort provisions designed to prevent recipients,  such as state DOTs, public housing agencies, and private companies,  from substituting planned spending for a given program with Recovery  Act funds. That is, the provisions ensured that the increased federal  spending would supplement rather than replace state, local, or private  spending. The maintenance-of-effort provision for DOT in the Recovery  Act required the governor of each state to certify that the state would  maintain its planned level of transportation spending from February 17,  2009, through September 30, 2010. Twenty-one states did not meet  their certified planned spending levels, and a January 2011 preliminary  DOT report found that some of these states were unclear on what  constituted \u201cstate funding\u201d. DOT also found some of the states were  unclear about how well DOT guidance on calculating planned  expenditures would work in the many different contexts in which it would  have to operate. As a result, many problems came to light only after DOT  had issued initial guidance and states had submitted their first  certifications. DOT issued guidance seven times during the first year after  the act was signed to clarify how states were to calculate their planned or  actual expenditures for their maintenance-of-effort certifications. Further,  many states did not have an existing means to identify planned  transportation expenditures for a specific period, and their financial and  accounting systems did not capture that data. Therefore, according to  DOT and some state officials, a more narrowly focused requirement  applying only to programs administered by state DOTs or to programs  that typically receive state funding could have helped address the  maintenance-of-effort challenges. DOT and state officials told us that  while the maintenance-of-effort requirement can be useful for ensuring  continued investment in transportation, allowing more flexibility for  differences in states and programs, and adjustments for unexpected  changes to states\u2019 economic conditions, should be considered for future  provisions.", "At DOE, the department initially encountered some challenges with fully  developing a management and accountability infrastructure because of  the large amount of Recovery Act funding it received in a short period of  time.

Further, DOE required  recipients\u2019 weatherization plans to address how the respective state\u2019s  current and expanded workforce (employees and contractors) would be  trained. In May 2010, according to DOE, the agency was in the process of  developing national standards for weatherization certification and  accreditation. DOE estimated that developing the standards would take  about 2 years\u2014a time frame that did not match the accelerated timing of  the Recovery Act\u2019s funds\u2019 distribution.

For example, Stimulus Tracker broke  down each award into several projects, each of which had its own  dashboard page that displayed information such as (1) the status of the  project, (2) the percentage of total funds spent, (3) start date and  spending deadlines, and (4) the number of jobs created or retained.  Visitors to the site could drill into a record of every payment made with  stimulus funds through the additional feature \u201cPayment Tracker\u201d and  every contract to carry out stimulus-funded work through \u201cContract  Tracker.\u201d", "Stimulus Tracker also offered an interactive map for site visitors who were  interested in knowing how stimulus dollars were allocated geographically  and where specific projects were located. This information was layered on  top of the city\u2019s existing online map portal. It included such items as the  locations of schools, libraries, hospitals, and subways, as well as online  property, building, statistics, and census information. As New York City\u2019s  existing online map portal could already be navigated either by entering a  specific address or simply using zoom and scroll tools, city Recovery Act  officials were able to build on this application and include a city mapping  tool for Recovery Act funds where the public could find any project with a  discrete location.

The Recovery Act\u2019s recipient reporting requirements apply only to  nonfederal recipients of funding, including all entities other than  individuals receiving Recovery Act funds directly from the federal  government such as state and local governments, private companies,  educational institutions, nonprofits, and other private organizations. As  required by section 1512(c) of the Recovery Act, recipients were to  submit quarterly reports that included the total amount of Recovery Act  funds received, the amount of funds expended or obligated to projects or  activities, and a detailed list of those projects or activities. For each  project or activity, the detailed list was to include the project\u2019s name,  description, and an evaluation of its completion status. Also, the recipient  reports were to include detailed information on any subcontracts or  subgrants as required by the Federal Funding Accountability and  Transparency Act of 2006. For example, recipient reports are required  to also include details on sub-awards and other payments.", "With the Recovery Act\u2019s enhanced reporting requirements on spending,  agencies and recipients faced several challenges. Many agencies and  state and local partners were limited in their capacity to meet the  enhanced reporting requirements due to a lack of knowledge and  expertise. Others struggled with the burden of double reporting when they  had to report to federal systems tracking Recovery dollars as well as to  agency systems because, in some cases, agencies required more data to  manage their programs. Finally, some had trouble reporting data for  certain projects within the operational limitations of place-based data  mapping systems.", "Capacity to meet reporting requirements. Many state and local  partners were limited in their capacity to meet spending reporting  requirements because they lacked knowledge and expertise. Using a  centralized mechanism like FederalReporting.gov to capture recipient  reporting information was a new process that recipients and agencies had  to learn. We have previously reported on the questions raised by state  officials regarding the reporting capacities of some local organizations,  particularly small rural entities, boards, or commissions, and private  entities not used to doing business with the federal government. In  addition, some state officials said that the Recovery Act\u2019s requirement  that recipients report on the use of funds within 10 days after a quarter  ends was a challenge because some sub-recipients were unable to send  them the needed data on time.", "Officials at several agencies suggested that if FederalReporting.gov had  allowed certain key award and identifying data fields to be pre-populated  each quarter, it would have likely resulted in fewer data errors for  agencies to address and eased the reporting burden on recipients. In our  September 2013 report and testimony on federal data transparency, we  concluded that the transparency envisioned under the Recovery Act for  tracking spending was unprecedented for the federal government,  requiring the development of a system that could track billions of dollars  disbursed to thousands of recipients. Such a system needed to be  operational quickly to enable posting of spending information rapidly for a  variety of programs. However, because agency systems did not collect  spending data in a consistent manner, the most expedient approach for  Recovery Act reporting was to collect data directly from fund recipients.  Recipients had the additional burden of having to provide this information  and when the data had to be entered manually, it could impact the  accuracy of the data. Thus, in September 2013 we recommended that  the director of OMB, in collaboration with members of the Government  Accountability and Transparency Board, develop a plan to implement  comprehensive transparency reform, including a long-term timeline and  requirements for data standards, such as establishing a uniform award  identification system across the federal government.", "Earlier this year, the Recovery Board noted that agencies and OIGs also  experienced difficulties adapting to the more frequent reporting (every  quarter) and more detailed reporting (e.g., jobs created or individual  project activities) required of most government grant recipients. Agency officials acknowledged spending considerable staff hours training  recipients, providing technical assistance to them, verifying and validating  their data, and following up with them when issues arose. Despite efforts  to streamline and enhance existing review protocols, agencies still  needed skilled people to review and process applications for awards.  Although agencies and OIGs credited outreach to recipients for reducing  noncompliance with reporting requirements, the amount of staffing  resources it took to conduct that outreach was significant.", "Double reporting. We have previously noted that recipients of Recovery  Act funds were required to report similar information to both agency  reporting systems and FederalReporting.gov. Several federal agency  and state government officials we spoke with also mentioned that  reporting to FederalReporting.gov resulted in double reporting for their  agency and grantees as several of them deemed their existing internal  systems superior and therefore would end up reporting to both. For  example, at HUD, program offices were unable to abandon their  established reporting systems because the agency\u2019s systems collected  data necessary to support HUD\u2019s grants management and oversight  processes. HUD officials told us that requiring grantees to report using  two systems resulted in double reporting of data and proved burdensome  to recipients and to HUD staff who spent many hours correcting  inaccurate entries.", "At DOT, officials preferred using the agency\u2019s own data because it was  more detailed and was reported monthly\u2014more frequently than the  Recovery.gov data. In a focus group involving state transportation  officials, several echoed the redundancy of reporting systems. These  officials indicated that having to report to three systems\u2014the internal  state system, DOT\u2019s system, and FederalReporting.gov\u2014increased their  agencies\u2019 burden. As we reported in our previously mentioned September  2013 report and testimony on federal data transparency efforts, the lack  of consistent data and standards and commonality in how data elements  are defined places undue burden on federal fund recipients. This can  result in them having to report the same information multiple times via  disparate reporting platforms. procedures for reporting on the use of federal funds, it directed recipients  of covered funds to use a series of standardized data elements. Further,  rather than report to multiple government entities, each with its own  disparate reporting requirements, all recipients of Recovery Act funds  were required to centrally report into the Recovery Board\u2019s inbound  reporting website, FederalReporting.gov.", "GAO-13-871T and GAO-13-758. the geospatial reporting presentation format on the website. For example,  according to Recovery Board officials, the website only allowed one  location to be reported per project even though some projects spanned  multiple locations. Therefore, if a DOT highway project crossed multiple  ZIP codes, only one location of performance could be reported. Further,  certain locations were difficult to map such as rural roads, post office  boxes, county level data, and consultant contractors who worked out of  their homes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recipients Were Required to Report Outcome Measure of Jobs Created and Retained but Faced Some Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The other major performance measure required under the Recovery Act  focused on the estimate of the number of jobs created or number of jobs  retained as a result of funding provided by the act. In addition to the  previously described reporting on funds spent and activities, recipients  were required in their quarterly reports to estimate the number of jobs  created or retained by that project or activity. OMB issued clarifying  guidance for recipient reporting in June 2009 and recipients began  reporting on jobs starting in October 2009. Among other things, the  guidance clarified that recipients of Recovery Act funds were to report  only on jobs directly created or retained by Recovery Act-funded projects,  activities, and contracts. Recipients were not expected to report on the  employment impact on materials suppliers (\u201cindirect\u201d jobs) or on the local  community. Recipients had 10 days after the end of each calendar  quarter to report. OMB\u2019s guidance also provided additional instruction on  calculating the number of jobs created or retained by Recovery Act  funding on a full-time equivalent (FTE) basis.", "Recipients faced several challenges meeting these requirements. They  had difficulty accurately defining FTEs, as various recipients interpreted  and applied the FTE guidance from OMB differently. Further, many  recipients struggled to meet reporting deadlines as they had little time to  gather, analyze, and pass on information to the federal government at the  end of each fiscal quarter.", "Definitional challenges and discrepancies in reporting FTEs. Under  OMB guidance, jobs created or retained were to be expressed as FTEs.  In our November 2009 report we found that recipients reported data  inconsistently even though OMB and federal agencies provided  significant guidance and training. Specifically, we found that while FTE  calculations should allow for different types of jobs\u2014part time, full time or  temporary\u2014to be aggregated, differing interpretations of the FTE  guidance compromised the recipients\u2019 ability to aggregate the data. For  example, in California, two higher education systems calculated FTEs  differently. One chose to use a 2-month period as the basis for the FTE  performance period. The other chose to use a year as the basis. The  result was almost a three-to-one difference in the number of FTEs  reported for each university system in the first reporting period. Although  the Department of Education provided alternative methods for calculating  an FTE, in neither case did the guidance explicitly state the period of  performance of the FTE. We recommended that OMB clarify the definition  of FTE jobs and encourage federal agencies to provide or improve  program-specific guidance for recipients. Further, we recommended that  OMB be more explicit that jobs created or retained are to be reported as  hours worked and paid for by the Recovery Act. In general, OMB and  agencies acted upon our recipient reporting-related recommendations  and later reporting periods indicated significant improvements in FTE  calculations. OMB\u2019s guidance changed the original formula and  consequently, agencies had to rush to educate recipients about the  changes. Agencies spent extra time and resources that quarter reviewing  and validating recipient data to reduce errors. In some cases, agencies  communicated daily with recipients via phone or e-mail to ensure their  report submissions were accurate.", "Capacity of recipients to meet deadlines. The requirement to regularly  report on jobs created and retained further strained the capacity of some  recipients. Recipients only had 10 days after the end of each fiscal  quarter to determine this information and pass it on to the federal  government.reporting should have been extended by 1 to 2 weeks so they were not  rushing to input data. One of these officials said she was directed by  other state officials to put in \u201cthe best data you have, even if it\u2019s not  correct\u2026and go back and correct it later.\u201d City officials also reported  concerns with the quick turn-around time for reporting. For example, one  city official stated that, in order to meet reporting deadlines, it was  necessary had to enter data manually, which created additional work. The  Recovery Board accepted these post-correction actions as it extended  the quality assurance period to provide more time for agencies to review  reports and recipients to make corrections in FederalReporting.gov. As a  result, recipients could change their reports up to about 2 weeks before  the start of the next reporting period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Specific Performance Measures Varied by Program and Agency with Some Focusing More on Outputs than Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["The administration required agencies receiving Recovery Act funds to  submit performance plans that identified additional measures on a  program-by-program basis. Consistent with existing GPRA requirements  for agencies to set outcome-oriented performance goals and measures,  OMB\u2019s initial Recovery Act implementation guidance required federal  agencies to ensure that program goals were achieved. OMB required  agencies to measure specific program outcomes, supported by  corresponding quantifiable output measures, and improved results on  broader economic indicators. agencies typically resorted to existing measures in their grant programs\u2019  performance plans. This information is reported by agency and by  program within each agency, as opposed to government-wide.

These plans included information on each  Recovery Act program\u2019s objectives, activities, delivery schedule, accountability plan,  monitoring plan, and program performance measures.", "For example, Education\u2019s performance plan described the agency\u2019s  accountability mechanisms, the type and scope of project activities, and  specific program performance measures. With the exception of the  number of jobs created or retained, Education\u2019s plan stated the agency  was primarily using existing established agency performance measures  that applied to both Recovery and non-Recovery funds. For example to  measure the success of one type of education grant fund (specifically,  Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as  amended) which the Recovery Act made available to local educational  agencies, Education used existing agency performance measures, such  as the percentage of economically disadvantaged students in grades 3 to  8 scoring at the proficient or advanced levels on state reading and  mathematics assessments.", "On the other hand, DOT filled out the templates to report on its 12  programs, and its performance measures were generally less specific and  outcome oriented. For example, DOT\u2019s Capital Assistance for High Speed  Rail Corridors and Intercity Passenger Rail Service performance plan  metrics included whether interim guidance was published within time  frames, the number of applicants received for the program, and the  number of grants awarded for the program. Further, as we previously  reported, DOT released a series of performance plans in May 2009 to  measure the impact of Recovery Act transportation programs, but these  plans generally did not contain an extensive discussion of the specific  goals and measures to assess the impact of Recovery Act projects. For  example, while the plan for the highway program contained a section on  anticipated results, three of its five measures were the percent of funds  obligated and expended and the number of projects under construction.  The fourth measure was the percentage of vehicle miles traveled on  pavement on the National Highway System rated in good condition, but  the plan said that goals for improvement with Recovery Act funds were  yet to be determined. The fifth goal was number of miles of roadway  improved, and DOT\u2019s plan reported that even with the addition of  Recovery Act funds, the new target would remain the same as previously  planned. As a result, we recommended in May 2010 that DOT ensure that  the results of these projects were assessed and a determination made  about whether these investments produced long-term benefits.

The oversight community adopted a faster and more flexible  approach to how they conducted and reported on their audits and reviews  so that their findings could inform programs of needed corrections before  all Recovery funds were expended. They leveraged technology by using  advanced data analytics to reduce fraud and to create easily accessible  Internet resources that greatly improved the public\u2019s access to, and ability  to make use of, data about grants funded by the Recovery Act. These  and other experiences, as well as the challenges identified in this report,  provide potentially valuable lessons for the future.

Others, such as some of  the information sharing networks established during the Recovery Act,  have had more difficulty in doing so. Proposals under consideration by  Congress and the administration to extend Recovery Act requirements for  spending transparency to all federal grants suggest that this has been the  case for tracking dollars.
