Our review included analyzing the guidance relative to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-109 and our 1994 report addressing how leading organizations manage information technology investments. We then interviewed program and contractor officials and reviewed system development documentation and plans to determine whether actual SPAS development processes and practices were consistent with the guidance and whether these processes and practices were exposing the program to unnecessary risks. In particular, we focused on system requirements analysis and definition, verification and validation, cost estimating, system architecture alternatives analysis, and communications planning.", "We also interviewed SPAS users at four field locations that are currently operating the SPAS prototype to determine their involvement in defining SPAS requirements and their reaction to and satisfaction with the prototype. These four sites were the Flight Standards Division of the Western Pacific Region; the Van Nuys, California, FSDO; the San Jose, California, FSDO; and the Bedford, Massachusetts, FSDO. We also witnessed the operation of the prototype at these locations, and operated the prototype at the contractor\u2019s facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Instead, effective requirements definition demands a more iterative process in which requirements are continuously analyzed, validated, and refined through constant interaction with users.", "FAA\u2019s approach to analyzing and defining SPAS requirements has involved a series of steps to maximize user involvement and provide users with early \u201clooks\u201d at the system for evaluation and reaction, thereby better ensuring that the system will meet their needs. These steps first began in May 1991 when the SPAS Steering Committee distributed a questionnaire to 1,000 aviation safety inspectors to solicit their views on what type of automated tool would best serve their needs. The questionnaire contained a variety of questions, such as: How could an automated system help with your work? and What features would you like to see? On the basis of the 375 survey responses received and experience with the Air Force\u2019s airline safety analysis system, FAA and VNTSC generated an initial set of SPAS requirements.", "Next, FAA began validating and refining the requirements. First, FAA, in collaboration with VNTSC, held a series of group discussions and one-on-one visits with aircraft safety inspectors throughout the country. According to SPAS documentation, these discussions and visits allowed SPAS developers to see first-hand what the inspectors do on a daily basis and to listen to their ideas, thus giving the developers a keener understanding of the inspectors\u2019 needs and helping them to refine SPAS requirements accordingly.", "In October 1991 and December 1993, two expert panels consisting of dozens of experienced aviation safety inspectors and members of the SPAS management team were established to determine whether users\u2019 needs were adequately being captured. These panels were charged with developing and recommending SPAS safety indicators and revalidating SPAS functional requirements.", "To further validate SPAS requirements, FAA\u2019s next step was to implement the SPAS Steering Committee\u2019s recommendation to build a prototype system for users. System prototyping is an effective method of defining and refining user requirements. By quickly providing users with a system model (that is, something less than the full complement of envisioned system features and functions) with which to interact and react, prototyping allows needed adjustments to be made before making large investments in developing the final system. In our 1994 report on how leading organizations improved mission performance through strategic information management and technology, we noted that these organizations make effective use of rapid prototyping to minimize system risks and maximize benefits.", "The SPAS prototype evaluation focused on the effectiveness and ease of use of the user interface, the adequacy of source systems\u2019 data quality, and the impact of SPAS on inspectors\u2019 daily activities.

No systematic software cost estimating tool or technique, such as COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model), REVIC (Revised Intermediate COCOMO), or SLIM (Software Life Cycle Intermediate Model), was used. Further, the program has no documented analysis to support the software cost estimate, and it has not attempted to update it.

In commenting on a draft of this report, the Director of the Office of Flight Standards agreed that such a strategy is needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The axiom \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d applies to SPAS. This system will not be effective if the quality of its source data is not improved. Moreover, it could potentially misdirect FAA resources away from the higher risk aviation activities. While FAA has some initiatives underway to improve some of these data, the initiatives are isolated, incomplete, and provide little assurance that SPAS will receive the quality data it needs to be useful. Unless FAA acts quickly on this matter, SPAS will not be able to perform as intended when it is deployed in 1997. FAA must expeditiously develop a comprehensive and coordinated strategy for defining and attaining defined data quality improvement goals within specified time frames for all SPAS source databases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the FAA Administrator direct the Associate Administrator for Regulation and Certification to require the Office of Flight Standards to develop and implement a comprehensive and coordinated strategy, specifying how the quality of all data residing on SPAS source data systems will be brought up to the minimum level needed for SPAS to meet operational requirements. At a minimum, this strategy must include (1) clear and measurable data quality objectives for each SPAS source data system that recognize the sensitivity of SPAS\u2019 various analyses to the respective source data inputs, (2) accurate assessments of the current quality of the data on each SPAS source data system, (3) clear statements of organizational responsibility and authority for improving the source systems\u2019 data quality, (4) both interim and long-term milestones for attaining stated quality objectives that tie closely to SPAS development schedules, and (5) estimates of resource requirements to meet stated objectives and agency commitments to providing these resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, FAA officials agreed with our recommendation to develop and implement a comprehensive and coordinated strategy for improving the quality of the data residing on SPAS source databases. However, they do not believe that the data quality problem is as severe as our report describes it to be. They stated that the quality of the data has measurably improved over the last several years. To support their position, they cited various steps taken to strengthen the completeness, correctness, currency, and consistency of the databases. For example, they said that data entry edit checks have been introduced and that inspectors are now more conscious of the consistency of the data they enter. However, they could not provide any data, analysis, or otherwise verifiable evidence supporting their claims. While we acknowledge that the steps cited should produce some quality gains, without evidence of actual improvements we believe that the quality of the data on which SPAS will rely remains a significant problem. As stated in our report, FAA and Department of Transportation analyses as recent as 1993 and 1994 continue to report severe aviation safety related data limitations."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
