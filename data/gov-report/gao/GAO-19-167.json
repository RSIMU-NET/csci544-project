One key limitation of the estimates is that FNS has not evaluated the accuracy of its assumption about the percentage of SNAP benefits trafficked. FNS assumes that, among stores that trafficked, 90 percent of the benefits redeemed in small stores, and 40 percent in large stores, were trafficked. A former FNS official stated that this assumption is based on discussions with investigators in the 1990s when FNS first developed its approach to estimate trafficking, and that they have not since evaluated it for accuracy. However, there are options available for evaluating this assumption, such as reviewing SNAP transaction data from stores that are known to have trafficked. Statistical standards for federal agencies indicate that assumptions should be reviewed for accuracy and validated using available, independent information sources. By not evaluating this key assumption, FNS's commonly cited estimates of SNAP fraud are potentially inaccurate.", "FNS has generally taken steps to address retailer trafficking that align with leading fraud risk management practices, but the agency has not pursued additional actions to prevent and respond to trafficking.

During reauthorization, FNS reviews previously approved stores for continued compliance with program requirements.

FNS officials planned to reauthorize a sample of high-risk stores each year, but said they did not follow through with those plans. Officials also stated that they did not document an analysis of the benefits and costs of this practice, which would be consistent with leading fraud risk management practices.

For example, a retailer might charge  $100 to a recipient\u2019s SNAP EBT card and give the recipient $50 in cash  instead of $100 in food. The federal government reimburses the retailer  $100, which results in a fraudulent $50 profit to the retailer. While this  type of trafficking is a direct exchange of SNAP benefits for money,  trafficking also can be done indirectly. For example, a retailer might give a  recipient $50 in cash for the use of $100 in benefits on that recipient\u2019s  EBT card. The retailer could then use the EBT card to purchase $100 in  products at another SNAP retailer (see fig. 2).

Throughout  each report, FNS presents its estimates as precise numbers. However,  uncertainty is introduced when extrapolating from a smaller sample\u2014in  this case, an investigative sample that solely includes stores known to  have trafficked or suspected of trafficking\u2014to the full population of SNAP- authorized stores because the extent to which the sample reflects the  broader population of stores is unknown (see sidebar).

While FNS discusses some  limitations of its trafficking estimates in the body of each report, only the  report\u2019s appendices include information that can be used to assess the  level of uncertainty around the estimates.", "Using information contained in these appendices, we found widely  varying trafficking estimates. For example, although FNS reported that  approximately $1 billion in SNAP benefits were trafficked annually from  2012 through 2014, information in the report\u2019s appendices indicates that  the amount trafficked could have ranged from about $960 million to $4.7  billion.

According to an FNS official, FNS would like the reports to  continue to provide non-technical information that is comparable to prior  years. However, as shown in the figure above, it is possible to compare  estimates over time when estimates are presented with ranges. Further,  reporting the level of uncertainty with each estimate increases  transparency. According to a recent Congressional Research Service  report, these estimates are the most-often cited measure of fraud in  SNAP.

By not clearly reporting the level of uncertainty around  these commonly cited estimates of SNAP retailer trafficking, FNS\u2019s  reports are potentially providing misleading information to Congress and  the public regarding the extent of fraud in SNAP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FNS Evaluated Ways to Address Some Limitations in the Trafficking Estimates, but Does Not Plan to Take Further Steps", "paragraphs": ["FNS has acknowledged limitations with its current approach to estimating  retailer trafficking and evaluated ways to address some of those  limitations. As previously noted, FNS selects a non-random sample of  stores known to have trafficked or suspected of trafficking when  calculating its estimates, which may introduce bias into those trafficking  estimates (see sidebar). For example, the sample could overestimate the  extent of retailer trafficking if the stores in the sample that are targeted for  investigation are more likely to traffic. Conversely, if FNS\u2019s detection  methods do not capture all instances of trafficking\u2014such as retailers who  only traffic with people they know\u2014the sample could lead to an  underestimate of trafficking among all SNAP-authorized stores.  Recognizing that the trafficking estimates provide important information  on program fraud, FNS evaluated ways to address limitations in the  estimates. In 2013, FNS convened a technical working group of experts  to discuss alternate ways to estimate retailer trafficking. That group made  various recommendations to improve the estimates, some of which FNS  pursued through additional analyses.", "For example, to address limitations introduced by the sample FNS uses  to estimate trafficking, the agency conducted a study to assess the  feasibility of calculating its estimates using a national random sample of  stores. However, FNS determined it would be infeasible to use a  random sample because of the costs and resources that would be  involved. According to FNS officials, it cost the agency approximately  $67,000 to produce the September 2017 trafficking estimates report. By  comparison, FNS estimated that using a national random sample could  cost between $11.5 million and $38 million, depending on the specific  sample selection method. This is because, among other factors, taking  this approach would require investigative staff to visit stores suspected of  trafficking as well as those that are not suspected of trafficking. Doing so  would require a significant number of additional investigators, according  to the feasibility study.", "Also in response to a recommendation by the technical working group,  FNS contracted for a study in November 2017 that reviewed the five  factors the agency uses to make adjustments to reduce the bias in its  sample of stores (see sidebar). FNS began using these five factors\u2014such  as the type of store\u2014more than 20 years ago when it initially developed  its approach to estimating trafficking. The study evaluated the continued  relevance of the five factors, as well as the relevance of additional factors  related to store characteristics and neighborhood demographics. The  study did not make recommendations, and the expert who conducted the  study told us that based on the analysis, the original five factors remain  relevant. As a result, FNS officials stated the agency would continue to  use these factors to reduce bias in the sample.", "However, FNS has not evaluated whether factors the agency currently  uses to identify stores for possible investigation could help reduce bias in  the sample and improve the trafficking estimates. Specifically, FNS  analyzes data on SNAP transactions and looks for suspicious patterns or  other indications of potential trafficking. Based on the results of these  analyses, FNS assigns a numeric score to each store, and stores with  scores above a certain threshold are added to FNS\u2019s Watch List for  further review. Several experts have suggested to FNS that including  this score or other related factors when adjusting the investigative sample  could help reduce the bias in the sample and improve the trafficking  estimates, yet FNS has not evaluated the use of these factors for this  purpose. FNS officials said that stores\u2019 numeric scores and the factors  related to the Watch List are not public information, and the agency\u2019s  preference is to be transparent about the methodology used to produce  the trafficking estimates. However, FNS already describes its Watch List  and the use of a numeric score threshold in an appendix to its trafficking  reports. According to OMB\u2019s statistical standards, federal agencies should  take steps to maximize the objectivity of the statistical information they  produce. Objectivity refers to whether the information is accurate, reliable,  and unbiased. Without evaluating the usefulness of the Watch List  factors for adjusting the sample, FNS may miss an opportunity to reduce  the bias in the sample and improve the accuracy of its trafficking  estimates.", "In addition, FNS has not evaluated the accuracy of its assumption of the  percentage of SNAP benefits trafficked by different types of stores, which  FNS developed over 20 years ago from anecdotal information. Among  stores that engaged in trafficking, FNS assumes that 90 percent of  benefits redeemed in small stores and 40 percent of benefits redeemed in  large stores were trafficked (see sidebar). A former FNS official who  helped develop the agency\u2019s approach for estimating trafficking stated  that the assumption was based on conversations with investigators in the  1990s\u2014deemed to be the best source of information at the time. He  noted that the investigators who were consulted generally disagreed on  the percentage of benefits that were trafficked, as the actual percentage  could vary widely based on whether, for example, one employee had  trafficked or the entire store was a front for trafficking. However, the  investigators generally agreed that 90 percent and 40 percent would  overestimate trafficking by retailers in small and large stores, respectively.  According to FNS officials, in the absence of other data, they preferred to  use an overestimate, rather than an underestimate, of the percentage of  benefits trafficked in stores found to have trafficked.", "Despite an increase in the availability of data on retailer trafficking over  the last 20 years, FNS officials have not evaluated the accuracy of this  key assumption and said that they have no plans to do so. FNS officials  noted that they do not believe there are available data that indicate  whether the assumption is accurate and, as such, any evaluation would  require new data collection. However, according to contractors and a  former official we spoke with who had studied the methodology as well as  USDA OIG officials, data are currently available that may help FNS  evaluate the accuracy of this assumption. For example, they suggested  FNS could analyze the transaction data of stores that trafficked to identify  the percentage of all redeemed SNAP benefits that were consistent with  known indicators of trafficking. Currently, OIG officials told us that they  use a similar approach to calculate the amount of benefits trafficked for a  store whose owner is being prosecuted. According to OMB\u2019s statistical  standards, assumptions should be reviewed for accuracy and validated  using available, independent information sources. Without FNS  evaluating its key assumption of the percentage of SNAP benefits  trafficked, the estimates it reports on the extent of program fraud are  potentially inaccurate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FNS Has Taken Some Steps That Generally Align with Leading Practices to Prevent, Detect, and Respond to Retailer Trafficking, but Has Not Pursued Others", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FNS Has Taken Steps to Address Retailer Trafficking, but Has Not Pursued Certain Prevention and Response Activities", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Preventing Trafficking in the Retailer Authorization Process", "paragraphs": ["FNS has taken some steps to prevent retailer trafficking that align with  leading fraud risk management practices and our prior recommendations,  but has not pursued some opportunities for early oversight. As we note  in our Fraud Risk Framework, while fraud control activities can be  interdependent and mutually reinforcing, preventative activities generally  offer the most cost-effective investment of resources. FNS officials told us  that the agency tries to prevent trafficking through its policies and  procedures for authorizing stores to participate in SNAP. Since our 2006  report, FNS has taken some steps to amend retailer authorization  policies to address vulnerabilities that we identified. For example:  Increasing requirements for food that retailers must stock to  participate in SNAP: In 2006, we found that FNS had minimal  requirements for the amount of food that retailers must stock, which  could allow retailers more likely to traffic into the program. At that  time, FNS officials said that they authorized stores with limited food  stock to provide access to food in low-income areas where large  grocery stores were scarce. In 2006, retailers were generally required  to stock a minimum of 12 food items (at least 3 varieties in each of 4  staple food categories), but FNS rules did not specify how many items  of each variety would constitute sufficient stock. We recommended  that FNS develop criteria to help identify the stores most likely to  traffic, using information such as the presence of low food stock. In  2016, FNS promulgated a final rule increasing food stock  requirements and, in January 2018, issued a policy memorandum to  clarify these requirements. FNS officials told us that the new  requirements are designed to encourage stores to provide more  healthy food options for recipients and discourage trafficking.  According to the memorandum, retailers are now generally required to  stock at least 36 food items (including stocking at least 3 varieties in  each of 4 staple food categories, and 3 items of each variety). See  figure 6 for a comparison of the previous (as of 2006) and current  (reflecting the January 2018 memorandum) requirements.", "Assessing retailer risk levels: Also in 2006, we found that FNS had  not conducted analyses to identify characteristics of stores at high risk  of trafficking and to target its resources accordingly. For example, we  reported that some stores may be at risk of trafficking because one or  more previous owners had been found to be trafficking at the same  location. At that time, FNS did not have a system in place to ensure  that these stores were quickly targeted for heightened attention. We  recommended that FNS identify the stores most likely to traffic and  provide earlier, more targeted oversight to those stores. In 2009,  FNS established risk levels for stores: high, medium, and low. For  example, high-risk stores are those with a prior permanent  disqualification at that location or nearby. In January 2012, FNS  revised its policy for authorizing high-risk stores. The policy requires  high-risk retailers to provide specific documentation to ensure that the  owners listed on the application have not been previously disqualified  or do not have ties to a previously disqualified owner, such as a letter  from the bank listing the authorized signers on the store\u2019s accounts.", "Although FNS took these steps to identify risk levels for stores and target  its initial authorization activities accordingly, the agency is not currently  using this information to target its reauthorization activities to stores of  greatest risk. During reauthorization, FNS reviews previously approved stores for continued compliance with program requirements. Although the  agency\u2019s policy and website both state that certain high-risk stores will be  reauthorized annually, FNS is currently reauthorizing all stores on the  same 5-year cycle, regardless of risk. FNS reauthorized most high-risk  stores under this policy one time in fiscal year 2013, but officials told us  that they then discontinued annual reauthorizations after an in-depth  assessment of the benefits and costs of this practice. For example, FNS  staff reported collecting more than 150,000 documents as part of the  fiscal year 2013 reauthorization cycle and found that collecting these  documents annually is ineffective and burdensome to FNS and the  retailer.", "FNS instead decided to annually reauthorize a sample of high-risk  retailers as a result of its assessment of the fiscal year 2013 cycle, but did  not follow through with those plans. Specifically, the agency decided to  pursue annual reauthorizations of a sample of stores at the greatest risk  of program violations\u2014those at the same address as a store that had  been previously permanently disqualified. However, FNS officials did not  have documentation that the approach was ever implemented or that they  assessed the benefits and costs of reauthorizing this sample of high-risk  retailers. More frequent reauthorization of certain high-risk stores is  consistent with federal internal control standards, which suggest that  agencies should consider the potential for fraud when determining how to  respond to fraud risks. Considering the benefits and costs of control  activities to address identified risks is a leading practice in GAO\u2019s Fraud  Risk Framework. By not assessing the benefits and costs of reauthorizing  certain high-risk stores more frequently than other stores, FNS may be  missing an opportunity to provide early oversight of risky stores and  prevent trafficking."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Detecting Retailer Trafficking", "paragraphs": ["The steps FNS has taken to improve how it detects retailer trafficking  generally align with fraud risk management leading practices for  designing and implementing control activities to detect fraud. For  example, FNS\u2019s website shows how to report SNAP fraud, including  retailer trafficking, through the USDA OIG\u2019s fraud hotline. According to  our Fraud Risk Framework, reporting mechanisms help managers detect  instances of potential fraud and can also deter individuals from engaging  in fraudulent behavior if they believe the fraud will be discovered and  reported. Increasing managers\u2019 and employees\u2019 awareness of potential  fraud schemes can also help managers and employees better detect  potential fraud. To that end, FNS has developed fraud awareness training  for staff in each of the branches in its Retailer Operations Division\u2014the  office primarily responsible for oversight of SNAP-authorized retailers.  This includes training related to retailer trafficking for new staff and  refresher training for experienced staff. Some of the training materials  employ identified instances of trafficking to improve future detection and  response activities. See figure 7 for photographs from a store  investigation that were featured in an April 2017 training session.", "FNS also uses data analytics, another leading practice in our Fraud Risk  Framework, to identify potential trafficking and prioritizes its investigative  resources to the stores most likely to be trafficking. Specifically, FNS  scans about 250 million SNAP transactions per month through its Anti- Fraud Locator using EBT Retailer Transactions (ALERT) system to  identify certain patterns indicative of trafficking. ALERT assigns a numeric  score to each store based on the likelihood of trafficking. Stores with  scores above a certain threshold are added to FNS\u2019s Watch List, and  FNS analysts and investigators prioritize the stores on this list for review  based on factors such as average transaction amounts that are excessive  for that type of store. In addition, FNS\u2019s analysts conduct their own data  mining and review complaints and fraud tips from the OIG\u2019s hotline to add  stores to the Watch List.", "FNS also has explored ways and taken steps to improve its data analytics  through internal workgroups and external studies. Using the results of  monitoring and evaluations to improve fraud risk management activities is  a leading fraud risk management practice. For example, staff in the  Retailer Operations Division participate in a workgroup that uses findings  from FNS\u2019s trafficking investigations to improve the Division\u2019s detection  efforts. This collaborative effort has led to improvements such as using  store ZIP codes to compare transactions at stores suspected of trafficking  with similar stores nearby. According to FNS, its staff can use this  information to substantiate charges against retailers by establishing what  typical transaction patterns look like, compared to trafficking patterns, for  similar stores. In addition, FNS commissioned studies in fiscal years 2014  and 2015 to evaluate the effectiveness of its data analytics to monitor  stores and identify areas for improvement. For example, one of the  studies identified and recommended new ways that FNS could analyze  SNAP transaction data to detect emerging trafficking schemes\u2014such as  indirect trafficking at super stores and supermarkets, where more than 80  percent of SNAP benefits are redeemed. FNS officials reported in August  2018 that they examined the recommendations and implemented those  they determined were feasible with current resources and would add  value to their efforts. For example, they decided to analyze data over  shorter periods of time (monthly instead of a 6-month period) to more  quickly identify stores that may be trafficking. Officials also reported that  they are continuing to assess the effectiveness of their data analytics."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Responding to Retailer Trafficking", "paragraphs": ["FNS\u2019s efforts to respond to retailer trafficking generally align with leading  practices for fraud risk management. Consistent with our Fraud Risk  Framework, FNS has established collaborative relationships with external  stakeholders to respond to identified instances of potential fraud. For  example, to amplify its own efforts, FNS has agreements (known as state  law enforcement bureau, or SLEB, agreements) with 28 states. Through  these agreements, FNS allows state and local law enforcement agencies  to use SNAP EBT cards in their own undercover investigations of  retailers. According to the most recent available FNS data, participating  states opened 1,955 cases from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2018  under SLEB agreements. These cases resulted in a total of 139 retailers  being permanently disqualified from the program.", "Within USDA, FNS and the OIG also said they recently updated a  memorandum of understanding (MOU) that outlines, among other things,  how the two entities will coordinate on retailer trafficking investigations.  Under the MOU, FNS investigates retailers with average monthly SNAP  redemptions below a certain dollar threshold without first obtaining  clearance from the OIG to pursue the case. FNS and OIG officials said  that this provision of the MOU allows FNS to more quickly investigate  suspicious behavior and pursue administrative action, such as permanent  disqualification, against retailers found to be trafficking. Previously,  according to OIG officials, FNS needed to clear most cases against  retailers suspected of trafficking through the OIG. As we noted in our  2006 report, due to the time it takes to develop an investigation for  prosecution and the costs associated with doing so, a natural tension  exists between the goal of disqualifying a retailer as quickly as possible to  prevent further trafficking and seeking prosecution of the retailer to  recover losses and deter other traffickers. The MOU is also designed to  strengthen collaboration between FNS and the OIG in identifying the  situations that warrant criminal investigations.", "Since our 2006 report, OIG and FNS both generally increased the  number of actions taken against SNAP retailers found to be trafficking.  Specifically, the OIG reported an increase in the number of trafficking  cases that it successfully referred for federal, state, or local prosecution  (see fig. 8). The OIG also reported increases in the number of convictions  resulting from its investigations, from 79 in fiscal year 2007 to 311 in fiscal  year 2017.", "FNS also generally increased the number of retailers sanctioned for  trafficking, though few received a monetary penalty. From fiscal year  2007 to fiscal year 2017, the number of permanent disqualifications  resulting from FNS\u2019s trafficking investigations nearly doubled (see fig.  9). In lieu of a permanent disqualification, FNS sometimes imposes a  monetary penalty on a retailer found to be trafficking. However, FNS  imposed few monetary penalties for trafficking in lieu of permanent  disqualification during this period. From fiscal year 2007 to fiscal year  2017, FNS assessed a total of 40 such penalties, totaling $1.5 million (for  an average of about $38,000 each).", "In our 2006 report, we found that FNS\u2019s penalties for retailer trafficking  may be insufficient to deter traffickers. We noted that trafficking will  continue to be lucrative for retailers as long as the potential rewards  outweigh the penalties and recipients are willing to exchange their  benefits for cash. We recommended that FNS develop a strategy to  increase penalties for trafficking. Using the results of evaluations, such  as audits, to improve fraud risk management activities is a leading  practice in GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework. The Food, Conservation, and  Energy Act of 2008 (known as the 2008 Farm Bill) gave USDA authority  to impose higher monetary penalties, as well as authority to impose both  a monetary penalty and program disqualification on retailers found to  have violated relevant law or regulations (such as those found to be  trafficking).", "Although USDA was granted this authority a decade ago, the department  has not finalized regulatory changes to strengthen penalties against  retailers found to be trafficking. In August 2012, FNS proposed regulatory  changes to implement this authority from the 2008 Farm Bill, including  assessing a new trafficking penalty in addition to permanent  disqualification. The penalty would have been based on the store\u2019s  average monthly SNAP redemptions and was intended to recoup  government funds diverted from their intended use. In proposing these  changes, FNS stated that they were necessary to improve program  integrity and deter retailers from committing program violations. FNS also  estimated that it would assess an additional $174 million per year in these  new trafficking penalties\u2014a significant increase from the amounts FNS  currently assesses in penalties for trafficking (less than $100,000 in fiscal  year 2017). However, FNS did not finalize this rule, and, as of spring  2018, the rule was considered \u201cinactive.\u201d At that time, FNS officials told  us that they had not finalized the rule because other rulemaking had  taken priority in the intervening 6 years. More recently, in August 2018,  FNS officials told us that they plan to revise the previously proposed rule  to increase penalties and submit it for the spring 2019 regulatory  agenda. In November 2018, FNS officials indicated that they were  beginning to draft the proposed rule but could not provide us with  documentation of this effort because the regulatory action was still  pending. Increasing penalties for retailer trafficking would serve as an  important tool to deter trafficking and safeguard federal funds."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FNS Has Not Established Performance Measures to Assess its Retailer Trafficking Prevention Activities", "paragraphs": ["FNS measures the effectiveness of many of its trafficking detection and  response activities, but lacks measures to evaluate its prevention  activities. Measuring outputs, outcomes, and progress toward the  achievement of fraud risk objectives is a leading practice in our Fraud  Risk Framework. At the agency level, FNS has a priority plan for fiscal  year 2018 that includes a goal of reducing the SNAP trafficking rate  through retailer- and client-focused activities.", "At the program level, FNS\u2019s Retailer Operations Division has an internal  scorecard that tracks performance measures related to retailer oversight  activities, but none of these focuses on prevention of trafficking. For  example, the scorecard measures the outputs and outcomes of activities  designed to detect and respond to trafficking, such as the total number of  sanctions implemented against retailers and the percentage of  undercover investigations that result in a permanent disqualification.  However, the scorecard does not have any measures related to  preventing trafficking through the retailer authorization process\u2014a key  area for prevention activities. The scorecard includes one output measure  related to this process, but the measure (the percentage of retailer  authorization requests processed within 45 days) focuses on how quickly  retailers gain access to the program, rather than preventing trafficking.  Although FNS officials have acknowledged that their program compliance  efforts begin with the retailer authorization process, they said that they  had not considered establishing measures related to preventing  trafficking. They added that their supervisory review process may help  ensure that staff who process retailer applications in the Retailer  Operations Branch do not overlook evidence of potential fraud, but this  review includes a small sample of approved store applications (typically 5  cases per staff member monthly).", "Although FNS has not established measures to assess its trafficking  prevention activities, the agency has data that it could leverage for this  purpose. For example, FNS collects data on the number of applications  that were denied because FNS found that the retailer lacked business  integrity, such as applicants previously found to be trafficking or with ties  to a prior owner who had trafficked. Such data could be used to develop  measures related to the number and percentage of retailer applications  denied for business integrity. FNS officials acknowledged that these data  could be used to develop performance measures for its trafficking  prevention activities. Establishing such measures would enable FNS to  more fully assess the effectiveness of its retailer oversight activities and  better balance retailer access to the program with preventing retailer  fraud."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["FNS must continue to balance its goal of program integrity with its  mission to provide nutrition assistance to millions of low-income  households. During a period in which SNAP retailer participation has  markedly increased, FNS has made progress in addressing SNAP retailer  trafficking by identifying high-risk stores and increasing the number of  stores disqualified for trafficking. It is critical that FNS maintain progress  and momentum in these areas, particularly since FNS\u2019s own data suggest  that trafficking is on the rise.", "To its credit, FNS has already evaluated some ways to improve how the  agency measures and addresses retailer trafficking, yet, at the same  time, the agency has missed opportunities to strengthen these areas. For  example, since FNS has not taken steps to clarify and improve its retailer  trafficking estimates\u2014one of the only available SNAP fraud measures\u2014 questions remain regarding the accuracy of the estimates and the extent  of fraud in SNAP. In addition, prevention and early detection of retailer  trafficking are particularly important and deserve continued attention,  especially since retailers can quickly ramp up the amount they redeem in  federal SNAP benefits, potentially by trafficking. However, because FNS  is reauthorizing all stores once every 5 years, the agency may be missing  an opportunity to prevent trafficking through more frequent oversight of  risky stores. Further, until FNS strengthens its response to trafficking by  increasing penalties, the agency will continue to miss an opportunity to  improve program integrity and deter retailers from committing program  violations.", "Finally, FNS directs a significant amount of staff resources to authorizing  and monitoring retailers who participate in SNAP. Ensuring that those  staff understand the importance of addressing fraud is key for program  integrity. FNS has taken steps to make that clear through the inclusion of  relevant performance measures for the branches responsible for fraud  detection and response, yet the agency has not developed such  measures for its trafficking prevention activities. Until FNS establishes  performance measures for these activities, it will be unable to fully assess  the effectiveness of its overall efforts to address retailer trafficking.

Low-, medium-, and high-risk stores are  continually scanned by FNS\u2019s ALERT system. FNS officials added that, in  fiscal year 2017, FNS imposed sanctions (e.g., fines or temporary  disqualifications) on 862 stores found to be violating program rules, and  disqualified permanently 1,661 stores for trafficking SNAP benefits or  falsifying an application. FNS officials noted that this is a 26 percent  increase in the number of stores sanctioned, compared to fiscal year  2013. We agree that ongoing monitoring is important, and we discussed  these and other FNS efforts to detect and respond to retailer trafficking in  our report.
