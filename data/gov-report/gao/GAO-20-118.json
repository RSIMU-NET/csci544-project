While DEA's current data systems are not designed to conduct real-time analysis, and it conducts some analyses of industry-reported data, such as in response to requests from its field division offices, DEA could conduct more analyses using automated computer algorithms to help identify questionable patterns in the data. For example, DEA could analyze data to identify unusual volumes of deleted transactions or unusual volumes of drugs that were disposed of rather than sold. It could also analyze data to identify trends in distribution or drug purchases in a given geographic area. Other analysis DEA could perform is to look for unusual patterns when comparing drug orders in one geographic area with other nearby areas. These analyses could potentially help DEA proactively identify suspicious activities or registrants that may warrant investigation.", "No data governance structure to manage all drug transaction data. Although DEA has guidance, policies and procedures for the use of some information systems, it has not established a formal data governance structure to manage all data it collects and maintains, which are integral to its diversion control activities. A data governance structure is defined as an institutionalized set of policies and procedures for providing data governance throughout the life cycle of developing and implementing data standards. Industry and technology councils, domestic and international standards-setting organizations, and federal entities endorse the use of a governance structure to oversee the development, management, and implementation of data standards, digital content, and other data assets.

For  example, DEA does not have any documentation on their process for  ensuring the quality of data registrants submit to its ARCOS database\u2014 the main system that enables DEA to monitor the flow of controlled  substances. As a result, it is difficult to understand the controls they have  over this important data.", "A data governance structure is defined as an institutionalized set of  policies and procedures for providing data governance throughout the life  cycle of developing and implementing data standards.  A data  governance structure also helps to ensure important data assets are  formally managed and fully utilized, and can also provide consistent data  management. We previously reported on key practices based on several  data governance models, including developing and approving data  standards, managing, controlling, monitoring, and enforcing consistent  application of data standards, and delineating roles and responsibilities  for decision making and accountability.  Additionally, in June 2019, the  Office of Management and Budget established a Federal Data Strategy  (Strategy) as a framework of operational principles and practices to help  agencies use and manage data.", "We found several areas where DEA\u2019s current practices do not reflect  select leading data governance practices.", "Agencies should identify data needs to answer key agency  questions: We found that DEA does not have a governance structure  to determine and prioritize its data requirements for either suspicious  order reports it receives or data reported into its ARCOS systems. For  example, DEA has not established standard requirements for the  information required in a suspicious order report. As a result,  distributors\u2019 suspicious order reports vary and may contain  inconsistent and insufficient data for DEA to make investigative  decisions. In addition, DEA does not have a governance structure to  identify agency and industry stakeholder data needs to help inform its  opioid diversion control efforts.", "Agencies should provide resources explicitly to leverage data  assets: Agencies should ensure that sufficient human and financial  resources are available to support data driven agency decision- making, and accountability. As mentioned earlier, while DEA created  the new Targeting and Special Projects Section in March 2019 to  enhance DEA\u2019s data analytics, as of October 2019, DEA officials did  not have details or documentation about the data analysis efforts the  new division plans to undertake or the resources they plan to provide  for those efforts.

Similarly, leading practices for data governance includes delineating  roles and responsibilities for decision-making and accountability,  including roles and responsibilities for stakeholder input on key  decisions. As mentioned earlier, DEA established the Targeting and  Special Projects Section in March 2019 whose goal is to focus on  leveraging DEA\u2019s data capabilities and conducting data analytics on  ARCOS and other data, according to Diversion Control Division  officials. While the new section appears to hold promise, DEA has not  clearly defined and adopted the new section\u2019s roles and  responsibilities for managing and analyzing data across the DEA or  how the new section will communicate and collaborate with other  Diversion Control Division headquarters and field staff.

The data in the ARCOS database is historical, rather than real- time, on orders that have been filled. Every registered manufacturer is  required, at such time or times and in such form as required by the  Attorney General, to make periodic reports to the Attorney General of  every sale, delivery or other disposal of any controlled substance. Each  distributor is required to make such reports with respect to narcotic  controlled substances. For example, as part of the reporting to ARCOS,  acquisition and distribution transaction reports are required, by regulation,  to be filed every quarter, except that a registrant may be given permission  to file more frequently, but not more frequently than monthly, depending  on the number of transactions being reported each time by that  registrant. In addition, manufacturing transaction reports are required to  be filed annually, except that a registrant may be given permission to file  more frequently, but not more frequently than quarterly.", "CSOS. DEA does not require registrants to use CSOS and thus it is not  used by all registrants.

Suspicious order reports are intended to  identify orders of unusual size, orders deviating substantially from a  normal pattern, and orders of unusual frequency before they are filled. By  law, each registrant is required to design and operate a system to identify  suspicious orders that it receives. Registrants identify, then report, to  DEA using their own systems to determine suspicious orders. As discussed previously in this report, registrants can report these orders  into DEA\u2019s newly launched SORS Online database, but reporting into this  database is voluntary and registrants have an option to report in other  ways, so this database does not capture all suspicious orders and is  therefore not comprehensive. Suspicious orders are likely identified in  close to a \u201creal-time\u201d basis. Orders that have been identified and reported  as suspicious by the registrants, are orders that have not yet been filled.", "While two individual drug distribution companies we interviewed said they  saw some value in real-time reporting, most industry stakeholders we  spoke with on the usefulness of real-time data, including a broad cross- section of associations representing pharmacies and drug distribution  companies, said that real time dissemination of suspicious orders by DEA  would not add extensive value to efforts to detect possible diversion.  Instead, some industry stakeholders suggested that a focus on data that  provide trends over time might be more useful. As discussed earlier in  this report, we provide examples of data analysis DEA currently performs  and could perform on its existing data that could potentially help DEA  determine or identify possible patterns of aberrant behavior in drug order  information. Others we spoke with raised concerns about the varying  ways companies determine what is suspicious and that using real-time  data reported from DEA on these orders could be like comparing apples  to oranges.", "Most of the associations that represent pharmacies and drug distributors  that we met with indicated they did not see much value in either reporting,  or receiving reports, of suspicious orders in \u201creal-time.\u201d For example, a  representative from an association representing pharmacists told us that  rarely would there be a case where a single order was so egregious that  stopping it would have a significant impact on public health. This  representative also noted that it would be more important to focus on  historical trends, given \u201ctrends don\u2019t happen in a day.\u201d", "Other stakeholders we spoke with said that while there may be utility in  real-time reporting of suspicious orders, they also had concerns about its  feasibility, given current available data.

For example,", "Officials from an association that represents a large number of drug  distributors indicated that receiving more real-time data might allow  their members to have an additional check on orders that a wholesale  distributor receives, but this utility would largely be contingent on the  distributors\u2019 ability to compare suspicious order reports across one  another. Distributors use different criteria for determining whether an  order is suspicious; there is no continuity across them; and they  experience varying order volumes and patterns across their  customers and over time as patient needs change. Thus, such  analyses would be difficult to conduct, if they could be done at all, and  would not necessarily result in useful comparisons.", "A representative from one drug distribution company told us that  having knowledge of other distribution companies\u2019 suspicious orders  is not helpful because the company would not know how the other  distributor made a determination on the suspicious order.", "Another representative stated that distributors are operating  proprietary systems that may or may not vary substantially from each  other depending on a large number of varying circumstances, and  may be operating \u201cwildly different\u201d systems for identifying suspicious  orders and therefore the information would not be valuable.", "Representatives from two drug distribution companies identified  additional challenges to real-time reporting of suspicious orders if the  determination of whether an order was suspicious or not was made by  DEA. First, they did not believe DEA had sufficient resources or  knowledge to identify suspicious orders. One representative said DEA  does not know the history and market dynamics in the pharmaceutical  industry to help inform decisions it would need to make on an order.  Second, identifying an order as suspicious before it is filled would add  a tremendous burden on DEA. According to one of the  representatives, their company typically ships orders on the same day  the order is received, consistent with \u201cjust-in-time\u201d inventory  management practices. If DEA were expected to make suspicious  order determinations without the risk of disrupting patient care needs,  it would be imperative for DEA to act quickly to identify suspicious  orders. These distribution companies did not believe DEA would be  able to identify them rapidly as needed. As noted above, DEA\u2019s  current systems are not designed for real-time reporting, and it does  not have an existing mechanism or a comprehensive and complete  database of orders before they are filled that it can analyze, on a real- time basis, to identify potentially suspicious orders.", "Officials from the association that represents a large number of drug  distributors were careful to point out, however, that systems sometimes  differ intentionally due, for example, to varying customer bases, service  requirements and patient care needs.

The tool does  not provide detailed enough information to be useful to facilitate the  identification of suspicious orders. For example, when a distributor  queries the tool, the search results will list the total dosage units for a  particular opioid for the past six months at the pharmacy. Because  some opioid drug dosages are more commonly abused than others,  distributors told us that simply having the total number of dosage units  is not as helpful as seeing the breakdown of the different dosage  units. In another instance, the data provided to distributors does not  include critical details about the number of suppliers. One distributor  might have multiple warehouses and distribution centers that it uses  to package and ship pharmaceutical products. In the ARCOS data  that DEA provides to distributors, these individual warehouses are  counted as distinct suppliers in the total supplier count data provided  to the distributors. Therefore, the number of suppliers may appear  inflated to the distributors, even though it is only a single company  providing the products.", "According to DEA, the ARCOS lookup tool is meant to be a pointer  and assist distributors in conducting due diligence so they can \u201cknow  their customer.\u201d Regardless if a distributor is shipping from multiple  distribution centers and therefore showing as multiple suppliers in the  lookup tool, these are all unique DEA registration numbers and are  therefore unique suppliers to the customer. According to DEA, the  important part here is that distributors can see quantity and gram  totals per registrant (such as, a pharmacy customer) that they query.", "When evaluating whether an order is suspicious, a distributor uses its  own internal transaction data to evaluate a buyer\u2019s ordering patterns.  However, purchasers of controlled substances, such as pharmacies and  medical practices, may use multiple distributors for their purchases.  Distributors have previously raised concerns that they did not have  access to additional transaction data, such as whether the purchaser is  also buying controlled substances from additional suppliers. They have  noted that this additional data would be useful when making decisions  about whether an order is suspicious, and specifically, that ARCOS data  would be useful in helping them evaluate whether an order was  suspicious. For example, in 2018, one distributor testified that, given  DEA\u2019s access to the controlled substance transaction data that  distributors report, \u201cnly DEA has visibility over the entire landscape and  can track and analyze aggregate data on the distribution of controlled  substances in particular jurisdictions.\u201d In addition, an industry  organization we met with provided comments to DOJ in 2017 that certain  data could provide more context for them to identify problematic orders.  Specifically, the organization noted that if DEA could provide ARCOS  data in aggregate form without identifying individual distributors\u2019  competitors, the distributor could consider a pharmacy\u2019s orders in the  context of the pharmacy\u2019s overall ordering from all distributors.", "An industry association representing distributors, and two of the  distributors that we interviewed stated that the Enhanced Lookup Buyer  Statistic Tool is a step in the right direction.

It is  missing opportunities to more effectively identify questionable ordering  patterns and possible diversion activities than through its current analysis  methods. Using more automated analyses, similar to other federal entities  that use computer algorithms as part of their analysis of available data to  help flag instances of diversion, DEA could enhance its ongoing efforts to  prevent, detect, and investigate diversion more quickly and assist it in  reporting on how it is using ARCOS data to identify suspicious activities.", "Furthermore, because DEA does not have a documented data  governance structure in place to manage its data, it risks challenges  related to quality, availability, and integrity of the data it uses to support  opioid diversion. Although DEA has started to explore developing a data  governance structure, it is important for DEA to document and define its  process about what the structure would entail. This would help the  agency determine the effectiveness of its structure, an important  consideration given the large amounts of varied data DEA receives from  industry stakeholders. Also, while DEA does have some performance  goals related to opioid diversion, it lacks outcome-oriented goals and  measurable performance targets to assess the extent to which the  industry-reported data it obtains and uses support the agency\u2019s diversion  control activities.

As stated earlier, we will continue to work with DEA to address the  specific actions needed to meet the intent our recommendation.", "DEA concurred with our fourth recommendation that DEA, in consultation  with industry stakeholders, should identify solutions to address the  limitations of the ARCOS Enhanced Lookup Buyer Statistic Tool, to  ensure registrants have the most useful information possible to assist  them in identifying and reporting suspicious orders to DEA. DEA stated it  has consulted with industry stakeholders and has identified solutions to  address the limitations of the tool. We believe such consultation will be  beneficial for DEA to understand its industry stakeholders\u2019 needs and that  identifying solutions for addressing these needs would help ensure  registrants have the information necessary to help identify and report  suspicious opioid orders.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Attorney General, the DEA Administrator and the  Secretary of Health and Human Services, and other interested parties. In  addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at  http://www.gao.gov.", "If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact  me at (202) 512-6691 or McneilT@gao.gov.

We also conducted interviews with DEA headquarters  offices, including the Diversion Control Division and DEA field division  offices. To determine DEA registrant legal reporting requirements related  to prescription drug orders and the meaning of suspicious orders, we  reviewed applicable laws and regulations, including the CSA and its  subsequent amendments and related DEA regulations and guidance. In  addition, we reviewed the recently enacted SUPPORT Act. To identify  policies and guidelines DEA uses to obtain and review registrant-reported  data, we reviewed DEA procedures for conducting drug-related  investigations, information system manuals for data and information  systems used by DEA, and DEA written communications to registrants  and DEA forms registrants use to report prescription drug transactions to  DEA. As part of our work examining the information systems used to  obtain and analyze data reported by registrants, we interviewed officials  who oversee the management of DEA information systems, such as  Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS),  Controlled Substances Ordering System (CSOS), Registrant Information  Consolidated System, and the Suspicious Orders Reporting System  (SORS) systems used to obtain and store suspicious order reports at  DEA headquarters. We interviewed DEA officials in headquarters and  field division offices to determine how information that industry members  report to DEA is obtained and used to detect and identify potential  diversion activities. The perspectives we gathered from field division  offices cannot be generalizable to the entire population of field division  offices, but did provide us with insights into the agency\u2019s diversion efforts  and use of industry-reported data.", "To identify what opportunities exist, if any, for DEA to improve these  efforts, such as using computer algorithms or real-time reporting, we also  interviewed DEA officials responsible for developing analytical products  based on industry-reported data. In addition, we interviewed DEA officials  at eight field division offices to learn about how diversion investigators  use industry-reported data and what, if any, improvements might be  needed. To identify which of the 23 DEA field division offices to interview,  we prioritized our selection based on four primary criteria: 1) the  controlled prescription drug availability rate in their geographic area,  according to a 2017 DEA threat assessment report, indicating whether  the field division office had a \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cmoderate\u201d rate of availability; 2)  whether the office was within the location of a DOJ Opioid Fraud and  Detection Unit task force location; 3) whether the office was located within  top ten state with high controlled prescription drug prescribing rate, as  identified by the CDC; and 4) whether the office was located within a state  that the CDC identified as having a high ER visit rate for opioid  overdoses. We also ensured that the DEA field division offices we  interviewed represented different geographic areas within the United  States.", "We also conducted interviews with four pharmaceutical distributors and  one trade organization whose membership includes wholesale  distributors. We interviewed three organizations representing pharmacies,  pharmacists, and drug diversion professionals to gather their perspectives  and experiences with efforts to detect and report suspicious opioid orders.  We based our initial interview selection of distributors based on DEA- provided ARCOS data of opioid-related transactions, which indicated the  three largest distributors for opioids. To identify smaller distributors to  gather their perspectives, we contacted an industry association  representing distributors to facilitate our efforts to arrange for an  interview, resulting in an interview with one additional distributor.", "In addition, we interviewed officials from a state prescription drug  monitoring program (PDMP) that collects real-time data, a Bureau of  Justice Assistance grant program that supports PDMPs, and a company  that operates 44 of the 53 state PDMPs to gain insights on the data they  collect. The views of these organizations cannot be generalized to the  entire population, but provided important insights and perspectives about  suspicious order detection and reporting. We reviewed the data DEA  collects to identify possible types of analyses DEA could conduct using  ARCOS data to identify unusual patterns. In addition, we reviewed key  data governance practices used by organizations and identified through  our past work to determine the extent to which DEA has a governance  structure in place to manage how it collects and uses data to support  diversion control efforts. Additionally, we reviewed the June 2019 Office  of Management and Budget Federal Data Strategy which provides a  framework of operational principles and practices to help agencies use  and manage data. The key practices we identified to compare DEA\u2019s  data governance efforts against were: identify data needs to answer key  agency questions; provide resources explicitly to leverage assets;  prioritize data governance; and support non-federal stakeholders. We  selected these practices because they are important to early development  of a data governance structure. We also reviewed the February 2019  Data Strategy, released by DOJ, that is to serve as a roadmap for DOJ  components to manage their data assets.", "To understand the extent to which DEA assesses the results of the data it  obtains and uses from its ARCOS system and through suspicious order  reporting, we reviewed DEA\u2019s performance measures and applicable laws  governing performance reporting in the federal government, including the  Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), as updated  and expanded by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA).  Although GPRA and GPRAMA requirements apply to those goals  reported by departments (e.g., DOJ), we have previously reported that  they can serve as leading practices at other organizational levels, such as  component agencies for performance management. We also reviewed  related national, DOJ, and DEA strategy documents that are used to  communicate diversion control goals and performance. These documents  included the 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment and 2019 National  Drug Control Strategy, DOJ\u2019s department-wide strategic plan, DOJ  Annual Performance Report, DEA\u2019s 360 strategy guide, and DEA  congressional budget justification documents. In addition, we evaluated  DEA\u2019s performance measures against criteria in Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government. Furthermore, we reviewed the extent  to which DEA defined objectives and outcome-oriented goals, or  established measurable performance targets to evaluate the  effectiveness of how it obtains and uses data and compared them to  GPRAMA requirements, which may serve as leading practices for DEA.", "To determine what opportunities exist, if any, for DEA to improve its use  and collection of industry-reported data, such as using computer  algorithms or real-time reporting, we interviewed DEA officials to  determine what analytics, if any, DEA is using to detect and identify  potential opioid diversion activities. In our interviews with field division  offices, we requested information regarding how investigators received  suspicious order reports from registrants and how the investigators  requested and used ARCOS and other system analysis to conduct or  support their investigative work. We also interviewed officials from other  entities with opioid diversion prevention responsibilities, such as state  level Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs, the Department of Health  and Human Services, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office  Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit.", "To obtain perspectives of industry stakeholders on how data, such as  suspicious orders may be better reported to DEA, we interviewed four  industry associations whose memberships include industry stakeholders.  We selected these associations based on their roles in representing  various DEA registrant communities, such as pharmacists, pharmacies,  and distributors. We also reviewed documentation describing the data  available to DEA via its ARCOS database, as well as documentation that  described examples of unusual patterns of orders. Based on such  information, two GAO specialists identified methods that could be  implemented using computer algorithms to analyze ARCOS data to  identify patterns that might indicate unusual activity. Additionally, these  specialists identified related opportunities that DEA could use to analyze  ARCOS data combined with data from other sources, such as  prescription rate information, to identify these patterns.", "To address the extent to which DEA collaborates with industry  stakeholders to combat opioid diversion, we examined DEA policies and  procedures, and interviewed relevant DEA officials, industry associations,  and private sector industry members. Specifically, we examined DEA  agency-wide directives and guidance, and component management  policies and procedures for providing information to industry stakeholders  related to industry\u2019s suspicious order reporting requirements, including  written communication DEA sent to industry stakeholders related to  suspicious order reporting. In addition, DEA officials provided us with a  demonstration of SORS, ARCOS, and the ARCOS Enhanced Lookup  Buyer Statistic Tool \u2013 available to distributors to help them identify and  report suspicious opioid orders.", "We interviewed DEA officials in eight field division offices who interact  with industry stakeholders on, among other things, identifying and  reporting suspicious orders. These officials provided their perspectives on  the usefulness of suspicious order reports to their investigations as well  as other industry self-reported data collected in DEA information systems.  We interviewed opioid distributors of varying sizes, as noted above,  including some of the largest opioid distributors, based on DEA-provided  ARCOS data of opioid-related transactions, for their perspectives on the  information and tools DEA provides to them, including the Lookup Buyer  Statistics Tool and the ARCOS Enhanced Lookup Buyer Statistic Tool.  The views of these distributors are not generalizable to the entire  population, but provide insights and information on how industry detects  and reports suspicious orders through use of ARCOS data and other  tools.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2019 through January  2020 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
