VAMCs can use one or more of the protected (confidential and nonpunitive) and nonprotected processes to evaluate the role of individual providers in adverse events. GAO was asked to review the extent to which processes used to respond to adverse events are carried out across VAMCs. In this report, GAO examined (1) VAMCs' adherence to VHA's protected peer review process, and the extent to which VHA monitors this process, and (2) VAMCs' adherence to VHA's nonprotected processes and the extent to which VHA monitors these processes. To conduct this work, GAO visited four VAMCs selected for variation in size, complexity of surgeries typically performed, and location. GAO reviewed VHA policies and federal internal control standards and analyzed data from the four selected VAMCs. GAO also interviewed VHA and VA OIG officials, as well as officials from VISNs of the four selected VAMCs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers GAO visited did not adhere to certain policy elements of the protected peer review process, and monitoring by VA's Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is limited. According to policy issued by VHA, protected peer review may be used by VA medical centers (VAMC) when there is a need to determine whether a provider's actions associated with an adverse event were clinically appropriate--that is, whether another provider with similar expertise would have taken similar action. Despite VAMC officials' general understanding of the protected peer review process, none of the VAMCs GAO visited adhered to all four protected peer review policy elements selected for review, including the timely completion of reviews, and the timely development of peer review triggers that signal the need for further review of a provider's care. Failure of VAMCs to adhere to the protected peer review policy elements may result in missed opportunities to identify providers who pose a risk to patient safety. Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), responsible for oversight of VAMCs, monitor VAMCs' protected peer review processes through quarterly data submissions and annual site visits. A VHA official said that VHA monitors the process by reviewing and analyzing the aggregated quarterly data submitted by VAMCs through the VISNs. The VA Office of the Inspector General (OIG) also conducts oversight of the protected peer review process as part of a larger review of VAMCs' operations. While the VISNs and VA OIG have reviewed VAMCs establishment of peer review triggers to prompt further review of a provider's care, neither they nor VHA has monitored their implementation. As such, VHA cannot provide reasonable assurance that VAMCs are using the peer review triggers as intended, as a risk assessment tool. This weakens VAMCs' ability to ensure they are identifying providers that are unable to deliver safe, quality patient care.", "VAMCs' adherence to the nonprotected focused professional practice evaluation (FPPE) process is unclear due to gaps in VHA's policy on documentation requirements, and VHA does not routinely monitor nonprotected processes. An FPPE for cause is a time-limited evaluation during which the VAMC assesses the provider's professional competence when a question arises regarding the provider's ability to provide safe, quality patient care. Information collected through the FPPE can be used to inform adverse actions, such as limiting the provider's scope of care. Although VAMC officials were generally aware of the FPPE process, there are gaps in VHA's policy regarding how these evaluations should be documented and what information should be included, which limited GAO's ability to assess VAMCs' adherence to the process. For example, one VAMC provided GAO with documentation labeled as an FPPE and identified by the service chief as an FPPE; however, the quality manager said a formal FPPE was not conducted and that the documentation was actually part of a protected peer review. These differing views illustrate that, even within the same facility, gaps in VHA's policy on documenting FPPEs create a lack of clarity and opportunities for misinterpretation and inappropriate use. Moreover, the gaps in VHA's policy may hinder VAMCs' ability to appropriately document the evaluation of a provider's skills, support any actions initiated, and track provider-specific incidents over time. There is no routine monitoring of FPPEs for cause by VHA, VISNs, or VA OIG."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA take action to ensure VAMCs adhere to certain elements of the peer review policy, require VAMCs to report data on implementation of peer review triggers, and develop more specific policy to help guide the FPPE process, including documentation requirements.

Based on the nature of the adverse  event and the information gleaned through a particular review process, a  VAMC may decide to conduct multiple types of reviews, both protected  and nonprotected processes, as appropriate. Information collected  through protected review processes, including protected peer review,  cannot be used to inform adverse actions against a provider; information  collected through nonprotected processes, including FPPEs and AIBs,  can be used to support a VAMC\u2019s decision to take adverse action against  a provider. According to VHA policy, VAMCs can use both protected and  nonprotected processes concurrently or consecutively as long as  protected and nonprotected processes and data collection are kept  separate. According to VHA officials, if a VAMC is using a protected  process to review an event and realizes that a nonprotected review may  be necessary, the protected process should be stopped and the VAMC  should start a nonprotected review.

VHA\u2019s Director of Risk  Management said that her office is responsible for making changes to  policy in response to VA OIG findings related to the protected peer review  process. For example, in a 2008 report on VISNs\u2019 oversight of the  protected peer review process, the VA OIG found that VISNs failed to  substantially comply with the requirement to conduct periodic inspections;  the VA OIG recommended that VHA clarify its peer review policy to define  periodic site visits required of VISNs. VHA\u2019s 2008 revision of the  protected peer review policy redefined site visits as annual to result in  more frequent monitoring by VISNs. VHA also improved peer review  data monitoring activities. According to the Director of Risk Management,  a national survey of VAMC risk managers was conducted in 2011 to  better understand how protected peer review data are used. Based on  survey data and a literature review, VHA officials said they determined  that VAMCs and VISNs needed additional data on the specific areas of  care that were being peer-reviewed as well as information about  significant problems identified and frequently cited issues. VHA officials  said that in fiscal year 2012, they expanded the required quarterly  protected peer review data set that VAMCs report to the VISN to include  the commonly peer-reviewed aspects of care, such as the choice of a  diagnostic test, performance of a procedure or treatment, and addressing  abnormal results of diagnostic tests."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VHA and VA OIG Monitoring of Peer Review Triggers Is Limited", "paragraphs": ["According to VHA\u2019s protected peer review policy, VISNs and the Office of  Risk Management play a role in monitoring VAMCs\u2019 implementation of  protected peer review processes, which include peer review triggers.

Officials from the fourth VISN told us  they have reviewed types of triggers in place at VAMCs, but they have  not confirmed that VAMCs have established peer review triggers. Officials  from all four VISNs told us they typically do not monitor whether VAMCs  have implemented the established peer review triggers, including  monitoring how many FPPEs for cause have been triggered. One VISN  official explained that the VISN cannot monitor every aspect of every  policy and regulation that govern VAMCs\u2019 operations; therefore, they  choose to focus their monitoring efforts on the elements of particular  importance where other entities\u2014such as the VA OIG and The Joint  Commission\u2014have found evidence of noncompliance.", "VHA\u2019s Director of Risk Management told us that the office does not  monitor whether VAMCs have established peer review triggers.

However, there are gaps in  VHA\u2019s policy regarding how these evaluations should be documented and  what information should be included, which limited our ability to assess  VAMCs\u2019 adherence to the FPPE policy. Officials from two of the VAMCs  we visited told us there are no standardized guidelines on how the FPPE  process should be structured. According to the Director of Credentialing  and Privileging, VHA\u2019s policy on FPPEs was intended to allow VAMCs  flexibility in the design of the evaluation to accommodate the variety of  ways that issues are identified and the types of issues that may be  addressed (see box for example of an FPPE).", "Example of an FPPE at one VAMC we  visited   There are multiple ways that an FPPE may be  prompted, including multiple patient  complaints or exceeding a VAMC\u2019s peer  review trigger. At one VAMC we visited, a  provider exceeded a peer review trigger\u2014 receiving two or more level of care 3 peer  review ratings within 6 months\u2014which  prompted a detailed assessment, including a  retrospective evaluation of 25 percent of the  provider\u2019s medical records over the previous  12 months. The medical records were  evaluated specifically for patient evaluations,  outcomes, and documentation. Upon  completion of the assessment, VAMC officials  determined that the provider\u2019s documentation,  including patient discharge summaries,  patient transfer, medication review, and  disclosure notes, was inadequate. An FPPE  was initiated, for which the provider was  instructed on how to properly document these  types of summaries and notes. The evaluator  also recommended that the provider write the  notes for each patient seen before moving to  see other patients, instead of writing the notes  for all patients at the end of the day. VAMC  officials also initiated a performance  improvement plan for the provider, which  included monitoring his medical record  documentation over a 6-month period. When  officials determined that the provider had not  improved after this period, the FPPE was  extended to continue monitoring aspects of  his clinical care. The provider retired 6 months  later.", "Officials from the VAMCs we visited were generally aware that FPPEs  can be used to address concerns about the quality of a provider\u2019s care;  are time limited; and are not disciplinary, but could ultimately be used to  take adverse action against a provider, if necessary. While VAMC officials  were generally aware of the FPPE process, we found that the four  VAMCs we visited varied widely in their documentation of FPPEs,  attributable at least in part to the lack of specificity in VHA\u2019s FPPE policy  regarding documentation requirements. In reviewing FPPEs conducted  between fiscal years 2009 and 2011 we found the following:", "One of the four VAMCs provided a completed template for each of its  FPPEs, including the purpose of the FPPE, specifying what triggered  the review, the time period for review, comments by the evaluator, an  action plan based on the review, and evidence of concurrence with  the review by the applicable service chief. (See app. I for an example  of an FPPE template used at one of the VAMCs we visited.)", "Two other VAMCs provided various combinations of documents as  evidence of their FPPEs, including professional standards board  minutes and emails and letters from evaluators. These documents  contained varying amounts of information detailing the circumstances  prompting the FPPE, comments from evaluators, and follow-up  actions, if any.", "The fourth VAMC initially provided us with documentation of one  FPPE, including a completed template identifying the clinical service  involved, the method of evaluation, the evaluator\u2019s findings, and the  service chief\u2019s conclusions; and several documents, each with  focused professional practice evaluation labeled at the top, specifying  the medical records evaluated for the FPPE and the evaluator\u2019s  comments on each case. The VAMC\u2019s service chief told us that an  FPPE had been conducted for cause for this provider, but the VAMC\u2019s  quality manager said a formal FPPE had not been conducted and that  the documentation we received was part of a protected peer review  process. This disagreement illustrates that even within the same  facility the interpretation of VHA\u2019s policy on FPPEs differs, which can  lead to potentially inappropriate use.", "Gaps in VHA\u2019s policy on FPPE documentation requirements create a lack  of clarity and therefore may affect VAMCs\u2019 ability to appropriately  document the evaluation of providers\u2019 skills, support any actions initiated,  and track provider-specific FPPE-related incidents over time. For  example, if FPPEs are not well documented, VAMC officials may have  limited knowledge of the findings to proceed with any actions and limited  ability to track that such evaluations were conducted. As a result, if  another adverse event subsequently occurred involving the same  provider, the VAMC may not be aware of any prior findings. One VAMC  official stressed to us the importance of thorough documentation of an  FPPE, even if the determination is made that the provider delivered safe,  quality patient care and no adverse action is needed. Without adequate  documentation, a VAMC may conduct an FPPE that complies with VHA\u2019s  policy, and determine that adverse action is needed on the basis of the  evaluation\u2019s findings, but ultimately may be unable to take the action  because the documented evidence is insufficient. Officials at one VAMC  said they did not believe that the evidence gathered from an FPPE was  strong enough to hold up against a provider\u2019s appeal of an adverse  action.", "AIBs. Another type of nonprotected review that VAMC officials may  choose to address an adverse event is an AIB. In our review of VA\u2019s  AIB policy, we found that the policy generally provides clear guidance on  the requirements, including documentation. For example, the policy  specifies steps on how VAMC officials determine the need for an AIB,  select the board members, and write the charge letter that convenes the  AIB, and also provides a number of templates and checklists, including  templates for the charge letter and investigative report, and checklists for  collecting evidence, conducting interviews, and writing the report.", "When asked about AIBs, VAMC officials told us an AIB could be used  when (1) a case is egregious; (2) there is a previous incident involving the  same provider; (3) the VAMC needs or wants to take privileging or  disciplinary action; and (4) the facts of a case are in dispute or when there  is a high level of complexity and ambiguity in the case. For example, at  one VAMC we visited, an AIB was convened to investigate the facts and  circumstances regarding the care and treatment immediately preceding a  veteran\u2019s death. The AIB was charged with investigating allegations that a  provider\u2019s care deviated from standard practice procedures, including  prescribing inappropriate doses of medications, not ensuring appropriate  monitoring or appropriate interval of physical assessments, and providing  substandard documentation and communication."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VHA Does Not Routinely Monitor Nonprotected Processes", "paragraphs": ["FPPEs.
