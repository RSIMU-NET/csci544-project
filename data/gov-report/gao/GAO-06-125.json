The Navy did not analyze the most cost-effective mix of active and reserve personnel and in some cases used outdated mission documents as the baseline for analysis. The Department of Defense personnel directive states that missions should be accomplished using the least costly mix of personnel. In addition, GAO's prior work has shown that when reserve forces can successfully meet deployment and operational requirements, they can perform missions for less cost than active forces, and that decisions about the number of personnel needed to perform government functions should be driven by valid and reliable data. The 10 activities' justification packages GAO reviewed did not indicate if or how commanders evaluated the cost-effectiveness of using active or reserve personnel. A key reason why cost-effectiveness was not evaluated is that the Fleet Forces Command provided no guidance requiring that such an analysis be conducted or submitted as part of the activities' justification packages. Additionally, because the Navy had not devoted the resources to update some of its baseline mission documents prior to the start of the review, some of the activities' analyses did not start with the best possible data, which may have resulted in inaccuracies in their determinations about capabilities and personnel requirements. Including cost-effectiveness in the criteria for the zero-based review and documenting such analyses, as well as ensuring data accuracy, could have better demonstrated a sound basis for the recommended personnel changes and, in some cases, may have led to different recommendations. The review's recommendations will result in a change in the force mix, some cost savings, and the active force assuming greater command and control over reserve forces. The Chief of Naval Operations approved personnel changes that would result in a net reduction of over 16,000 reserve positions, a net increase of about 880 positions in the active force, and a net increase of about 450 civilian personnel positions. The reasons for these recommended changes varied by activity. The Fleet Forces Command also initially estimated that the Navy could save approximately $283.5 million annually by implementing the personnel recommendations, although this estimate is changing as some activities reexamine their personnel requirements using more recent data. In addition to total force personnel changes, the active force is assuming greater command and control responsibility for the reserve force. For example, the active force is now responsible for the training and readiness of the reserve forces and is receiving their status reports. This realignment of responsibility is consistent with the Chief of Naval Operation's expectations for creating a more integrated total force."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The role of the Navy Reserve is to provide mission-capable units and  manpower to support Navy peacetime and wartime operations.  In fiscal  year 2004, the Navy Reserve was authorized 85,900 selected reservists, the  primary source of reserve mobilization manpower to support the 369,800  military personnel in the active force. The Secretary of Defense noted in a July 2003 memorandum that the balance of capabilities between the active  and reserve forces was not right to meet future mission requirements.  In  response, the Chief of Naval Operations announced an effort to transform  the Navy Reserve and create a more integrated total force in which Navy Reserve capabilities are tied directly to active units in support of Sea Power  21 mission requirements.  As part of a continuing process to fully integrate  its active and reserve forces, in August 2004 the Navy completed a zero\u00ad based review of the requirements for Navy selected reservists. The  objective of the review was to determine how many selected reserve  personnel are needed to support the active force in meeting current and  future Navy mission requirements.", "In the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for 2005,Congress mandated that we assess several issues related to the Navy\u2019s  review of selected reserve manpower requirements, including (1) the  extent that the Navy used clearly defined and consistent criteria and a  sound methodology in determining the future mix of active and reserve  components and (2) the extent the Navy\u2019s zero-based review process  considered operational concepts and emerging mission requirements.  As  agreed with your offices, we provided an interim briefing addressing these  objectives on March 29, 2005. To summarize the results of our work, this  final report addresses the following questions:  1.\t What criteria and process did the Navy use to conduct its zero-based  review of reserve manpower requirements, and what, if any, limitations  affect the Navy\u2019s analyses and implementation plans?  2.\t How will the recommendations from the zero-based review affect the  reserve\u2019s manpower, funding, and command and control relationship  with the active force?", "To answer these questions, we analyzed the criteria, process, and guidance  the Fleet Forces Command used to conduct the zero-based review by  reviewing the documentation for selected Navy activities.  As part of our  analysis, we examined the review results for 10 Navy activities and visited  the Naval Air Forces Command and four other selected activities to assess  the zero-based review process at the activity level and obtain detailed  information about recommended reserve manpower changes. In addition,  we obtained information from Navy Headquarters and Navy Reserve  Headquarters to determine how the review\u2019s results would impact active  and reserve command and control relationships and reviewed planned  funding documents to assess the extent that recommended reserve  manpower changes were reflected in future budgets.  We also obtained  information from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy,  Manpower and Reserve Affairs to determine the relationship between the  Department of the Navy Human Capital Strategy and the Navy\u2019s zero-based  review.  Except for some outdated mission documents used as the baseline  for manpower requirements, we concluded the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of this report.

The Selected Reserve contains those  units and manpower that are most essential to the wartime missions  because it provides mission-capable units and individuals to augment the  active Navy force when required.  For example, the Selected Reserve  consist of Naval aviation units, Naval coastal warfare groups, medical  personnel, and submarine forces personnel.  The Individual Ready Reserve  consists of individuals who have received training in the active Navy force  or Selected Reserve.  Members of the Selected Reserve receive priority  over other reservists for training and equipment and they generally are the  first to be called to active duty by a presidential order.", "In August 2003, the Chief of Naval Operations directed the Commander of  the Fleet Forces Command to validate the Navy Selected Reserve  manpower requirements and determine the ability of the Navy Reserve to  provide required capabilities to the Navy forces.  To accomplish this, the  Fleet Forces Command conducted a zero-based review over a 10-month  period, from October 2003 to August 2004.  Based on the review, the  Command recommended reducing the size of the Selected Reserve from  85,900 authorized positions to about 70,000 by fiscal year 2011\u2014a decrease  of about 16,000 authorized positions.  The Chief of Naval Operations  approved the zero-based review results for implementation in August 2004.", "The zero-based review is a component of the Navy\u2019s ongoing active/reserve  integration initiative. This initiative is an essential element of the  Department of the Navy\u2019s Human Capital Strategy, which was announced in  June 2004.  According to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy as well as  Navy and Marine Corps manpower officials, accelerating manpower costs,  changes in the global military environment, and evolving military  requirements prompted the Department of the Navy to develop this  strategy. The overall goal of the strategy is to have the best people with the  proper skills, training, and experience in the right jobs.  The strategy serves  as high-level guidance for the Navy and Marine Corps to use in developing  their own implementation plans.  As shown in figure 1, the strategy consists  of three elements: civilian personnel transformation, naval military  personnel transformation, and Navy active/reserve integration.", "Implementing the National Security Personnel System will facilitate the  Department of Defense\u2019s civilian personnel transformation efforts, while  the Navy military personnel transformation is driven by the implementation  of the Navy\u2019s Sea Warrior Initiative.

In following the guidance and applying these criteria, the  functions conducted a capability gap analysis by determining (1) the extent  to which the active forces could meet the mission requirement and (2) how  many reserve personnel would be required to fill any remaining gaps in the  active forces\u2019 capability.", "The zero-based review guidance also required review results to be reported  and documented in a standardized format.  Our review of 10 of 37 activity  packages submitted to the Fleet Forces Command confirmed that each of  the 232 functions associated with the 10 activities completed a structured  electronic spreadsheet containing pertinent information about mission  capability requirement, current manpower authorizations, and proposed  manpower changes to justify the reserve manpower needed to perform its  assigned mission.  Each function also cited that its mission linked to one of  the pillars of Navy Sea Power 21.  For example, all eight of the Naval  Security Group activity\u2019s functions linked their missions to Sea Shield, the  pillar that provides sea-based theater and strategic defense.  The functions  also considered the manpower needs of emerging mission requirements.

The Commander of the Navy Reserve  Force also participated in the high-level review of the proposed reserve  manpower changes.  The process allowed multiple two-way  communications to finalize proposals for reserve manpower requirements  and validate the results. In instances where the Fleet Forces Command  disagreed with an activity\u2019s initial proposal, the activity revised and  resubmitted its proposal or provided additional justification until the  disagreement was resolved.  After the Fleet Forces Command made a  decision about the number of authorized reserve positions, it notified the  activities and allowed them to again officially request reconsideration by  providing additional documentation and support.  For example, the Naval  Air Systems Command first submitted justification for 652 reserve  positions.  However, after reviewing the justification package, the Fleet  Forces Command recommended eliminating all of the Naval Air Systems  Command\u2019s reserve positions because they were not linked to mobilization  requirements.  The Naval Air Systems Command resubmitted justification  for 226 reserve positions to provide special skills and support for  contingency operations.

After the executive board approved the  results, they were given to the Commander of the Fleet Forces Command,  who also reviewed and approved the results.  The criteria the Fleet Forces  Command used for validating the reserve manpower requirements included  whether (1) the particular mission is suitable for the reserve component,  (2) the position is required to be filled by a military person, (3) the position  fills a gap in the active component\u2019s capabilities, and (4) the reserve  component can perform the mission.  The validation process included a  mission risk assessment by the Fleet Forces Command of how important  the reserve forces were to performing the mission.  The Command then  assigned a low, moderate, or high-risk designation as to whether the active  component could perform the mission without the planned contribution  from the reserve component.  For example, the Fleet Forces Command  assessed that there was a low risk that the Maritime Patrol Reconnaissance  function could not perform the mission without the reserves\u2019 contribution.  After the results were validated, they had to be approved by the Total Force  Flag Steering Group, a group of senior officers, including the Commander  of the Navy Reserve Force, charged with ensuring continued progress in  the integration of Navy active and reserve forces.

We have shown that when the reserve  force can successfully meet deployment and operational requirements, it  can generally perform missions at a lower cost than the active force  because active units have all full-time personnel assigned whereas reserve  units have mostly part-time personnel assigned.By identifying capability  gaps in the active force as the primary criterion for determining the  required reserve manpower, the Navy failed to assess whether the lower  cost reserve force could be used to meet capabilities currently provided by  the active force.", "While the Fleet Forces Command\u2019s general guidance indicated that the  manpower requirements review should consider cost in determining an  adequate return on investment, it also stated that the return on  investment should be based on commanders\u2019 judgment.

If the most cost-effective mix of active and  reserve forces had been a major criterion in the review process, the results  might have been different and the Navy may have been able to realize  additional savings for some activities. For example, our current analysis of  Navy data showed that the manpower costs for a reserve squadron of nine  P-3 Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance aircraft would be approximately  $20 million annually\u2014about $8 million or 29 percent less than the  estimated manpower cost of $28 million for an active squadron.", "Outdated Mission Documents  May Have Resulted in Inaccurate  have resulted in inaccurate recommendations about the Navy reserve  Manpower Recommendations \t manpower needed to perform missions in the future.
