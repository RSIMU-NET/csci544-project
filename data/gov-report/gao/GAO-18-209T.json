In the event of a supply disruption, the SPR can supply the market by either exchanging oil for an equal quantity of oil plus an additional amount as a premium to be returned to the SPR in the future or selling stored oil. Since the SPR was authorized in 1975, DOE has released oil 11 times in response to domestic supply disruptions. All but one were in the form of an exchange, including six exchanges in response to hurricanes. For example, Hurricane Harvey in 2017 closed or restricted ports through which 2 million barrels of oil per day were imported. In response, DOE exchanged 5 million barrels of oil to Gulf Coast refineries. According to DOE officials, exchanges from the SPR allowed refineries to operate, ensuring continued production of refined petroleum products for use by consumers.", "Based on past GAO work and preliminary observations, the SPR is limited in its ability to respond to domestic supply disruptions, including severe weather events, for three main reasons. First, as GAO reported in September 2014 (GAO-14-807), the SPR is almost entirely composed of oil and not refined products like gasoline, which may not be effective in responding to all disruptions. For example, following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, nearly 30 percent of U.S. refining capacity was shut down for weeks, disrupting supplies of gasoline and other petroleum products. The SPR could not mitigate the effects of disrupted supplies. Second, as GAO also reported in September 2014, the SPR is nearly entirely located in the Gulf Coast, so it may not be responsive to disruptions in other regions, such as the West Coast. Third, GAO's ongoing work reviewed DOE and energy task force reports that found that statutory authorities governing SPR releases may inhibit their use for regional disruptions.", "GAO's preliminary observations show that other International Energy Agency (IEA) member countries generally have used one of five reserve structures configured in various ways. The structures are defined by whether countries hold either public reserves (e.g., the SPR), industry reserves (e.g., placing reserve holding requirements on industry), or a combination. Most IEA members hold refined petroleum products in reserve, with many members holding at least a third of their reserves in these products. For example, in Germany, 55 percent of reserves are in petroleum products. In addition, some IEA members' reserves are geographically dispersed in their countries to respond to disruptions. For example, France has reserves in each of its seven regions and has used these to address fuel supply disruptions as a result of recent domestic strikes. DOE has taken some steps to evaluate other structures but has not formally evaluated the structures of other countries in over 35 years. In addition, DOE contractors studied the feasibility of regional product reserves in the Southeast and West Coast regions to address supply vulnerabilities from hurricanes and earthquakes, respectively but DOE did not finalize the two 2015 studies. In 2016, DOE released a long- term strategic review of the SPR that Congress had required and GAO recommended. However, DOE did not include the results of the two studies in its 2016 review."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations but will consider making them, as appropriate, as it finalizes its work."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our work on energy resilience,  specifically preliminary observations from our ongoing work looking at the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR)\u2014the world\u2019s largest government  owned stockpile of emergency oil. U.S. energy systems are vulnerable to  a range of potential disruptions, including from international events, such  as conflicts or terrorism incidents that may affect oil supplies, and  domestic ones, such as from hurricanes and other severe weather  events, which can disrupt oil and gas supplies and cause temporary fuel  or electricity shortages. Because of the central role that energy plays in  the U.S. economy and the configuration of the nation\u2019s energy system,  vulnerabilities may have wide-ranging implications for energy production  and use, ultimately affecting transportation, industrial, agricultural, and  other critical sectors of the economy that require reliable energy. We have  reported on energy vulnerabilities as well as on federal efforts to address  them. Recent experience with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria  underscores these vulnerabilities. In addition to damaging infrastructure  and property, and causing the loss of life, the hurricanes disrupted the  operations of refineries representing at least 15 percent of the nation\u2019s  refining capacity, affected fuel distribution, and left millions of U.S.  citizens without electricity.", "After the Arab oil embargo, over 4 decades ago, Congress authorized the  creation of the SPR to include the ability to release oil to the market  during supply disruptions and protect the U.S. economy from damage.  The SPR is managed by the Department of Energy (DOE). The SPR held  673.7 million barrels of oil as of September 30, 2017 which is worth about  $38.4 billion at prices as of October 30, 2017. According to DOE\u2019s 2014- 2018 strategic plan, the SPR benefits the nation by providing an  insurance policy against actual and potential interruptions in petroleum  supplies caused by international turmoil, hurricanes, accidents, or terrorist  activities. Releasing SPR oil during a disruption is intended to mitigate  damage to the economy by replacing disrupted oil supplies, thereby  reducing price increases that can result in economic damage. When  processed, oil is converted into refined petroleum products such as  gasoline and diesel fuel.", "The SPR also helps the United States meet its stockholding obligations  as a member of the International Energy Agency (IEA)\u2014an international  energy forum of 29 member nations established in 1974 to help members  respond to major oil supply disruptions. IEA members have agreed to  fulfill obligations, including holding reserves of oil or refined petroleum  products equaling 90 days of net petroleum imports, and to release these  reserves, utilize demand restraint measures, increase surge production,  or utilize fuel switching during an IEA collective action in response to oil  supply disruptions. In September 2014, we found that changes including  increasing oil production, shrinking oil imports, and changing oil and fuel  distribution patterns have important implications for the SPR. In that  report, we concluded that changing market conditions have implications  for the size, location, and composition of the SPR, and recommended that  the Secretary of Energy undertake a comprehensive reexamination of the  appropriate size of the SPR. In addition, in 2015, Congress required the  Secretary of Energy to complete a long-range strategic review of the  SPR. DOE completed its review in August 2016 which reviewed the size,  composition, infrastructure needs, and distribution capability of the  reserve.", "My statement today is based primarily on preliminary observations from  ongoing work and focuses on (1) how DOE has used the SPR to address  domestic petroleum supply disruptions; (2) the extent to which the SPR is  able to respond to domestic petroleum supply disruptions; and (3) how  other IEA members have structured their strategic reserves and the  extent to which DOE has evaluated these structures.", "As part of our ongoing work, we reviewed reports and studies, including  by DOE, IEA, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and  interviewed DOE and IEA officials.

The SPR stores oil in underground salt caverns along the Gulf Coast in  Louisiana and Texas. DOE established an initial target capacity for the  SPR of 500 million barrels based on U.S. import levels and implemented  a phased approach to create large underground oil storage sites in salt  formations, to reach a physical storage capacity of 750 million barrels.  The SPR currently maintains four storage sites with a physical capacity of  713.5 million barrels.", "Three recent laws required sales of oil from the SPR to fund its  modernization and other national priorities. The Bipartisan Budget Act of  2015 provided for the drawdown and sale of 58 million barrels of oil from  fiscal years 2018 through 2025 and authorized the sale of up to $2 billion  worth of oil through fiscal year 2020 to be used for an SPR modernization  program. The Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act provided for  the drawdown and sale of 66 million barrels of oil from fiscal years 2023  through 2025. The 21st Century Cures Act provided for the drawdown  and sale of 25 million barrels from fiscal years 2017 through 2019. DOE  estimates that, as a result of these sales, the SPR will hold between 506  and 513 million barrels of oil by 2025. For member countries to meet net  petroleum import obligations, the IEA counts both public and private oil  reserves, although the United States meets its IEA obligation solely  through the SPR. As of July 2017, according to IEA data, the SPR held  the equivalent of 141 days of import protection and U.S. private oil held  the equivalent of an additional 216 days, for a total of about 356 days.

The distillate is stored in leased  commercial storage in terminals located in three states: Connecticut,  Massachusetts, and New Jersey.

Purchasers are responsible for making their own  arrangements for the transport of the SPR oil to its final destination. The  Secretary of Energy also is authorized to release petroleum products from  the SPR through an exchange for the purpose of acquiring oil for the  SPR. According to DOE officials, this authority is sometimes utilized in  oil supply disruptions when a specific volume of SPR oil is provided to a  private sector company in an emergency exchange for an equal quantity  of oil plus an additional amount as a premium to be returned to the SPR  in the future. According to DOE\u2019s website, emergency exchanges are  generally requested by a company after an event outside the control of  the company, such as a hurricane, disrupts commercial oil supplies.

At the time of the Arab oil embargo,  price controls in the United States prevented the prices of oil and  petroleum products from increasing as much as they otherwise might  have, contributing to a physical oil shortage that caused long lines at  gasoline stations throughout the United States. Now that the oil  market is global, the price of oil is determined in the world market,  primarily on the basis of supply and demand. In the absence of price  controls, scarcity is generally expressed in the form of higher prices,  as purchasers are free to bid as high as they want to secure oil  supply. In a global market, an oil supply disruption anywhere in the  world raises prices everywhere. Releasing oil reserves during a  disruption provides a global benefit by reducing oil prices in the world  market.", "Increases in domestic oil production. Reversing a decades-long  decline, U.S. oil production has generally increased in recent years.  According to EIA data, U.S. production of oil reached its highest level  in 1970 and generally declined through 2008, reaching a level of  almost one-half of its peak. During this time, the United States  increasingly relied on imported oil to meet growing domestic energy  needs. However, recent improvements in technologies have allowed  producers to extract oil from shale formations that were previously  considered to be inaccessible because traditional techniques did not  yield sufficient amounts for economically viable production. In  particular, the application of horizontal drilling techniques and  hydraulic fracturing\u2014a process that injects a combination of water,  sand, and chemical additives under high pressure to create and  maintain fractures in underground rock formations that allow oil and  natural gas to flow\u2014have increased U.S. oil and natural gas  production.", "Declines in net petroleum imports. One measure of the economy\u2019s  vulnerability to oil supply disruptions is to assess net petroleum  imports\u2014that is, imports minus exports. Net petroleum imports have  declined by over 60 percent from a peak of about 12.5 million barrels  per day in 2005 to about 4.8 million barrels per day in 2016. In 2006,  net imports were expected to increase in the future, increasing the  country\u2019s reliance on foreign oil. However, imports have declined  since then and, according to EIA\u2019s most recent forecast, are expected  to remain well below 2005 import levels into the future. Canada and  Mexico are the nation\u2019s major foreign sources for imported oil.  Furthermore, the United States has increased its exports of oil and  refined petroleum products."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOE Has Primarily Used Exchanges from the SPR to Private Companies to Address Domestic Petroleum Disruptions", "paragraphs": ["To quantify how DOE has used the SPR to address domestic petroleum  supply disruptions, we reviewed DOE and EIA documents.

DOE has released oil 24  times from 1985 through September 2017, including 11 releases in  response to domestic supply disruptions. Of these 11 releases, 10 were  exchanges, including 6 exchanges in response to hurricanes. One of the  11 releases was an SPR sale in response to Hurricane Katrina, which  was part of an IEA coordinated action release. Historic releases from the  SPR are shown in figure 1.", "Our preliminary analysis also indicates that the six exchanges from DOE  to U.S. refineries in response to hurricanes totaled about 28 million  barrels.", "Based on our preliminary analysis of DOE documents, most recently,  in response to Hurricane Harvey in 2017, DOE exchanged 5 million  barrels of oil to Gulf Coast refineries that requested supplies. Refinery  operations largely depend on a supply of oil and feedstocks.  Hurricane Harvey closed or restricted ports through which 2 million  barrels of oil per day were imported, and several refineries had no  supply options except for SPR oil. According to DOE officials,  exchanges from the SPR have allowed refineries to continue to  operate until alternative supply sources became available, ensuring  continued production of refined petroleum products for use by  consumers.", "Based on our preliminary analysis of DOE documents, DOE\u2019s most  significant response to a hurricane was in 2005 following Hurricane  Katrina. As we reported in January 2014, oil platforms were  evacuated and damaged, virtually shutting down all oil production in  the Gulf region as a result of the hurricane. Based on our  preliminary analysis of DOE documents, exchanges from the SPR,  totaling 9.8 million barrels of oil, helped refineries offset this short-term  physical supply disruption at the beginning of the supply chain,  thereby helping to moderate the impact of the production shutdown on  U.S. oil supplies. In addition to these exchanges, DOE also  participated in an IEA collective action that was called in response to  Hurricane Katrina by selling 11 million barrels of oil from the SPR, and  IEA member countries delivered and sold much needed gasoline and  other products to the United States. In total, DOE sold or exchanged  20.8 million barrels of oil from the SPR.", "Our preliminary analysis of DOE documents and reports also showed that  although almost all of DOE\u2019s releases in response to domestic supply  disruptions have been from the SPR, DOE also used the Northeast Home  Heating Oil Reserve in response to Superstorm Sandy in 2012.

First, as we reported in September 2014, reserves are  almost entirely composed of oil and not refined products, which may not  be effective in responding to all disruptions that affect the refining  sector. Second, as we reported in September 2014, reserves are nearly  entirely located in one region, the Gulf Coast, which may limit  responsiveness to disruptions in other regions. Third, during the course of  our ongoing work, we reviewed DOE and energy task force reports that  found that the statutory authorities governing SPR releases may inhibit  their use for regional disruptions.", "Composition: As we reported in September 2014, the SPR is almost  entirely composed of oil, which may not be effective in responding to  all disruptions that affect the refining sector. In September 2014, we  reported that many recent economic risks associated with supply  disruptions have originated from the refining and distribution sectors,  which provide refined products, such as gasoline, rather than from  shortages of oil. Oil reserves are of limited use in such instances.  We reported in May 2009 that following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita,  nearly 30 percent of U.S. refining capacity was shut down for weeks,  disrupting supplies of gasoline and other products. The SPR could  not mitigate the effects of disrupted supplies because it holds oil. As  of September 2017, over 99 percent of the SPR and its Northeast  Gasoline Supply Reserve component (about 674 of 675 million  barrels) is held as oil rather than as refined products, such as gasoline  and diesel. Moreover, Gulf Coast hurricanes severely impacted  refinery operations, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Hurricane Ike  and Hurricane Gustav in 2008, and Hurricane Harvey this year.  According to DOE officials, oil reserves are not able to mitigate the  potential effects of large-scale Gulf Coast refinery outages that may  impact refined product deliveries.", "Location: As we reported in September 2014, the SPR is nearly  entirely located in one region, the Gulf Coast, which may limit its  ability to respond to disruptions in other regions. In the Gulf Coast,  the SPR is located close to a major refining center as well as to  distribution points for tankers, barges, and pipelines that can carry oil  from it to refineries in other regions of the country. Most of the system  of oil pipelines in the United States was constructed in the 1950s,  1960s, and 1970s to accommodate the needs of the refining sector  and demand centers at the time. Given the SPR\u2019s current location in  the Gulf Coast, transporting oil from the reserve may impact  commercial distribution of oil. Based on our ongoing work, according  to DOE\u2019s 2016 long-term strategic review of the SPR, the agency  reported that the expanding North American oil production and the  resulting shifts in how oil is transported around the country have  reduced the SPR\u2019s ability to add incremental barrels of oil to the  market under certain scenarios in the event of an oil supply crisis.  This means that while the SPR remains connected to physical assets  that could bring oil to the market, in many cases, forcing SPR oil into  the distribution system would result in an offsetting reduction in  domestic commercial oil flows. As we reported in September 2014, it  may be more difficult to move oil from the SPR to refineries in certain  regions of the United States. For example, since no pipelines connect  the SPR to the West Coast, supplies of petroleum products and oil  must be shipped by pipeline, truck, or barge from other domestic  regions or by tanker from foreign countries. Such modes of transport  are slower and more costly than via pipelines. For example, it can  take about 2 weeks for a vessel to travel from the Gulf Coast to Los  Angeles\u2014including transit time through the Panama Canal.", "Statutory release authorities: In the course of our ongoing work, we  reviewed DOE and energy task force reports that found that the  statutory authorities governing SPR releases may inhibit their use for  regional disruptions. DOE is authorized to release petroleum distillate  (fuel) from the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve upon a finding by  the President of a severe energy supply interruption that includes a  dislocation in the heating oil market or other regional supply  shortage. On the other hand, because the Northeast Gasoline  Supply Reserve is a part of the SPR, DOE can release gasoline from  that reserve only after the President makes the statutorily required  findings for release from the SPR, which do not explicitly include the  existence of a regional supply shortage. According to DOE\u2019s 2016  long-term strategic review of the SPR, a regional product reserve is  meant to address regional supply shortages, whereas the SPR of  which the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve is a part of, is meant to  address severe energy supply interruptions that have a national  impact. As a result, according to DOE\u2019s 2016 long-term strategic  review of the SPR, in practice, this means that the release of the  gasoline reserve would have to have a national impact. The  Quadrennial Energy Review of 2015 recommended that Congress  integrate the authorities of the President to release products from the  regional product reserves\u2014the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve  and Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve\u2014into a single, unified  authority by amending the trigger for the release of fuel from the two  refined product reserves so that they are aligned and properly suited  to the purpose of a product reserve, as opposed to an oil reserve.", "As discussed, based on our preliminary observations, DOE has used the  SPR in response to domestic supply disruptions, but the effectiveness of  these releases is unclear because DOE has not formally assessed all of  them. DOE has exchanged about 28 million barrels of oil in response to  hurricanes, but we found only two reports assessing DOE\u2019s response to  Hurricanes Gustav, Ike, Katrina, and Rita, and it is unclear whether DOE  has examined other responses. According to a 2006 DOE Inspector  General report, DOE used the SPR and its assets with great  effectiveness to address emergency energy needs in the crises  surrounding Hurricanes Katrina and Rita,  but the concentration of SPR  sites along the Gulf Coast meant the United States also had to rely on  refined petroleum products from Europe. The report noted that despite  being in the path of the hurricanes\u2019 destruction, the SPR promptly fulfilled  requests for oil from refineries suffering from storm-related supply  shortages. However, the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina  demonstrated that the concentration of refineries on the Gulf Coast and  resulting damage to pipelines left the United States to rely on imports of  refined petroleum products from Europe, as part of an IEA collective  response. Consequently, regions experienced a shortage of gasoline, and  prices rose. DOE testified in 2009 that despite a response from the SPR  and IEA, some markets south of Virginia and north of Florida could not be  immediately supplied with refined products due to a lack of infrastructure  to receive and distribute imports from the Atlantic coast to inland  population centers. Exchanges with multiple refiners totaling 5.4 million  barrels of SPR oil were authorized to Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008.  DOE assessed this response and submitted a report to Congress in  2009. According to DOE\u2019s 2009 report, the exchanges conducted in  September and October 2008 were successful in providing emergency  petroleum supplies to refiners experiencing shortages caused by  Hurricanes Gustav and Ike.", "As we reported in May 2009, as originally enacted, EPCA envisioned the  possibility that the SPR would include a variety of petroleum products  stored at locations across the country. In a 2009 hearing, the then  Deputy Assistant Secretary for Petroleum Reserves testified that DOE still  considers a large SPR focused on oil storage to be the best way to  protect the nation from the negative impacts of a short-term international  interruption to U.S. oil imports; however, the hurricanes of 2005 and 2008  showed that the SPR may be limited in its ability to address some short- term interruptions to domestic refined products supply and distribution  infrastructure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other IEA Members Structure Their Reserves Differently, with Some Holding Industry Reserves and Refined Products, and DOE Has Taken Steps to Explore These Structures", "paragraphs": ["Based on information reviewed during the course of our ongoing work, to  respond to disruptions, 27 of the 29 IEA member countries use one of five  reserve structures, also known as stockholding structures, in which these  countries hold public reserves, industry reserves, or a combination of  these. The five structures are shown in figure 2. Also, most members  hold refined petroleum products, with many members holding at least a  third of their reserves in refined petroleum products. Some members hold  their refined petroleum products in different regions across their country  to respond to disruptions.", "Based on our preliminary analysis of information on the 29 IEA member  countries, 18 place a stockholding obligation on industry either exclusively  or in part to meet their total emergency reserve needs. Most of these  countries distribute the stockholding obligation in proportion to  companies\u2019 share of oil imports or of sales in the domestic market.  However, several member countries instead impose a higher obligation  on refineries because of their high amount of operating oil.", "According to a 2014 IEA report, most IEA members hold some amount  of refined petroleum products, and a European Union (EU) directive  generally requires EU members to ensure that at least one-third of their  stockholding obligation is held in the form of refined petroleum products.  For example, according to the IEA\u2019s website, Germany\u2019s stockholding  agency, Erdolbevorratungsverband (EBV), holds 55 percent of its reserve  in refined petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and light  heating oil. In contrast, the United States holds almost all of its reserves  in oil rather than refined petroleum products.", "Some IEA member countries geographically disperse their reserves of  refined petroleum products to be able to respond to domestic disruptions.  For example, according to the IEA\u2019s website, to maintain a wide  geographical distribution of emergency reserves, the French stockholding  agency stores refined petroleum products in each of its seven geographic  zones. Moreover, according to the IEA\u2019s website, France\u2019s agency  stores petroleum product reserves in each zone; reserves in each zone  should represent specified amounts based on consumption in order to  respond to emergencies. During a labor strike in December 2013,  France used its emergency reserves to supply local gas stations when  delivery of fuel was impeded for a prolonged period of time, according to  a French document. In another example, the IEA reported that Germany  holds petroleum product reserves in several regions in the country and  that the reserves are to be distributed throughout Germany, so that a  minimum reserve equivalent to a 15-day supply is maintained in each of  five designated supply areas. The rationale for this is to prevent  logistical bottlenecks that could occur if all emergency reserves were  stored centrally, according to a 2014 IEA report.", "Based on our preliminary observations, DOE has taken some steps to  evaluate different structures for holding reserves. However, the agency  has not formally evaluated other countries\u2019 structures in over 35 years  and has not finalized its 2015 studies on regional petroleum product  reserves. According to DOE officials, the agency explored the feasibility  of adopting the industry structure shortly after creating the SPR and  concluded that this and other structures were not feasible in the United  States. In 1980, DOE studied the feasibility of adopting the agency  structure, which is the most similar to the SPR since the only major  difference is how the reserve is funded, according to DOE officials.  According to IEA documents, in the agency structure, generally the  reserve is funded by a tax or levy on products or industry, which is  passed down to the consumer. In contrast, the SPR is funded through  congressional appropriations. However, DOE officials we interviewed  cautioned that the agency has not reassessed its findings from 35 years  ago. As mentioned above, in 2016 DOE reassessed the SPR in light of  the changing global oil market, but this assessment did not include a  review of other IEA countries\u2019 structures.", "Our preliminary review indicates that DOE examined the feasibility of  additional regional petroleum product reserves in two 2015 studies, but it  did not finalize these studies or expand the SPR to include additional  reserves. In September 2014, we reported that DOE officials told us they  were conducting a regional fuel resiliency study that would provide  insights into whether there is a need for additional regional product  reserves and, if so, where these reserves should be located. The  Quadrennial Energy Review of 2015 recommended that the agency  analyze the need for additional or expanded regional product reserves by  undertaking updated cost-benefit analyses for all of the regions of the  United States that have been identified as vulnerable to fuel supply  disruptions. Figure 3 illustrates vulnerabilities that DOE identified in 2014.", "In response to the 2015 recommendation, DOE contractors studied the  feasibility of additional regional petroleum product reserves, as part of the  SPR, in the U.S. Southeast and West Coast regions to address supply  vulnerabilities from hurricanes and earthquakes, respectively. According  to DOE officials, weather events in the Southeast are of higher probability  but lower consequence, and events in the West Coast are of lower  probability but higher consequence. DOE did not finalize its 2015 studies  on regional petroleum product reserves and make them publicly available.", "According to DOE officials, because consensus could not be reached  within the Administration on several issues associated with the refined  product reserve studies, these studies were not included as part of DOE\u2019s  2016 long-term strategic review of the SPR. Our ongoing work indicates  that DOE\u2019s 2016 long-term strategic review of the SPR did not account for  the risks of domestic supply disruptions as a factor in determining the  appropriate size, location, and composition of the SPR. Prior to the two  2015 studies, in 2011, DOE carried out a cost-benefit study of the  establishment of a refined product reserve in the Southeast and  estimated that such a reserve would reduce the average gasoline price  rise by 50 percent to 70 percent in the weeks immediately after a  hurricane landfall, resulting in consumer cost savings, according to the  Quadrennial Energy Review of 2015.", "In closing, I note that we are continuing our ongoing work examining  issues that may help inform future considerations for the SPR. Given the  constrained budget environment and the evolving nature of energy  markets and their vulnerabilities, it is important that DOE ensures the  SPR is an efficient and effective use of federal resources. We look  forward to continuing our work to determine whether additional DOE  actions may be warranted to promote this objective.", "Chairman Upton, Ranking Member Rush, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
