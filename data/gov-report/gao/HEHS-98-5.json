Through 401(k) plans, workers can affect their retirement savings, depending on the contribution level they choose and the investment decisions they make. Most 401(k) pension plans also allow participants to borrow against their pension accounts at relatively low interest rates. Pension-plan borrowing is not limited to 401(k) plans. For example, to encourage saving in individual retirement accounts (IRA), recent legislation allows early withdrawal from these accounts for certain purposes, such as for a first-time home purchase.", "Proponents of pension-plan borrowing argue that allowing such access to retirement savings before retirement increases participation in pension plans where participation is voluntary. They also argue that pension-plan borrowing increases contributions to plans where participants determine their contribution levels. However, critics argue that pension-plan borrowing often results in lower pension income at retirement. In addition, opponents to the creation of individual Social Security accounts fear that if borrowing from such accounts were allowed, Social Security income could be jeopardized.", "Given the importance of pension-plan borrowing and possible implications for Social Security reform and individual retirement accounts (IRA), you asked us to (1) determine the effects of pension-plan borrowing on participation in and contributions to 401(k) pension plans, (2) describe the demographic and economic characteristics of workers who borrow from their pension accounts, and (3) identify the potential consequences for participants who borrow from their pension accounts.", "To conduct our work, we analyzed two databases. The first is a nationally representative sample containing detailed demographic and employment information about American workers in 1992; the second contains pension plan information for plans with 100 or more participants in 1992. These data were the most recent available at the start of our study, and we have no reason to believe that worker characteristics have significantly changed. We also reviewed the economic and pension literature and solicited comments from outside pension analysts. We did our work between October 1996 and August 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Many participants\u2019 defined-contribution plans supplement another pension plan.", "A 401(k) pension, or salary-reduction, plan is a defined-contribution plan that allows participants to contribute, before taxes, a portion of their salary to a qualified retirement account. Investment income earned on 401(k) account balances accumulates tax-free until the individual withdraws the funds at retirement. However, participation in 401(k) is voluntary, and contribution levels are determined by the individual but can be no larger than $9,500 per year.", "About 85 percent of 401(k) pension plans are the only pension plan sponsored by the employer, although the majority of 401(k) plan participants are covered by another pension plan. A recent study of selected 401(k) plans shows that worker participation rates for these plans varies from about 50 percent to over 90 percent. Participant contributions to 401(k) accounts, on average, are about 7 percent of earnings. To encourage participation in and contributions to these pension plans, plan sponsors may wholly or partially match employee contributions and provide education on the importance of retirement saving. In addition, over half of all 401(k) pension plans allow participants to borrow from their pension accounts.", "Borrowing from 401(k) pension plans is legally permissible and allows plan participants to borrow the lesser of $50,000 or one half of their vested account balance. The term of the loan cannot exceed 5 years, unless the loan is used to purchase a primary home. Furthermore, the loans are generally offered at very favorable interest rates. A recent survey of 401(k) plans found that about 70 percent of the plans that allow borrowing charge an interest rate equal to or less than the prime rate plus one percentage point, while less than 10 percent charge an interest rate equal to the local bank\u2019s lending rate. The repayment of loan principal and, unless the primary residence is used to secure the loan, interest payments are not tax-deductible. Failure to repay the loan results in the outstanding loan balance being considered a taxable pension distribution. The borrower is then responsible for paying all taxes on the distribution plus a 10-percent early withdrawal penalty if the borrower is under 59-1/2 years old.", "Overall, about half of all firms with 100 or more employees that offer savings and thrift plans permit participant loans. Previously, GAO reported that 57 percent of the firms with 100 to 499 employees that offer a 401(k) plan permit participant loans. Similarly, 80 percent of firms with 500 to 4,999 employees and 46 percent of firms with 5,000 or more employees permit loans against 401(k) accounts. In addition, over 95 percent of 401(k) plans that offer loans have at least one plan participant with an outstanding loan.", "Pension-plan loan provisions, however, are controversial. Advocates argue that loan provisions are an incentive to lower-income workers to participate in pension plans where participation is voluntary. Furthermore, many 401(k) plan administrators think loan provisions also have a somewhat positive impact on participants\u2019 contribution rates to pension accounts. A survey conducted by the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI) suggests that most workers think that participants should be able to withdraw retirement funds to pay for financial emergencies, to buy a house, or to pay for a child\u2019s education. Workers may be more willing to save for retirement if they can have access to their savings for emergencies before retirement.", "Opponents of loan provisions argue that permitting participants to borrow from their retirement accounts works against the policy objective of enhancing retirement income. Almost half of the companies that do not permit 401(k) loans surveyed by William M. Mercer say that loan programs are contrary to plan philosophy. Almost 60 percent of employed respondents to a recent EBRI survey think about using their own retirement funds only at the time of retirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Loan Provisions, Among Other Factors, Encourage Participation in and Larger Contributions to 401(k) Plans", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of the two databases on worker characteristics and pension-account activity shows that pension-plan borrowing increases participation in 401(k) plans (see app. II). However, a number of other factors, such as employer matching and size of firm, also influence participation and contribution amounts.", "Participation rates in plans with loan provisions are about 6 percentage points higher than plans with no loan provisions (see fig. 1). Employer matching also increases participation rates by about 20 percentage points depending on the match rate. These findings are consistent with the results of other research. Under the typical situation\u2014where the employer contributes about half of what participants contribute\u2014borrowing provisions plus employer matching increases participation by about 28 percentage points\u2014from 55 percent to 83 percent.", "Our analysis also indicates that smaller firms tend to have slightly higher participation rates than larger firms. This may be due to smaller firms more effectively targeting benefits to employee needs. In addition, a recent study found that the type and quality of information provided to employees on 401(k) plans may also be an important factor in encouraging employee participation in 401(k) pension plans. The impact of providing high-quality information appears to be greatest on workers with lower earnings.", "In our analysis of 401(k) plans, we also found that average annual employee contribution amounts are 35 percent higher in 401(k) plans with loan provisions than in 401(k) plans with no loan provisions. Employer matching also increases average contribution amounts in 401(k) plans but not to the same extent as loan provisions. Depending on the employer match rate, we estimate that average annual employee contribution amounts are typically 10- to 24-percent higher than with no employer matching. The effect of both loan provisions and employer matching can be dramatic\u2014an increase in average contribution amounts of over $600 per year (see fig. 2). Furthermore, one study suggests that providing high-quality pension-plan information to plan participants may also increase contribution levels to 401(k) plans.", "These results are further corroborated when we examined individual participant contributions to 401(k) pension accounts. We estimate that a typical 401(k) participant covered by a pension with loan provisions and receiving an average employer match rate will contribute a higher proportion of earnings to his or her 401(k) account than an identical participant covered by a plan with no loan provision or employer matching\u20148.6 percent versus 4.9 percent (see fig. 3)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Borrowers May Be Less Economically Secure Than Nonborrowers", "paragraphs": ["Plan participants with no outstanding plan loans are in a better financial position than borrowers.

The total net worth and nonhousing net worth of borrowers is also considerably lower than that of nonborrowers. In addition, retirement-account borrowers have about $1,500 more in nonhousing debt and have much higher nonhousing-debt-to-income ratios than nonborrowers.", "Nevertheless, our analysis indicates that 401(k) plan participants who also are covered by another pension plan are 50-percent more likely to have an outstanding loan than other participants (see app. II). Those with only a 401(k) pension plan\u2014and, thus, with the most to lose by borrowing from their pension accounts\u2014are less likely to do so. But participants who have recently been turned down for a loan from another source are almost 40-percent more likely to borrow against their pension account than other plan participants, holding all else equal.", "Black and Hispanic pension-plan participants are almost twice as likely as white participants to borrow against their pension account (see app. II), after controlling for income and assets. Minorities may have more difficulties obtaining commercial loans, including mortgages. Our results also indicate that other characteristics of an individual, such as age, gender, and marital status, do not significantly affect pension-plan borrowing.", "Pension-plan borrowers may use their pension-plan loan for living expenses, an automobile purchase, or housing (rather than borrowing from a commercial source to finance a home purchase), all of which could be considered necessities. A smaller proportion of pension-plan borrowers report having housing debt than nonborrowers, but a larger proportion report having education loans (see table 2).", "Attitudes toward borrowing money also differ between plan borrowers and nonborrowers. A larger proportion of plan borrowers think it is all right to borrow to finance an automobile, but a slightly smaller proportion think it is all right to borrow to finance education expenses. Almost half of the plan borrowers say it is all right to borrow money to cover living expenses compared to about a third of nonborrowers. Less than 10 percent of each group think it is all right to borrow to finance luxury goods, such as jewelry, and less than 10 percent of plan borrowers think it is all right to borrow to cover the expenses of a vacation.

Under reasonable assumptions about pension-plan savings and borrowing behavior, a borrower could have 2- to 28-percent less pension income at retirement (see app. II). Many 401(k) participants have a substantial amount of their pension balances invested in the stock market and earn a relatively high rate of return. Pension-plan loans, however, generally have a favorable interest rate, which may be much lower than the return on the pension-account investments. Consequently, a borrower may earn less on the loan balance because he or she is making interest payments to the account at the relatively low interest rate rather than earning higher returns from investments, such as equities.", "How much pension income is lost depends on the size of the loan, the interest rate of the loan, the rate of return of pension account investments, and whether or not the borrower continues to make pension contributions while repaying the loan. For example, if a borrower decides to forgo making pension-plan contributions during loan repayment, he or she could have over 20-percent less retirement income.

Saving for retirement receives favorable tax treatment, but in the past, it was at the cost of being virtually inaccessible until late in life.

Allowing participants to borrow against their 401(k) pension accounts for reasons unrelated to retirement can increase both participation in these plans and participant contributions. However, pension-plan borrowing is a two-edged sword: Individuals who were prompted to participate because of the borrowing provision increase their retirement savings, but individuals who opt to borrow lose some of the tax advantages to retirement savings and risk having less income at retirement.", "Our findings have implications for other sources of retirement income. Since participation in IRAs is voluntary, our results suggest that early access to IRA funds may increase both participation in and contributions to these accounts but at the risk of lower retirement income. On the other hand, individual Social Security accounts\u2014if created\u2014would require participation, and contribution levels would be set by law.

Given that about 7.6 percent of plan participants have outstanding loans, then blacks are about 5.8/7.6 times 100\u2014or 76 percent\u2014more likely to have an outstanding pension-plan loan than whites.", "Parameter estimate (standard error) \u20130.2854 (0.1550)", "Age 35 to 44 years (0.1920)", "Age 45 to 54 years (0.2184)", "Age 55 to 64 years \u20130.1426 (0.3006) (0.1976)", "Dropped out of school before the 12th grade (0.3921)", "1 to 4 years of college; no degree (0.2291)", "4 or more years of college; college degree 0.7249(0.2127) 1.1337(0.2068) 1.7382(0.2934)", "Covered by another pension plan 0.7651(0.1515)", "Recently turned down for loan 0.5829(0.1855)", "Family income $25,000 to $34,999 per year (0.2937)", "Family income $35,000 to $44,999 per year (0.2975)", "Family income $45,000 to $59,999 per year \u20130.3429 (0.3128) (continued)", "Parameter estimate (standard error)", "Family income $60,000 to $74,999 per year \u20130.4968 (0.3411)", "Family income $75,000 or more per year \u20131.0754(0.3522)", "Natural logarithm of number of years covered by this defined-contribution plan 0.2608(0.0900)", "Family net worth $50,001 to $100,000 \u20130.9459(0.2722)", "Family net worth $100,001 to $250,000 \u20130.0553 (0.2251)", "Family net worth $250,001 to $1,000,000 \u20130.3286 (0.2913)", "Family net worth over $1,000,000 \u20130.1263 (0.3226)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consequences of Borrowing From Retirement Accounts", "paragraphs": ["Our simulation results are presented in table II.5 and show the pension account balance after 35 years for each scenario. The results show that as long as the interest rate of the loan is less than the rate of return of the pension account balance (assumed to be 11 percent), borrowers will have a lower account balance at retirement. The actual reduction depends on the gap between the account rate of return and the loan interest rate, and whether or not pension contributions continue during the loan repayment period.
