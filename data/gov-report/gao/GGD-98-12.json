Employees who accept buyouts are not prohibited from later returning directly to federal employment or working under contract for the government. However, under a provision of the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act (FWRA), unless a waiver is granted, buyout recipients generally must repay the buyout if they return to federal employment or if they are employed under a personal services contract within 5 years of their separation.", "During the period we reviewed, January 1993 through June 1995, two different buyout rules were in effect for the Department of Defense (DOD). From January 1993 to March 29, 1994, DOD employees could receive buyouts, and these buyout recipients were not required to repay the buyouts if they returned to federal employment. However, DOD\u2019s policy during this period was that it would not rehire its buyout recipients until 1 year after their separation. As of March 30, 1994, under the FWRA, employees from DOD as well as other federal agencies could receive buyouts, but the buyout recipients generally had to repay the buyout if they returned directly to federal employment within 5 years of their separation.", "In an October 1996 letter to you on compliance with reemployment requirements, we reported that there were 23 cases of buyout recipients (1) who appeared to have violated the FWRA repayment provision or the DOD reemployment policy or (2) about whom we could not determine whether they had returned to federal employment because of inconsistent source data.", "As agreed with your office, this report provides information on (1) whether the 23 buyout recipients returned to federal employment and, if so, whether they repaid the buyout or met the DOD reemployment policy and (2) whether the 9 agencies that were identified as employing these 23 buyout recipients and other selected agencies, which may have buyout recipients under contract, had internal control procedures in place to help ensure that buyout recipients repay buyouts when required to do so."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 1992, DOD was the first federal agency authorized to offer buyouts to its employees, and it has been using buyouts since January 1993 to reduce the size of its workforce. On March 30, 1994, the FWRA authorized buyouts for other executive agencies and amended DOD\u2019s authority. For both DOD and other executive agencies, employees generally were offered a buyout payment that was the lesser of $25,000 or their severance pay entitlement. According to OPM, in fiscal year 1996, $24,833 was the average buyout amount for regular optional retirements; $24,949 was the average for early retirements; and $14,499 was the average for resignations.", "The legislation granting DOD its initial buyout authority in 1992 did not impose any buyout-related conditions or repayment provision on buyout recipients who were reemployed by the federal government. However, DOD\u2019s policy was that it would not rehire DOD buyout recipients within 1 year of their separation, unless an exception was approved by a high-level DOD official.", "In 1994, the FWRA required buyout recipients from federal agencies that were under the act\u2019s authority, including DOD, to repay their buyouts if they returned to federal employment within 5 years of their separation. DOD buyout recipients had to repay their buyouts if they were reemployed as civil servants, but not if they were reemployed under personal services contracts. Non-DOD buyout recipients had to repay their buyouts if they returned directly to federal employment or if they were employed under a contract that was expressly identified or administered as a personal services contract. Also, under the FWRA, buyout recipients who were obligated to repay their buyouts could do so after an agency hired them. However, the agency rehiring the buyout recipient could seek a repayment provision waiver for the employee from OPM, in certain situations.", "Under new buyout authority enacted in 1996, the repayment provision was changed. Among other things, employees who accept buyouts under the 1996 authority must repay the entire buyout before their first day of federal reemployment, and there is no authority for waivers. Congress also passed other laws providing specific statutory authority for repaying buyouts for employees in selected agencies. The agency-specific buyout authorizations generally require that recipients repay their buyouts if they rejoin the federal workforce. In addition, under the time frames of the current buyout laws, agencies will need to verify buyout recipients\u2019 compliance with repayment provisions through 2006.

However, according to CPDF data as of September 1996, the number of employees who had accepted buyouts grew to 128,467, or an additional 40,724 employees.

We asked the OIGs whether the buyout recipients had returned to federal employment and, if so, whether they had repaid the buyout or met DOD\u2019s reemployment policy. We limited the scope of our work to the buyout recipients who were reemployed as federal employees between January 1993 and June 1995.", "Among other things, our letters to the OIGs identified the buyout recipients by name and social security number and asked specific questions concerning their reemployment. We asked the OIGs to review the 23 buyout recipient cases, provide us with information concerning the clarification of conflicting data and apparent violations, and take any needed action, as appropriate. In cooperation with the OIG offices, we contacted selected federal agencies\u2019 personnel officials about the status of some cases. We also followed up with the OIGs and agency personnel officials by providing them with additional information, such as detailed case information and OPM documentation.", "To determine if the 9 federal agencies that were identified in the CPDF data as employing the 23 buyout recipients had internal control procedures in place to provide a reasonable assurance of compliance with buyout reemployment requirements, we asked the agencies to provide us with copies of these procedures. Specifically, we asked the agencies for copies of their internal control procedures on the reemployment of buyout recipients either as members of the civil service or as personal services contract employees.", "To determine whether other selected agencies had internal control procedures for the reemployment of buyout recipients under personal services contracts, we first had to decide which agencies to select for the review. To do so, we reviewed OPM\u2019s August 1996 interim report to Congress on the reemployment of buyout recipients. In that report, OPM said that none of the agencies in its review reported cases involving buyout recipients\u2019 returning to work under personal services contracts, but that several agencies reported having completed or having begun reviews and follow-ups of their contracting arrangements.", "In its report, OPM identified DOD and DOT as having conducted reviews of their contracting arrangements and GSA as having a review under way. DOD reported to OPM that it had not reemployed any buyout recipients under personal services contracts. However, OPM asked DOD to provide an updated report because DOD had looked only at DOD buyout recipients and not recipients from other agencies. As a result, we excluded DOD from our review of this matter. We decided to review the OIG audit reports of DOTand GSA to (1) gain an understanding of the experiences agencies have had with buyout recipients\u2019 being hired under personal services contracts and (2) learn what kind of internal control procedures may be applicable.", "Because governmentwide data on buyout recipients hired under personal services contracts do not exist and because of time constraints, we limited the part of our review concerning internal controls for personal services contracts to the agencies that had the two OIG audits. We also obtained OPM\u2019s 1994 and 1996 written guidance as well as OPM\u2019s list of possible options that agencies could take to help ensure compliance with the buyout repayment provision, and we discussed this guidance with OPM officials.", "We did our review in Washington, D.C., from October 1996 to October 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We provided a draft of this report to the Director of OPM and to the heads of the 9 agencies identified as employing the 23 buyout recipients in our review and requested their comments.

Also, one additional case of reemployment of a buyout recipient without repayment was found by the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) OIG while researching the case about which we asked. In addition, OPM found FWRA repayment provision violations in two other research efforts it undertook, but it is unclear whether these violations are in addition to the violations that we found."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selected Agencies Found Nine Cases Violated the Repayment Provision, and Two Cases Violated DOD\u2019s Reemployment Policy", "paragraphs": ["The 9 federal agencies identified in the CPDF data as employing the 23 buyout recipients provided information showing that a violation of FWRA\u2019s repayment provision or DOD\u2019s policy had occurred in 11 of the 23 cases. (See app. II for the employment status of the 23 buyout recipient cases, by federal agency.) The agencies reported that in 9 of the 11 cases, FWRA\u2019s repayment provision was violated. These agencies also reported that they hired the nine buyout recipients without seeking repayment of the buyout. The remaining two cases were violations of DOD\u2019s reemployment policy, which did not require buyout repayment.", "After determining that a violation had occurred, the agencies varied in how they responded. In general, they based their actions on whether they still employed the buyout recipient. For example, of the nine cases with violations of FWRA\u2019s repayment provision, six cases involved individuals who were still employed, and the hiring agencies arranged for the buyout recipients to make repayments. In the three cases where the buyout recipients were no longer in their employ, the hiring agencies billed the recipient in one case, and took no action in the other two cases.Although the agencies did not seek repayment in these two cases, the law requires that if a buyout recipient accepts reemployment within 5 years of the separation, he or she is required to repay the buyout unless a waiver is granted by OPM. Therefore, if a buyout recipient is reemployed without repaying the buyout, the hiring agency is to seek recovery of the debt. The hiring agency has this obligation even though any money it recovers must go to the agency that originally paid the buyout, which may not be the agency rehiring the buyout recipient. OPM has instructed agencies that when a buyout recipient is reemployed by another agency, the two agencies should coordinate efforts to collect the buyout amount.", "In the two cases that violated DOD\u2019s reemployment policy, DOD\u2019s OIG reported that the Department had rehired both buyout recipients in violation of its policy not to rehire such individuals within 1 year of their separation unless a high-level DOD official grants an exception. DOD subsequently waived its policy for one buyout recipient; the other recipient resigned. Both of the buyout recipients received their buyouts before FWRA was enacted; therefore, the repayment provision did not apply."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Found That the 12 Remaining Cases Involved Inaccurate Data", "paragraphs": ["Agency officials told us that 12 of the cases we identified were not repayment violations. In 6 of the 12 cases, the federal agencies said that they mistakenly had submitted inaccurate data to OPM\u2019s CPDF, which we used in our previous review to identify potential violators. The data that the agencies submitted to the CPDF showed that they had reemployed six buyout recipients. However, the agencies reported that, in a follow-up review of their records, they discovered that they had not reemployed these recipients. For example, DOD said that three buyout recipient cases it reported involved individuals who had retired after receiving the buyouts but that the recipients were identified in Department data as employees, even though they were never rehired. DOD explained that the positions the three individuals once held were part of a large transfer of positions within the Department and that an error was made in recording the transfer.", "For the remaining 6 of the 12 cases, the agency officials said that they had no record of ever employing the buyout recipients.

OPM\u2019s survey, which was conducted from March 30, 1994, through May 20, 1996, and included the heads of all of the cabinet-level agencies and most smaller independent agencies, reported that 46 of the 80 buyout recipients whom the agencies reemployed had possibly not repaid their buyouts. According to OPM\u2019s survey, 40 of the possible 46 violations were in Defense agencies (see app. IV for details), and the remaining 6 possible violations were in non-Defense agencies. OPM said that 34 of the 80 cases were in compliance with the FWRA repayment provision. Although 58 agencies responded to the survey, according to OPM, 10 agencies that had used buyouts did not respond in time for OPM to include them in the interim report.", "OPM also did a study of possible buyout recipients who may have been reemployed during March 30, 1994, through June 30, 1995. This study, which used CPDF data, found a possible 49 reemployed buyout recipients, 9 of whom had violated the FWRA\u2019s repayment provision. For the remaining 40 cases, OPM determined that 38 cases had complied with the provision, and that 2 cases needed further resolution.", "As of October 1997, OPM officials said that they were still verifying the number of possible buyout violations in both of its research efforts, and that there was no way to be certain of the differences between the number of reemployed buyout recipients identified under OPM\u2019s two research efforts or with our review. This uncertainty is because the OPM survey effort did not collect names and social security numbers, which could have been compared with the CPDF data in either OPM\u2019s effort or our review for verification. Our review and OPM\u2019s study both were based on CPDF data, and the time frame of OPM\u2019s study was encompassed in our review. However, the methodologies used to extract the data were not the same, which provided different results. For instance, although OPM\u2019s study confirmed 10 FWRA repayment provision violations and we confirmed 9, only 5 of the violations we confirmed were also confirmed by OPM; consequently, 5 of the violations OPM confirmed were not confirmed by our review."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected Agencies Lacked Adequate Internal Control Procedures to Help Ensure Compliance With the FWRA Repayment Provision", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies have an obligation to ensure that the FWRA repayment provision is met when buyout recipients are reemployed as civil servants, or when they work under contract expressly identified or administered as personal services contracts for the government.

Internal controls consist of policies and procedures used to provide reasonable assurance that (1) goals and objectives are met; (2) resources are adequately safeguarded, efficiently used, and reliably accounted for; and (3) laws and regulations are being followed. However, none of the 9 agencies that we asked to provide the status of the 23 buyout recipient cases had adequate internal control procedures in place to provide reasonable assurance that the FWRA repayment provision was met. This was the case despite OPM\u2019s 1994 and 1996 guidance to agencies on the FWRA repayment provision as well as OPM\u2019s list of options explaining steps agencies could take to identify returning buyout recipients, steps that OPM said were inexpensive to implement.", "In GSA and DOT, which entered into contracts involving buyout recipients, the OIGs reported that GSA and DOT\u2019s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) did not have adequate procedures to prevent violations of the FWRA repayment provision.

By having an applicant certify his or her buyout status in writing, the State Department would have documented evidence of the applicant\u2019s response to the question of receiving a buyout should a question arise after the applicant was hired. However, according to a State Department official, if an applicant indicated that he or she were a buyout recipient, the agency had no personnel procedures in place to ensure that the appropriate buyout repayment provision was satisfied. Such certification was not required by the other 8 agencies from which we requested information on the 23 buyout recipient cases.", "According to OPM, a fundamental step for agencies to help ensure compliance with the repayment provisions of the various buyout authorities is for the agencies to identify whether job applicants are former federal employees and, if so, whether they had received a buyout. OPM\u2019s instructional pamphlet for job applicants, which is entitled Applying for a Federal Job, states that individuals may apply for federal employment using either of two documents. Applicants may use a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or the Optional Application for Federal Employment - Optional Form 612,which asks individuals to provide information about their work history, including dates of employment, and to certify if they had ever been a civilian employee with the federal government. According to OPM, when applicants indicate on any of these applications for employment that they have prior federal service, hiring officials are to ask the applicant whether he or she received a buyout.", "Job applicants who submit r\u00e9sum\u00e9s are to provide the same information that is requested on the Optional Application For Employment\u2014that is, work history and whether they had ever been federal employees. Of course, federal agencies must depend on job applicants\u2019 truthfully reporting such information. However, the Optional Application For Employment and the instructional pamphlet for r\u00e9sum\u00e9s state that providing false information is grounds for not hiring the applicant, for firing the applicant after he or she is employed, and for imposing a fine or prison sentence on the applicant.", "In our discussions with OPM officials, they said that having job applicants complete a certification form, like the one developed by the State Department, would help agencies identify applicants who were buyout recipients. The officials explained that information on whether an applicant had received a buyout may not be readily available to the hiring agency. For example, the information may be in the individual\u2019s official personnel folder, which the hiring agency may not receive for several weeks, or in a computer system that is located at the agency that paid the buyout. In addition, such certification would assist agencies that were hiring individuals who had received buyouts from other agencies, especially those agencies that do not participate in the CPDF, such as those in the judicial and legislative branches of government. For agencies covered by 5 C.F.R. 7.2, it is mandatory that they provide OPM with personnel information for use in the CPDF, among other things, unless specifically exempted by statute.", "The need for hiring officials to readily know whether a job applicant is a former federal employee who took a buyout was made even more important by the enactment of the 1996 legislation.

The OIG said that a number of additional buyout recipients had already returned to work under various contracts, some of which were being administered as personal services contracts. The OIG explained that GSA staffing had decreased 21 percent overall from its 1993 level, which would require GSA program offices to reduce program services, contract out work to maintain workload, or do both.", "Increased contracting, according to the GSA OIG, heightens the risk of buyout recipients\u2019 returning under personal services contracts. However, the OIG did not believe that action should be taken against the 10 buyout recipients it found in violation because the OIG did not find that any of the instances appeared to be willful or deliberate attempts to circumvent the FWRA repayment provision. In fact, the OIG added, the buyout recipients took specific steps to try to comply with the FWRA, such as not performing the same functions, not working in their former offices, and not working as a contractor directly for the government. Although we did not attempt to determine whether any of the GSA contracts were, in effect, personal services contracts, if in fact they were, then the FWRA repayment provision would have been violated and the buyout debt would have to be recovered.", "The DOT and GSA OIG audits determined that violations of the FWRA repayment provision have occurred under agency contracts. However, the audits might have uncovered more violations if they had looked for all buyout recipients that were employed at the two agencies under service contracts and had not limited their search to their agency\u2019s buyout recipients.", "As illustrated by the DOT and GSA audits, violations of the FWRA repayment provision may occur not only under contracts expressly identified as personal services contracts but also in connection with contracts that are administered as personal services contracts. As previously mentioned, OPM provided optional guidance to agencies on ways to help ensure compliance with the buyout repayment provision, and some of these suggestions pertained specifically to contracting. In its guidance, OPM suggested that agencies issue their own guidance to personnel involved in the oversight and management of contracts (e.g., contracting officers) and have them monitor compliance with the buyout repayment provisions, require contractors to identify and certify that contract employees who have received buyouts are not working in violation of the law, and require periodic spot checks of contracting personnel to help ensure compliance.", "These OPM suggestions were also recommended to some extent by the DOT and GSA OIGs in their reports. For example, the DOT OIG recommended that (1) FAA identify all of its employees who took buyouts and returned to work for FAA as employees of contractors and (2) the circumstances of each case be evaluated to determine whether FAA and the employees who took buyouts complied with the FWRA. The GSA OIG said that GSA\u2019s policies and procedures for implementing the FWRA should be clarified, and that the clarification should include information explaining how a contract that is not intended to be a personal services contract can become one and what key actions to take if that happens. According to the GSA OIG, the clarified policies and procedures should be distributed to all employees who are scheduled to leave under the buyout program, all program managers, and all contracting officers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Our review found violations of the FWRA repayment provision and DOD\u2019s reemployment policy as well as a lack of internal controls to help prevent such violations. OPM\u2019s list of possible options that agencies could take to help ensure compliance with buyout repayment provisions generally was not implemented by the agencies we studied, even though OPM officials believe that doing so would not be costly to agencies. Because agency management is responsible for ensuring its compliance with laws and regulations, it is also responsible for establishing effective internal controls to avoid violations of such laws and regulations, including the FWRA repayment provision. Under the time frames of the current buyout laws, every federal agency will need to verify buyout recipients\u2019 compliance with repayment provisions of the various buyout authorities through 2006.", "According to OPM, a fundamental step for agencies to help ensure compliance with the repayment provisions of the various buyout authorities is for the agencies to identify whether job applicants are former federal employees and, if so, whether they had received a buyout. Identifying buyout recipients who work under contracts with the government that are not expressly identified as personal services contracts, but are administered as such, appears to be more difficult than identifying buyout recipients who return directly to federal service. In the cases of DOT and GSA, their OIGs found that the agencies\u2019 controls did not adequately identify contracts administered as personal services contracts. Thus, DOT and GSA found it difficult to identify buyout recipients who had returned under personal services contracts. For an agency to determine that a contract employee must comply with a repayment provision, it must first determine that the employee\u2019s contract is expressly identified as, or is being administered as, a personal services contract.", "The need for agencies to be able to better recognize the administration of contracts as personal services contracts was pointed out by the audit report of GSA\u2019s OIG. The audit report said that, as downsizing occurs, agencies are turning to contractors to accomplish tasks, and that some employees who leave agencies because of downsizing are working for those contractors. As a result, the DOT and GSA OIGs made recommendations in their reports to help ensure that their employees and contractors know what constitutes a personal services contract and how the identification of buyout recipients under such contracts could help prevent future repayment provision violations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations to the Director of OPM", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that agencies establish procedures to comply with the buyout repayment provisions of the FWRA and other buyout authorities, we recommend that the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) take the following actions to establish steps to identify potential violations of the provisions.", "Promulgate regulations requiring agencies to identify buyout recipients who (1) are applying to return or have returned directly to federal employment or (2) are applying to work for or already work for the federal government under a contract that is, by its terms, a personal services contract, or administered as such, and require them to repay their buyouts. In doing so, the Director may want to consider OPM\u2019s list of possible options (see app. III) that agencies could take to help ensure compliance with the buyout repayment provisions.", "Create a form that job applicants would be required to complete to certify whether they were buyout recipients and, if so, from which agency they received the buyout.

The Director said agencies have been extremely cooperative in responding to OPM\u2019s requests for information regarding reemployed buyout recipients, regardless of whether the recipient is in violation of the FWRA repayment provision. The Director also said that we overestimated the scale of the FWRA repayment provision problem because we double-counted the number of violations by adding the number of violations we identified to those of OPM\u2019s research efforts, although both of us very likely identified the same violations.", "We also received cooperation from agencies in tracking down the status of the 23 cases we reviewed. However, we contacted these agencies after the buyout recipients were rehired. Although the information the agencies provided may serve to assist in identifying violations after they have occurred, it does not prevent violations from occurring. Preventing violations is especially important for the more recent buyout laws, which require buyout recipients to repay their buyouts before their first day of reemployment with the federal government or employment under a personal services contract. Therefore, we continue to believe that agencies are obligated to have internal controls that are adequate to reasonably ensure compliance with the buyout provisions. In addition, we agree that our draft report included some instances of apparent double-counting, and we have made the appropriate changes in this report. Our review and one of OPM\u2019s studies in its interim report were based on CPDF data, and the time frame of OPM\u2019s study was encompassed in the period we reviewed. However, the methodologies used to extract the data were not the same, which provided different results. For instance, although OPM\u2019s CPDF-based study confirmed 10 FWRA repayment provision violations and we confirmed 9, only 5 of the violations we confirmed were the same as those confirmed by OPM. Consequently, five of the violations that OPM confirmed were not confirmed by our review.", "In addition, the Director made a number of technical comments regarding accuracy or context in the draft report; we made these changes in this report where appropriate.

The Director believed it would not be cost effective to comply with OPM\u2019s suggested option to contact the approximately 95,000 buyout recipients who had left DOD and to remind them of the FWRA repayment provision, given the very small numbers of detected violations. However, she agreed that before prospective employees are hired, they should be required to certify whether they have received a buyout from a previous federal employer.", "Although we believe OPM\u2019s suggested options are useful indicators of the steps that can be taken to help ensure compliance with buyout repayment provisions, we do not suggest that all of OPM\u2019s options should be implemented by every agency. We believe that documenting whether prospective employees have received buyouts is a sound step to help ensure compliance, but it must be linked to procedures to help ensure that those who have received such payments repay them to satisfy the appropriate buyout provision.", "We received written comments on a draft of this report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in a letter dated August 8, 1997, from the Director of its Office of Human Resources Management.

We believe that our draft report did recognize the responsibility of buyout recipients to reveal their buyout status; our recommendation that a form be created on which job applicants would certify their buyout status explicitly recognizes this responsibility of buyout recipients. However, although any failure of buyout recipients to acknowledge their status when reapplying for federal employment can make enforcing the law more difficult, agencies nevertheless retain responsibility for ensuring compliance. We recommended that OPM promulgate regulations requiring that agencies take steps to identify buyout recipients who need to repay their buyout because the agencies we reviewed had not established procedures that provided a reasonable assurance of compliance with the repayment requirement. 2.USDA said it was important to note that discrepancies in OPM\u2019s CPDF data compared with data in agency reports can contribute to the difficulty that agencies may have in identifying repayment violations and observed that such discrepancies explained some of the possible violations we had found. We agree that discrepancies between the CPDF and agency reports can make use of the CPDF an imperfect mechanism for identifying possible buyout repayment violations. However, we did not recommend that agencies rely on the CPDF to identify possible violations. Use of the CPDF could be but one of several options for identifying possible violations. To the extent that the CPDF is used, discrepancies in CPDF data can, at least in part, be reduced by the agencies themselves\u2014many of the inconsistencies between CPDF data and agency reports were due to agencies\u2019 not having provided updated, accurate data to OPM. 3.USDA was concerned that the description and placement of references to USDA violations at the beginning of the draft report implied that USDA was the first and most significant violator.
