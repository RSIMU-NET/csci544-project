In addition, MAI grantees faced administrative challenges managing HIV/AIDS funding that was fragmented across several grants. Various agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) awarded MAI grants to grantees. The agencies included CDC, HRSA, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and seven other offices within HHS. The MAI grantees in GAO's sample reported providing mostly support services with their MAI grants, similar to the types of support services grantees provided with core HIV/AIDS funding from CDC and HRSA. These support services included community outreach and education, and staff or provider training. Twenty percent of the grantees also reported providing medical services to their clients. According to the limited data HHS agencies and offices maintain on the demographics of the population served with MAI grants, the majority of recipients of MAI services were from racial and ethnic minority groups, as is also the case with recipients of services provided with core HIV/AIDS funds. MAI grantees faced administrative challenges because the fragmented nature of MAI and core HIV/AIDS funding required them to manage funding from several sources, each of which required them to complete multiple application and reporting requirements. For example, one city received nine HHS grants to provide HIV/AIDS services - six MAI grants and three core HIV/AIDS grants - and for each of these grants, that city had to complete separate administrative requirements. In this case, while HHS is funding all of the services, it is doing so across multiple funding streams, which raises the possibility of inefficiencies and requires unnecessarily duplicative application and reporting requirements of grantees that could otherwise be using their resources to provide needed services. Additionally, according to HRSA officials, these administrative challenges discouraged some grantees from applying for MAI grants. HRSA officials stated that some of the states receiving core HIV/AIDS grants chose not to request MAI grants because the grants' small size did not justify the additional reporting or other administrative requirements that would accompany them.", "MAI grantee reports that GAO reviewed, as well as stakeholder organizations GAO interviewed, described a variety of best practices for community outreach and capacity building that at times led to improved client recruitment and improved capacity of community based organizations to serve communities disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS. For instance, MAI grantees reported targeting specific communities, broadening outreach strategies, utilizing social media forums, and using various HIV testing strategies as best practices for community outreach that at times led to improved recruitment for HIV testing and other services. Grantees and some of the stakeholders reported that upgrading technology and providing training to grantee staff were the best methods to improve capacity to serve clients."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To enhance HIV/AIDS services to minority populations, HHS should consolidate MAI funding into core HIV/AIDS funding and seek legislation as necessary to achieve a consolidated approach.

These HHS  agencies and offices include HRSA, the primary federal agency for  improving access to health care services for uninsured, isolated or  medically vulnerable individuals; the Substance Abuse and Mental Health  Services Administration (SAMHSA), which leads public health efforts to  advance the behavioral health of the nation; CDC, which seeks to protect  health and promote quality of life through the prevention and control of  disease, injury, and disability; the Indian Health Service (IHS), which  provides federal health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives;  the Office of Population Affairs (OPA), which aims to be the leader in  family planning and reproductive health care services, training and  research; the Office of Minority Health (OMH); which aims to improve the  health of racial and ethnic minority populations through the development  of health policies and programs; the Office of HIV/AIDS and Infectious  Disease Policy (OHAIDP), which advises HHS officials on the  implementation and development of policies, programs, and activities  related to HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases; the Office on Women\u2019s  Health (OWH), which seeks to improve the health and sense of well-being  of women and girls; the Regional Health Administrators (RHA), which  seeks to perform essential functions for HHS in prevention,  preparedness, and agency-wide coordination; and the Office of  Adolescent Health (OAH), which seeks to improve the health and well  being of adolescents. We also interviewed staff from six stakeholder  organizations, including national HIV/AIDS organizations that represent  MAI grantees: the Black AIDS Institute, Latino Commission on AIDS,  National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, National Council  of Urban Indian Health, National Minority AIDS Council, and National  Native American AIDS Prevention Center. In addition, we interviewed the  Kaiser Family Foundation, a subject matter expert. We interviewed these  organizations to obtain their perspectives on MAI. Information we  obtained from these interviews is not generalizable. We conducted a  review of MAI services reported in MAI annual grantee reports from a  generalizable sample of 100 MAI grantees from fiscal year 2011. To  select our sample, we created a list of all MAI grantees from the ten HHS  agencies and offices that awarded MAI grants in fiscal year 2011 and  then selected a generalizable sample of 100 grantees from these  agencies and offices. We then obtained MAI annual grantee reports for  these grantees from the respective agencies and offices and used NVivo  software to identify the types of MAI services in these reports (app. II  provides more detail on our sample design.).provided and population served from this sample are generalizable to the  population of MAI grantees. We summarize the statistical precision of our  estimates using a 95 percent confidence interval, which is the interval that  would contain the population value in 95 percent of the samples we could  have drawn. Since the size of the confidence intervals varies widely  across the estimates, we specify these intervals where we refer to the  estimates. We categorized MAI services described in the grantee reports  into six categories. We then analyzed and compared the services  identified in these categories by HHS agency and office, grant amount,  source of grant, and organizational type. We also reviewed agency  guidance on which services grantees are expected to provide with their  MAI and core HIV/AIDS grants.", "In addition, to identify the population served by MAI, we obtained and  reviewed the available demographic data on the race and ethnicity of the  clients served with MAI grants as well as aggregate historical funding  data that we requested and obtained from HHS agencies and offices for  fiscal years 2007-2012. Some agencies and offices could not provide  demographic data on their clients, but we assessed the reliability of the  demographic data that the agencies and offices could provide by  interviewing agency officials about how their demographic data was  collected, and we also discussed any inconsistencies we found in the  data. We found the data provided to be sufficiently reliable for presenting  information about the race and ethnicity of MAI grantee populations. We  also obtained, reviewed, and analyzed the core HIV/AIDS grant amounts  that MAI grantees in our sample were awarded in order to understand the  total amount of HIV/AIDS funding that MAI grantees received. We then  compared the core HIV/AIDS grant amounts to their MAI grant amounts.  To determine core HIV/AIDS grant amounts, we used CDC and HRSA  funding data in addition to publicly available funding data. We compared  publically available data to data provided to us, and confirmed the data  with the agencies where there were discrepancies. We found these data  to be reliable for our purposes.", "Furthermore, to assist us in reviewing the administrative challenges faced  by MAI grantees, we evaluated grantee administrative requirements  including applications and reporting requirements for MAI and core  HIV/AIDS grants, and considered our past work on federal programs or  activities government-wide that have evidence of fragmentation, overlap,  or duplication. In that work, we found that the presence of fragmentation  can lead to instances of overlap and duplication among government  agencies or programs that have similar goals or activities.", "To describe the best practices identified by grantees for community  outreach and capacity building of CBOs serving communities  disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS, we conducted a review of MAI  annual grantee reports from our generalizable sample of 100 MAI  grantees using NVivo software in order to identify and categorize what  grantees considered to be best practices. Specifically, we identified and  analyzed MAI services that grantees considered were best practices,  which included best practices for community outreach or capacity building  of CBOs that serve communities disproportionally affected by HIV/AIDS.  We defined the term best practices to include any successes, lessons  learned, or challenges overcome by grantees regarding their MAI  activities. Because grantees generally were not required to discuss best  practices in their MAI annual grantee reports, we cannot estimate the  proportion of grantees identifying such practices. Instead, we can simply  count the number of best practices reported in our sample that we  identified using our definition of best practices. As a result, our estimates  are not generalizable for this purpose, unlike our estimates of services  provided.

Given  that the majority of individuals living with HIV/AIDS in the United States  today are racial and ethnic minorities, the populations eligible for the  services provided through both core HIV/AIDS grants and MAI grants are  primarily minority. In most cases, MAI grants not only have the same  purpose as core HIV/AIDS grants but MAI grants go to similar grantees to  provide similar services. Moreover, HHS agencies and offices are  required to manage separate, fragmented streams of funding that are  largely intended for the same purpose.", "MAI grantees face a challenge in that they are often required to complete  duplicative administrative requirements for their HIV/AIDS funding. In past  work, GAO has determined that federal programs are duplicative when  they provide similar services to the same populations and fragmented  when numerous agencies or offices provide the same services. In this  case, a single department is funding the services, but it is doing so across  multiple agencies and offices with multiple funding streams. Such a  situation raises the possibility of inefficiencies and requires unnecessarily  duplicative administrative processes of grantees that could otherwise be  using their resources to provide needed services. Opportunities exist for  HHS to reduce unnecessarily fragmented funding streams through its  budget request and allocation process. For example, HHS can  consolidate disparate MAI funding streams when making discretionary  budget allocations, and it can restructure its annual budget requests to  concentrate funding in core HIV/AIDS programs. HHS can also seek  legislative solutions to achieve a more consolidated funding approach, for  example, by amendments to the CARE Act or other law, as necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to reduce the administrative costs associated with a fragmented  MAI grant structure that diminishes the effective use of HHS\u2019s limited  HIV/AIDS funding, and to enhance services to minority populations, HHS  should take the following two actions:", "Consolidate disparate MAI funding streams into core HIV/AIDS  funding during its budget request and allocation process, and", "Seek legislation to amend the CARE Act or other provisions of law, as  necessary, to achieve a consolidated approach."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a copy of this report to HHS for its review and HHS provided  written comments (see app. III).
