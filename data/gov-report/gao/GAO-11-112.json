After abandoning an earlier, more expensive missile and a joint service effort, the Air Force began producing the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) in 2001. After that, the program (1) encountered many flight test failures, (2) decided to develop an extended range version, and (3) recognized significant cost growth. The production decision for the JASSM-ER is planned for November 2010. Also, the Secretary of Defense has recently announced a major initiative to restore affordability and productivity in defense spending. This initiative is expected to, among other things, identify savings by conducting needed programs more efficiently. As DOD faces the initial production decision on JASSM-ER, GAO was asked to assess (1) most recent test results, correction of causes of previous flight test failures, and efforts to improve JASSM's reliability; and (2) JASSM cost changes, efforts to control costs, and additional cost risks for the program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since 2007, design changes and other corrective actions by the Air Force have improved the baseline JASSM's test results significantly--the missile has now demonstrated 85 percent success versus 58 percent achieved previously and before the corrections. The JASSM-ER variant has done well thus far, with no failures during the first seven flight tests. These results reflect the Air Force's enhanced oversight of the program and significant investments made to improve reliability. These efforts also identified many of the root causes for flight test failures. While baseline JASSM missile reliability has improved, it is not expected to achieve the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics' required level of 90 percent until 2013. Tests conducted thus far of the improved baseline JASSM and the JASSM-ER variants have been developmental--or controlled--in nature. Neither the improved JASSM baseline missile nor the JASSM-ER has been demonstrated in operationally realistic testing or in a combat operation. JASSM costs have increased by over seven percent since the program was restructured in 2008. As the table shows, since 1998, JASSM quantities have more than doubled and estimated program costs have grown from $2.2 billion to a $7.1 billion. The Air Force has taken several steps to control JASSM costs, but options to reduce costs at this point appear limited. In fact, several factors suggest additional cost growth is likely. First, the Air Force has not been able to provide enough funding to produce the missiles at planned rates. That has led to a less efficient production process, a longer production period, and higher costs that have not yet been reflected in the $7.1 billion estimate. Second, the Air Force's potential plans to retrofit existing missiles with the reliability improvements may not be feasible, given the missile's sensitivity to being reopened. If retrofits prove infeasible, new replacements may have to be purchased; if they are feasible, the Air Force may have to provide additional funding to retrofit all existing missiles. Finally, since the Air Force last compared JASSM to possible alternatives, the unit cost was assumed to be about 40 percent less than currently expected and that now could make alternatives more competitive in terms of cost and/or capabilities. A reevaluation of the JASSM program, given that most of its costs have yet to be incurred, is warranted before the decision to produce the JASSM-ER is made."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense reevaluate the JASSM program's affordability and cost-effectiveness before making the decision to produce the JASSM-ER. DOD partially concurred with GAO's assessment, but believes the JASSM-ER should begin production in November 2010. GAO believes that it is incumbent upon the department to reexamine JASSM before making the production decision to ensure that the program is structured as efficiently as possible and is still a good investment given the other demands DOD faces."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the past two and a half decades, the Department of Defense (DOD)  has invested heavily to acquire an Air Force air-to-ground cruise missile  capable of stealthy flight and reliable performance at affordable costs. The  Air Force invested in the Tri-Service Standoff Attack Missile (TSSAM)  from 1986 through 1994 but ended the program once the unit costs  exceeded $2 million per missile and as testing issues surfaced. The Air  Force is currently in production for the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff  Missile (JASSM). This program is intended to provide a next-generation  cruise missile capable of striking high-value, highly defended targets from  outside the enemy\u2019s air defenses launched from a variety of aircraft,  including the B-1, B-2, B-52, and F-16. Over the first several years of the  program, the Air Force (1) encountered many flight test failures, (2)  decided to develop an extended range version, and (3) recognized  significant cost growth which led to a critical Nunn-McCurdy unit cost  breach in 2006. The Air Force is about to begin producing the extended  range version (JASSM-ER) that will more than double the range of the  baseline missile. The two variants of JASSM are approximately 70 percent  common in hardware and 95 percent common in software.", "As DOD approaches the production decision on JASSM-ER, you asked us  (1) to assess the results of testing, whether the causes of previous flight  test failures have been corrected, and Air Force initiatives to improve  JASSM\u2019s reliability; and (2) to identify the extent JASSM costs have  changed over time, the steps the Air Force is taking to control costs, and  additional cost risks, if any, for the program. We note that the production  decision on JASSM-ER is being made shortly after the Secretary of  Defense announced a major initiative to improve the cost efficiency of  weapon systems acquisition.", "To determine JASSM\u2019s current costs and the extent they have changed, we  analyzed JASSM\u2019s contracts, budgets, and selected acquisition reports. We  compared the cost estimating practices of Office of Secretary of Defense  (OSD) cost analysts in the development of the life-cycle cost estimates for  JASSM and JASSM-ER to our Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide. To  assess the results of the most recent tests and to determine if corrective  actions have been implemented, we analyzed JASSM flight test results and  the results of the failure review boards to determine scoring criteria and  results and what corrective actions were implemented. We interviewed  officials with the JASSM joint program office, Lockheed Martin\u2014the  prime contractor, the Air Force, and Office of Secretary of Defense. We  interviewed a former Air Force official who was an early JASSM program  manager to better understand the program\u2019s objectives and original  acquisition strategy. We also reviewed our prior work on best acquisition  practices which established a set of evaluation criteria for a knowledge- based acquisition approach. We conducted this performance audit from  November 2009 through October 2010 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we  plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to  provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The JASSM program began in 1995 and was to be an affordable, joint  program between the Air Force and the Navy to meet an urgent need with  a streamlined acquisition strategy. JASSM predecessor TSSAM was also  planned to be a low-cost cruise missile able to deliver several different  munitions. However, after several unsuccessful flight tests, the lead  contractor for TSSAM initiated a reliability improvement program to  address higher reliability requirements, but demonstration of whether  problems had been resolved would have taken several years and cost more  than $300 million. As costs for TSSAM increased, the Army ended its  participation in the program and after a period of declining budgets and  changes to threat scenarios, a cost and operational effectiveness analysis  was completed, which showed that other options might be adequate to  meet national security requirements. In 2004, the Navy left the JASSM  program citing it as a redundant capability to other systems in its  inventory. JASSM was expected to require minimal maintenance while in  storage and life-cycle cost was to be controlled through improved  reliability and supportability achieved during development.", "To execute the acquisition strategy and meet cost and schedule goals, the  Air Force used Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR). TSPR  generally gives the contractor total responsibility for the entire weapon  system and for meeting DOD requirements, with minimum government  oversight. The Air Force made initial JASSM requirements flexible to allow  Lockheed Martin to have clear control of the design and product baseline.  Program officials stated this strategy was based on other successful  programs, such as the Joint Direct Attack Munition program, and would  allow the contractor flexibility to make changes to meet cost and schedule  deadlines without having to consult with the government. An example of  this flexibility was the mission missile effectiveness requirement. The  effectiveness requirement is the minimum number of missiles required to  kill specified targets and was named as a key performance parameter,  allowing trades between reliability, survivability, and lethality. In other  words, if the program was successful at achieving high levels of  survivability and lethality, reliability could remain low, even fluctuate, and  still meet the stated parameters. Quantities for JASSM were established by  reviewing the threshold targets and determining the number of missiles  necessary to meet operational damage criteria, based on missile  performance using the effectiveness requirement. Therefore, changes to  reliability would affect the quantities necessary to meet requirements.", "As part of the program\u2019s 1995 acquisition strategy, the Air Force received  five proposals for JASSM and in 1996 selected Lockheed Martin and  McDonnell Douglas to begin a 24-month risk-reduction phase. Following  the risk-reduction phase, the Air Force planned 32 months for  development and a total of 56 months from program start to full-rate  production in 2001. The program planned for concurrent developmental  and operational testing and evaluation with four flight tests planned before  initial production. The Air Force planned to have nine fixed-price  production lots from 2001 through 2009 totaling 2,400 baseline missiles  with an initial program cost estimate of $2.2 billion (fiscal year 2010  dollars).", "A former Air Force official who was an early JASSM program manager  stated the Air Force accepted Lockheed Martin\u2019s proposal, which included  favorable fixed-price contract prices for production lots 1 through 5 with  the understanding that the prices would increase after Lot 5. JASSM\u2019s  acquisition strategy planned for a 74 percent unit cost increase between  Lots 5 and 6. The cost increase between Lots 5 and 6 was to occur at a  time when quantities were increasing. Despite this planned cost increase,  the production unit costs would have remained within the Air Force\u2019s  acceptable range established before the competition and at much less cost  than TSSAM. Further, the prices offered by Lockheed Martin for the first  five production lots were below the Air Force\u2019s desired cost range for the  system. Air Force officials said the low costs contributed to Lockheed  Martin\u2019s selection. However, to maintain the benefits of this pricing, the  quantities purchased by the Air Force had to remain within a certain range  for each of the first 5 years.", "While the Air Force planned for some cost growth in the original  acquisition strategy, the program\u2019s cost grew much more than expected.  For the first four production lots, the Air Force benefited from the  favorable prices in the original contract. However, because of funding  limitations, it was not able to procure the minimum missile purchase in  Lot 5 and had to renegotiate this lot with Lockheed Martin. In doing so,  Lockheed Martin was able to renegotiate Lot 5 prices based on its actual  production costs\u2014at over $1 million per missile. Air Force documentation  indicates that previously negotiated unit prices for Lot 1 through Lot 5  were as much as 45 percent less than Lockheed Martin\u2019s actual costs.  Subsequent lots that had not been negotiated under the original contract  similarly reflected an increase in price.", "Most of this cost growth took place prior to 2006, culminating in a critical  Nunn-McCurdy unit cost breach late in 2006. According to program  documents, several causes have been cited for the critical Nunn-McCurdy  unit cost breach: an unrealistic cost estimate resulting from a flawed  acquisition strategy; the addition of 2,500 more expensive JASSM-ER  variants; the costly efforts to overcome reliability problems; and reduced  annual production rates for a longer period. Following the critical Nunn- McCurdy unit cost breach, the Air Force halted production of the missiles  until DOD certified that the program should continue. The Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics  (USD/ATL) found no lower cost alternatives and certified the program in  2008, despite the missile\u2019s higher than projected production costs.", "Since operational testing began in 2001, the reliability of the JASSM  missile has been inconsistent. The Air Force flight-tested 62 baseline  missiles from January 2001 through May 2007, resulting in 25 failures and 3  \u201cno tests,\u201d which was a 58 percent reliability success rate. However,  because the program\u2019s strategy allowed for the contractor to manage to  mission effectiveness by combining reliability with other factors, the 58  percent reliability rate was sufficient to meet mission effectiveness  criteria. The Air Force tracked reasons for flight test failures, but was not  part of the failure review boards until production Lot 5, 5 years after the  start of operational testing. Air Force officials stated that until 2006,  Lockheed Martin handled all flight test failure review determinations and  made corrective actions internally and the government was not heavily  involved. During the Nunn-McCurdy certification process, USD/ATL  directed the JASSM program to develop a reliability growth plan that  would achieve 90 percent reliability for the baseline missile. The program  set a goal of achieving this reliability rate by Lot 11, or fiscal year 2013. In  addition, the JASSM-ER program set a reliability goal of 85 percent by Lot  4, or fiscal year 2014.", "In our 2000 report on JASSM, we recommended the Secretary of Defense  revise its acquisition strategy for the JASSM program to be more closely  linked to demonstrating that the missile design is stable and can meet  performance requirements before making the production decision. DOD  partially concurred with our recommendation stating that its acquisition  strategy is directly linked to knowledge points, that it is linked to specific  criteria established for making the low-rate initial production decision,  and that the contractor is required to meet these criteria. We concluded  that, while the Air Force had taken steps to link production decisions for  JASSM to knowledge, we did not believe that the specific criteria  established to support a production decision were sufficient to minimize  cost and schedule risk.", "In June 2010, the Secretary of Defense announced an initiative to restore  affordability and productivity in defense spending. He stated that there is a  need to abandon inefficient practices accumulated in a period of budget  growth and learn to manage defense dollars in a manner that is \u201crespectful  of the American taxpayer at a time of economic and fiscal stress.\u201d He set a  goal to save $100 billion over the course of the 5 year defense planning  period. Subsequently, USD/ATL has issued guidance on delivering better  value to the taxpayer and improving the way DOD does business. That  guidance indicated that budget savings could be found by eliminating  unneeded and costly programs and activities as well as by conducting  needed programs and activities more efficiently, such as by stabilizing  production rates. Subsequently, in a September 14, 2010, memorandum,  USD/ATL provided specific guidance to acquisition professionals to  achieve this mandate. That guidance included 23 principle actions to  improve efficiency, including \u201cMandate affordability as a requirement\u201d and  \u201cDrive productivity growth through Will Cost/Should Cost management.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corrective Actions Have Led to Improved JASSM Test Results but Operational Effectiveness Is Still to Be Demonstrated", "paragraphs": ["Since 2007, the Air Force has enhanced its oversight of the JASSM  program and made significant investments to improve its reliability as  directed by USD/ATL.

The team\u2019s report stated that while JASSM\u2019s  development and reliability were within acceptable ranges when  compared to other cruise missiles, the JASSM program should increase  testing to discover additional weaknesses in design or production as well  as increase confidence in the level of reliability achieved and tie those  results to contractor incentives. In 2007, after direction from USD/ATL and  the Air Force during the Nunn-McCurdy certification process, the program  office updated the Joint Reliability and Maintainability Evaluation Team  and Test Data Scoring Board charters to significantly expand their role in  management of system development, manufacturing, configuration  changes, and testing. Since 2007, as a result of the Air Force\u2019s increased  attention to reliability testing and investments in reliability initiatives, the  program has identified many of the root causes for reliability failures.  While there is no single cause behind JASSM flight test failures, common  failures occurred across JASSM subsystems including navigation, flight  control, and propulsion.", "Most of the corrective actions to address the causes of the flight test  failures affect missile hardware and many have been implemented in the  current configuration for new production missiles. However, some flight  test failure investigations are still ongoing. Those investigations are often  difficult because of the lack of physical evidence after the flight test  missile detonates on the White Sands missile range. As a result, identifying  the root causes for failures were based on very extensive component  testing at supplier facilities. Additionally, the root causes for several test  failures were never conclusively determined as the failures may have  resulted from aircraft or user malfunctions. Efforts to address significant  reliability problems found during testing have contributed greatly to  JASSM\u2019s cost growth and schedule delays since the beginning of  development. The Air Force has estimated that it may ultimately spend  about $400 million through fiscal year 2025 on its reliability improvement  initiatives.", "The Air Force has also increased lot acceptance testing of the fuses and  implemented high-speed photography and screening improvements. In  addition to forensic evaluation of the missile impact area, the Air Force  also employs visual inspections and a built-in-test. The Air Force has also  taken a variety of actions, in addition to flight testing, to improve JASSM\u2019s  reliability, including the following initiatives.", "Increased Oversight: The Air Force and Lockheed Martin have begun  a process verification program to ensure suppliers follow prime  contractor specifications. According to Air Force officials, the process  verification program has allowed the Air Force to avoid unforeseen  costs as some missile parts have become obsolete. Further, officials  stated that it allows the JASSM program to catch problems earlier and  plan on how to replace parts sooner. According to a program official,  one process verification program team caught an obsolescence issue  with a global positioning satellite receiver and was able to minimize the  cost and production effect on the program.", "Missile Redesign: Program officials state that while wholesale missile  redesign is not considered a cost-effective option, they are considering  design changes and improvements at the component level.", "Increased Personnel: The program office has increased the number  of government personnel supporting the process verification program  and corrective action efforts.

Lockheed  Martin has implemented tests and improvement programs to increase  user confidence in reliability and control costs. For example, Lockheed  Martin officials stated that, to improve reliability, they have begun  using a test that exposes electrical connections to higher voltages than  they usually encounter during flight to make sure the wiring can handle  a surge.

Whereas  operational testing is designed to evaluate the ability of JASSM to execute  a mission, reliability testing is more narrowly focused on evaluating the  missile\u2019s performance during the mission. While mission failures were  counted against the program during initial testing, more recent mission  test failures have been declared \u201cno tests.\u201d For example, in early testing  when a B-52 software issue resulted in an aborted mission and it was  scored a test failure, this event would have been declared a no test under  current missile reliability definitions.", "While recent flight testing of the baseline missile has shown improved  missile reliability, the Air Force has not yet evaluated the operational  effectiveness and suitability of the baseline JASSM with all corrective  actions implemented. The JASSM program assesses operational  effectiveness through operational testing, follow-on testing, and the  weapon system evaluation program (routine tests of inventory assets).  These flight test scenarios assess operational effectiveness in realistic  combat scenarios against targets by determining reliability, evaluating  capability and limitations by identifying deficiencies, and recommending  corrective actions. In operational testing, the JASSM baseline program  flight tested 38 missiles from June 2002 through May 2007 resulting in 19  failures and two no tests. While these tests identified issues with missile  reliability, they also identified issues related to the B-52 aircraft, aircraft  software, and fuse issues which negatively affected the operational  effectiveness of the missile.

When taking into consideration  the pre-2008 cost growth, which included the cost of adding the JASSM-ER  variant, JASSM has grown from a $2.2 billion to a $7.1 billion program. In  addition, while it has initiated several cost control measures, the Air Force  appears to have limited options to reduce JASSM costs. Moreover, several  areas of risk could add to those costs. First, the Air Force has not been  able to provide enough annual funding to support the annual procurement  levels used as the basis for its 2008 program cost estimate. That has led to  a less efficient production process and a longer production period (most  recently extended 5 years to 2025). Second, until the Air Force evaluates  the effectiveness of the inventory JASSM baseline missiles with corrective  actions for previously identified hardware and software issues, their  viability and military utility is in question. If inventory missiles are found  not to have utility, they may need to be replaced. If retrofitted missiles are  found to be effective, the Air Force may still have to find additional  funding to complete the retrofit process. Third, the Air Force plans to  conduct many more flight tests to improve JASSM reliability from 85 to 90  percent. Finally, in comparing the capabilities and cost of JASSM to  several domestic and international missile systems in 2008, the Air Force  assumed that JASSM would cost about $1 million per unit, which is about  40 percent less than currently expected."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "JASSM Costs Are Much Higher Than Originally Anticipated", "paragraphs": ["Compared to original program estimates, JASSM\u2019s currently projected  costs are much higher because of (1) higher than anticipated production  costs, (2) longer production period, (3) the addition of the JASSM-ER  variant, and (4) reliability improvement efforts. Through fiscal year 2010,  about 75 percent of the planned JASSM quantities have yet to be procured  and, as a result, most of the program costs have yet to be incurred.", "Following the critical Nunn-McCurdy unit cost breach, the Air Force  halted production of the missiles until USD/ATL certified that the program  should continue. USD/ATL found no lower cost alternatives and certified  the program in 2008, despite the missile\u2019s higher than projected production  costs. As a part of our review, we examined the cost estimates used by  OSD to certify the program following the critical Nunn-McCurdy unit cost  breach. This estimate used the actual costs of the missile since JASSM was  well into the production phase at the time. Overall, the Air Force\u2019s cost  estimate substantially met our best practice standards in our Cost Guide.", "For a more in-depth discussion of our review of this JASSM cost estimate,  see appendix III.", "Since the Nunn-McCurdy certification in 2008, the growth in JASSM\u2019s  projected program cost has moderated, rising about $500 million (from  $6.6 billion to $7.1 billion) through 2025. Reliability enhancements to the  JASSM missile instituted in 2007 and additional reliability testing have  added the majority of the increase in program costs. These enhancements  were implemented to meet USD/ATL\u2019s 90 percent reliability goal which  was set during the Nunn-McCurdy certification. Also, the Air Force  decided to lengthen the program\u2019s procurement schedule by another 5  years, buying the same number of missiles over a longer time period. That  reduces the efficiency of the production processes and adds inflation to  the cost estimate. Currently, on a per unit basis, the average procurement  unit cost of a JASSM missile is projected to be about $1.2 million. JASSM- ER is expected to cost about $200,000 more than the average, about $1.4  million per unit.", "Since 2008, the Air Force has added several measures to control costs in  the JASSM program, but the effect of these measures is not yet clear.  Examples of these measures include the following.", "Contract Incentives: The Air Force has begun using fixed-price  incentive (firm target) contracts for each lot to produce the missiles for  less than projected.", "Greater Insight into Actual Costs: Air Force officials have  increased insight into Lockheed Martin\u2019s actual costs, which may make  them more informed when negotiating new contracts. Program officials  stated that, for example, they now know how many engineers are  needed to perform a certain task and the number of hours it takes to  assemble a missile. The Air Force can directly verify the costs charged  by subcontractors.", "Increased Authority over Design: In recent contract negotiations,  the Air Force gained approval authority over certain design changes  that may affect current and future lots, including those that may  increase cost, require retrofit, or affect safety. Previously, Lockheed  Martin had full authority over most design changes.", "While the effectiveness of the cost control measures is not yet known, the  Air Force appears to have limited options to actually reduce those costs.  For example, annual production rates are expected to remain well below  the levels projected at the start of the program. The 2008 Air Force cost  estimate was based on an annual production rate of 280 missiles per year.  However, that cost estimate may now be understated because the program  has not produced that many missiles in a single year since 2005. For  example, the Air Force\u2019s procurement quantities for production Lot 7 and  Lot 8 were 111 and 80 units, respectively, well below the economic order  quantity of 175 missiles per year. Program officials stated that annual  quantities below the economic order quantity will result in an increasingly  inefficient production process and some key suppliers may shift from  continuous to limited production. Further, Lockheed Martin officials  stated that low production rates could cause skilled labor to look  elsewhere for work and JASSM reliability could be adversely affected. The  contractor has been able to maintain some level of production efficiency  because of foreign military sales that make up for the reduced Air Force  procurements. However, lower than projected annual procurement levels  will increase production costs. A further challenge is the fact that JASSM\u2019s  design is mostly complete and there may be few opportunities to reduce  production costs through redesign. As a result, average JASSM unit costs  may remain in excess of $1.2 million indefinitely."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effectiveness of Retrofitting Corrective Actions into JASSM Inventory Is Uncertain", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force has plans to address the low reliability of missiles in its  inventory by retrofitting some of its 942 missiles with hardware and  software corrective actions.

However,  previous efforts to retrofit JASSM missiles have proven to be problematic.  An example of challenges associated with retrofitting missiles is adding  telemetry instrumentation kits after the missiles have been produced and  are in the inventory. Those kits are added to all missiles to be flight  tested. This requires opening up the missile to insert telemetry after the  stealth coating has been applied and increasing the number of electrical  connections as compared to a production missile. Air Force officials  stated the kit could add some reliability concerns when it is added to test  missiles because the missiles were not designed to be opened after they  were completed. Air Force officials also stated that workers have to  reroute wires and remove the engine so that the self-destruct mechanism  can be installed and all of this rework inside the missile has the potential  to lead to more errors and cause additional reliability issues.", "The impact of retrofitting missiles has become evident in the weapon  system evaluation program, which is operationally representative flight  testing run by users of the system and focuses on the performance of  missiles in the inventory. JASSM\u2019s performance in this evaluation program  has not been good, with 7 failures in 12 tests from 2006 through 2007, and  with at least some of the failures attributable to the retrofit process.

For the JASSM baseline missile, all of  DOD\u2019s existing programs were found to be less effective in terms of  lethality, survivability, or capacity. The Navy\u2019s Tomahawk missile was the  closest alternative to meeting JASSM\u2019s capability but it is not as lethal as  JASSM. Also, the Tomahawk is launched from ships and not from aircraft,  as the Air Force plans to use the capability.", "DOD also evaluated new or modified programs as possible alternatives to  JASSM and JASSM-ER. The Air Force evaluated 12 domestic and  international missile systems with projected unit production costs ranging  from $600,000 to $2.8 million. JASSM-ER, estimated at the time of this  evaluation to cost $1 million per unit, was more expensive than 5  alternative systems under consideration. In terms of performance, some  alternatives were more capable than JASSM and some were not. All of the  alternative systems were expected to require some up-front investment.  Based on this analysis, no other alternative was found to provide greater  or equal military capability at less cost than JASSM-ER.", "Later in the Nunn-McCurdy process, however, OSD cost analysts found  that the costs of JASSM-ER would likely be at least $1.4 million per  missile. That continues to be the projected unit cost of JASSM-ER and, as  we discussed earlier in this report, there are cost risks that may drive that  unit cost higher. Despite the higher production unit costs for JASSM-ER,  the Air Force has not revisited the results of its assessment of alternatives.  In light of the current cost projections, which are 40 percent higher than  assumed in the previous assessment, JASSM-ER would be equal to the cost  of an additional alternative.

After  restructuring the program in 2008 and after considerable effort to improve  reliability, the JASSM program as it exists today is much different than  originally envisioned. A $2.2 billion, 11-year program to produce 2,400  missiles has become a $7.1 billion, 28-year program to produce 4,900  missiles. From a technical and capability standpoint, the program offers  more now than the baseline missile did before 2008. Yet, the effectiveness  of the new missiles remains to be demonstrated in operational testing, and  low production rates, retrofit costs, and additional reliability testing could  drive program costs higher.", "At this point, about 70 percent of the projected JASSM costs have not yet  been incurred. In November 2011, DOD will decide whether to approve the  Air Force\u2019s request to start low-rate initial production of the JASSM-ER  variant. Low-rate initial production is normally the last major milestone  decision for an acquisition program.
