GAO has identified the need to modernize the financial regulatory system as a challenge to be addressed in the 21st century. This report, mandated by the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006, discusses (1) measurements of regulatory costs and benefits and efforts to avoid excessive regulatory burden, (2) the challenges posed to financial regulators by trends in the industry, and (3) options to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the federal financial regulatory structure. GAO convened a Comptroller General's Forum (Forum) with supervisors and leading industry experts, reviewed regulatory agency policies, and summarized prior reports to meet these objectives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The inherent problems of measuring the costs and benefits of regulation make it difficult to assess the extent to which regulations may be unduly burdensome to U.S. financial services firms, particularly in comparison to firms in other countries. Additionally, it is difficult to separate the costs of complying with regulation from other costs and thus determine regulatory burden. Regulatory agencies, however, have undertaken several initiatives to reduce regulatory burden; these efforts contributed to the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006. While noting that regulation contributes to confidence in financial institutions and markets, participants in the Forum agreed regulators have opportunities to further reduce regulatory burden and suggested regulators better measure the results of implemented regulations. GAO also recently recommended regulatory agencies consider whether and how to measure the performance of regulation during the process of promulgating the regulation and improving the communication of regulatory reviews to the public. The current regulatory structure, with multiple agencies that oversee segments of the financial services industry, is challenged by a number of industry trends. The development of large, complex, internationally active firms whose product offerings span the jurisdiction of several agencies creates the potential for inconsistent regulatory treatment of similar products, gaps in consumer and investor protection, or duplication among regulators. Regulatory agencies have made efforts to collaborate in responding to these trends and avoid inconsistencies, gaps, and duplication. However, challenges remain; until recently, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Securities and Exchange Commission, for instance, had not sought to resolve potentially duplicative and inconsistent regulation of several financial services conglomerates for which both agencies have jurisdiction. Finally, despite the challenges posed by the industry's dynamic environment, accountability for addressing issues that span agencies' jurisdiction is not clearly assigned. These issues have led GAO to suggest in prior work that the federal regulatory structure should be modernized. GAO and others have recommended several options to accomplish modernization of the federal financial regulatory structure; these include consolidating certain regulatory functions as well as having a single regulator for large, complex firms. There also are potential lessons that can be learned from the experience of other nations that have restructured their financial regulators. Several Forum participants, for instance, suggested that one important lesson the United States could learn from the United Kingdom's Financial Services Authority was the value of setting principles or goals for regulators. The Department of the Treasury's recently announced plan to propose a restructured regulatory system provides an opportunity to take the first step toward modernization by providing clear and consistent goals for the regulatory agencies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The financial services industry\u2014including the banking, securities, and  futures sectors\u2014 has changed significantly over the last several decades.  Firms today are generally fewer and larger, provide more and varied  services, offer similar products, and operate in increasingly global  markets. These developments have both benefits and risks for the overall  U.S. economy. Despite these changes, the U.S. financial regulatory  structure has largely remained the same. It is a complex system of multiple  federal and state regulators as well as self-regulatory organizations (SROs)  that operate largely along functional lines, even as these lines have  become increasingly blurred in the industry. Regulated financial  institutions have learned to operate and thrive under the existing  regulatory system. However, concerns about inefficient overlaps in  responsibility, undue regulatory burden, and possible gaps in oversight  raise questions about whether the current structure is best suited to meet  the nation\u2019s needs.", "We identified a need to modernize the financial regulatory system as a  challenge to be addressed in the 21st century, noting that although  multiple specialized regulators bring critical skills to bear in their areas of  expertise, they have difficulty identifying and responding to risks that  cross industry lines. We asked whether it is time to modernize the  financial regulatory system to promote a more coherent and integrated  structure and specify goals more clearly. Such concerns also have been  recently raised by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In a statement  regarding its review of U.S. economic developments, IMF concluded that  rapid innovation in the U.S. financial industry had created new regulatory  challenges for a system disadvantaged by its overlapping regulatory  oversight. IMF stated that emphasis should be placed on strategies to  improve regulatory effectiveness, such as implementing general regulatory  principles or goals to ease interagency coordination and shorten reaction  times to industry developments. Similarly, the Department of the Treasury  has undertaken an initiative to examine the regulatory structure  associated with financial institutions, partly in response to concerns that  the current structure may make U.S. financial markets less competitive.  Treasury expects to develop a plan by early 2008 to identify a regulatory  structure with improved oversight, increased efficiency, reduced overlap,  and the ability to adapt to financial market participants\u2019 constantly  changing strategies and tools.", "Debate about modernizing the current financial regulatory structure is not  new. However, there is continuing value in reexamining the current  regulatory system and structure and considering ways in which it could be  more efficient and effective.", "In response to a mandate in the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of  2006, this report    describes measurements of the costs and benefits of financial regulation in  general and current efforts to avoid excessive regulatory burden;    describes financial industry trends and the challenges that these pose to  the federal financial regulatory structure; and   discusses various options to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of  the federal financial regulatory structure.", "To meet our objectives, we convened a Comptroller General\u2019s Forum  (Forum) on June 11, 2007, that brought together leading experts from the  financial services industry, the regulatory agencies, and academia to  discuss issues relative to our objectives. The Forum agenda covered three  broad topics: (1) balancing regulatory costs and benefits, (2) financial  services regulation in a dynamic environment, and (3) assessing options  for enhancing the financial regulatory system. Forum participants were  selected to provide perspectives from different segments of the industry  and different regulatory agencies. To encourage a free exchange of  information and viewpoints, no specific statements or opinions expressed  by Forum participants are attributed to any participant. To meet our  objectives, we also met with federal regulators to discuss our objectives  and reviewed regulatory agency documents and reports. We also reviewed  and summarized relevant analysis, conclusions, and recommendations  from our earlier reports on financial regulation.

State regulators charter  institutions and participate in the oversight of those institutions; however,  all of these institutions have a primary federal regulator if they offer  federal deposit insurance. The primary federal regulators are the  following:    The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which charters and  supervises national banks. As of December 30, 2006, there were 1,715  commercial banks with a national bank charter.

In  addition, FDIC has certain backup supervisory authority for federally  insured banks and savings institutions.", "The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), which charters and supervises  federally chartered savings institutions. As of December 30, 2006, OTS  supervised 844 institutions with $1.464 trillion in total assets.", "The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), which charters and  supervises federally chartered credit unions. As of December 30, 2006,  8,362 credit unions hold $710 billion in assets.", "These federal regulators have established capital requirements for the  depository institutions they supervise, conduct onsite examinations and  offsite monitoring to assess an institution\u2019s financial condition, and  monitor and enforce compliance with banking and consumer laws.  Regulators also issue regulations, take enforcement actions, and close  institutions they determine to be insolvent.", "The securities and futures industries are regulated under a combination of  self-regulation (subject to oversight of the appropriate federal regulator)  and direct oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), respectively. In  the securities industry, the self-regulatory organizations (SROs) have  responsibility for oversight of the securities markets and their participants  by establishing the standards under which their members conduct  business; monitoring business conduct; and bringing disciplinary actions  against their members for violating applicable federal statutes, SEC\u2019s  rules, and their own rules. SEC oversees SROs by inspecting their  operations and reviewing their rule proposals and appeals of final  disciplinary proceedings. In the futures industry, SROs include the futures  exchanges and the National Futures Association. Futures SROs are  responsible for establishing and enforcing rules governing member  conduct and trading; providing for the prevention of market manipulation,  including monitoring trading activity; ensuring that futures industry  professionals meet qualifications; and examining members for financial  strength and other regulatory purposes.

Broker-dealer activities, for instance, are  generally subject to SEC\u2019s jurisdiction, whether the broker-dealer is a  subsidiary of a bank holding company subject to Federal Reserve  supervision or a subsidiary of an investment bank. The functional  regulator approach is intended to provide consistency in regulation, focus  regulatory restrictions on the relevant functions area, and avoid the  potential need for regulatory agencies to develop expertise in all aspects  of financial regulation.", "Many of the largest financial legal entities are part of holding company  structures\u2014companies that hold stock in one or more subsidiaries\u2014and  conduct business and manage risks on a consolidated basis. Many of these  companies are subject to consolidated supervision that provides a basis  for examining the financial and operating risks faced by holding  companies and the controls in place to manage those risks at a  consolidated, or holding company-wide, level. Companies that own or  control banks are regulated and supervised by the Federal Reserve as  bank holding companies, and their nonbanking activities generally are  limited to those the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related  to banking. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, bank holding companies  can qualify as financial holding companies and thereby engage in a range  of financial activities broader than those permitted for \u201ctraditional\u201d bank  holding companies. Savings and loan or thrift holding companies (thrift  holding companies), that own or control one or more savings associations  (but not a bank) are subject to supervision by OTS and, depending upon  certain circumstances, may not face the types of activities\u2019 restrictions  imposed on bank holding companies. Certain holding companies that own  large broker-dealers can elect to be supervised by SEC as consolidated  supervised entities (CSE). SEC provides group-wide oversight of these  entities unless they are determined to already be subject to  \u201ccomprehensive, consolidated supervision\u201d by another principal regulator.  While holding company supervisors oversee the holding company, the  appropriate functional regulator remains primarily responsible for  supervising any functionally regulated subsidiary within the holding  company.", "In prior reports, we have noted that characteristics of the U.S. regulatory  structure can have positive effects. Specialization by regulatory agencies  allows them to better understand the risks associated with particular  activities or products. Competition among regulators helps to account for  regulatory innovation, providing businesses with a method to move to  regulators whose approaches better match businesses\u2019 operations. We also  have noted that the system is complex, with a single large firm subject to  oversight by multiple federal and state agencies, as figure 1 illustrates.", "The Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) also  share responsibility for maintaining financial stability. Treasury also  represents the United States on international financial market issues and,  in consultation with the President, also may approve special resolution  options for insolvent financial institutions whose failure could threaten the  stability of the financial system.

Such reviews have, in some cases,  assisted in identifying the costs and benefits of regulation and removing  unnecessary burden. However, some groups still assert regulatory burden  has increased significantly over time and regulators should do more to  address such burdens. Forum participants agreed with these assertions,  suggesting regulators improve measurements of the results of  implemented regulations as a way to promote their own regulatory  accountability.

For example, a 1998 Federal Reserve staff study  concluded that it had insufficient information to reliably estimate the total  cost of regulations for commercial banks.", "One limitation of efforts to measure regulatory costs is the difficulty that  businesses have in separating the costs of regulatory compliance from  other costs related to risk management or recordkeeping. For instance,  bank capital adequacy regulation provides an example of the inherent  difficulty of assessing the value of regulation. Our work on the  implementation of the Basel II risk-based capital framework noted that  banks often could not separate out costs related directly to the  implementation of the framework, as systems often served multiple  purposes, such as reporting for many kinds of regulations and also for  internal, risk management purposes. Similarly, an analysis of financial  regulation in the United Kingdom found that firms tend not to separate out  costs for complying with regulations, and firms could not estimate  hypothetical savings if certain regulations were removed.", "While regulation provides a broad assurance of the strength of financial  markets, it is difficult to measure those benefits, in part because  regulations seeking to ensure financial stability aim to prevent low- probability, high-cost events."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns Exist that Regulation Could Hinder Market Efficiency", "paragraphs": ["Recent reports by industry participants, academics, and policymakers also  have suggested that regulatory burden may be lessening U.S. securities  markets\u2019 viability and challenging their competitiveness.

Some industry representatives, market analysts, and  academics argue that this environment creates concerns for firms about  potential class action and other lawsuits that may impact their decision to  engage in business in the United States. Another factor is the often limited  coordination among regulators that at times results in overlapping  regulatory jurisdictions and confusing regulations. Additionally, questions  regarding the jurisdiction over some financial products raise doubts for  firms about how such products will be regulated. For example, the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce has questioned whether CFTC should have  jurisdiction over securities futures products, and recommended that  jurisdiction be shifted to the SEC. In our work we also have noted that  SEC and CFTC share overlapping jurisdiction on financial products that  have the features of both securities and futures, which can inhibit market  innovation by potentially causing market participants to design products  based on how they might be regulated.

One participant noted the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), for  example, has resulted in filing many currency transaction reports and  suspicious activity reports, but the benefits of such filings are sometimes  unclear to banks.

To take advantage of  opportunities to promote better accountability and limit the potential for  duplication and regulatory gaps, we recommended that these agencies  foster more systematic collaboration among themselves to promote  supervisory consistency, particularly for firms that provide similar  services.

Because each federal regulator oversees a different set of  institutions and has different perspectives and goals, reaching consensus  on some issues in developing the Basel II framework has been difficult  even though all of the agencies generally agree that limitations in the  current Basel I framework have rendered it increasingly inadequate for  supervising the capital adequacy of the largest, most complex banks. For  example, officials from FDIC have been concerned about the use of banks\u2019  risk-based capital models under Basel II because, while these models have  been used for internal risk assessment and management for years, with the  exception of certain market risk models, they are relatively unproven as a  regulatory capital tool, and questions remain about the reliability of data  underlying the models. To address some of these concerns, agencies have  proposed a number of safeguards in the proposed Basel II rule.

According to the NPR,  the framework is intended to produce more risk-sensitive capital  requirements than currently used by the agencies. The framework also  seeks to build upon improvements to risk assessment approaches adopted  by a number of large banks over the last decade.

In  January 2004, OCC issued two final rules that are jointly referred to as the  preemption rules. The \u201cbank activities\u201d rule addressed the applicability of  state laws to national banking activities, while the \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d rule  set forth OCC\u2019s view of its authority to inspect, examine, supervise, and  regulate national banks and their operating subsidiaries. The rules  addressed OCC\u2019s authority to preempt state laws that applied to operating  subsidiaries of national banks if those operating subsidiaries were  conducting banking activities permitted for the national bank itself.  However, the rules do not fully resolve uncertainties about the  applicability of state consumer protection laws, particularly those aimed at  preventing unfair and deceptive acts and practices. National banks are  subject to federal consumer protection laws, including the Federal Trade  Commission Act\u2019s prohibition of unfair or deceptive acts or practices. OCC  supervises national banks and helps to enforce their compliance with  these federal requirements. Opponents of OCC\u2019s position stated such  preemption would weaken consumer protections and the rules could  undermine the dual banking system, because state-chartered banks would  have an incentive to change their charters from state to federal since  national banks do not have to comply with state laws that apply to banking  activities and, to the extent that compliance with federal law is less costly  or burdensome than state regulation, the federal charter provides for  lower regulatory costs and easier access to markets. Supporters of the  rules asserted that providing consistent regulation for national banks,  rather than differing state regulatory regimes, was necessary to ensure  efficient nationwide operation of national banks.

FDIC would have continued to  oversee activities of state banks and thrifts that could pose risks to the  insurance funds and to resolve failures of insured banks.", "H.R. 1227 (1993). This proposal would have consolidated OCC and OTS in  an independent Federal Bank Agency and aligned responsibilities among  the new and existing agencies. It also would have reduced the multiplicity  of regulators to which a single banking organization could be subject while  avoiding the concentration of regulatory power of a single federal agency.  The role of the Federal Financial Institution Examination Council would  have been strengthened; it would have seen to the uniformity of  examinations, regulation, and supervision among the three remaining  supervisors. According to a Congressional Research Service (CRS)  analysis, this proposal would have put the Federal Reserve in charge of  more than 40 percent of banking organization assets, with the rest divided  between the new agency and a reorganized FDIC.   1994 LaWare proposal.

It called for a division of  responsibilities defined by charter class and a merging of OCC and OTS  responsibilities. The two primary agencies under the proposal would have  been an independent Federal Banking Commission and the Federal  Reserve, which would have supervised all independent state banks and  depository institutions in any holding company whose lead institution was  a state-chartered bank. The new agency would have supervised all  independent national banks and thrifts and depository institutions in any  banking organization whose lead institution was a national bank or thrift.  FDIC would not have examined financially healthy institutions, but would  have been authorized to join in examination of problem banking  institutions.

Effective  regulatory oversight would ensure that institutions conducting the  same lines of business or offering equivalent products are generally  subject to similar rules, standards, or guidelines for those lines of  business or products.  4.  Enhanced efficiency and reduced regulatory burden. By establishing  consolidated, comprehensive, and coordinated oversight and applying  consistent rules across similar activities, inefficiencies such as  duplication of effort and regulatory burden caused by reporting similar  data to multiple regulators, could be eliminated or reduced.", "A review of our work suggests three additional goals that would also be  important to improve regulatory effectiveness:  1.  Transparency in rule making. Transparency in rule making in an  environment where multiple regulators bring multiple goals and  perspectives would entail the maximum possible disclosure regarding  the intended goals of proposed regulations, the basis for the selection  of the regulatory approach, and planned evaluation of the implemented  regulation. This would help reduce industry uncertainty about, and  possible opposition to, proposed rules and their impact on the  industry. Transparency also would help to ensure consistent  expectations of regulators and the industry.  2.  Commitment to consumer and investor protection. Currently,  consumer protection (including consumers as investors) is  administered by a variety of agencies and can result in differential  regulation and the inequitable treatment of firms competing in the  same market. In addition, consumers can suffer if they receive  different levels of protection when they purchase different products  and services from different types of financial firms. Equal treatment  and equal access to credit also are important objectives.  3.  Ensuring safety and soundness. Ensuring a safe and sound banking  system and promoting financial system stability require a balance  between the need for effective regulatory oversight and the possibility  that too much oversight could hinder competition. Fulfilling this goal  also requires developing a system that limits the extension of the  federal safety net in order to encourage market as well as regulatory  discipline.", "Other organizations have noted the importance of clearly specified  regulatory goals for regulatory effectiveness. The Basel Committee on  Banking Supervision developed 25 core principles for effective banking  supervision that have been used by countries as a benchmark for assessing  the quality of their supervisory systems and for identifying a baseline level  of sound supervisory practices. The core principles are a framework of  minimum standards for sound supervisory practices and are considered  universally applicable. The first of the principles states that an effective  system of banking supervision will have clear responsibilities and  objectives for each authority involved in the supervision of banks.", "In August 2007, IMF issued a report regarding the findings of its  consultation with the United States as part of its mission to review U.S.  economic developments. IMF concluded that while the U.S. economy  continues to show remarkable dynamism and resilience, it faced important  challenges, such as the need to maintain a robust financial system. IMF  found that the current structure\u2019s multiple federal and state regulators  overseeing the evolving financial market system may limit regulatory  effectiveness and slow responses to pressing issues. Therefore, IMF  suggested the United States increase the use of general principles or goals  to guide financial regulation. According to IMF, general regulatory goals  may ease interagency coordination and shorten reaction times to industry  developments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Treasury Has Announced Plans to Consider Regulatory Structure Modernization", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of the Treasury recently announced an action plan that will  consider reforms to modernize the U.S. financial regulatory structure as  part of a plan to maintain the global leadership of U.S. capital markets.
