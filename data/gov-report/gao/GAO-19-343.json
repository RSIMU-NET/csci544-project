In their efforts to manage the buildings and grounds of the U.S. Capitol complex, AOC's jurisdictions have used the Division for projects that vary widely in cost, complexity, and duration (see figure). For example, over the last 5 fiscal years, the jurisdictions have used the Division for projects ranging in cost from about $1,000 to about $10 million and in scope from hazardous material testing to multiyear lighting-system upgrades. Jurisdiction officials cited the Division's flexibility in adjusting to scope and other changes to keep a project on schedule as one of the reasons they may decide to use the Division instead of an outside contractor. While jurisdiction officials said they were generally satisfied with the Division's services, officials from two jurisdictions suggested that the Division consider changing how it operates\u2014for example, by transferring some positions to its parent organization in an effort to lower what it charges the jurisdictions. According to AOC officials, making changes such as this one to the Division's operations could have varying effects, such as increasing how much funding AOC would require from other sources beyond the jurisdictions.", "The Division has taken steps to strategically manage its workforce to help ensure that it has the right number and composition of staff to meet the jurisdictions' needs but has not formalized the process it uses for collecting information on the jurisdictions' construction priorities each month. Because the Division's workload is driven by projects the jurisdictions hire it to perform, such things as changes in projects' priorities and work to be performed make determining future workforce needs challenging. The Division's approach to managing its workforce generally aligns with practices that GAO has previously identified that help agencies strategically manage their human capital. This approach includes having strategies to address gaps if the size and composition of an agency's workforce are not aligned with its workload requirements. However, because the Division has not formalized the process it uses to collect information each month on the jurisdictions' construction priorities it may miss opportunities to obtain information that is critical to making informed decisions. The Division also cannot provide reasonable assurance to AOC management and Congress that it is taking the steps necessary to manage its workload and that it is basing its workforce projections on the most current information available."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that AOC formalize the process the Division uses for collecting information on the jurisdictions' construction priorities each month, such as through developing written procedures.

This responsibility includes a number of buildings  that comprise the U.S. Capitol complex, including the U.S. Capitol, House  and Senate office buildings, the Library of Congress, the Supreme Court,  and the U.S. Botanic Garden. AOC is organized into 10 operational  jurisdictions, each of which is managed by a superintendent (or  equivalent), who oversees that jurisdiction. For renovations, repairs, and  new construction, the superintendents can use their own employees, a  private contractor, or AOC\u2019s Construction Division (hereafter the Division).  The Division is designed to be a flexible option for the jurisdictions and  operates in response to their needs. It is comprised primarily of trade  workers such as electricians, plumbers, and masons that it employs on a  temporary basis. In March 2017, AOC laid off 30 of the Division\u2019s  approximately 190 temporary employees, citing a lack of work from the  jurisdictions. While the number and types of temporary employees within  the Division are continually changing based on the work it is performing, the magnitude of this layoff raised questions about how AOC manages its  workload and workforce.", "You asked us to review the Division\u2019s role in supporting AOC\u2019s  jurisdictions, as well as the circumstances surrounding the March 2017  layoff of 30 of the Division\u2019s temporary employees.

In addition, we visited the sites of six projects that the  Division was executing at the time of our review. The projects we visited  were selected to enable us to understand the nature of the work the  Division performs for the jurisdictions; accordingly, the information we  provide regarding those projects is not generalizable to all projects the  Division performs for the jurisdictions. We also interviewed Division  officials and each of the jurisdictions\u2019 superintendents. During the  interviews, we asked superintendents what suggestions they had to  change the Division\u2019s operations and discussed with Division officials the  potential implications of those changes. We did not independently  evaluate the superintendents\u2019 suggestions or the implications of  implementing the superintendents\u2019 suggestions.", "To assess how the Division manages its workforce, we reviewed pertinent  documents, such as the Division\u2019s Organization and Operating Plan,  obtained and analyzed payroll data for the Division for fiscal years 2014  through 2018, and interviewed Division officials.

In addition, PPM manages systems that  span jurisdictions including electrical distribution and emergency  generators. PPM is also the parent organization of the Division, which  provides construction and facility management support to all of AOC\u2019s  jurisdictions.", "Established in the 1970s, the Division\u2019s mission is to \u201csupport AOC  jurisdictions serving their Congressional and Supreme Court clients by  providing high quality construction and craftsmanship with seamless  flexibility, best value, and extraordinary customer service, while protecting  our national treasures.\u201d The Division\u2019s operations are funded through a  mix of appropriations and project funding from the jurisdictions.  Specifically, according to AOC officials, the agency\u2019s appropriation for  Capital Construction and Operations provides the salaries and expenses  of up to 13 permanent staff. The salaries and expenses of the remaining  staff, as well as other costs (such as materials) are covered by the project  funding the Division receives from the jurisdictions. According to AOC  officials, essentially, the jurisdictions hire the Division to execute work on  their behalf, and the Division charges the jurisdictions for its expenses.", "As a result, the number and type of temporary employees the Division  employs at any given time is directly related to the projects it is  performing for the jurisdictions. As of October 2018, of the Division\u2019s 162  employees, 12 were permanent employees responsible for executive  management and administrative functions. The remaining 150 were  temporary employees\u2014124 trade workers and 26 construction support  employees\u2014that it hired under temporary (e.g., 13- or 24-month)  appointments. The trade workers include electricians, plumbers, masons,  woodcrafters and carpenters, cement finishers, sheet metal mechanics,  painters and plasterers, hazardous material abaters and insulators,  laborers, and warehouse and material handlers. The construction support  employees include personnel who perform activities such as construction  management, purchasing, and timekeeping.", "The Division\u2019s temporary employees are eligible for benefits. By law, AOC  is generally required to provide all temporary employees with \u201cthe same  eligibility for life insurance, health insurance and other benefits\u201d to  temporary employees who are hired for periods exceeding one year.  The benefits AOC\u2019s temporary employees receive may differ from what  other federal temporary employees in the executive branch receive since  these benefits vary depending on the type of temporary appointment and  the employing agency, among other things. For example, employees  serving under an appointment limited to 1 year or less are generally not  eligible for the Federal Employees\u2019 Group Life Insurance program.", "As previously stated, the Division pays for the salaries and expenses of  its temporary employees with project funding from the jurisdictions. That  project funding covers both the Division\u2019s direct and indirect costs. Direct  costs are those directly attributed to and expended on a project, such as  labor (i.e., trade workers) and materials. In contrast, indirect costs are  necessary costs that are not directly attributable to a specific project, such  as employee leave and training, as well as salaries for construction  support employees, such as supervisors and purchasing agents. To pay  for its indirect costs, the Division charges the jurisdictions what it calls an  \u201cindirect rate.\u201d As of October 2018, the Division\u2019s indirect rate was 0.85.  The Division applies this rate to every direct labor-hour associated with a  project it executes for the jurisdictions. For example, for a trade worker  with a hypothetical hourly cost of $45, the Division charges the  jurisdictions about $83, as shown in figure 2.", "For more information on the Division\u2019s direct and indirect costs, see  appendix II."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Jurisdictions Used the Division for a Wide Range of Projects, Citing Flexibility and Capacity as Key Factors, and Were Generally Satisfied with the Division\u2019s Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Jurisdictions Used the Division for a Wide Range of Projects", "paragraphs": ["Based on our analysis of the Division\u2019s data for projects completed during  fiscal years 2014 through 2018, the jurisdictions used the Division to  varying degrees for projects that ranged widely in terms of cost,  complexity, and duration.", "Cost: There was a wide range in the nominal cost of individual  projects the Division completed during fiscal years 2014 through  2018. The smallest individual project cost about $1,100 in 2017  dollars to perform hazardous materials testing in the Ford Office  Building for the House jurisdiction in fiscal year 2016. Larger projects  may be done in phases and when combined can cost millions of  dollars. For example, in 2015 the Division completed a lighting project  at the James Madison Building for the Library jurisdiction in two  phases at a total cost of about $9.8 million in 2017 dollars.", "Complexity: During this period, the Division\u2019s projects ranged from  work involving one type of activity or trade to work involving several  phases or many trades. For example, the Capitol Power Plant  jurisdiction used the Division for paint projects and a door  replacement. Other projects included the construction of a lactation  suite at the Ford House Office Building. For this 4-month project, the  Division performed carpentry, electrical work, hazardous materials  abatement, and other tasks in order to demolish an existing women\u2019s  restroom and build a lactation suite with an adjacent, smaller women\u2019s  restroom (see fig. 3).", "Duration: During this period, the jurisdictions used the Division for  projects that varied from quick turnaround projects that took a few  days to complete to longer, multi-year projects. Most (about 88  percent) of the projects were completed within one year, while about 4  percent were completed between 1 and 2 years, and about 8 percent  took 2 or more years to complete. For example, the Senate  jurisdiction used the Division for an elevator repair project in 2016 at  the Russell Office Building that took one day to complete while smoke  detector upgrades in the James Madison Building for the Library  jurisdiction took over 5 years and were completed in 2014. We also  identified several examples of projects that the Division did for  jurisdictions in phases. Sometimes the duration of the phases were  less than one year but when combined the work spanned multiple  years. For example, the Division built additional office spaces for staff  displaced by the House jurisdiction\u2019s renovation of the Cannon Office  Building. Each phase of the work was completed within one year, but  the work spanned almost 2 years from November 2014 to August  2016.", "The extent to which each of the jurisdictions used the Division also varied.  Based on our analysis of the Division\u2019s data and discussions with the  jurisdictions, the Library, House, and Senate jurisdictions were the  primary users of the Division during fiscal years 2014 through 2018,  comprising more than 90 percent of the total work by cost for completed  projects, as shown in figure 4. The Division completed projects exceeding  $1 million for each of these jurisdictions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Jurisdiction Officials Cited the Division\u2019s Flexibility and Capacity as Factors That Influence Decisions to Use the Division", "paragraphs": ["While jurisdictions have the option to use their own staff or a contractor  for projects, jurisdiction officials said they consider a range of factors  when determining whether to use the Division. They most frequently cited  the Division\u2019s flexibility in responding to scheduling and scoping changes  and the jurisdictions\u2019 own internal capacity to execute a project. They less  frequently cited other factors, such as the availability of appropriations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Flexibility", "paragraphs": ["Schedule: Jurisdiction officials said the Division provided scheduling  flexibility at no extra charge compared to using outside contractors.  According to jurisdiction officials, when projects require a great deal of  flexibility, the jurisdictions may be more likely to choose the Division over  a contractor because the Division can start and stop work as needed and  can work nights or on weekends if necessary to keep a project on  schedule without charging extra fees. For example, work on projects may  need to be stopped or delayed for a variety of reasons, such as for  security purposes if there is a protest near the worksite, or during a  presidential visit.", "Jurisdiction officials also noted that the Division can typically mobilize  faster than a contractor, a consideration that can be an important factor in  determining whether to use the Division. For example, jurisdiction officials  noted that the Division\u2019s employees can begin work faster than an outside  contractor because they have employee identification badges that  authorize access to most buildings across the Capitol complex without an  escort. 'Contractors must obtain a badge prior to accessing a work site  and require escorts in instances when they do not have an AOC or site- specific badge, and the process of obtaining a badge adds time to when a  contractor can begin work. As another example, jurisdiction officials also  told us that using a contractor requires that AOC develop full design  specifications for a project, a process that takes time and resources. In  contrast, the Division can execute work without full design specifications.  For example, Capitol Power Plant officials told us they used the Division  for renovations to their Administration Building because, according to the  officials, the Division started the work sooner, without design  specifications and thereby completed the project faster than a contractor  likely could have. Capitol Power Plant officials explained that the work\u2014 which included new carpet and painting\u2014was agreed upon with the  Division without spending time developing detailed design specifications  that would have been required to obtain a contractor for the work.", "Scope Changes: According to jurisdiction officials, the Division is  typically more flexible than a contractor when dealing with issues that  arise from unforeseen site conditions or changes to a project\u2019s scope. For  example, during the construction of the lactation suite discussed above,  the Division uncovered lead paint in the walls, requiring the work to stop  until the lead paint was removed. According to officials, contractors  typically charge for making changes to a project\u2019s scope, such as  removing hazardous materials uncovered during construction or  associated delays. The Division does not charge for making changes or  associated delays. This flexibility is because the Division charges based  on direct labor hours spent on a project, meaning its expenses are  charged as they are incurred. Accordingly, while a project\u2019s costs may  increase if more labor is charged to a project, the Division also has the  option of having its employees work on other projects if work on a  particular project has to stop.", "Jurisdiction officials told us that the Division also works with the  jurisdictions to save money on projects. According to officials, such  savings were the case during a 2-year project that the Division completed  at the Library jurisdiction\u2019s Jefferson Building in 2018 with a cost of $3.5  million in 2017 dollars. The project involved reversing the direction of  doors in high-occupancy areas to allow for more orderly evacuation of  occupants in the event of an emergency, as shown in figure 5. It also  involved replacing some of the building\u2019s historic doors and associated  hardware with replicas that meet modern safety standards. Officials told  us the Division helped the jurisdiction save about $1.2 million (in current  dollars) during the course of the project by identifying less expensive  materials for the project than originally planned for.", "Internal staff: Jurisdiction officials also told us that they use the Division  for projects when they lack the internal capacity to do so. Most of the  jurisdictions have some trade workers, such as electricians and plumbers,  on staff to handle their daily operations and maintenance needs.  Jurisdictions may execute smaller projects with their own employees but  may use the Division for projects beyond routine maintenance work that  their own employees cannot fit into their schedules. For example, officials  with the Senate jurisdiction told us that they have staff capable of  performing cabinetry work but have used the Division in the past for  cabinetry work so that their staff could focus on more routine  maintenance work. Senate jurisdiction officials also told us that they  primarily use their own staff for construction work, but will use the Division  as an option to supplement their staff when the volume of the Senate  jurisdiction\u2019s own workload is higher than what can be handled internally.", "Skill and equipment: Jurisdictions may use the Division if they lack the  skills or equipment to execute a particular project. Officials from five of the  jurisdictions told us that they have staff within their jurisdiction who can  execute small projects involving hazardous materials, such as lead paint  abatement under 2 square feet in size. Larger projects have additional  abatement requirements, and the jurisdictions have used the Division for  these projects. As another example, the Capitol Grounds jurisdiction used  the Division in 2016 to install the annual Christmas tree on the Capitol  lawn because the jurisdiction lacked the necessary equipment to do so.  The Botanic Garden jurisdiction, which does not employ any masons,  used the Division for a project at its Conservatory in 2016 because of the  Division\u2019s masonry expertise. Officials with the Senate jurisdiction also  cited the Division\u2019s masonry expertise among other factors, such as the  Division\u2019s familiarity with the jurisdiction\u2019s buildings, in selecting the  Division to repair the steps at the Russell Senate Office Building in 2017,  as shown in figure 6.", "Availability of appropriations: Jurisdiction officials told us that they  might not use the Division if the work cannot be completed by the time the  jurisdiction\u2019s appropriations expire. Specifically, because the jurisdictions  pay for the Division\u2019s services as work is executed rather than upfront  when the work is initiated, the jurisdictions must ensure that work by the  Division can be completed before their appropriations expire. Jurisdiction  officials told us that as a result, the Division may not be a realistic option  when using 1-year appropriations near the end of the fiscal year. In  contrast, when using a contractor, jurisdictions may obligate fixed period  appropriations prior to the end of the fiscal year for work that will continue  into the following fiscal year.", "Cost: Most jurisdiction officials said that a project\u2019s cost was not a key  factor they considered when determining whether to use the Division for a  project. When the jurisdictions are considering using a contractor they are  not required to obtain cost estimates from the Division first and generally  do not do so. As a result, comprehensive information on the relative costs  of using the Division compared to a contractor was not available.  However, in cases where the jurisdictions told us they did obtain  estimates from both the Division and a contractor, they said the cost to  use the Division was sometimes more expensive than a contractor and  sometimes less expensive, as illustrated in the following examples.", "Officials with the Supreme Court Building and Grounds jurisdiction  told us they used the Division to install a new heating, ventilation, and  air-conditioning system in one of its buildings after it obtained an  estimate from a contractor. According to officials, the project required  specialized skills that the Division\u2019s trade workers did not have.  However, once they received the contractor\u2019s estimate, the jurisdiction  officials determined it was cheaper to pay for the Division\u2019s employees  to get trained to do the project than using a contractor.", "Officials with the Senate jurisdiction told us they obtained cost  estimates for lead abatement work from both the Division and a  contractor several years ago. According to officials, the contractor\u2019s  estimate was less than that of the Division because the contractor  proposed using different equipment for the project than the Division,  and the jurisdiction used the contractor for the abatement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Jurisdiction Officials Reported They Were Generally Satisfied with the Division\u2019s Services; A Few Suggested Making Changes to Its Operations", "paragraphs": ["The jurisdiction officials we interviewed said they were generally satisfied  with the Division\u2019s services, including the quality of its work, and were  particularly satisfied with the flexibility the Division offers. Officials from  seven of the nine jurisdictions we interviewed also told us they would not  suggest making changes to how the Division currently operates.", "Officials from two of the jurisdictions suggested the organizational and  cost-allocation changes discussed below. According to Division officials,  implementing those suggestions would have implications for its  operations and structure, and would require additional research and  evaluation to determine if they are feasible.", "Transfer positions from the Division to its parent organization,  PPM: Officials from one jurisdiction suggested that the Division could  lower its indirect rate by transferring payroll responsibility for some  supervisory positions, such as its construction or safety managers,  from the Division to PPM. As discussed above, because the Division  does not receive an appropriation for the salaries and expenses of its  temporary construction support employees, it pays for those costs by  charging the jurisdictions for direct labor hours and also an \u201cindirect  rate.\u201d", "Division officials told us that payroll responsibility for some  construction support positions could be transferred to PPM and that  this transfer would reduce the Division\u2019s indirect rate because that  rate increases by about 1.1 percent for each employee captured in the  rate. Because PPM is the parent organization of the Division, this step  would not reduce the total costs of projects to AOC as an  organization; rather, it would transfer the responsibility for paying  certain costs from the jurisdictions to PPM. According to AOC officials,  this could have several effects. First, PPM would need to find a way to  fund those positions, which would likely require an increase in its  appropriations to cover additional positions. Second, transferring  supervisory positions to PPM could mean those personnel could be  tasked to support other AOC-wide efforts, rather than supervising and  managing the day-to-day execution of the Division\u2019s projects.  Similarly, Division officials told us that transferring supervisory  positions or support personnel such as purchasing agents to PPM  could reduce the Division\u2019s flexibility, such as its ability to hire  additional supervisors or support personnel if its workload increases in  the future.", "Make the Division\u2019s indirect rate variable: Officials with that same  jurisdiction suggested that the Division consider making its indirect  rate (which as of October 2018 was a fixed rate of 0.85) a variable  rate. Under a variable rate approach, projects would have different  rates depending on their needs. For example, a project requiring only  labor would be charged one rate, but a project requiring labor and  additional services, such as the purchasing of materials, would be  charged a higher rate. According to Division officials, charging the  jurisdictions varying rates depending on the extent to which a project  utilizes the Division\u2019s resources could reduce the cost for some  jurisdictions but increase it for others since the Division must charge  enough to recover all of its costs. Division officials told us AOC  evaluated this option in 2017 but decided against it. AOC determined  that making the Division\u2019s indirect rate variable would result in  increased administrative burden because the Division would have to  determine which projects and workhours would be variable and which  would not. It would then need to track and assess them differently for  each project.", "Provide additional on-site supervisors for complex multi-trade  projects: For most projects, the Division provides supervisors who  manage the day-to-day execution of multiple projects. However,  jurisdictions have the option to pay, as a direct cost, for dedicated, on- site supervisors to oversee and manage their projects exclusively.  Officials with one jurisdiction suggested that the Division make it  standard practice for complex, multi-trade projects to have a  dedicated, on-site supervisor. Division officials told us that having a  dedicated, on-site supervisor works best for complex, multi-trade  projects such as the East Phase of the House jurisdiction\u2019s 13-month,  $15 million child care center project that the Division completed in  December 2018 (see fig. 7).", "According to Division officials, having dedicated, on-site supervisors day  and night during construction enabled the project to remain on schedule  and below budget because the supervisors were responsible for  overseeing all construction activities and could immediately address  questions or concerns that arose, thereby resulting in increased efficiency  and cost savings. Division officials told us that while the project\u2019s scope  increased during execution, the Division was able to work additional  nights and weekends to meet the project\u2019s deadline. Even with additional  scope, Division officials estimated that they have saved the House  jurisdiction about $500,000 (in current dollars) on the project through  increased oversight and by identifying areas of cost savings, such as  purchasing less expensive lighting fixtures than called for in the design."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "The Division Has Taken Steps to Strategically Manage Its Workforce but Does Not Have a Formalized Process for Collecting Some Information", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Uncertainties Make Anticipating the Division\u2019s Workforce Needs Challenging", "paragraphs": ["The variability of the Division\u2019s workload makes anticipating the  necessary size (number of employees) and composition (mix of trades  and number of employees within each trade) of its workforce challenging.  AOC has reported to Congress that the primary drivers behind the size  and composition of the Division\u2019s workforce have been project demand  and the availability of funding. As previously discussed, the Division\u2019s  workload is driven by projects the jurisdictions hire it to perform. Without  projects to execute for the jurisdictions, the Division does not have  funding to pay the salaries and expenses of most of its employees.  Accordingly, the size of the Division\u2019s workforce expands and contracts in  response to the jurisdictions\u2019 demand for work. For example, over the last  5 fiscal years, the size of the Division\u2019s trade workforce has fluctuated  between a high of 191 in fiscal year 2016 and a low of 121 in fiscal year  2018. During that period, the number of employees the Division employed  within each trade also fluctuated.", "Several factors contribute to the variability of the Division\u2019s workload and  make determining its future workforce needs challenging. First, officials  told us that the Division has no control over whether the jurisdictions use  the Division for their projects. Second, even if a jurisdiction decides to use  the Division, Division officials told us that projects are notional or  uncertain until that jurisdiction signs a project agreement, among other  things. Third, even with a signed agreement, jurisdictions can reduce a  project\u2019s scope or cancel it all together, a situation that can leave the  Division searching to find work for the trade workers it planned to use for the project. Finally, differing project priorities also come into play, as both  Division officials and representatives from three of the jurisdictions  acknowledged that some projects and work for certain jurisdictions are a  higher priority than others. According to officials, when priority or  emergency projects arise, the timing and work for ongoing projects can  be affected as trade workers are shifted to the priority or emergency. In  some cases, the on-going project may continue at a slower pace with  fewer workers and in other cases all work might be stopped for a period  of time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Division Has Taken Steps to Anticipate Its Workforce Needs but Lacks a Formalized Process for Collecting Information on the Jurisdictions\u2019 Construction Priorities", "paragraphs": ["Over the last several years the Division has made efforts to strategically  manage its workforce to help ensure that it has the right number and  composition of employees to meet the jurisdictions\u2019 needs.

According to Division officials, its staff are in  frequent contact with the jurisdictions and meet periodically with the  jurisdictions to discuss the status of ongoing and future projects. The  officials said that Division staff meet bi-weekly with the larger  jurisdictions\u2014such as the Senate, House, and Library\u2014and monthly or  as needed with others as well as with PPM on a weekly basis to discuss  the status of projects and workforce needs. According to Division officials,  this regular communication with the jurisdictions is their primary and most  important method of identifying and addressing workload issues or  concerns. Jurisdiction officials echoed the Division\u2019s comments, noting  that they are in frequent contact with staff from the Division or as needed.", "Base workforce decisions on current needs and future projections:  Over the last several years, the Division has taken steps to improve how  it collects and tracks information from the jurisdictions upon which to base  its future workforce projections. Prior to 2015, the Division used a paper- based process to collect information on the jurisdictions\u2019 work requests  and tracked information on a spreadsheet. In 2015, the Division  implemented a software tool called the Construction Division  Management System (CDMS) to streamline that process, making it easier  for the jurisdictions to submit requests for work. For example, using  CDMS, the Division can now electronically collect information for ongoing  projects from the jurisdictions, such as change orders and schedule  updates, and the jurisdictions can electronically submit requests for cost  or schedule information for future projects. According to Division officials,  Construction Managers, who are familiar with the resource needs of  individual projects, are responsible for updating and validating the  information in CDMS\u2014typically bi-weekly\u2014and the information in CDMS  is available to the jurisdictions to review and verify.", "More recently, in July 2017, the Division hired a scheduler to develop  resource-loaded schedules for ongoing projects. This involves assigning  labor, materials, equipment, and other resources to a project\u2019s schedule.  According to Division officials, currently, the Division develops resource- loaded schedules for about 70 percent of its workload as the projects that  comprise its remaining workload are too small or short-term for such  schedules. In addition, in October 2017, the Division began collecting  additional information on the jurisdictions\u2019 construction priorities through a  monthly data call. As part of this data call, which the Division performs via  email, the Division requests updated information from the jurisdictions on  their current projects, such as the expected start date or whether minor  tasks remain, and the status of potential future projects. Using the  information the Division collects from the jurisdictions, officials told us it  then forecasts its workload and workforce needs out over the succeeding  12 months. According to officials, those projections are an \u201cart, not a  science,\u201d because of the uncertainties surrounding the Division\u2019s  workload.", "However, the Division has not formalized the process it uses to collect  information about the jurisdictions\u2019 construction priorities. Specifically, we  found that the Division lacks a written set of procedures for the monthly  data call discussed above to help ensure that staff understand who is  responsible for collecting information, what information should be  collected, and when that information should be collected. This lack of  procedures led to a situation in July 2018 where, according to officials,  the Division did not conduct that data call but has since set calendar  reminders for key staff in an effort to help ensure they do not miss it  again. While setting such reminders may have some benefit now, it does  not ensure that others within AOC will execute that data call in the future.  Formalized processes, such as written procedures, can help ensure that  steps an agency is taking can be implemented in a predictable,  repeatable, and accountable way. Such procedures are also a key  component of internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance  that an organization\u2019s operations are effective and efficient. AOC  officials agreed that a more formalized process for collecting information  about the jurisdictions\u2019 construction priorities could help ensure the data is  collected consistently. It would also better position AOC management to  ensure that the Division\u2019s process will be implemented consistently and  that the jurisdictions understand what information is expected of them. It  could also provide reasonable assurance to AOC management and  Congress that the Division is taking the steps necessary to manage its  workload and basing its workforce projections on the most current  information available.", "Have strategies to address workforce gaps: The Division has a  number of strategies it can employ if the size and composition of its  workforce are not aligned with its workload requirements. For example,  officials told us the Division can utilize direct-hire authority to quickly fill  positions if there is a shortage of employees with specific skillsets to meet  the jurisdictions\u2019 needs. Officials told us employees may also work  overtime to meet the jurisdictions\u2019 needs if the Division\u2019s workload  projections do not show a need to hire additional employees. In instances  where there is a lack of work, officials told us the Division has the options  of not renewing the appointments of its temporary employees; helping  affected employees in finding positions in jurisdictions to the extent  practicable; or, if necessary, lay off affected employees, as it did in March  2017.", "Division officials told us they are also exploring additional strategies to  help address potential instances where the size and composition of its  workforce are not aligned with its workload requirements moving forward.  One potential strategy involves using the Division to help address AOC\u2019s  backlog of deferred maintenance and capital renewal, which AOC  estimated in 2017 was about $1.4 billion. Another potential strategy  involves working with the jurisdictions to establish more large projects that  provide a stable amount of work over a period of time. An example of a  recent such project is the East Phase of the O\u2019Neill Child Care Center  project. According to Division officials, around 25\u201330 trade workers  worked at the site at any given time, providing stability and work for  multiple trades. When work on other projects was delayed or did not  materialize, the Division was able to move the trade workers to the child  care project.", "Monitor progress: Over the last several years the Division has taken  steps to monitor the accuracy of its workload and workforce projections  by discussing its projections with AOC management, including the  Architect of the Capitol and the superintendents of the jurisdictions, each  month. According to officials, the Division began these monthly briefings  for AOC\u2019s management in December 2016, when its workload decreased  due to the completion of work related to the renovation of the Cannon  Office Building. During these briefings, Division staff provide the Architect  of the Capitol and the superintendents with information on the Division\u2019s  active, committed, and potential projects over the next several months.  According to Division officials, these briefings provide an opportunity to  discuss with AOC\u2019s management any issues or concerns they have with  the Division\u2019s workload.", "The Division employed the practices described above in the months  leading up to the March 2017 layoff of the 30 temporary employees.  Division officials told us that 5 to 6 months prior to March 2017, they  anticipated a potential decline in the Division\u2019s workload and worked with  the jurisdictions to identify potential projects that the Division could  execute, but sufficient additional projects did not materialize. During this  process, the Division involved PPM, the jurisdictions, and AOC\u2019s  management, among others. The efforts to minimize the number of  employees affected by any layoffs included identifying job openings within  the jurisdictions that employees could apply for. According to officials, one  employee was hired by the Senate jurisdiction, another by the Capitol  Grounds jurisdiction, and a third by the Office of the Chief Administrative  Officer in the House, prior to the layoff.", "During the course of our review, we observed that the Division employed  these strategies. Specifically, Division officials told us that they  anticipated there might be a potential decline in the Division\u2019s workload in  early 2019. The Division raised this potential with AOC\u2019s management  during the summer of 2018, and officials told us the issue was resolved  once the House and Library jurisdictions identified several projects that  the Division could execute beginning in 2019."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "AOC\u2019s Appointment and Subsequent Lay Off of Temporary Employees in March 2017 Followed Applicable Practices and Policy", "paragraphs": ["AOC\u2019s authority to appoint and remove its employees is governed by title  2 of the U.S. Code and AOC has established various practices and policy  related to their terms of employment.

In this particular situation, the Division  officials said they determined the number of temporary employees  needed to carry out its projected workload and considered two factors  equally: (1) the employees\u2019 performance and skillset and (2) the  employees\u2019 ability to work independently and as part of a team. Human  capital officials told us that AOC\u2019s offices of Employee and Labor  Relations and its General Counsel reviewed the Division\u2019s request, and  found no human-capital or legal concerns. The human capital officials  drafted letters notifying the 30 employees of their layoff, effective upon receipt.

Human capital officials told us that they did not provide  the Division\u2019s temporary employees with advance notice of their layoff  because of concerns that such advance notice could result in an  unproductive and disruptive work environment. In terms of notifying  relevant employee unions, human capital officials said they provided 12- hour advance notification of the layoff to one employee union, in  accordance with that union\u2019s collective-bargaining agreement. The five  rehired employees we interviewed told us they were caught off guard by  the March 2017 layoffs.

According to AOC\u2019s  Chief Human Capital Officer, some jurisdictions provided advance notice  of layoffs to temporary employees while others did not. To provide  consistency with such notification and in response to our inquiries, in  October 2018 AOC issued guidance standardizing the notification period  for temporary employees laid off due to lack of work or lack of funds  across all jurisdictions. This guidance directs jurisdictions to provide all  temporary employees with a notification period of 2-weeks prior to the  effective date of being laid off for these reasons.

We  focused our discussion of these data to the cost, scope, and duration of  projects and do not present information on the number of completed  projects because of differences in how the jurisdictions identify projects.  To assess the reliability of the Division\u2019s data, we reviewed available  documentation and interviewed agency officials. We determined that the  Division\u2019s project data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report, which includes describing the type and cost of projects the  Division completed for the jurisdictions over the last 5 fiscal years and  identifying illustrative examples of those projects. For appropriate  comparison, the costs of completed projects we present in our report  have been adjusted for inflation and converted to 2017 dollars using the  fiscal-year gross domestic product index, which is compiled by the U.S.  Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis. We attempted  to obtain comparable data for projects where the jurisdictions used their  own employees or a contractor, but these data were not readily available.  With respect to the jurisdictions\u2019 use of their own employees, the Capitol  Building jurisdiction attempted to obtain this data for us, but the data that  were available did not include the cost of all labor spent on projects.  Further, according to AOC, the jurisdictions do not capture data on  employees\u2019 time spent on construction work so this data also included  projects that were considered routine maintenance. With respect to the  jurisdictions\u2019 use of contractors, the data that were available also included  purchase card transactions, among other unrelated costs. According to  AOC, identifying just the contract costs of the jurisdictions\u2019 construction  projects would require that AOC conduct significant research and review  every transaction associated with its contracts.", "To provide illustrative examples, we visited the sites of six projects that  the Division was executing at the time of our review. To select these  projects, we asked the agency to provide us with projects that would  enable us to understand the nature of the work the Division performs for  the jurisdictions.

As of October 2018,  the Division\u2019s indirect rate was 0.85. The Division applies this rate to  every direct labor-hour associated with a project it performs for the  jurisdictions. For example, a trade worker that the Division employs who  has a hypothetical hourly cost of $45 also has an indirect cost of about  $38. Accordingly, that trade worker\u2019s total hourly cost, which the Division  charges the jurisdictions, is about $83.", "The Division developed the methodology for its indirect rate in 2012, in  consultation with the Architect of the Capitol\u2019s (AOC) Chief Financial  Officer and the jurisdictions, after it determined that its funding model at  that time did not adequately recover costs that were not directly  attributable to projects. According to the Division, the primary driver for  developing this indirect rate was employee leave. Specifically, the  Division\u2019s employees earn about 11 hours of leave per pay period, and  funds to cover that leave need to be recovered because they cannot be  obligated and charged to a project at the time the leave is earned but  prior to its being taken by the employee. The Division allocates its indirect  costs among the jurisdictions, using statutory authorities available to the  Architect of the Capitol.", "According to AOC officials, historically, the Division\u2019s indirect rate was  determined by staff within the Division. The rate was determined by  looking at historical cost and project data over the two prior fiscal years.
