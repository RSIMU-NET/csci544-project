Some panelists, however, were critical of the three programs\u2019 guidance overall, noting that the guidance emphasizes the early determination and design stages to the detriment of the monitoring and evaluation stages, emphasizes wetlands to the detriment of uplands or adjacent lands, or fails to require corrective actions in those instances where projects do not succeed.", "In commenting on the strengths of the Civil Work\u2019s guidance, some panelists indicated that the guidance emphasizes an ecosystem approach and considers adjacent lands and uplands; includes a good integration of other agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities and the various laws and policies; or provides good technical guidance for the design, construction, and monitoring stages. The majority of panelists, however, criticized the Corps\u2019 reliance on economic tradeoffs to determine the acceptable mitigation alternatives as presented in the Economic and Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related Land Resources Implementation Studies. Several panelists indicated that the Corps\u2019 reliance on this guidance interferes with the current thinking, which emphasizes selecting the least damaging alternative and considering adjacent lands when determining which alternative to select. In addition, some panelists criticized the Civil Works guidance as possibly being too broad, too detailed, incomplete as it relates to determining how much and what kind of mitigation should be undertaken, lacking examples of mitigation, or not current because it does not consider mitigation activities in a landscape context.", "In assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the Corps\u2019 Regulatory Program\u2019s guidance, the panelists primarily commented on the recently issued October 2001 Regulatory Guidance Letter. The panelists generally viewed the new guidance as an improvement over existing guidance because it is clearer, simpler, and more in line with current technical findings; strengthens the importance of watershed contextand functionality of affected areas; enhances the existing guidance in the areas of determination and evaluation and places new emphasis on ecosystems rather than citing a preference for on-site in-kind mitigation; suggests the consideration of landscape setting and indicates a continuing evolution to a function-based approach to mitigation; is a positive step toward helping assess and quantify the amount of mitigation that is required; calls for monitoring to be included as a permit condition; or  provides more definitive instructions on how to determine mitigation ratios and types of mitigation, and addresses the long-term viability of mitigation through establishing success criteria.", "While complimenting the new guidance, panelists also identified weaknesses. Namely, it still lacks the details and performance measures to truly advance wetlands protection; continues to need to strengthen monitoring and evaluation activities; still lacks sufficient specifics on how much and what type of mitigation is needed and what functions should be replaced;  does not provide specifics on how landscape settings should be allows credit for efforts undertaken in uplands, which means that wetlands functions and values will less likely be replaced in those situations; or continues to lack guidance on the minimum requirements of a conceptual mitigation plan.", "In assessing the Highway Program\u2019s guidance, panelists were generally more complimentary of its content and presentation than of the Corps\u2019 guidance. Several panelists found the guidance to  be clearer and more focused;  be more effective in communicating current thinking;  be more user-friendly, with a step-by-step format;  provide the right amount of background information and technical include design options and examples;  be stronger than the Corps\u2019 guidance in ensuring the long-run viability of the project because it calls for a compensation ratio greater than 1 to 1; or  be more professionally presented because it allows the exercise of professional judgment.", "Panelists cited few weaknesses with the Highway Program\u2019s guidance, and they did not point out the same weaknesses. For example, one panelist noted that monitoring activities involved monitoring compliance with the mitigation design rather than with measuring the functions and values to determine replacement success. This same panelist reported that more monitoring of construction is needed because mitigation will fail because of construction flaws and not because of design problems. Another panelist found that the guidance overemphasizes the use of mitigation banks, which may not always be appropriate.", "One panelist appeared to sum up the panelists\u2019 comments, stating \u201c. . . he three programs reviewed are within reach of mitigating many, but not all types of wetland habitats for fish and wildlife. . . . .

In terms of format, almost all the panelists suggested the need for a single, unified body of guidance that would include both the regulatory and technical details necessary to effect successful mitigation. Doing so, according to some panelists, would improve the usability and readability of the guidance and better achieve consistency in operations and results. Among the suggested improvements, panelists recommended that the unified guidance include  user-friendly, step-by-step instructions that tell applicants when they have to mitigate and that provide a general idea of how much mitigation will be required; current guidance regularly updated on a website; annotated outlines, more illustrations, case studies, and examples of lessons learned from past failures or successes and the reasons for them; a requirement for an operations, maintenance, and rehabilitation funding plan to provide greater assurance that all project services will be provided over a broad range of contingencies; a technically appropriate and consistent set of sampling measures applied throughout all stages of mitigation; or  opportunities for flexibility and the exercise of professional judgment.", "Regarding the content of the guidance, some panelists strongly urged that more guidance be included on the monitoring and evaluation aspects of mitigation projects. Two panelists recommended ongoing\u2014\u201clife cycle\u201d\u2014 monitoring to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation in light of explicit performance criteria and to provide a rationale for corrective action where appropriate. Some panelists suggested that the expanded monitoring and evaluation requirements should include systems to provide for feedback of evaluation results or that a separate budget be designated for monitoring and evaluation to ensure that adequate data be collected to determine project success.", "Panelists also suggested that the content of the current guidance be expanded to more fully include discussions on uplands species and habitat other than vegetated wetlands, such as open waters, streams, or stream banks. In addition, most of the panelists suggested that the current guidance more fully discuss the functions and values and how to determine the best way to replace them. According to one panelist, once the key functions are determined, general guidance should exist on how to translate the replacement of these functions into compensation ratios and combinations of in-kind and out-of-kind mitigation to ensure that the key functions are replaced. Another panelist suggested that permits should be denied if the functions and values will not be compensated and indicated that this requirement would decrease the likelihood of environmental degradation and increase the likelihood of successfully replacing lost functions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Panel\u2019s Estimation of Achieving Successful Mitigation", "paragraphs": ["We asked the panelists to estimate the percentage of success that mitigation projects could be expected to achieve in restoring the natural hydrologic conditions and native vegetation, and otherwise supporting native fish and wildlife species, under two circumstances: (1) if the present mitigation guidance were followed and (2) if the guidance were followed after being improved in the ways panelists proposed. Some panelists expressed concern in providing estimates because of (1) a lack of an empirical basis for any estimate, (2) insufficient first-hand knowledge about how closely the guidance is being followed, (3) insufficient basis for connecting success or failure with the degree to which the guidance was followed, or (4) a lack of knowledge about the competencies of the persons implementing the guidance. The panelists emphasized that any numbers provided would not be reliable, and GAO agrees.", "Panelists did, however, provide insights to the primary factors, other than the guidance, that could prevent a project from restoring hydrologic conditions, restoring native vegetation, and otherwise supporting native fish and wildlife species. The panel explained that project success could be affected by lack of experience or competence of those doing the work, or lack of proper project management; cost constraints or inadequate funding;  poor site selection, poor construction, or improper implementation of lack of control and/or lack of attention to surrounding landscape conditions, or external influences from adjacent areas such as urban development, heavy infestations of exotic species, and human and animal impacts;  unexpected conditions, such as major storms, that are difficult to control or manage or invasive weeds or wildlife species that dominate the site unexpectedly; inadequate monitoring for fish and wildlife values and more focus on the easier measurement of hydrology and vegetation success;  monitoring to determine compliance with the design plan rather than monitoring functions and values, thus failing to account for poor designs; lack of available biological materials, such as no seed bank;  problems in creating some types of wetlands because they are inherently difficult to replicate (peat bogs being the extreme example);  wetlands that cover extremely small areas, or appropriate land is  not ensuring that corrective measures will be taken for failures in the restoration project after construction; or  not fully restoring lost hydrology or vegetation if mitigation banks are used to compensate for losses in different watersheds.", "One panelist noted that a certain percentage of all restorations will fail in the attempt to restore native vegetation and wildlife. According to the panelist, the failure rate for \u201ccreated\u201d wetlands and other habitats is much higher than for restored sites, so it is important to distinguish the type of site being discussed. Another panelist stated that in some situations, lost functions and values are impossible to replace because of their location within the watershed, the lack of mitigation sites within the watershed, or the type of wetlands that were damaged.", "A third panelist noted that, in general, restoring \u201cnatural hydrologic conditions\u201d is only possible in \u201crestoration\u201d efforts (rather than \u201ccreation\u201d or \u201cenhancement\u201d efforts or both), and this is only a portion of the compensation activities undertaken in these programs. According to the panelist, restoration of natural conditions is most likely to succeed when the impacts of projects occur only on the site under restoration. In all other circumstances, the panelist said, the probability of success diminishes regardless of the technical sophistication of the practitioner. Furthermore, restoring native vegetation is theoretically possible only when appropriate natural hydrologic conditions have been established. Therefore, success in this effort cannot exceed the success in hydrologic engineering. In addition, restoring native fish and wildlife species is more difficult, generally because the surrounding area has been affected, and thus the landscape setting is uncontrollably altered. In the panelist\u2019s view, restoration of a natural community of species on compensatory mitigation sites is exceptionally difficult."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Views of the Agencies", "paragraphs": ["We provided the Departments of  Transportation and Defense with copies of the draft report for review and comment.

However, we did not review or evaluate the Corps' overall compliance with section 906 nor did we reach any conclusion in this regard. Additionally, the department clarified that for three projects identified in appendix II for which mitigation had not begun, mitigation is scheduled for later in the construction sequence because site conditions do not allow mitigation to occur earlier.

They indicated that this determination is aided by a clear, long-standing sequential definition of \u201cmitigation\u201d that requires avoidance first, then minimization of impact, and finally mitigation of unavoidable impacts. According to one panelist, however, while the governmentwide guidance provides definitions and indications of desired outcomes, the governmentwide guidance stops short of specifying exactly when or how a program should make a case-specific determination that compensatory mitigation is necessary and/or how much should be required. This panelist indicated that none of the three programs have explicit guidance for determining whether compensatory mitigation is required, and the outcome apparently is more a result of due diligence and quality of staff than quality of regulatory guidance.", "Various panelists indicated that strengths of the Civil Works Program\u2019s guidance include detailed planning formulation guidance and state-of-the- art planning tools, emphasis on the ecosystem approach and the inclusion of adjacent lands, or the emphasis on resource evaluation to determine the mitigation needed.

As one panelist pointed out, the design stage is considered more a technical element of mitigation and not as subject to policy guidance as are other stages such as the determination and evaluation stages. Panelists\u2019 generalized comments related to the Wetlands Engineering Handbook and included both strengths and weaknesses. Specifically, some panelists believed that the handbook includes detailed background on wetlands and statistical evaluation techniques; is relatively complete, reasonably current, and very clear; or as one panelist put it, the handbook provides very good technical information on the design, construction, and monitoring of wetland ecosystems. According to the panelist, the information is timeless and remains a standard in the field of mitigation. Yet, other panelists cited weaknesses with the same handbook. Namely, one panelist said that it does not provide a comprehensive explanation of how to design a replacement wetland and puts emphasis only on one technique to evaluate functions, even though the technique has been criticized by wetlands professionals. The panelist further stated that the handbook is very complicated to follow with its overemphasis on statistical techniques over basic design procedures. Another panelist criticized the handbook as addressing the structural aspects of viability but paying little attention to long-term habitat function. Panelists pointed out that the guidance at this stage was weak in the areas of non-wetland fish and wildlife and upland mitigation, such as open waters, streams, stream banks and uplands, and in fact, the guidance was heavily focused on wetland mitigation.", "Regarding the Civil Works Program\u2019s guidance, two panelists commented on the strength of the guidance. One panelist indicated that the guidance generally includes a relatively complete description of the parameters needed to design a successful and effective wetlands mitigation project and has sufficient criteria on uplands, land use, and other offsite factors. Another panelist said the guidance has enough information related to policy that is pertinent in the selection of the conceptual design; and case studies that are informative and provide constructive insight in applying the principles and techniques to other types of mitigation work. Three panelists, however, cited weaknesses in the Corps\u2019 guidance for this stage. Among the weaknesses cited were that practitioners will need more specific technical guidance because the guidance addresses various administrative attributes of the process rather than the mitigation aspects of projects; the guidance includes a few examples of projects but should include more and the examples should be discussed in greater detail; the guidance sets out how the design criteria should be applied, but is sometimes confusing and overly complex in its presentation; or the guidance lacks specific technical information other than to address simple hydrology and soil factors.", "Two panelists commented about the Regulatory Program\u2019s new guidance when reflecting on this stage. One panelist indicated that the new guidance strengthened existing guidance by emphasizing the need to integrate buffer zone design into the plans. Another panelist indicated that the new approach cited in the guidance potentially provides a better mechanism for designing a successful replacement project; that the new guidance begins to set out the user-friendly, step-by-step set of instructions that previously had been missing; and that the new guidance makes the design stage guidance clearer and broader in at least some respects and clarifies some of the previous vagueness. While basically complimenting the new guidance, however, this panelist indicated that in other respects, the new guidance is not an improvement because it provides more flexibility than it should\u2014for example, awarding credits for preservation\u2014that does not serve to fulfill the goal of replacing lost functions and values.", "Panelists cited some strengths in the Highway Program\u2019s guidance for this stage.

Further, this panelist indicated that the guidance provides excellent detail and good examples of the design stage, offers several alternative methods to assess wetland functions, and provides an excellent tool for learning how to design and construct wetland replacement projects. Another panelist indicated that while the guidance primarily relates to wetlands, it is very user-friendly both in information and format; the overall process is clear, logical, and comprehensive; from a viability perspective, the guidance is more effective because it links the need to replace lost functions at each step in the process; and the discussion on applying a cost analysis is more instructive and easier to apply than the Corps\u2019 guidance. Yet, this panelist also indicated that the guidance suffers from the absence of information gained and lessons learned over the last 5 years and that some of the guidance conflicts with other documents. Finally, a third panelist indicated that the guidance provided good information to help in developing mitigation designs, promoted site analysis, and included sound and consistent logic for investigating site characteristics needed for sustaining wetlands.

One panelist indicated that the Corps\u2019 Regulatory Program\u2019s new guidance better explains when off-site mitigation is appropriate and that it ensures that the compensatory mitigation project will include design elements that deal with the entire ecosystem."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Viable", "paragraphs": ["In this assessment, panelists were to consider whether the guidance for the three programs presents sufficient information to best ensure the success of the project.

For two stages\u2014determination and evaluation\u2014most of the panelists rated the Civil Works Program\u2019s guidance lower than the Highway Program\u2019s guidance. For two other stages\u2014design and monitoring\u2014most panelists rated the two programs\u2019 guidance the same. For the remaining stage\u2014construction\u2014an equal number of panelists rated the Civil Works Program\u2019s guidance the same as or lower than the Highway Program\u2019s guidance. One panelist indicated that the guidance for the evaluation stage for all three programs does not provide confidence that completed projects will successfully meet their performance objectives. Panelists\u2019 narrative comments generally did not include comments for weaknesses in the Civil Works\u2019 guidance and strengths in the Highway Program\u2019s guidance. One panelist, however, criticized the Civil Works\u2019 guidance because it contained no requirement to reconsider the proposed project if the compensatory mitigation project is not likely to succeed, that the information in the guidance is unlikely to lead to the replacement of habitat losses in at least some instances, and that the guidance does not consider the impact of the mitigation project on adjacent lands. Conversely, this panelist indicated that the Highway Program\u2019s guidance was more effective because it calls for a compensatory mitigation ratio of 1.5 to 1, it clearly states that no net loss goal applies only to wetlands, and the guidance allows funding for the establishment period to increase the likelihood of project success. One panelist indicated that the new Regulatory Program\u2019s guidance provided more definitive instructions on how to determine mitigation ratios and types of mitigation and addressed the long-term viability of mitigation through establishing success criteria while another panelist pointed out that strengthening the financial assurances requirements also will improve a project\u2019s chance for long-term success."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Panel of Scientific Experts, Technical Adviser, and Expert Reviewers", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Panel of Scientific Experts", "paragraphs": ["Robert P.
