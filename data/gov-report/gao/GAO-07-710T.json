First, Congress created the interagency National Intellectual Property Rights Law Enforcement Coordination Council (NIPLECC) in 1999. Later, in October 2004, the Bush administration initiated the Strategy Targeting Organized Piracy (STOP). GAO's testimony focuses on (1) the effectiveness of NIPLECC and STOP as a coordinating structure to guide and manage U.S. government efforts; and (2) the extent to which STOP meets the criteria for an effective national strategy. This statement is based on GAO's November 2006 report (GAO-07-74), which included an assessment of STOP using criteria previously developed by GAO. In this report, we recommended that head of NIPLECC, called the IP Coordinator, in consultation with the National Security Council and relevant agencies (1) clarify in the STOP strategy how NIPLECC will carry out its oversight and accountability roles and (2) take steps to ensure that STOP fully addresses the characteristics of a national strategy. The IP Coordinator concurred with our recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The current coordinating structure that has evolved for protecting and enforcing U.S. intellectual property rights lacks leadership and permanence, presenting challenges for effective and viable coordination for the long term. NIPLECC has struggled to define its purpose and retains an image of inactivity among the private sector. It continues to have leadership problems despite enhancements made by Congress in December 2004 to strengthen its role. In contrast, the presidential initiative called STOP, which is led by the National Security Council, has a positive image compared to NIPLECC, but lacks permanence since its authority and influence could disappear after the current administration leaves office. While NIPLECC adopted STOP in February 2006 as its strategy for protecting IP overseas, its commitment to implementing STOP as an effective national strategy remains unclear, creating challenges for accountability and long-term viability. While STOP has energized agency efforts for protecting and enforcing intellectual property, its potential as a national strategy is limited since it does not fully address the desirable characteristics of an effective national strategy. For example, its performance measures lack baselines and targets to assess how well the activities are being implemented. In addition, STOP is missing key elements such as a discussion of risk management and designation of oversight responsibility. For instance, the strategy lacks a discussion of current or future costs, the types or sources of investments needed to target organized piracy, and processes to effectively balance the threats from counterfeit products with the resources available. While STOP partially addresses organizational roles and responsibilities, it does not discuss a framework for accountability among the STOP agencies, such as designating responsibility for oversight. Agency documents clarify some of the key elements of an effective national strategy that were not incorporated into STOP directly; however, the need to consult multiple documents underscores the strategy's lack of integration and limited usefulness as a management tool for effective oversight and accountability."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to appear before the subcommittee to  discuss our work on U.S. efforts to protect U.S. intellectual property (IP)  rights. We appreciate the opportunity to further contribute to this  discussion within the Congress. U.S. government efforts to protect and  enforce intellectual property rights domestically and overseas are crucial  to preventing billions of dollars in losses to U.S. industry and IP rights  owners and addressing health and safety risks resulting from the trade in  counterfeit and pirated goods. IP protection and enforcement cut across a  wide range of U.S. agencies and functions, as well as those of foreign  governments, making coordination among all parties essential. Many of  these efforts are coordinated through the interagency National Intellectual  Property Law Enforcement Coordination Council (NIPLECC), created by  Congress in 1999, and the Strategy for Targeting Organized Piracy (STOP)  initiated by the White House in 2004. While NIPLECC is a coordinating  council, STOP is a strategy coordinated by the National Security Council.", "In my statement today, I will address two topics on IP enforcement: (1) the  effectiveness of NIPLECC and STOP as a coordinating structure to guide  and manage U.S. government efforts; and (2) the extent to which STOP  meets the criteria for an effective national strategy. I am aware, Mr.  Chairman, that you have co-sponsored proposed legislation to address  some of the shortcomings of the current coordinating structure which  impede effective IP enforcement and coordination. In my statement today  I will include some observations on how the proposed legislation  addresses key weaknesses we have identified in our past work on IP  enforcement.", "To address these issues, I have drawn on completed GAO studies,  particularly a report that we completed on STOP and NIPLECC last fall.  We examined NIPLECC and STOP official documents and reviewed the  legislative history of NIPLECC. Our November 2006 study assessed the  extent to which STOP serves as a national strategy for combating trade in  counterfeit and pirated goods by using the six desirable characteristics of  an effective national strategy developed in previous GAO work. GAO has  used this methodology to assess and report on the administration\u2019s  strategies relating to combating terrorism, restructuring DOD\u2019s global  force posture, and rebuilding Iraq. National strategies with these desirable  characteristics offer policymakers and implementing agencies a  management tool that can help ensure accountability and more effective  results. I should also mention that we have a number of other studies soon  to be published that are also related to IP enforcement. These include (1) a  study that we have completed for Senator Voinovich focusing on IP  enforcement at the U.S. border, and (2) additional work on a Customs and  Border Protection (CBP) program called the \u201cin-bond system\u201d that allows  goods to transit the United States and enter U.S. commerce at a port other  than the port of arrival. In conducting the GAO studies, we have  performed work at multiple U.S. agency headquarters in Washington, D.C.,  and at U.S. ports of entry and agency field offices. In addition, we met with  representatives from multiple industry associations and companies that  are affected by IP violations, such as manufacturing, entertainment, luxury  goods, and pharmaceutical industries. We also met with the head of  NIPLECC, the IP Coordinator, to obtain information on steps taken to  implement the recommendations presented in our November 2006 study.  We also examined the March 2007 STOP document \u2014 the most current  strategy document.

However, the legal protection of intellectual property varies greatly  around the world, and several countries are havens for the production of  counterfeit and pirated goods. Technology has facilitated the manufacture  and distribution of counterfeit and pirated products, resulting in a global  illicit market that competes with genuine products and complicates  detection and actions against violations. High profits and low risk have  drawn in organized criminal networks, with possible links to terrorist  financing. The public is often not aware of the issues and consequences  surrounding IP theft. Industry groups suggest that counterfeiting and  piracy are on the rise and that a broader range of products, from auto  parts to razor blades, and from vital medicines to infant formula, are  subject to counterfeit production. Counterfeit products raise serious  public health and safety concerns, and the annual losses that companies  face from IP violations are substantial.", "Given the increasing threats to America\u2019s economy, health, and safety, U.S.  government agencies have undertaken numerous efforts to protect and  enforce intellectual property rights, and a structure to coordinate these IP  enforcement efforts evolved. In 1999, Congress created the interagency  National Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Coordination Council  (NIPLECC) as a mechanism to coordinate U.S. efforts to protect and  enforce IP rights in the United States and overseas. In October 2004, the  Bush Administration announced the Strategy Targeting Organized Piracy  (STOP) to \u201csmash criminal networks that traffic in fakes, stop trade in  pirated and counterfeit goods at America\u2019s borders, block bogus goods  around the world, and help small businesses secure and enforce their  rights in overseas markets.\u201d Although both NIPLECC and STOP were  created to improve the United States\u2019 IP enforcement and protection  efforts, they were established under different authorities \u2013 NIPLECC as a  congressional mandate and STOP as a presidential initiative led by the  White House under the auspices of the National Security Council. Table 1  compares NIPLECC and STOP.", "STOP and NIPLECC share similar goals, including coordination of IP  protection and enforcement, and involve nearly the same agencies.

From 1999 through the end of 2004, NIPLECC  produced three annual reports that did little more than provide a  compilation of individual agency activities. We also concluded in our 2004  report that if Congress wished to maintain NIPLECC and take action to  increase its effectiveness, it should consider reviewing the council\u2019s  authority, operating structure, membership, and mission.", "Congress addressed NIPLECC\u2019s lack of activity and unclear mission in the  2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act in December 2004.

It also created the position of the Coordinator for  International Intellectual Property Enforcement, also known as the \u201cIP  Coordinator,\u201d to head NIPLECC. The IP Coordinator is appointed by the  President and may not serve in any other position in the federal  government. The co-chairs for NIPLECC are required to report to the IP  Coordinator.", "Unlike NIPLECC, STOP from its beginning has been characterized by a  high level of active coordination and visibility. In October 2004, the  President launched STOP, an initiative led by the White House under the  auspices of the National Security Council, to target cross-border trade in  tangible goods and strengthen U.S. government and industry IP  enforcement actions. STOP members are the same agencies that house  NIPLECC members, except that STOP includes the Food and Drug  Administration. According to a high-level official who participated in the  formation of STOP, the initiative was intended to protect American  innovation, competitiveness, and economic growth. It stemmed from the  recognition that U.S. companies needed protection from increasingly  complex and sophisticated criminal counterfeiting and piracy. As part of  STOP, agencies began holding meetings, both at working levels and higher,  to coordinate agency efforts to tackle the problem.", "STOP is viewed as energizing U.S. IP protection and enforcement efforts  and is generally praised by agency officials and industry representatives.  The IP Coordinator stated in congressional testimony that STOP has built  an expansive interagency process that provides the foundation for U.S.  government efforts to fight global piracy. Several agency officials  participating in STOP said that it gave them the opportunity to share ideas  and support common goals. Many agency officials with whom we spoke  said that STOP had brought increased attention to IP issues within their  agencies and the private sector, as well as abroad, and attributed that to  the fact that STOP came out of the White House, thereby lending it more  authority and influence. One agency official pointed out that IP was now  on the President\u2019s agenda at major summits such as the G8 and European  Union summits. In addition, most private sector representatives with  whom we spoke agreed that STOP was an effective communication  mechanism between business and U.S. agencies on IP issues, particularly  through the Coalition Against Counterfeiting and Piracy (CACP), a cross- industry group created by a joint initiative of the Chamber of Commerce  and the National Association of Manufacturers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IP Enforcement Coordinating Structure Lacks Clear Leadership and Permanence", "paragraphs": ["The structure that has evolved to coordinate U.S. efforts to protect and  enforce IP rights, NIPLECC and STOP, lacks clear leadership and  permanence. Our November 2006 report noted that, despite the re- energized focus on IP enforcement as a result of STOP, the ambiguities  surrounding NIPLECC\u2019s implementation of STOP as a strategy create  challenges for the long-term viability of a coordinated federal IP  enforcement approach. While NIPLECC adopted STOP as its strategy for  protecting IP overseas in February 2006, its commitment to implementing  STOP as a successful strategy remains unclear. For instance, it is not clear  how NIPLECC will provide a leadership role in implementing STOP. While  NIPLECC\u2019s most recent annual report describes many STOP activities and  the IP Coordinator\u2019s direct involvement in them, it does not explain how  the NIPLECC principals and the IP Coordinator plan to carry out their  oversight responsibilities mandated by Congress to help ensure successful  implementation of the strategy. In addition, while the current STOP  strategy document (March 2007) states that the NIPLECC annual report  provides details on interagency collaboration to achieve STOP goals,  STOP does not mention NIPLECC\u2019s oversight role or articulate a  framework for oversight and accountability among the STOP agencies  carrying out the strategy.", "Although Congress enhanced NIPLECC\u2019s powers through the  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005, we found that NIPLECC retains  an image of inactivity within some of the private sector. For example,  representatives of almost half of the 16 private sector groups with whom  we spoke expressed the opinion that NIPLECC was inactive or a  nonplayer. In addition, representatives from 10 of these groups were  unclear about NIPLEC\u2019s role, and many said that they were unclear about  the difference between NIPLECC and STOP. In July 2006, Senate  appropriators expressed concern about the lack of information provided  to Congress by NIPLECC on its progress.", "In contrast with NIPLECC, agency officials and members of the private  sector attribute STOP\u2019s effectiveness to its status as a White House  initiative and its resulting authority and influence. However, it lacks  permanence since it is a presidential initiative and may disappear after the  current administration leaves office. Furthermore, while agency officials  we interviewed generally considered STOP to be the U.S. government\u2019s IP  strategy, NIPLECC officials have sent mixed signals about effectively  implementing STOP. One official representing NIPLECC said that the  STOP strategy should have goals and objectives, including metrics to  measure progress about which the IP Coordinator should report. However,  a NIPLECC representative from another agency told us that this document  was a fact sheet that accounted for administration efforts rather than a  strategy. Similarly, a NIPLECC representative from a third agency was  skeptical about whether STOP should be assessed as NIPLECC\u2019s strategy.  Finally, the IP Coordinator stated in March 2006 congressional testimony  that STOP is NIPLECC\u2019s strategy; however, he also told us that STOP was  never meant to be an institutional method for reporting priorities and  metrics to the President or Congress, or to manage resources."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Improvements Needed to Achieve an Effective National IP Enforcement Strategy", "paragraphs": ["STOP is a first step toward an integrated national strategy for IP  protection and enforcement and has energized agency efforts.

Our discussions with the IP Coordinator, in preparation for this testimony,  indicated that the Office of the U.S. Coordinator for International Property  Enforcement has taken some steps to address GAO\u2019s recommendations.  For example, the IP Coordinator has been working with the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) to understand agencies\u2019 priorities and  resources related to IP enforcement.
