GPS consists of three segments--space, ground control, and user equipment--but the study only addressed the space segment, which accounts for the largest share of total GPS costs--more than half--in the Air Force's current budget. The Air Force identified and assessed nine options for future GPS space segments, ranging in cost from $13 billion to $25 billion from fiscal year 2013 through 2030. The report assessed each option based on a constellation or collection of 30 total satellites instead of 24, which is the Air Force's baseline GPS requirement for accuracy. This increase in total satellites raises an issue with the constellation size the Air Force intends to support in the future. Air Force officials stated that the cost analyses supporting the nine options were high-level cost estimates. Although this may be expected given the time constraints and other limitations of the study, these estimates are not at a level that would support future GPS investment decisions.", "Although the Air Force report is a good starting point, more information on key cost drivers and cost estimates, and broader input from stakeholders would help guide future investment decisions. Specifically, the key cost drivers include dual launch capability (launching two satellites on a single launch vehicle), navigation satellites (smaller GPS-type satellites yet to be developed), and a nuclear detection capability. The cost estimates also excluded the ground control and user equipment segments and cost risk. Further, the Air Force did not obtain inputs from some key stakeholders such as those from the GPS positioning, navigation, and timing advisory community. Consequently, without conducting a more comprehensive assessment that addresses each of these concerns, the Air Force is not yet in a position to make sound future GPS investments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends the Air Force: (1) affirm the future size of the GPS constellation it plans to support; (2) ensure future assessments are comprehensive and include cost risk and the impact of options on all three GPS segments; and (3) engage the broader stakeholder community in future assessments of options.

The GPS III program plans to eventually replace the  existing constellation with upgraded satellites that carry the nuclear  detonation detection system payload. The first seven options presented in  the Air Force report involve GPS III or some modification of it.  Specifically, five options (numbers 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) involve launching two  GPS III satellites on a single launch vehicle (referred to as dual launch),  and according to the Air Force report, are expected to substantially  reduce costs by eliminating the need to buy launch vehicles for each  satellite, as is currently practiced.

Therefore, it  is unclear whether investment costs for these options will in fact be lower  than the baseline cost of the current GPS III program. Moreover, based  on the estimated costs presented in the report, basing all options on a 30- satellite constellation may actually increase the overall GPS investment  because the limited differences between the options assessed narrows  the range of costs across the seven options that rely on a core of GPS III  satellites.", "Program officials noted that although the requirement is for 24 satellites,  for the last seven years the Air Force has operated at least 27 satellites in  the GPS constellation and, more recently, as many as 31 satellites due to  the existing satellites outlasting the useful life originally estimated. We  reported in 2010 that DOD predicted many of the older satellites in the  constellation will reach the end of their operational life faster than they will  be replenished over the next several years, decreasing the size of the  constellation from its current level. Since the magnitude of error  calculated by GPS receivers dramatically decreases as the constellation  reaches 30 satellites, and program officials stated that users have come  to rely on this increased accuracy over the last several years, the Air  Force determined it was appropriate to assess options for providing this  same level of service into the future. As a result, the report establishes a  constellation of 30 satellites\u2014an increase over the Air Force\u2019s  requirement for accuracy\u2014as a baseline for each of the GPS options  assessed. Program officials, however, acknowledged that there is  reluctance to formally require the GPS constellation to be larger than the  24-satellite requirement supported by the Air Force without the certainty  of a corresponding growth in program funding. While a 30-satellite  constellation may be justifiable, using that as a baseline in the study may  have eliminated some lower cost options that may exist with 24 satellites.

For  example, both the dual launch capability and the NavSat concept require  use of technologies new to GPS with associated developmental risks, and  as key drivers of cost, they are factors that differ significantly enough to  have a material impact on the analysis and the resulting findings,  including estimated costs. Additionally, two of the NavSat options are  based on the possibility that the nuclear detonation detection mission  could eventually be transferred to another space-based system, but the  effect of such a change on overall system capability was not fully  considered in the report. To assess the options as a basis for making  future GPS investment decisions, more information on each of these  drivers is important to understand the full impact they could have on the  future integrity, capability, and cost of the system.", "For options 3 through 7, development of a dual launch capability for GPS  III satellites is necessary, but a lack of detail in the Air Force\u2019s report on  the maturity of key technologies and cost considerations make it difficult  to conduct a fully informed assessment of the viability of these options.  Program officials indicated that this ongoing effort will require reductions  in the size, weight, and power of the GPS III satellites, as well as  development of equipment (adaptors) that will allow two satellites to fly on  a single launch vehicle. According to program officials, these adaptors are  nearing a high level of technology maturity. However, the report names  various other components and technologies under development for this  effort, such as lithium ion batteries and more efficient signal amplifiers,  but does not indicate where they stand in terms of technology maturity.  Instead, the report assumes that dual launch capability is fully developed  and that demonstration of the capability will be ready in time to launch the  seventh and eighth GPS III satellites (of potentially 32 production  satellites). Consequently, it is difficult to assess the near- to medium-term  feasibility and timeframes of all options that are based on dual launching  GPS III satellites.", "Additionally, the Air Force did not fully consider the cost impact of its dual  launch approach. While cost savings may eventually be accrued from  dual launches, the report does not address the acquisition and operations  strategy\u2014what is necessary to buy and conduct dual launches up front.  For example, one of the subject matter experts we consulted identified a  number of factors which would result in cost increases that offset some of  the expected savings from not procuring a second launch vehicle. These  include (1) taking the steps to ensure the constellation\u2019s integrity would  remain intact in the event of a launch failure, as two satellites would be  lost in such an instance rather than one (e.g., Air Force officials would  have to decide whether to orbit more spares to overcome the effects of a  possible launch failure); (2) making changes at the manufacturing level to  accommodate two satellites, such as the additional storage costs to hold  the first satellite until the second satellite is ready to launch; (3) ensuring  launch site facilities are capable of processing two satellites essentially  simultaneously, noting that discovery of an anomaly during launch site  testing of one satellite could affect the other satellite; and (4) ensuring the  additional support equipment and personnel necessary to support  preparing two satellites for launch. This expert further acknowledged that  none of these factors were \u201cshowstoppers\u201d but suggested that they  should be taken into consideration. Program officials noted that in  developing the notional launch schedule for the options, they factored in a  two percent probability of launch failure which is an industry standard for  mature launch vehicle designs. However, they acknowledged that  modifications needed on the launch vehicle to dual launch GPS satellites  have not been demonstrated.", "Some of the identified technical risks for the notional NavSat options may  be understated given that they involve undertaking new acquisition  programs with technologies not previously used on GPS satellites. For  example, many of the initiatives to reduce satellite size, weight, and  power underway for developing dual launch capability are also being  explored for application on NavSats. We have found in our prior work  relating to best practices for weapon system acquisition that programs  employing technologies that are not fully mature tend to face challenges  staying on budget and on schedule, which increases risk to the overall  program. The Air Force report indicates that maturation of the NavSat  concept is a prerequisite for many options assessed, including  development of new satellite buses and payloads. These development  efforts are assigned medium and medium-high technical and  programmatic risk. While the report acknowledges that there are technical  risks involved with developing higher efficiency signal amplifiers and other  space, weight, and power reducing technologies, it concludes that none  of these technologies is high risk. However, officials from the Air Force  Research Laboratory, which is helping to develop some of these  technologies for potential application on NavSats, noted that some of the  new technologies are currently at a relatively low level of maturity (i.e.,  only tested in a laboratory environment), and will not likely be feasible for  the GPS program until at least 2018. Moreover, one of the subject matter  experts we consulted noted that there are other potential risks associated  with the NavSat options, such as not having a proven track record. This  expert noted problems in the NavSat programs could result in the loss of  user confidence in GPS that has been built up over decades of delivering  a reliable satellite navigation service.", "Details regarding technology maturity are also needed to better  understand the cost impact of these options on the overall GPS program.  For example, program officials acknowledged that savings from dual  launching GPS III satellites could help offset some of the additional costs  associated with development of NavSats. However, they noted that there  would likely be significant initial development costs for the NavSats that  would result in the need for a net budget increase in the near-term.", "Additionally, a key aspect of NavSat capability relevant to civilian GPS  users is not addressed in the Air Force report and without additional  clarification, it is difficult to determine the impacts to these users. The  report notes that one approach for reducing the size, weight, power, and  cost of proposed NavSats, would be to reduce the total number of  navigation signals they transmit. Specifically, under option 5 in the report,  NavSats would broadcast two of four civilian signals and two military  signals. Three of the subject matter experts we consulted noted concerns  in part because determining which civilian signals to exclude would likely  result in the prioritization of one user group over another, as the civilian  signals have different applications. Air Force officials indicated that,  option 5 is based on a larger core of GPS III satellites\u2014which are  required to carry all civilian signals\u2014and augmented by a smaller number  of NavSats. However, it is unclear how a core of GPS III satellites would  compare with a combined constellation of GPS III satellites and NavSats,  both required to broadcast all civilian signals.", "Two of the NavSat options included in the Air Force report would require  the eventual elimination of the nuclear detonation detection system  payload from GPS satellites, and the report notes that as long as this  mission is a priority and is planned to be hosted on GPS satellites, these  options\u2014and the low relative costs\u2014would therefore not be viable.  Elimination of the nuclear detonation detection system could have other  effects on the overall capability of the GPS system not recognized or  addressed in the Air Force report. For example, one of the subject matter  experts we consulted mentioned that the GPS search and rescue  function, a requirement for GPS III satellites, shares an antenna with the  nuclear detonation detection system payload. Thus, the two options  (numbers 8 and 9) that drop the nuclear detonation detection system  completely would potentially forgo the search and rescue function as well.  However, program officials said the search and rescue payload is  relatively small and could be adapted to the NavSats without the nuclear  detonation detection system, and also noted that in a mixed constellation  of GPS III satellites and NavSats, there would likely be sufficient  coverage for the search and rescue mission even if the search and  rescue sensors were only on the GPS III satellites. Given the differing  views of these officials and subject matter experts, this issue will need to  be resolved as the Air Force pursues future assessments of GPS options."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cost Estimates are Not Comprehensive", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force\u2019s high-level cost estimates appear consistent across the  options for the space segment, but the estimates do not include the other  two key GPS segments.

However, without inclusion of the other two key segments of the  system, the methodology used does not reflect true life cycle costs.  Additionally, Air Force officials noted that the cost estimates developed  for the report do not include cost risk. This leaves some question as to the  ultimate usefulness of the cost estimates, risk rankings, or both. In  addition, the Air Force did not apply all aspects of best practices in  developing its cost estimates, which further reduces the usefulness of  these estimates in decisionmaking. Finally, the Air Force did not obtain  input from the PNT advisory community which may have helped inform its  assessment.", "For a defense acquisition program, DOD defines life cycle costs as the  total cost to the government of acquisition and ownership for a program  over its full life. This includes the cost of development, acquisition,  operations, and support (to include personnel), and where applicable,  disposal. While the Air Force report indicates that the estimates are  based upon life cycle costs, it does not include key elements necessary to  meet the definition of life cycle cost, thereby underestimating the total  costs of the options and limiting their usefulness. The Air Force\u2019s cost  estimates for each option only included the space segment\u2014satellite and  launch vehicles\u2014which it determined to be the only segment to have  significant impact on overall costs. As mentioned previously, the space  segment accounts for the largest share\u2014more than half\u2014of total GPS  costs in the Air Force\u2019s current budget. Under this methodology, program  officials said options dealing with the ground control system were not  included in the cost estimates because costs associated with adding  capability to control new satellites were estimated to be a small  percentage of the total GPS system cost, and would not provide a  significant distinction between the options. However, this estimation,  without the ground control segment, may not be valid given that there  could be unknown cost and schedule risks for the ground control segment  associated with modifications to accommodate new and different satellite  vehicles. More specifically, while changes to the ground segment may not  be a major cost differentiator between the options, they have presented  significant challenges. For example, program officials said the costs of  adding ground control capability for a new generation of satellites are  known, but this is based on updates to the current ground control system.  However, in our prior work, we also reported that modernization of the  current ground control segment has been challenging, and has only  enabled limited capability to control the new satellites, rather than  facilitating full access to their new capabilities. Additionally, the ground  control segment is being completely replaced as part of the GPS OCX  program, which according to Air Force officials, will eventually enable  users to take full advantage of the capability offered by the GPS  constellation, and is expected to cost nearly $3.7 billion through fiscal  year 2017. This cost is significantly higher than initial planning estimates  due to software and other challenges experienced thus far, and the extent  and cost of this effort were not recognized in the Air Force report.", "Additionally, two of the subject matter experts we consulted indicated that  inclusion of user equipment could have benefited the study. The Air Force  report did not assess any options that would require hardware changes to  user equipment beyond what is already planned for user equipment  modernization because of the large number of civilian receivers currently  in use. One subject matter expert noted that although the report cites this  as the primary reason user equipment was not examined; civilian user  equipment will continue to evolve by integrating GPS signals with signals  from other global navigation systems, as well as with non-space-based  PNT capabilities such as inertial navigation sensors, chip scale atomic  clocks, and terrestrial radiolocation technologies. The expert noted that  this could reduce some of the capability that the space segment needs to  provide in the future. Based on our discussions with officials from the Air  Force Research Laboratory, this could in turn potentially reduce the size  and power requirements for the space vehicle and thereby the overall  cost.", "According to Air Force officials involved in the study, the overall cost  estimates do not include cost risk, which is defined as the risk  associated with the ability of the program to achieve its acquisition  strategy cost objectives. Similarly, identified technical and programmatic  risks and their relative rankings do not generally appear to have a basis in  cost. The options involving a constellation of all NavSats or at least a core  of NavSats (numbers 8 and 9 respectively) both reflect high technical and  programmatic risks. At the same time, the cost estimates for these  options reflect the lowest development and procurement costs (excluding  operations and sustainment costs) over the fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year  2030 timeframe. We have found in our prior work relating to key practices  for weapon system acquisition that programs employing technologies that  are not fully mature tend to require more time in development or  production and more funding than is initially anticipated. Without  additional details as to how cost factors into the risk determination, it is  difficult to know the relative utility of the Air Force\u2019s cost estimates for  making further GPS decisions.", "Best practices in cost estimating result in accurate and credible cost  estimates that management can use for making informed decisions. The  methodology consists of 12 steps that we present in figure 2.", "These best practices represent an overall process of established,  repeatable methods that result in high-quality cost estimates that are  comprehensive and accurate, and that can be easily and clearly traced,  replicated, and updated. We found that the Air Force followed some  aspects of the 12-step process in developing its estimates for GPS  architecture options, but did not follow others. For example, the Air Force  defined the estimate\u2019s purpose and identified some ground rules and  assumptions, but did not perform sensitivity analysis and conducted  minimal analysis of cost-related risks. This would be expected given the  time constraints and other limitations of the study; however, to further  assess its GPS options, more fully-developed cost estimates would be  important in facilitating more rigorous comparisons across the options."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consultation with Key Stakeholders Could Provide Additional Insights", "paragraphs": ["GPS has grown into a global utility whose multi-use services are integral  to U.S. national security and transportation safety, and are an essential  element of the worldwide economic infrastructure. As a result, any  decision regarding GPS has far reaching consequences for many beyond  DOD. This fact was clearly addressed in the national PNT policy which  formalized the membership of the PNT executive committee to include  other government departments and agencies that have a stake in the  stewardship of GPS. This committee ensures that the national security,  homeland security, and civil requirements receive full and appropriate  consideration in the PNT decision process and facilitates the integration  and reduction of conflicts of these requirements for PNT, as required.  However, the Air Force did not seek input from those departments and  agencies that are represented on the committee, including the  Department of Transportation, which co-chairs the committee with DOD.  These key stakeholders could have provided valuable insight on potential  impacts of the options presented, as well as future needs arising from any  changes to the GPS.", "Several of the subject matter experts we consulted directly represent the  stakeholders identified in the PNT policy. While these individuals largely  believe the Air Force report is a good starting point for future GPS  decisions, they provided additional, meaningful insights relating to  potential risks and costs associated with the individual options as well as  with ground control and satellite launch; user equipment capabilities; and  the concerns and needs of various GPS users. According to Air Force  officials, they did receive input from individuals who advocated for the  needs of non-DOD users, but acknowledged that these individuals did not  directly represent those users or other stakeholders identified in PNT  policy. While not specifically required by the House Armed Services  Committee to seek input from others, obtaining input from key  stakeholders, such as was provided by the subject matter experts we  consulted, the Air Force may have been able to obtain additional insights  as it developed and weighed the various GPS options.

The study focused on the space segment and as such,  the options consist of various configurations of satellites and launch  options\u2014whether to launch satellites individually or in multiples. The less  risky options appear to be relatively minor deviations from the  department\u2019s current approach in fielding GPS III, with the key decision  being whether to launch one or two satellites at a time. Pursuing any  options would likely require a near term increase in the overall GPS  budget to achieve future savings\u2014a challenge in the current fiscally  constrained environment. Yet, the study used a larger constellation size  than the Air Force\u2019s current derived requirements and lacked the  comprehensiveness that would allow the study to be used for future  decision making. Based on acquisition best practices, there are actions  the Air Force could take to improve the study results to include: identifying  the constellation size to be supported; expanding the areas of  consideration to include ground control and user equipment; more  thoroughly defining and analyzing key capabilities and implementation  approaches; and using a higher fidelity approach in assessing risk and  estimating cost going forward. The Air Force could also benefit from  greater consultation from the broader PNT stakeholder and advisory  community, which could offer valuable perspectives relating to the overall  approach for investigating future GPS options, as well as the relative  merits and unknowns associated with each option analyzed. While there  are a number of limitations in the study, it is valuable as a basis for  substantive discussion of long-term GPS investments.

Affirm the future GPS constellation size that the Air Force plans to  support, given the differences in the derived requirement of the 24- satellite constellation and the 30-satellite constellations called for in  each of the space segment options in the Air Force\u2019s report.  2.  Ensure that future assessments of options include full consideration of  the space, ground control, and user equipment segments, and are  comprehensive with regard to their assessment of costs, technical  and programmatic risks, and schedule.  3.  Engage stakeholders from the broader civilian community identified in  PNT policy in future assessments of options.

In its response, the department stated the numbers of satellites  are affirmed annually in the President\u2019s Budget request. However, the  budget shows satellite procurements over time and does not specify the  target constellation size to meet current or future accuracy requirements,  which has a direct impact on annual procurement costs. Additionally, as  our report indicates, the Air Force report based all options on a 30- satellite constellation while reporting a GPS requirement for accuracy of a  24 satellite constellation at 95 percent availability. Therefore, the need  remains for the department to more clearly and transparently identify the  target GPS constellation size the department intends to pursue.", "DOD also concurred with our second recommendation to ensure future  assessments of options include full consideration of the space, ground  control, and user equipment segments, and are comprehensive with  regard to their assessment of costs, technical and programmatic risks,  and schedule. In its response, the department stated that while  consideration of the space and ground control segments should be  comprehensive in these areas, the user equipment segment should be  included in future assessments when those assessments include the  fielding of new user equipment capability. As one of the subject matter  experts we consulted noted, user equipment continues to evolve and  could potentially embrace PNT technologies and capabilities that would  reduce required capabilities for GPS satellites. As our report indicates, a  comprehensive look at user equipment is warranted, especially given that  the user equipment modernization program is in a pre-development  phase.", "Finally, DOD concurred with our third recommendation to engage  stakeholders from the broader civilian community identified in PNT policy  in future assessments of options. In its response, the department said  stakeholders from the broader civilian community identified in PNT policy  should be engaged in future assessment of options that include changes  to the Standard Positioning System performance standard or to  agreements or commitments the DOD has already made with civil  stakeholders. However, as we noted in our report, considering the  unknown effect on the civilian user community of some of the options  presented, as well as potential future application of new technology for  user equipment, comprehensive assessment of future GPS options  should involve the broader PNT community, particularly those  stakeholders identified in PNT policy.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the Air Force.
