These codes define work roles and tasks for cybersecurity specialty areas such as program management and system administration. Further, the act required DHS to identify and report its cybersecurity workforce critical needs.", "The act included a provision for GAO to analyze and monitor DHS's implementation of the requirements. GAO's objectives were to assess the extent to which DHS has (1) identified, categorized, and assigned employment codes to its cybersecurity positions and (2) identified its cybersecurity workforce areas of critical need. GAO analyzed DHS and OPM workforce documentation and administered a data collection instrument to six major DHS components. GAO also interviewed relevant DHS and OPM officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has taken actions to identify, categorize, and assign employment codes to its cybersecurity positions, as required by the Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014 ; however, its actions have not been timely and complete. For example, DHS did not establish timely and complete procedures to identify, categorize, and code its cybersecurity position vacancies and responsibilities. Further, DHS has not yet completed its efforts to identify all of the department's cybersecurity positions and accurately assign codes to all filled and vacant cybersecurity positions. In August 2017, DHS reported to the Congress that it had coded 95 percent of the department's identified cybersecurity positions. However, GAO's analysis determined that the department had, at that time, coded approximately 79 percent of the positions. DHS's 95 percent estimate was overstated primarily because it excluded vacant positions, even though the act required DHS to report these positions.", "In addition, although DHS has taken steps to identify its workforce capability gaps, it has not identified or reported to the Congress on its department-wide cybersecurity critical needs that align with specialty areas. The department also has not reported annually its cybersecurity critical needs to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), as required, and has not developed plans with clearly defined time frames for doing so. (See table).", "Without ensuring that its procedures are complete and that its progress in identifying and assigning codes to its positions is accurately reported, DHS will not be positioned to effectively examine its cybersecurity workforce, identify its critical skill gaps, or improve its workforce planning. Further, until DHS establishes plans and time frames for reporting on its critical needs, the department may not be able to ensure that it has the necessary cybersecurity personnel to help protect the department's and the nation's federal networks and critical infrastructure from cyber threats.

The initial framework defined 31 cybersecurity- related specialty areas that were organized into 7 categories. In  August 2017, the framework was revised to include 33 cybersecurity- related specialty areas. The 7 categories are: securely provision,  operate and maintain, protect and defend, investigate, collect and  operate, analyze, and oversee and govern. For example, in the  oversee and govern category, a specialty area is cybersecurity  management, which covers the management of personnel,  infrastructure, policy, and security awareness. Further, in the protect  and defend category, the vulnerability assessment and management  specialty area covers conducting assessments of threats and  vulnerabilities and recommending appropriate mitigation  countermeasures in order to protect information systems from threats.", "In August 2017, NIST also revised the framework to define work roles  within each specialty area and describe cybersecurity tasks for each  work role.

For example, DHS  identified a skill gap called development operations, which is related to 12  different specialty areas in the NICE framework. This skill gap also  overlaps with other DHS skill gaps and creates the potential for double- counting critical needs. Furthermore, although three selected components  reported in our questionnaires that they were able to identify their critical  needs that aligned to the framework, they did not report this information to  OCHCO.", "According to OCHCO officials, DHS has not identified department-wide  cybersecurity critical needs that align with the framework partly because  OPM had not provided DHS with guidance for identifying cybersecurity  critical needs. According to OPM officials, however, they provided oral  guidance to DHS on using the 2-digit codes for identifying its critical  needs during four meetings in 2016 and 2017. The OPM officials also  stated that they had plans to develop governmentwide guidance for using  the 3-digit codes to identify cybersecurity critical needs by March 2018 to  fulfil the requirements of the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce  Assessment Act of 2015. According to OPM, agencies such as DHS are  required to identify critical needs for the 3-digit codes by April 2019.

Specifically, DHS did not include guidance in its  procedures that instructed components on how to report on their critical  needs or to align to the NICE framework work categories and specialty  areas. Two selected components\u2019 officials told us they required  guidance from OCHCO on how best to identify critical needs.", "According to OCHCO officials, they did not provide components guidance  on critical needs that align with the NICE framework because the  components were in the best position to determine their critical needs.  Further, OCHCO officials stated that the components do not generally  view critical skills gaps in terms of the categories or specialty areas as  defined in the NICE framework, but instead, describe their skills gaps  using position titles that are familiar to them. For example, one selected  component identified security engineering as a skills gap familiar to them.  However, according to OCHCO officials, this gap may align to five  different specialty areas in the NICE framework\u2019s securely provision work  category. As mentioned previously, the framework required that critical  needs be align with a specific specialty area.", "In September 2017, OCHCO developed a draft document that crosswalks  identified department-wide cybersecurity skills gaps to one or more  specialty areas in the NICE framework. However, the document does not  adequately help components identify their critical needs by aligning their  gaps with the NICE framework. Half of the DHS skills gaps overlap with  two or more work categories, but the National Finance Center payroll  system allows components to enter only one code per position. Further,  the document does not provide additional decision rules to help  components determine a critical need in cases in which a skills gap is  mapped to multiple work categories.", "Without providing relevant guidance to help components identify their  critical needs, DHS and the components are hindered from effectively  identifying and prioritizing workforce efforts to recruit, hire, train, develop,  and retain cybersecurity personnel across the department."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Did Not Report Critical Needs Annually to OPM or Develop Plans and Time Frames for Completing Priority Actions", "paragraphs": ["HSCWAA required that, annually from September 2016 through  September 2021, DHS, in consultation with OPM, submit a report to OPM  that describes and substantiates critical need designations.
