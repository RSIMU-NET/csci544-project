To address these objectives, GAO reviewed the text of the regulations published in the Federal Register , and reviewed the universe of all 527 economically significant final regulations (generally those with an annual effect of $100 million or more) published during the specified transition and nontransition periods and a generalizable stratified random sample of 358 of the 1,633 significant final regulations published during the same time periods."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["During transition periods at the end of presidential administrations, agencies published more final regulations and more frequently provided advanced notice to the public on those regulations compared to nontransition periods. The Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations published on average roughly 2.5 times more economically significant regulations during transition periods than during nontransition periods. But agencies more often, relative to nontransition periods, provided the public an opportunity to influence the development of the transition-period regulations by providing advanced notice of their issuance and opportunities to comment on proposed regulations before they were finalized.", "In their published regulations, agencies reported that compliance with four of five procedural requirements was high during both transition and nontransition periods, but not with the Congressional Review Act (CRA). During all periods, agencies reported complying with requirements, such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act, for nearly all economically significant regulations and the majority of significant regulations. Agencies less often complied with one or more CRA requirements. (See figure.) Though agencies are responsible for complying with CRA, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is responsible for oversight of agencies' rulemaking, consistent with law, and reviews regulations before publication, which provides an opportunity to identify and help agencies avoid potential noncompliance. The most common CRA deficiency was agencies' failure to provide Congress the required time to review and possibly disapprove regulations, which GAO has also identified as a deficiency in previous work. Economically significant regulations for which OMB completed its review within 3 months before the planned effective date were at high risk of not complying with CRA, thus increasing the risk that agencies would not provide Congress with the required time for its reviews.", "Economically Significant Regulations Determined to be Noncompliant with the Congressional Review Act"]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OMB, as part of its regulatory review process, identify economically significant regulations at potential risk of not complying with CRA and work with agencies to ensure compliance.

This phenomenon is  often referred to as \u201cmidnight rulemaking.\u201d Officials from outgoing  administrations generally attribute this increased regulatory activity to  agencies completing long-planned regulatory initiatives. However, the  Congressional Research Service (CRS) has noted that some members of  Congress and individuals outside the government have expressed  concerns that \u201cmidnight rules\u201d may be rushed through the analytical and  procedural processes agencies are expected to use, providing fewer  opportunities for the public to provide input, and therefore resulting in  lower quality regulations. CRS has also pointed out that presidential  transitions in which party control of the White House changes\u2013which  occurred during the four most recent transitions in 1993, 2001, 2009, and  2017\u2013may increase the incentive for Presidents and agencies to engage  in midnight rulemaking because it may be difficult for the subsequent  administration to change or eliminate regulations after they have taken  effect.", "Section 5 of the Edward \u201cTed\u201d Kaufman and Michael Leavitt Presidential  Transitions Improvements Act of 2015 includes a provision for us to  assess final significant regulatory actions promulgated by executive  departments during specified presidential transition periods and to  analyze and compare multiple characteristics of regulations issued during  these transition periods to each other and to regulations issued during the  same 120-day periods in nontransition years since 1996. The transition  periods identified in the act are those ending on January 20 in 2001,  2009, and 2017, which occurred at the end of the administrations of  Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama. For the transition periods, and  among these transition periods and the same 120-day periods in  nontransition years, our objectives were to assess the extent to which  there were variations in (1) the number of regulations and other indicators  related to the scope and transparency of these regulations; (2) agencies\u2019  reported compliance with procedural requirements for promulgating the  regulations; and (3) the anticipated economic effects agencies reported  would result from the regulations.", "For each of the three transition periods and the 18 other periods cited in  the mandate, we reviewed what the act defines as \u201ccovered regulations\u201d  published by executive agencies in the Federal Register. For purposes of  this review, executive agencies are those cabinet departments and other  agencies that answer directly to the President and exclude the  independent regulatory agencies. The definition of a \u201ccovered regulation\u201d  in the mandate is the same as the definition of a final significant  regulatory action under Executive Order (E.O.) 12866. Under E.O.  12866, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviews significant  proposed and final regulations from all federal agencies (other than  independent regulatory agencies) before they are published in the  Federal Register. The order defines significant regulatory actions as  those that are likely to result in a rule that may  1.  Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or  adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the  economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public  health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities  (generally referred to as \u201ceconomically significant\u201d regulations);  2.  Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action  taken or planned by another agency;  3.  Materially alter the budgetary effects of entitlements, grants, user  fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients  thereof; or  4.  Raise novel legal or policy issues arising from legal mandates, the  President\u2019s priorities, or the principles set forth in the executive order.", "For the purposes of this report, we differentiate between the results for  \u201ceconomically significant\u201d regulations (criterion 1 above, i.e., generally  those with annual economic effects greater than $100 million) and the  results for other significant regulations (criteria 2-4 above, i.e., those  expected to have less than $100 million in economic effects but are  deemed significant under the order\u2019s other three definitions of  significance). We will refer to the latter category as \u201csignificant  regulations.\u201d We primarily relied on OMB\u2019s Reginfo.gov database on  regulations reviewed under E.O. 12866 to compile a list of final  economically significant and final significant regulations published during  the specified periods. We refined and supplemented the lists from the  Reginfo.gov database with information from our database on rules  submitted to us under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), and the  Government Printing Office\u2019s Federal Digital System database on the  Federal Register. To test the reliability of these databases, we reviewed  relevant documentation, interviewed knowledgeable agency officials,  looked for missing data and outliers (for example, by identifying missing  records or those included in error), traced a sample of entries to source  documents, and conducted additional checks. We concluded that the data  were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "We reviewed the universe of all 527 final economically significant  regulations published during the specified periods and a generalizable  stratified random sample of 358 final significant regulations from the  population of 1,633 final significant regulations published during the  specified periods. For economically significant regulations, we can  provide precise statistics on the extent of a finding, because we reviewed  the universe. For significant regulations, our findings are based upon a  sample designed to achieve a margin of error no greater than plus or  minus 7 percentage points at the 95 percent level of confidence for each  presidential transition period and the nontransition periods combined. Our  findings for the sample are generalizable for the population of all covered  significant regulations published in each transition period and, collectively,  all nontransition periods, but are not generalizable to the individual  agencies that published those regulations.", "To assess the number of regulations and other variations related to the  scope and transparency of these regulations, we tallied total numbers of  final regulations published during each specified period. We identified  whether the regulations were economically significant or significant, and  which agencies had published the regulations to assess scope. We also  reviewed other indicators, such as whether the final regulation had a prior  proposed rule and whether the agency had provided advanced notice that  the regulation was being developed in the Unified Agenda, to provide  insights on the type of rulemaking procedures that agencies used and the  transparency of those rulemakings.", "To assess variations in agencies\u2019 compliance with procedural  requirements and the anticipated economic effects of regulations, we  reviewed the published text of the regulations and, for regulations that  were also major rules, the reports that we prepared for Congress under  CRA.

We also  reviewed the published regulations to see whether agencies identified  expected economic effects (benefits, costs, and transfers). Consistent  with our prior governmentwide review of regulations, we did not evaluate  the agencies\u2019 decisions regarding procedural requirements or their  determinations regarding the potential effects of their regulations.

RFA was enacted in response to  concerns about the effect that federal regulations can have on small  entities. RFA requires agencies to consider the impact of their  regulations on small entities and to prepare regulatory flexibility  analyses, unless the head of the agency certifies that the rule would  not have a \u201csignificant economic impact upon a substantial number of  small entities.\u201d", "Paperwork Reduction Act.

Under  SBREFA, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) are required  to convene Small Business Review Panels (also known as SBREFA  panels) for rulemaking efforts that are expected to have a significant  economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. These  panels are intended to seek direct input early in the rulemaking  process from small entities that would be impacted by the  rulemakings.", "Congressional Review Act. CRA was enacted to better ensure  that Congress has an opportunity to review and possibly disapprove  regulations, in certain cases, before they become effective. CRA  established expedited procedures by which Congress may disapprove  agencies\u2019 regulations by introducing a resolution of disapproval that, if  adopted by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President,  can nullify an agency\u2019s action. CRA states that an agency may not  reissue the regulation in \u201csubstantially the same form,\u201d as a regulation  Congress disapproved.

For economically significant regulations, E.O. 12866  requires agencies to provide to OIRA (unless prohibited by law) an  assessment, including the underlying analysis, of the costs and  benefits anticipated from the regulatory action and feasible  alternatives. For significant regulations, E.O. 12866 requires  agencies to provide to OIRA an assessment of the potential costs  and benefits anticipated from the planned regulatory action.

In contrast,  regulations involving only transfers became a smaller proportion of the  economically significant regulations published during Presidents Bush\u2019s  and Obama\u2019s transition periods. Regulations that involved various  combinations of costs, benefits, and transfers became a larger proportion  of regulations published during Presidents Bush and Obama\u2019s transition  periods and overall became a larger proportion of economically significant  regulatory activity that occurred during President Obama\u2019s transition  period.", "Executive guidance encourages agencies to quantify and monetize  expected costs and benefits to help decision makers understand the  consequences of regulatory approaches. E.O. 12866 states that for  economically significant regulations agencies should analyze costs and  benefits to the extent feasible, and Circular A-4 encourages agencies, to  the extent possible, to provide monetized estimates of these costs and  benefits. For economically significant regulations, we found that agencies  were more likely to monetize anticipated costs and transfers compared to  benefits and were more likely to monetize anticipated costs during  Presidents Clinton and Bush\u2019s transition periods. (See figures 11-13.) For  economically significant regulations, we also did additional analysis of the  extent to which agencies anticipated the benefits would justify the costs  and the extent to which net costs or benefits were calculated. (See  appendix II.)", "In examining the extent to which agencies anticipated that costs, benefits,  and transfers would result from significant regulations, we found that an  estimated 57 percent across all periods reviewed provided information on  the anticipated costs, benefits, transfers, or some combination of these,  with no statistical differences among the three transition periods and the  nontransition periods combined.

Among the few exceptions, economically significant regulations  published during the transition periods were more likely to have provided  advanced notice to the public and more likely to result in private sector  costs and potential benefits to society.", "However, agencies\u2019 noncompliance with the requirements of CRA for  economically significant regulations (major rules under CRA) grew worse  over time. Under CRA, agencies must allow additional time for Congress  to review these most impactful regulations before they take effect unless  the agency claims good cause for not delaying the effective date. Our  review did highlight a potential opportunity for OIRA to work with agencies  to improve CRA compliance going forward. Specifically, OIRA staff have  the unique opportunity to work with agencies before economically  significant regulations and regulations deemed significant for other  reasons are published in final form in the Federal Register. OIRA staff  should use this opportunity to identify economically significant regulations  whose planned effective dates appear at risk of not providing Congress  with sufficient time to review the regulation.", "To do this, our analysis points to a simple \u201crule of thumb\u201d OIRA reviewers  could use. If an agency is planning to make an economically significant  regulation effective in less than 3 months from the time OIRA is  completing its review, OIRA staff should discuss with agency officials  strategies for ensuring compliance with CRA. These could include  delaying the planned effective date, stating in the submission to the  Federal Register that the regulation will go into effect 60 days after  publication and ensuring prompt submission to Congress and us, or  discussing whether the agency has a reasonable basis to claim \u201cgood  cause\u201d for not delaying the effective date and ensuring that the use of  \u201cgood cause\u201d is clearly explained in the regulation.

OMB staff did not agree or disagree with our  recommendation. However, they identified some concerns regarding the  recommendation to improve agencies\u2019 compliance with CRA. They noted  that: (1) CRA states that agencies are responsible for complying with the  act\u2019s delay and submission requirements; (2) agencies determine when  their regulations will take effect and when they submit the regulations to  Congress and us, neither of which OMB has direct control over; and (3)  where OMB does exercise authority\u2014the regulatory review process  under E.O. 12866\u2014OIRA staff already take steps to check agencies\u2019  compliance with CRA, and they do not see what more they could do to  improve agencies\u2019 compliance with the act.

Regarding the third concern, we disagree that OMB has done all that it  can to improve compliance with CRA. As noted above, OMB staff  asserted that they do take steps to check for CRA compliance, and these  checks could provide a starting point for OMB to address our  recommendation. However, our analysis raises questions about how  effective these checks have been. OIRA completed its review for 110 of  the 132 noncompliant economically significant regulations within 90 days  of the stated effective date. This analysis points to a simple \u201crule of  thumb\u201d for OIRA reviewers to use. If a regulation has a planned effective  date in less than 90 days, it is at high risk of noncompliance with CRA.  Further, our report identifies three specific strategies OIRA staff could  discuss with agency officials on how to comply with CRA.

The transition periods identified in the act are those  ending on January 20 in 2001, 2009, and 2017, which occurred at the end  of the administrations of Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama.", "For purposes of this review, executive agencies are cabinet departments  and other agencies that answer directly to the President and exclude the  independent regulatory agencies. The definition of what the mandate  refers to as a \u201ccovered regulation\u201d is the same as the definition of a final  significant regulatory action under Executive Order (E.O.) 12866. Under  E.O. 12866, the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Office of  Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) reviews significant proposed  and final regulatory actions from all federal agencies (other than  independent regulatory agencies) before they are published in the  Federal Register. The order defines significant regulatory actions as  those that are likely to result in a regulation that may:  1.  Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or  adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the  economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public  health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities  (generally referred to as \u201ceconomically significant\u201d regulations);  2.  Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action  taken or planned by another agency;  3.  Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user  fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients  thereof; or  4.  Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the  President\u2019s priorities, or the principles set forth in the executive order.", "For each of the three transition periods, and among these transition  periods and the same 120-day periods in the 18 nontransition periods,  our objectives were to assess the extent to which there were variations in:  1.  The number of regulations and other indicators related to the scope  and transparency of these regulations;  2.  Agencies\u2019 reported compliance with procedural requirements for  promulgating the regulations; and  3.  The anticipated economic effects agencies reported would result from  the regulations.", "In general, to address each of these objectives we reviewed the universe  of all 527 final economically significant regulations published during the  specified time periods and a generalizable stratified random sample of  358 final significant regulations from the population of the 1,633 final  significant regulations published during those same periods. For  economically significant regulations, we can provide precise statistics on  the extent of a finding, because we reviewed the universe of final  economically significant regulations. For significant regulations, our  findings are based on a sample designed to achieve a 7 percent margin  of error and 95 percent level of confidence for each stratum in the  population of all covered significant regulations published in each  transition period and, collectively, all nontransition periods. Our findings  for the sample are not generalizable to the individual agencies that  published those regulations. We divided the significant regulations into  four strata depending on when the regulation was published: 1) the 2000- 2001 transition period; 2) the 2008-2009 transition period; 3) the 2016- 2017 transition period; and 4) all the nontransition periods consolidated  into one stratum. We made two modifications to the data for each  stratum before we selected our sample: 1) We added to the sampling  frames additional significant regulations that we had become aware of  during our review of economically significant regulations; and 2) we  reviewed the sampling frames and filtered out duplicate entries. Because  we followed a probability procedure based on random selections, our  sample is only one of a large number of samples that we might have  drawn. Since each sample could have provided different estimates, we  express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results  as a 95 percent confidence interval (for example, plus or minus 7  percentage points). This is the interval that would contain the actual  population value for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn.  Table 3 summarizes the population and sample size by stratum for  significant regulations.", "We primarily relied on the Reginfo.gov database on OMB\u2019s regulatory  reviews under E.O. 12866 to compile lists of final economically significant  and significant regulations published during each of the transition and  nontransition periods. As described in more detail below, we refined and  supplemented the lists from the Reginfo.gov database with information  from our database of rules submitted to us under the Congressional  Review Act (CRA), and the Government Printing Office\u2019s Federal Digital  System database on the Federal Register. To test the reliability of these  databases, we reviewed relevant documentation, interviewed  knowledgeable agency officials, looked for missing data and outliers (for  example, by identifying missing records or those included in error), traced  a sample of entries to source documents, and conducted additional  checks. We concluded that the data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.", "Further for all objectives and for both economically significant and  significant regulations, our primary source was the text of the published  regulation. However, as described below, we did sometimes supplement  that information with information from other publicly available sources. We  downloaded copies of published regulations from the website maintained  by the Government Printing Office, which securely controls content to  ensure the integrity and authenticity of the Federal Register. We used a  data collection instrument to collect standardized information about  individual regulations as described below. We did not evaluate the  agencies\u2019 decisions regarding procedural requirements or their  determinations regarding the effects of their rules. Instead, consistent with  our practice in preparing major rule reports to Congress under CRA and  prior reports on federal rulemaking, we are providing information about  what the agencies published in the Federal Register.", "To assess the number of regulations and other variations related to the  scope and transparency of these regulations, we first reviewed and  refined our lists of economically significant and significant regulations  published during each of the transition and nontransition periods. For  economically significant regulations, we compared the initial lists  compiled from Reginfo.gov against lists of major rules agencies had  submitted to us under CRA to look for potential omissions. We then  reviewed each of the published regulations to identify explanations  agencies may have provided of a selected regulation\u2019s classification as  economically significant under E.O. 12866 to tally total numbers of  economically significant regulations published during each of the time  periods and the agencies publishing them. To identify economically  significant regulations published annually, we looked for indications in the  title or summary of the regulation and confirmed that these regulations  appeared in multiple time periods reviewed. For significant regulations,  we obtained data from Reginfo.gov concerning the number of regulations  reportedly published and the agencies reported to have published them.  We also reviewed the published regulations for explanations of the  regulations\u2019 classification under E.O. 12866. Our sample of significant  regulations was not designed to make estimates for individual agencies,  so we used data from Reginfo.gov instead. For both economically  significant and significant final regulations, we compiled information on  the rulemaking procedures used by agencies to determine whether the  agencies had published a prior notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).", "We did this by looking for discussion of a proposed regulation in the  published final regulation. As necessary, we supplemented that review  with information from our major rule reports, if available, and data from  Reginfo.gov concerning the rulemaking history. To describe the extent to  which regulations had been advertised in the previous spring\u2019s Unified  Agenda, we searched for the regulation\u2019s identification number(s) in the  online database for the Unified Agenda.", "To assess the extent to which there were variations in agencies\u2019 reported  compliance with procedural requirements for promulgating the  regulations, we reviewed the published text of the regulations and, for  regulations that were also major rules, the major rule reports that we  prepared for Congress under CRA. We reviewed agencies\u2019 reported  compliance with procedural requirements for promulgating regulations  under five statutes\u2014CRA, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the  Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of  1995 (UMRA), and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness  Act (SBREFA)\u2014including whether and, if so, how the agency addressed  the requirement in the published regulation. To determine whether the  Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and  Health Administration held the panels they were required to hold under  SBREFA, we also reviewed the information on the Small Business  Administration\u2019s website summarizing these panels.", "We took multiple steps to identify noncompliance with CRA. We first  determined whether every regulation had been submitted to us, and for  regulations that had been submitted, we recorded the date we received  it. We used the date a regulation had been submitted to us when  assessing whether a regulation\u2019s stated effective date was consistent with  CRA requirements. We also reviewed whether agencies had claimed  \u201cgood cause\u201d for not delaying the effective date. For regulations not  submitted to us or those regulations submitted to us after they should  have been submitted, we conducted additional checks of the  Congressional Record to see if we could find evidence that the agency  had provided a copy of the regulation to either of the Houses of Congress  in time for the regulation\u2019s stated effective date to be consistent with CRA  requirements. If we could find evidence that any of these requirements  had been met, we removed the regulation from further consideration as  potentially noncompliant. As such, our methodology was designed to  identify instances of noncompliance. Our methodology does not allow us  to conclude that the remaining regulations were fully compliant. In  addition, it was beyond the scope of our review to evaluate the  appropriateness of agencies claiming \u201cgood cause\u201d for not providing the  required delay.", "To assess the extent to which there were variations in agencies\u2019 reported  anticipated economic effects resulting from the regulations, we reviewed  the published regulations to see whether they contained a section clearly  identified as economic analysis or discussion of the analytical  requirements concerning E.O. 12866. We used selected elements from  OMB Circular A-4 to review the analyses included in the published  regulations to identify expected costs, benefits, or transfers, and whether  that information was provided in monetary, quantitative, or qualitative  terms. To help identify regulations that involved transfers, we also  reviewed the annual reports OMB prepares for Congress on the costs  and benefits of federal regulations. OMB includes in these reports a list  of transfer regulations and has used a consistent definition over time.  We also looked for indication in the published regulation\u2019s economic  analysis that the regulation involved such topics as transfers, or federal  payments to certain groups in society (for example, Medicare recipients),  subsidies for certain economic activities, or user fees or royalties people  pay the government to name several common examples. To determine  the extent to which agencies discussed whether they expected that the  benefits would justify the costs, we looked for \u201cbottom line\u201d or other  concluding statements agencies may have provided in their economic  analysis. We also looked, when relevant, for a discussion of what the  net benefits or costs were expected to be. For transfer regulations that  were economically significant, we examined the extent to which agencies  quantified or monetized the expected transfers. If available, we used accounting statements agencies may have prepared summarizing the  anticipated economic effects to help collect all of this information. We did  not assess whether the agencies\u2019 determinations regarding the benefits  and costs were reasonable.
