Several other financial institutions also issue medical credit cards, usually offering their own branded product, but sometimes providing financing for retail networks or third-party companies that offer and market cards under their own names (see table). The marketplace for financing services not covered by health insurance also includes companies that assist providers in offering their own payment plans and websites that largely serve a marketing function by directing consumers to others' products. In 2013, GE Capital Retail Bank and its affiliate CareCredit entered into separate agreements with the New York Attorney General and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (known as CFPB), which had alleged deceptive card enrollment processes, including failure to provide disclosures and inaccurate information given by participating providers to consumers. Both settlements required CareCredit to make several changes to its practices, such as enhancing consumer disclosures.", "Medical credit cards from large banks offer a revolving line of credit with an established credit limit\u2014akin to a conventional credit card\u2014with some form of promotional financing (special terms and conditions, which are valid for a specified period of time). The most commonly used financing option is deferred interest, with no interest charged for a promotional period but interest charged retroactively if the balance is not paid in full before the end of the promotional period, usually 6 to 24 months. Among large banks GAO reviewed, as of May 2014, the most commonly used products had an annual percentage rate (APR) of 26.99 percent or more. Alternatively, these banks also offered revolving credit with fixed monthly payments, with an APR of 0 to 17.99 percent.

Consumers often can apply immediately at the provider\u2019s office,  sometimes with the assistance of the office staff, either online, by  telephone, or using a printed application. The card company determines  eligibility and, if the application is approved and an account is opened, is  required to provide the consumer with the account-opening disclosures  with the full terms and conditions, including fees, percentage rates, and  rate terms. Once enrolled, consumers generally interact with the card  company\u2014rather than the participating provider\u2014regarding use of the  card, and they direct their payments to the card company.", "Medical credit cards can be used to pay for elective (planned,  nonemergency) services, such as dental and orthodontic procedures, eye  correction surgery, audiology care, cosmetic procedures, and hair  removal or restoration, as well as for veterinary services.

Card issuers generally are responsible for  marketing, origination, and underwriting of accounts, and management  and collection of payments. CareCredit, Citibank, and Wells Fargo issue  medical credit cards under their own names, while Comenity works with  third-party companies (sometimes called aggregators) or retail networks  that offer and market the product under their own names.

Representatives of another company, which entered the medical credit  card market in 2003, told us that as of November 2013, dental and  orthodontia made up about 85 percent of its medical credit card business,  with the remaining 15 percent financing hair restoration, vision care, and  audiology and veterinary services. Representatives from a third company,  which entered the market in 2008, said that its largest market was for  dental and audiology services, although its card also financed veterinary  and vision services.

The settlement also limited what  the health care provider can charge in advance and required clearer  disclosure of the interest rates associated with deferred-interest products  (discussed below). It also required CareCredit to call consumers within 72  hours of the submission of a CareCredit application with a same-day  charge to confirm the account opening with the consumers and to inform  them of certain account terms, a practice that CareCredit has said it  adopted nationally.

Deferred interest  plans start accruing interest from the initial purchase date based on the  stated annual percentage rate (APR). If the entire promotional balance is  paid off during the specified promotional period (generally 6, 12, 18, or 24  months, depending on the plan), the accrued interest is waived. But if the  balance is not paid in full within the specified promotional period, the  accrued interest is assessed to the account. As seen in table 2, the APR  for consumers who did not pay off the purchase amount before the  promotional period expired varied depending on the product, but our  analysis found that most cardholders had deferred interest products with  an APR of 26.99 percent or more. One company\u2019s APR was 26.99  percent, a second ranged from 26.99 to 28.99 percent, and a third ranged  from 14.99 to 26.99 percent.
