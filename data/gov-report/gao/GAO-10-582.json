NNSA oversees eight contractor-operated sites that execute its programs. Two programs make up almost one-third of this budget: Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities (RTBF) Operations of Facilities, which operates and maintains weapons facilities and infrastructure, and Stockpile Services, which provides research and development (R&D) and production capabilities. Consistent with cost accounting standards, each site has established practices to account for these activities. The Administration has recently committed to stockpile reductions. GAO was asked to determine the extent to which NNSA's budget justifications for (1) RTBF Operations of Facilities and (2) Stockpile Services are based on the total costs of providing these capabilities. GAO was also asked to discuss the implications, if any, of a smaller stockpile on these costs. To carry out its work, GAO analyzed NNSA's and its contractors' data using a data collection instrument; reviewed policies, plans, and budgets; and interviewed officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["NNSA cannot accurately identify the total costs to operate and maintain weapons facilities and infrastructure because of differences in sites' cost accounting practices. These differences are allowable under current NNSA guidance as long as sites comply with cost accounting standards and disclose their practices to NNSA. The differences among cost accounting practices include the facilities and activities sites support with RTBF Operations of Facilities funds and how sites use other funding sources to support weapons facilities and infrastructure. GAO's analysis of sites' responses to a data collection instrument showed that the total cost to operate and maintain weapons facilities and infrastructure likely significantly exceeds the budget request for the RTBF Operations of Facilities program submitted to Congress for fiscal year 2009. NNSA has an effort under way that, if fully implemented, would provide more detail on the total costs to operate and maintain weapons facilities and infrastructure. NNSA does not fully identify or estimate the total costs of the products and capabilities supported through Stockpile Services R&D and production activities. Instead, NNSA primarily identifies the functional activities--such as engineering operations, quality control, and program management--and their costs supported through Stockpile Services and bases its future-year budget requests on the extent to which prior-year budgets were sufficient to execute these functions. In 2009, GAO issued a cost guide that identified using a product-oriented management tool, rather than a functionally oriented one, as a best practice for cost estimating. Using cost guide criteria, GAO's analysis found tracking costs by functions provides little information on the costs of the individual capabilities supported through Stockpile Services. NNSA has an effort under way that, if fully implemented, would provide more detail on the total costs of the products and capabilities supported through Stockpile Services. Reducing stockpile size is unlikely to significantly affect NNSA's RTBF Operations of Facilities and Stockpile Services costs because a sizable portion of these costs is fixed to maintain base nuclear weapons capabilities. The Administration has planned to increase budget requests for NNSA's nuclear weapons program by $4.25 billion between fiscal years 2011 and 2015. This planned increase is intended, in part, to invest in and modernize facilities and infrastructure and to ensure that base capabilities are supported such that a smaller nuclear deterrent continues to be safe, secure, and reliable. While base capability costs appear to be relatively insensitive to reductions in the stockpile, without complete and reliable information about these costs, NNSA lacks information that could help justify planned budget increases or target cost savings opportunities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Nuclear weapons have been and continue to be an essential part of the  nation\u2019s defense strategy. The end of the Cold War resulted in a dramatic  shift in how the nation maintains such weapons. Instead of designing,  testing, and producing new nuclear weapons, the strategy has shifted to  maintaining the existing nuclear weapons stockpile indefinitely and  extending the operational lives of these weapons through refurbishment,  without nuclear testing. The Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) National  Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is responsible for the  management and security of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons programs.  NNSA\u2019s annual appropriation for nuclear weapons has totaled  approximately $6.4 billion in recent years. To execute the activities to  maintain and refurbish the nation\u2019s existing nuclear weapons stockpile,  NNSA oversees eight separate sites\u2014collectively known as the nuclear  security enterprise\u2014that are managed and operated by private  contractors. Among other things, these contractors operate and maintain  the government-owned facilities and infrastructure deemed necessary to  support the nuclear weapons stockpile and to support the capabilities to  conduct scientific, technical, engineering, and production activities that  ensure the continued safety and reliability of the stockpile.", "In October 2008, NNSA put forward a plan to modernize the nuclear  security enterprise infrastructure\u2013\u2013with the intent to make it smaller and  more responsive, efficient, and secure\u2013\u2013while continuing to meet national  security requirements. NNSA\u2019s plan, if fully implemented, would  consolidate certain operations within the nuclear security enterprise and  replace its aging infrastructure with new nuclear and nonnuclear facilities  sized to support a smaller stockpile. The size of this smaller stockpile is  the outcome of recently completed negotiations between Russia and the  United States on a New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which was  signed on April 8, 2010, and, if ratified, will commit the two countries to  significant and verifiable arms reductions. The President\u2019s fiscal year 2011  budget request (1) supports increased funding to replace key nuclear  security enterprise facilities and to invest in infrastructure and (2)  anticipates requesting an additional $4.25 billion between fiscal years 2011  and 2015 over the fiscal year 2010 enacted level. This policy framework\u2014 to enable arms reductions by ensuring that the remaining stockpile and the  infrastructure on which it depends are safe, secure, and reliable\u2014is also  underscored in the newly released Nuclear Posture Review.", "The current nuclear weapons stockpile consists of seven different  warhead and bomb types delivered by four types of weapon systems,  including the following:    B61 and B83 gravity bombs delivered by dual-capable aircraft and long-   W80 warheads for cruise missiles deliverable by long-range bombers;    W76 and W88 warheads for submarine-launched ballistic missiles; and    W78 and W87 warheads for intercontinental ballistic missiles.", "In recent years, NNSA has taken steps to create system-based budgets  associated with each of these seven warhead and bomb types. These  system-based budgets represent the planned work activities NNSA  identifies as specific to each warhead or bomb type. In fiscal year 2009, the  seven system-based budgets totaled $542.8 million, or 8.5 percent of  NNSA\u2019s overall nuclear weapons budget. However, the vast majority of the  nuclear weapons budget is not system-based but rather represents funding  to support all other activities needed to operate and maintain the nuclear  security enterprise, including the intellectual and technical capabilities of  the nuclear workforce.", "Two of the largest non-system-based components of NNSA\u2019s nuclear  weapons budget are: (1) Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities (RTBF)  Operations of Facilities, the goal of which is to operate and maintain  facilities and infrastructure in a safe, secure, and reliable condition such  that they are operationally ready to execute nuclear weapons work, and (2)  Stockpile Services, the goal of which is to provide a foundation for  operations, which includes the research, development, and production  support capabilities for multiple nuclear weapon programs. In fiscal year  2009, Congress appropriated $6.41 billion for NNSA\u2019s weapons activities,  which an explanatory statement accompanying the annual appropriations  act reported as including $1.163 billion for RTBF Operations of Facilities  and $866.4 million for Stockpile Services. Together, these two components  total over $2 billion, or almost one-third of NNSA\u2019s total nuclear weapons  activities appropriation for that year.", "Consistent with Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board guidance  on identifying the full (total) cost of federal programs and activities, your  subcommittee has emphasized that NNSA should establish budgets that  reflect total program costs and that these budgets should be more  transparent to congressional oversight, particularly as efforts proceed to  modernize the nuclear security enterprise. In this context you asked us to  (1) determine the extent to which NNSA\u2019s RTBF Operations of Facilities  congressional budget justification that supplements the Budget of the  United States Government (the President\u2019s Budget) for fiscal year 2009 is  based on the total cost of operating and maintaining weapons facilities and  infrastructure; (2) determine the extent to which NNSA\u2019s fiscal year 2009  congressional budget justification for Stockpile Services identifies the  total costs of providing foundational research and production support  capabilities; and (3) discuss the implications, if any, of a smaller stockpile  on RTBF Operations of Facilities and Stockpile Services costs.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed NNSA\u2019s congressional budget  justifications for fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011, as well as accounting  records related to NNSA\u2019s execution of its RTBF Operations of Facilities  and Stockpile Services programs for fiscal year 2009. We also analyzed  documentation on NNSA\u2019s programs and activities, including national  work breakdown structures\u2014management tools NNSA uses to identify the  work activities that completely define a project or program\u2014for RTBF  Operations of Facilities and Stockpile Services. We compared NNSA\u2019s  work breakdown structures with our best practices for work breakdown  structures as published in the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment  Guide: Best Practices for Developing and Managing Capital Program  Costs. Further, we analyzed budget, cost, and program documentation  from all eight NNSA sites. We also collected data from NNSA\u2019s sites on  their nuclear weapons facilities and the sources of funding sites use to  fully support operations and maintenance of these facilities. These data  were collected using a data collection instrument that was pretested with  NNSA and several of its sites. We performed a reliability assessment of  these data and determined they were sufficiently reliable for the purposes  of this report. In addition, we analyzed NNSA\u2019s nuclear security enterprise  modernization plans and associated cost estimates. Finally, we conducted  interviews with DOE, NNSA, and site officials and toured facilities at six of  NNSA\u2019s eight sites. More details on our scope and methodology can be  found in appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2009 to June 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Established by Congress in 2000 as a separately organized agency within  DOE, NNSA has the primary mission of providing the United States with  safe, secure, and reliable nuclear weapons and maintaining core  competencies in nuclear weapons science, technology, and engineering.  To support this highly technical mission, NNSA relies on capabilities in  several thousand facilities located at eight nuclear security enterprise sites  that support weapons activities. These sites are owned by the government  but managed and operated by private contractors, and each has specific  research and development (R&D) and/or production responsibilities  within the nuclear security enterprise. (See fig. 1.)", "In addition to implementing NNSA\u2019s nuclear weapons programs, some  sites also support additional missions such as U.S. Navy nuclear  propulsion, nuclear nonproliferation activities, and work for other federal  agencies such as the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security.  NNSA\u2019s Office of Defense Programs is responsible for NNSA\u2019s weapons  activities and oversees the sites\u2019 management and operating (M&O)  contractors to execute R&D and production work. NNSA reimburses its  M&O contractors under cost-reimbursement-type contracts for the costs  incurred in carrying out the department\u2019s missions, and M&O contractors  have the opportunity to periodically earn additional award fees and  contract extensions based on annual performance assessments.", "Congress funds NNSA\u2019s nuclear weapons mission through an  appropriation titled Weapons Activities. Weapons Activities is organized  by NNSA into 14 operating programs with more than 40 budget lines  across four activity areas. In fiscal year 2009, Congress appropriated  approximately $6.4 billion for Weapons Activities, broken down by NNSA  into the four areas described in table 1.", "RTBF is the single largest program within NNSA\u2019s Weapons Activities  appropriation, with nearly $1.7 billion for fiscal year 2009, and  encompasses 90 percent of NNSA\u2019s funds designated in congressional  spending directives for the Infrastructure area. A significant RTBF  mission, executed through its Operations of Facilities subprogram, is to  operate and maintain NNSA-owned programmatic capabilities in a state of  readiness, ensuring that each capability\u2014defined to include facilities,  infrastructure, and supporting workforce\u2014is operationally ready to  execute programmatic tasks identified in ST&E and Stockpile Support.  Congressional spending directives designated nearly $1.2 billion of the  RTBF program funds in the Weapons Activities account, or about 70  percent, for RTBF Operations of Facilities at NNSA\u2019s eight sites. (See  app. II for additional discussion.)", "In 2006, NNSA and its sites sought to improve linkages between  programmatic tasks and the facilities and infrastructure that support the  nuclear weapons program. To do so, NNSA established three categories  for its facilities and infrastructure that indicate the extent to which they  are critical to the achievement of Stockpile Support and ST&E milestones:    Mission Critical facilities and infrastructure\u2014such as for nuclear weapons  production, R&D, and storage\u2014are used to perform activities to meet  highest-level Stockpile Support and/or ST&E milestones, and without these  facilities and infrastructure, operations would be disrupted or placed at risk.", "Mission Dependent, Not Critical facilities and infrastructure\u2014such as for  waste management, nonnuclear storage, and machine shops\u2014play a  supporting role in meeting Stockpile Support and/or ST&E milestones, and  loss of these facilities and infrastructure would only disrupt operations so  long as operations could not resume within 5 business days.", "Not Mission Dependent facilities and infrastructure\u2014such as cafeterias,  parking structures, and excess facilities\u2014do not have direct linkage to  Stockpile Support or ST&E milestones but support secondary missions or  quality-of-workplace initiatives.", "Together, Mission Critical and Mission Dependent, Not Critical facilities  and infrastructure are deemed \u201cmission essential.\u201d In fiscal year 2009,  NNSA categorized its over 4,500 facilities and infrastructure in these three  categories. Across the entire nuclear security enterprise, over 200  facilities and infrastructure were deemed Mission Critical and over 1,400  were deemed Mission Dependent, Not Critical.", "Directed Stockpile Work is the second largest program within NNSA\u2019s  Weapons Activities appropriation, with nearly $1.6 billion in fiscal year  2009. The Directed Stockpile Work program is executed through four  subprograms:    Stockpile Services, the largest of these subprograms, with $866.4 million in  fiscal year 2009, builds on weapons activities facilities and infrastructure  to provide the foundational capabilities to conduct R&D and production  work applicable to multiple warhead and bomb types. According to NNSA,  the capabilities supported with Stockpile Services funds enable the  achievement of other Directed Stockpile Work missions.", "Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition, with $190.2 million in fiscal year  2009, supports efforts to reduce the inventory of retired nuclear weapons  and their components.", "The Life Extension Program, with $205 million in fiscal year 2009,  represents one of NNSA\u2019s two subprograms focused on specific warhead  and bomb types. The Life Extension Program funds efforts to refurbish  and extend the expected stockpile lifetime of legacy warheads and bombs  for 20 to 30 years.", "Stockpile Systems funding supports ongoing sustainment activities for the  active nuclear weapons stockpile, such as the exchange of components  with limited lives and weapon-specific assessments. In fiscal year 2009,  Congress directed $328.5 million for these activities, which NNSA  prioritized among specific weapon and bomb types.", "NNSA reimburses its M&O contractors for the costs incurred in carrying  out NNSA\u2019s missions. These include costs that can be directly identified  with a specific NNSA program (known as direct costs)\u2014for example, the  costs for dismantling a retired weapon\u2014and costs of activities that  indirectly support a program (known as indirect costs), such as  administrative activities. To ensure that NNSA programs are appropriately  charged for incurred costs, M&O contractors\u2019 accounting systems assign  the direct costs associated with each program and collect similar types of  indirect costs into pools and allocate them among the programs.  Consistent with Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), M&O contractors must  classify their costs as either direct or indirect, and once costs are  classified, must consistently charge their costs. M&O contractors are  required to disclose their cost accounting practices in formal disclosure  statements, which are updated annually and approved by NNSA officials.  M&O contractors\u2019 cost accounting practices cannot be readily compared  with one another because contractors\u2019 methods for accumulating and  allocating indirect costs vary\u2014that is, a cost classified as an indirect cost  at one site may be classified as a direct cost at another.", "NNSA has developed national work breakdown structures for RTBF  Operations of Facilities and for Stockpile Services, management tools that  define the scope of work associated with the two subprograms. (See app.  II and app. III for these fiscal year 2009 work breakdown structures.) In  March 2009, we issued a cost estimating guide, a compilation of cost  estimating best practices from across industry and government. Among  other things, these best practices discuss establishing product-oriented  work breakdown structures, where a product is defined as an output and  100 percent of the work associated with achieving that output. Product- oriented work breakdown structures allow a program to track cost and  schedule by defined deliverables, promote accountability by identifying  work products that are independent of one another, and provide a basis  for identifying resources and tasks for developing a program cost estimate.  The ability to generate reliable cost estimates is a critical function, and a  program\u2019s cost estimate is often used to establish budgets.", "While individual M&O contractors account for the activities included in  NNSA\u2019s work breakdown structures according to their own accounting  practices and these practices vary, NNSA is required to provide reliable  and timely information on the full cost of its programs because this  information is crucial for effective management of government operations  and for oversight. Full costs include direct and indirect costs that  contribute to programs, regardless of funding sources. To meet this  requirement, NNSA needs complete and reliable information from its M&O  contractors so that it can determine the full (or total) costs of its  programs.

These differences include determining (1) which weapons  activities facilities and infrastructure individual sites support with RTBF  Operations of Facilities funds, (2) which activities included in the RTBF  Operations of Facilities work breakdown structure each site supports  directly or indirectly, and (3) the additional funding sources sites use to  support certain activities included in the RTBF Operations of Facilities  work breakdown structure. (For a detailed discussion of the differences in  M&O contractors\u2019 cost accounting practices, see app. II.) For example,    While NNSA has identified the Mission Critical facilities and  infrastructure at each of its sites, NNSA does not require M&O contractors  to pay for them with RTBF Operations of Facilities funds. In fiscal year  2009, Pantex fully funded the RTBF Operations of Facilities work scope at  all of its Mission Critical facilities with RTBF Operations of Facilities  funds. In contrast, LANL partially funded the RTBF Operations of  Facilities work scope at the majority, but not all, of its Mission Critical  facilities with RTBF Operations of Facilities funds.", "Six of the eight sites in the nuclear security enterprise reported to us that  in fiscal year 2009 they allocated the costs of certain activities included in  the RTBF Operations of Facilities work scope into indirect cost pools,  including the costs of activities such as utilities purchasing and real  property maintenance. These indirect cost pools are often funded through  multiple funding sources.", "All sites used funding in addition to RTBF Operations of Facilities funds to  pay for activities included in the RTBF Operations of Facilities work scope  in fiscal year 2009. In response to our data collection instrument, site  officials identified 11 sources of funding congressionally directed for other  Weapons Activities programs and subprograms that they expended, in  part, on activities they considered to be included in NNSA\u2019s RTBF  Operations of Facilities work breakdown structure. In addition, some sites  have developed user fee or cost recovery models for multiprogram  facilities. These models are generally based on charges to programmatic  users based on rates applied to, for example, the square footage of a  facility users occupy or the volume of waste they produce. User fees or  cost recovery may be charged as direct costs to Weapons Activities  programs as well as to other programs and projects, or they may be  charged through an indirect cost pool.", "As a result of these differences, NNSA cannot reliably identify the total  costs to operate and maintain these facilities and infrastructure across the  nuclear security enterprise.

Instead, NNSA officials  told us they rely on individual contractors to know this information for  their sites as a basis for formulating budget requests; however, some  contractors did not identify a total cost for their sites\u2019 weapons activities  facilities and infrastructure. For example, when we asked, M&O  contractors from two sites\u2014Y-12 and LANL\u2014did not provide the total cost  to operate and maintain weapons activities facilities and infrastructure at  their sites. LANL did not provide this information because site officials  could not determine the extent to which costs charged against indirect  cost pools were associated with activities included in the RTBF  Operations of Facilities work scope.

Rather, the work breakdown structure is  organized largely around work functions and only partially by specific  products or capabilities. (See app. III for a more detailed Stockpile  Services work breakdown structure.) NNSA officials told us that the  largely functionally oriented work breakdown structure for Stockpile  Services in total captures all the work activities associated with providing  foundational programmatic capabilities for R&D and production capacity  across the nuclear security enterprise. In addition, they said the work  breakdown structure for Stockpile Services is a useful management tool  for executing work functions across products and deliverables. However,  the organization of much of the work breakdown structure precludes the  ready identification of base capabilities and their costs. For example, the  activities included in the Stockpile Services work scope range widely\u2013\u2013 from basic infrastructure support to the manufacturing of actual weapons  components\u2013\u2013often without specifically identifying the products or  capabilities they are supporting.

For example, certain tools may be  used for surveillance and for other production missions. The $45.9  million identified as the costs for surveillance do not include the costs  to maintain or upgrade those tools.

A  sizable portion of these costs are fixed and represent the costs of  maintaining the base capabilities necessary to ensure that the nuclear  weapons stockpile continues to be safe, secure, and reliable without  underground nuclear testing. NNSA and its sites are working to reduce  fixed costs and to bring these costs into line with base capabilities by  modernizing and downsizing facilities and infrastructure and by  eliminating excess production and experimental capacity. However, NNSA  lacks information on the costs of these base capabilities that could  adequately justify planned budget increases, particularly with respect to  infrastructure investment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Base Capability Costs Are Unlikely to Be Significantly Affected by Reductions in Stockpile Size", "paragraphs": ["NNSA and site officials identify the scope of work captured in the RTBF  Operations of Facilities and Stockpile Services work breakdown structures  as providing the base capabilities necessary to conduct the ST&E and  system-specific work that ensures the continued safety, security, and  reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile without underground nuclear  testing. According to NNSA and site officials, most of the base capabilities  these programs provide would be necessary to maintain even if the size of  the stockpile were significantly reduced. Furthermore, NNSA and site  officials identify the majority of the costs associated with these base  capabilities as fixed and thus relatively insensitive to stockpile size. NNSA  recently analyzed its fiscal year 2008 costs to determine the extent to which  these costs represented the fixed or variable costs of sustaining the nuclear  security enterprise. NNSA\u2019s resulting analysis showed that 100 percent of  RTBF cost is fixed for certain capabilities, including high explosives and  weapons assembly/disassembly facilities and infrastructure. In addition, the  analysis showed that between 85 and 90 percent of cost was fixed for  nonnuclear components and plutonium and uranium work. Many of these  costs are included in the RTBF Operations of Facilities and Stockpile  Services work scopes.", "While we were unable to independently verify NNSA\u2019s analysis, during the  course of our review we did observe the relatively fixed nature of the  infrastructure and activities necessary to maintain base capabilities. For  example, an NNSA official estimated that the base capability cost for pit  manufacturing is about $120 million in Stockpile Services funds annually,  in comparison with overall Plutonium Sustainment funding for fiscal year  2009 of $155.3 million. Plutonium Sustainment funding also included  production-related R&D costs, as well as incremental costs for actual  component manufacturing. In addition, officials from several sites  highlighted equipment that may be operated for only a limited portion of  each year but that still must be maintained and operated when needed.  Officials at Y-12 noted that the fixed costs to maintain certain of these  capabilities currently exceed the value of their output; however, to ensure  that Stockpile Support and ST&E missions are achieved, these capabilities  must be maintained.", "While base capability costs for the nuclear security enterprise are unlikely  to significantly decline as a result of stockpile reductions, a primary  purpose of NNSA\u2019s effort to modernize the nuclear security enterprise is to  reduce the overall level of fixed costs at and among sites by consolidating  infrastructure and reducing capacity to base levels without compromising  national security. According to an NNSA official, 10 years from now one- third of NNSA\u2019s total existing facilities and infrastructure will be in excess  of programmatic need. Furthermore, NNSA\u2019s modernization plans call for  consolidating experimental capabilities among sites within the complex  and for reducing excess production capacity. We previously reported on  efforts at several sites, including LANL and LLNL, to reduce or eliminate  storage of significant quantities of weapons-grade special nuclear material  in site facilities. We also recently reported on progress to replace KCP  infrastructure with a new, modern facility that NNSA expects to result in  significantly reduced operations and maintenance costs for that site.  Other efforts include construction of the new Highly Enriched Uranium  Materials Facility at Y-12, which will enable closure of several older  storage facilities at the Y-12 site. In addition, facility disposition at multiple  sites, including LANL, LLNL, NTS, Pantex, and Y-12, will reduce both  ongoing maintenance costs and deferred maintenance backlogs.  Consolidation of equipment at NTS will reduce maintenance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA Lacks Information on Program Costs That Could Help Justify Planned Budget Increases", "paragraphs": ["While base capability costs appear to be relatively insensitive to changes  in the stockpile, complete and reliable information about the costs of  these capabilities is necessary for sound program management and to help  inform future planning. This is particularly important in the current  political and budgetary environment, in which stockpile reductions are  anticipated, and the Administration has planned to increase budget  requests for Weapons Activities by $4.25 billion over the fiscal year 2010  enacted level between fiscal years 2011 and 2015. This planned budget  increase is envisioned in part to ensure adequate support to maintain and  improve base capabilities, including infrastructure recapitalization and  replacement. In such an environment, NNSA is likely to face increased  scrutiny of its planning, programming, and budget execution to determine  the effect of funding increases on the overall health of base capabilities.", "In the past, Congress, we, and NNSA have examined different ways of  generating information on the costs of the nuclear weapons program that  would be useful to NNSA management and congressional decision makers  for planning purposes. In 2000 we recommended that NNSA develop a  method to relate its program structure to DOE\u2019s cost accounting  considerations so that fixed and variable costs of the program\u2019s activities  could be determined and made available when the program makes its  annual budget submission. In fiscal year 2005, NNSA reorganized its  budget structure in response to congressional appropriations committees,  which instructed NNSA to begin budgeting by warhead and bomb type\u2014 another way to understand program costs. The current budget structure  does identify some type-specific information. However, NNSA and site  officials have continued to caution against allocating RTBF and Stockpile  Services costs to specific warhead or bomb types, stating that allocating  fixed costs does not really provide any additional information than is  already available and could prove to be misleading; in the event of  stockpile reductions, fixed costs would simply be reallocated across  remaining warhead and bomb types and fail to produce the significant cost  savings that might be anticipated.", "Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) No. 4,  Managerial Cost Accounting Standards, states a general standard for  federal agencies to provide reliable and timely information on the full cost  of federal programs. The principal purpose of SFFAS No. 4 is to determine  the cost of delivering a program or output to allow an organization to  assess the reasonableness of this cost or to establish a baseline for  comparison. Congressional appropriations committees sought to define  individual warhead and bomb types as NNSA\u2019s programs; however, since  2005 NNSA has defined its programs as a mix of individual warhead and  bomb types, production and R&D functions that support multiple warhead  and bomb types, facilities and infrastructure support, and other supporting  programs such as security. In part, NNSA has done so because DOE\u2019s  accounting guidance does not require NNSA to allocate basic R&D costs  and certain infrastructure capacity costs. Also, by identifying RTBF and  Stockpile Services as programs, NNSA has identified in its budget  structure costs it has determined are fixed. Going forward, NNSA appears  to be moving toward a budget structure aimed at ensuring sufficient  funding to sustain base capabilities and to identify additional funding that  may be necessary to modernize capabilities or to achieve a level of  research or production capacity above the base level. NNSA currently  lacks the total cost information about its existing programs to ensure it  can accurately identify the costs of its base capabilities for future budget  justifications. Through its ongoing effort to revise its Defense Programs  work breakdown structure, which includes portions associated with RTBF  Operations of Facilities and Stockpile Services, NNSA has the opportunity  to capture this information. More specifically,    NNSA\u2019s preliminary revisions to its national work breakdown structure for  RTBF Operations of Facilities reorients the work breakdown structure  around capabilities and products; highlights Mission Critical facilities  that support these capabilities; and identifies three types of costs to  support these capabilities: (1) operations, which represents the current  program; (2) risk reduction, which includes costs above base capability to  support facility and equipment upgrades; and (3) transformation, which  includes costs to replace facilities and infrastructure or otherwise  significantly invest in their modernization. These revisions are positive  developments that we believe will enable NNSA to improve its  understanding of facilities and infrastructure costs paid for with  congressionally directed RTBF Operations of Facilities funds and to  improve the transparency of its RTBF Operations of Facilities budget  justification. According to NNSA officials, once the revised work  breakdown structure for all of Defense Programs has been fully  implemented, it should allow NNSA to capture information on the total  costs to operate and maintain weapons activities facilities and  infrastructure, not just those costs paid for with congressionally directed  funds for RTBF Operations of Facilities. In the absence of total cost  information, according to a senior NNSA official, NNSA is challenged to  balance operations and maintenance costs with recapitalization projects  and with large facility replacement projects.", "According to NNSA officials, the portion of the revised Defense Programs  work breakdown structure for Stockpile Services will include a  reorientation around capabilities and products, where possible. While  several NNSA officials said that improving cost estimating is not a primary  impetus for revising the Stockpile Services work breakdown structure  because all Stockpile Services costs are fixed, officials responsible for  revising the Defense Programs work breakdown structure told us that  doing so will help achieve transparent cost reporting from disparate  contractor cost accounting systems, regardless of the fixed nature of these  costs. Without identifying the total costs of Stockpile Services-supported  products and capabilities, NNSA will be challenged to explain the effects  of funding changes or justify the necessity for increased investment to  support or enhance base capabilities. It is important to recognize that  having a product- or capability-oriented work breakdown structure for  Stockpile Services that includes associated support costs should not  reduce NNSA\u2019s or its M&O contractors\u2019 flexibility to manage Stockpile  Services activities by function."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Within the global community, the Administration, and Congress, a bargain is  being struck on nuclear weapons policy. Internationally, if the treaty is  ratified, significant stockpile reductions have been negotiated between the  United States and Russia. Domestically, a new Nuclear Posture Review has  provided an updated policy framework for the nation\u2019s nuclear deterrent. To  enable this arms reduction agenda, the Administration is requesting from  Congress billions of dollars in increased investment in the nuclear security  enterprise to ensure that base scientific, technical, and engineering  capabilities are sufficiently supported such that a smaller nuclear deterrent  continues to be safe, secure, and reliable. For its part, NNSA must  accurately identify these base capabilities and determine their costs in order  to adequately justify future presidential budget requests and show the  effects on its programs of potential budget increases. As it now stands,  NNSA may not be accurately identifying the costs of base capabilities  because (1) without guidance to M&O contractors for consistent reporting,  NNSA cannot identify the total costs to operate and maintain essential  weapons activities facilities and infrastructure, and (2) NNSA analyzes the  reported costs of R&D and production functions without fully identifying  these functions with the specific capabilities supported through Stockpile  Services. Without taking action to identify these costs, NNSA risks being  unable to identify the return on investment of planned budget increases on  the health of its base capabilities or to identify opportunities for cost saving.  NNSA has the opportunity to mitigate these risks by addressing them  through the ongoing revision of work breakdown structures and through  identifying means of collecting the total costs of its base capabilities from  M&O contractors, which will not necessitate any changes to the way that  Weapons Activities programs are budgeted or how funds are expended.

Within the subprogram, NNSA obligates funds to its eight sites for  expenditure. In fiscal year 2009, NNSA obligated $866.4 million to its sites  to execute Stockpile Services work scope (see fig. 2).", "According to our cost guide, a work breakdown structure is the  cornerstone of every program because it defines in detail the work  necessary to accomplish a program\u2019s objectives and promotes  accountability by identifying work products that are independent of one  another. This provides a basis for identifying resources and tasks for  developing a program cost estimate. The ability to generate reliable cost  estimates is a critical function, and a program\u2019s cost estimate is often used  to establish budgets. NNSA\u2019s sites may create further levels of detail  within the work breakdown structure for their own management,  budgeting, or cost collection. Our cost guide is a compilation of cost  estimating best practices from across industry and government. Among  other things, these best practices discuss establishing a product-oriented  work breakdown structure, which allows a program to track cost and  schedule by defined deliverables. This allows a program manager to more  precisely identify which components are causing cost or schedule  overruns and to more effectively mitigate the root causes of overruns. For  NNSA, a product may best be thought of more broadly as a capability,  since a significant portion of NNSA\u2019s mission is research and development  (R&D). Thus, a product-oriented work breakdown structure for NNSA  could be focused on the capability to execute a class of experiments, to  produce a weapon component, or to conduct specified R&D. Our cost  guide emphasizes that a product-oriented work breakdown structure  should contain program management and other overhead activities to  make sure all work activities are included. In contrast, a functionally  based work breakdown structure\u2014for example, one based on  manufacturing, engineering, or quality control\u2014would not have the  detailed information to reflect cost, schedule, and technical performance  on specific deliverables. Table 5 provides NNSA\u2019s work breakdown  structure applicable to all sites for fiscal year 2009 and showing four levels  of detail.", "In fil yer 2009, $59.6 million in Prodc- tion Support fndas pent to provide  tooling nd tooling ervice ite where  prodction work occ.

More specifically,  these support activities\u2014such as engineering and manufacturing  operations; quality supervision and control; tool, gage, and equipment  services (tooling); purchasing, shipping, and materials management;  and electronic information systems\u2014enable the production of  weapons components and weapon assembly/disassembly, and help  support surveillance testing. To this end, NNSA officials characterized  Production Support as paying directly for the indirect activities at  individual sites that (1) are associated with providing manufacturing  support for production processes and (2) support more than one  warhead or bomb type.", "Management, Technology, and Production (MTP). MTP is the second  largest activity group within Stockpile Services. According to NNSA,  MTP includes activities that (1) sustain and improve stockpile  management, (2) develop and deliver weapon use control  technologies, and (3) result in production of weapons components for  use in multiple warhead and bomb types. In contrast to Production  Support activities that are focused on individual sites\u2019 production  missions, MTP includes those activities that benefit the nuclear  security enterprise as a whole. NNSA officials characterized MTP as  supporting a mix of direct and indirect activities. More specifically,  among other things, MTP management funds support weapons test  data archiving and other shared data systems; MTP technology funds  support studies and assessments relating to the safety and security of  nuclear weapons; and MTP production funds support the interpretation  of the results from surveillance tests, which are used to monitor and  evaluate the condition, safety, and reliability of weapons in the  stockpile. In addition, certain activities are captured within MTP that  would be classified by NNSA if associated with a specific warhead or  bomb type. According to NNSA officials, costs for these activities  represent a relatively small amount of MTP, which one official  estimated at approximately 10 percent of surveillance costs, or about  $4.6 million in fiscal year 2009.", "In fil yer 2009, NNSA nd it M&O  contrctor pent $9. million in R&D  Certifiction nd Safety fnd supporting the  base cability to condct hydrodynmic nd  subcriticl te.

R&D Certification and Safety provides  the underlying capabilities to mature basic research conducted in  ST&E programs. In this sense, R&D Certification and Safety serves as a  technology development bridge between research and weaponized  technologies. Among other things, R&D Certification and Safety funds  support three major activities. First, funds are used to support design  work to develop certain limited life weapon components that are used  in multiple warhead and bomb types and that must be exchanged on a  regular basis because they expire. Second, funds support the  specialized facilities, equipment, and personnel to maintain a base  capability to perform hydrodynamic tests, which examine the  performance of nuclear weapons pits using surrogate materials to  replace fissionable materials, and subcritical experiments, which  examine the material properties of plutonium. Finally, funds support  the preparation of various types of studies, including those produced  annually to report to the President of the United States on the safety,  security, and reliability of the stockpile.", "R&D Support. R&D Support is the smallest of the functional work  activity groups in Stockpile Services. R&D Support consists largely of  indirect activities that provide administrative and infrastructure  support for sites\u2019 R&D missions.

Plutonium Sustainment is the only fully  product-oriented activity group in Stockpile Services. While  incorporated as an activity group within Stockpile Services, Plutonium  Sustainment has its own work breakdown structure that is independent  from the other four Stockpile Services activity groups. The Plutonium  Sustainment work breakdown structure includes production support,  R&D support, and program management activities. According to an  NNSA official, this work breakdown structure, which captures work  activities associated with pit manufacturing and related R&D\u2014as well  as associated indirect and overhead costs\u2014is largely a legacy from  when Plutonium Sustainment was an ST&E program instead of part of  Stockpile Services. This is markedly different from the other four  groups, where production or R&D activities are organized separately  from their supporting overhead activities. The same NNSA officials said  that nearly all Plutonium Sustainment funds are spent at LANL, which  is home to the nation\u2019s pit manufacturing capability. These funds not  only support the base capabilities for plutonium R&D and pit  manufacturing, but also contribute to the operation and maintenance of  the facilities and infrastructure necessary to conduct these activities as  well as the actual manufacturing of a limited number of pits each year."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the National Nuclear Security Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, the following staff members made  key contributions to this report: Jonathan Gill, Assistant Director; John  Bauckman; Allison Bawden; Muriel Brown; Abe Dymond; Eugene Gray;  Carol Henn; Alison O\u2019Neill; Timothy Persons; Cheryl Peterson; Rebecca  Shea; Vasiliki Theodoropoulos; Jack Warner; and Franklyn Yao."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
