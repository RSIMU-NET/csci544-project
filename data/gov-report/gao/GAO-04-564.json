WHO activated its global infectious disease network and deployed public health specialists to affected areas in Asia to provide technical assistance. WHO also established international teams to identify the cause of SARS and provide guidance for managing the outbreak. WHO's ability to respond to SARS in Asia was limited by its authority under the current International Health Regulations and dependent on cooperation from affected areas. U.S. government agencies played key roles in responding to SARS in Asia and controlling its spread into the United States, but these efforts revealed limitations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention supplied public health experts to WHO for deployment to Asia and gave direct assistance to Taiwan. It also tried to contact passengers from flights and ships on which a traveler was diagnosed with SARS after arriving in the United States. However, these efforts were hampered by airline concerns and procedural issues. The State Department helped facilitate the U.S. government's response to SARS but encountered multiple difficulties when it tried to arrange medical evacuations for U.S. citizens infected with SARS overseas. Although the Asian governments we studied initially struggled to recognize the SARS emergency and organize an appropriate response, they ultimately established control. As the governments have acknowledged, their initial response to SARS was hindered by poor communication, ineffective leadership, inadequate disease surveillance systems, and insufficient public health capacity. Improved screening, rapid isolation of suspected cases, enhanced hospital infection control, and quarantine of close contacts ultimately helped end the outbreak. The SARS crisis temporarily dampened consumer confidence in Asia, costing Asian economies $11 billion to $18 billion and resulting in estimated losses of 0.5 percent to 2 percent of total output, according to official and academic estimates. SARS had significant, but temporary, negative impacts on a variety of economic activities, especially travel and tourism. The SARS outbreak added impetus to the revision of the International Health Regulations. WHO and its member states are considering expanding the scope of required disease reporting to include all public health emergencies of international concern and devising a system for better cooperation with WHO and other countries. Some questions are not yet resolved, including WHO's authority to conduct investigations in countries absent their consent, the enforcement mechanism to resolve compliance issues, and how to ensure public health security without unduly interfering with travel and trade."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the first major new infectious  disease of the 21st century, emerged in southern China in November 2002.

The disease spread rapidly along international air  routes through Asia, North America, and Europe in early 2003, eventually  infecting 8,098 people and causing 774 deaths. Asian countries were the  hardest hit, with 7,782 cases and 729 deaths. The 2002-2003 SARS outbreak  presented a challenge to Asian health care systems and disrupted Asian  economies. The World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. government,  and Asian governments all played a role in controlling the SARS outbreak  in Asia.

We  supplemented our field-level information with interviews with WHO and  U.S. government officials responsible for managing the response to SARS  and recognized public health experts; we also reviewed relevant  documents and reports. To describe the economic impact of SARS in Asia,  we reviewed official macroeconomic and sector data as well as economic  impact studies from international financial institutions, industry  associations, and public policy research organizations. We determined that  the official national accounts data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our analysis by reviewing supplementary documentary  evidence and each economy\u2019s compliance with data dissemination  standards.

Nevertheless, the U.S. strongly believed that the draft should also  require reporting of a defined list of certain known, serious,  communicable diseases that have the potential for creating such a  concern.", "Authority to conduct investigations. Member states are considering  the appropriate level of authority for the regulations. Specifically, an  unresolved issue is the degree to which the regulations will require  binding international commitments or more voluntary standards. To  address this issue, member states are examining whether the benefits  that would result from agreeing to more rigorous, comprehensive, and  mandatory regulations would outweigh losses in sovereignty. For  example, the draft regulations eliminate the language in the current  regulations that specifically requires WHO to first obtain consent from  the member state involved before conducting on-the-spot investigations  of disease outbreaks. However, the draft regulations are still somewhat  ambiguous about whether consent is necessary. According to a senior  WHO official, the proposed regulations were intentionally left vague  about consent because it is a subject that members will want to debate  thoroughly.", "Public health capacity of developing countries. The draft  regulations provide member states with direction regarding the  minimum core surveillance and response capacities required at the  national level, including at airports, ports, and other points of entry.  However, U.S. and WHO officials note that many developing countries  currently lack even the most rudimentary public health capacity and will  be dependent on significant international assistance to reach minimum  surveillance and response capabilities. HHS officials have expressed  caution about developing more comprehensive and demanding  requirements that will be difficult for many countries with limited  resources to implement. WHO officials acknowledge that, while WHO is  able to provide technical assistance through GOARN, multilateral  institutions, such as the World Bank, and donor countries will have to  provide significant resources for developing countries to meet minimum  surveillance and response requirements. A WHO official also indicated  that while the proposed revisions to the regulations do not have specific  provisions on technical assistance, developing countries are likely to  raise the issue of adding such a provision during the revision process.", "Enforcement mechanism. The members will have to address what  kind of enforcement mechanism they want included in the regulations  to resolve compliance issues and to deal with violations of the  regulations. According to WHO officials, failure to comply with WHO  public health requirements is often a problem. The draft regulations, like  the current regulations, include a nonbinding mechanism for resolving  disputes. Thus, the WHO Director-General is directed either to (1) make  every effort to resolve disputes or (2) refer disputes to a WHO Review  Committee, which is tasked to forward its views and advice to the  parties involved. Although WHO would continue to be dependent on the  voluntary compliance of member states, WHO officials believe that if  key countries (such as the United States) and neighboring trade  partners are sufficiently concerned about the dangers of emerging  diseases to press for compliance with the revised regulations, other  countries are likely to fulfill their obligations. Furthermore, though it is  too early to predict how China\u2019s response to SARS in 2003 will affect  future compliance, WHO officials say the negative political, economic,  and public health effects China suffered from its initial response to  SARS served as a warning to countries that ignore their international  public health responsibilities.", "International traffic. The stated purpose of the draft regulations,  which is similar to the current regulations, is to provide security against  the international spread of disease while avoiding unnecessary  interference with international traffic. Although the term international  traffic appears to refer to international travel and trade, neither the  proposed nor the current regulations define the term. Furthermore, the  draft regulations do not include detailed criteria for determining what  constitutes interference with international trade and travel. A WHO  official indicated that it was preferable not to include detailed criteria  and to allow this issue to be decided on a case-by-case basis because of  the very broad range of situations that could ultimately cause such  interference. This issue could receive a good deal of attention in the  revision process as member states try to balance medical and economic  concerns. According to WHO officials, in past epidemics, concerns  about economic loss and restrictions on trade and travel caused some  countries not to report outbreaks within their borders and to refuse  international assistance. Furthermore, for certain outbreaks\u2014for  example, those involving cholera in Peru in 1991 and plague in India in  1994\u2014some experts reported that the international response may have  exceeded the level of threat and led to unwarranted trade and travel  losses in those countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Completing the Revision Process Seen as High Priority", "paragraphs": ["The process for revising the International Health Regulations was  intensified by a WHO World Health Assembly resolution passed in May  2003, during the SARS outbreak, urging members to give high priority to the  revision process and to provide the resources and cooperation to facilitate  this work. The resolution also requested that the WHO Director-General  consider informal sources of information to respond to outbreaks such as  SARS; collaborate with national authorities in assessing the severity of  infectious disease threats and the adequacy of control measures; and, when  necessary, send a WHO team to conduct on-the-spot studies in places  experiencing infectious disease outbreaks. Although the resolution did not  impose legally binding obligations on members, according to WHO officials  and some observers it did lay the political groundwork for improved  international cooperation on infectious disease control.", "In January 2004, WHO distributed to its member states an interim draft of  the revisions proposed by the WHO Secretariat. Composed of 55 articles  and 10 technical annexes, the draft will be discussed in a series of regional  consultations throughout 2004. The degree of consensus on the draft\u2019s  technical and political issues will then determine the need for subsequent  meetings at the global level. The goal is to convene an intergovernmental  working group at the end of 2004 to finalize revisions to the draft  regulations. It is hoped the regulations will then be ready for submission to  the 58th World Health Assembly in May 2005. However, according to WHO  and HHS officials, reaching both technical and political consensus on the  regulations will be a difficult task, and they expect the revision process to  extend beyond its target date."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["While the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak had an impact on health and commerce  in Asia, the extensive response by WHO and Asian governments, supported  in large measure by the U.S. government, was ultimately effective in  controlling the outbreak. This event highlighted a number of important  issues, including the limited resources to support WHO\u2019s global infectious  disease network and deficiencies in Asian governments\u2019 public health  systems. It also revealed limitations in the International Health  Regulations.", "In the aftermath of SARS, WHO and member states have recognized the  importance of strengthening international collaboration and cooperation to  respond to global infectious disease outbreaks. To be successful, this effort  will require a greater commitment of resources for global infectious  disease control and a concerted effort to revise the International Health  Regulations to make them more relevant and useful in future outbreaks. As  the regulations are revised, WHO and member states face the challenge of  improving the management of disease outbreaks while mitigating adverse  economic impacts. The content, manner of acceptance, and means of  enacting the final revisions are not certain, and much work remains to be  done to resolve outstanding issues. As of April 2004, SARS has not re- emerged to cause another major international outbreak, but outbreaks of  other infectious diseases can be expected in the future. Therefore,  strengthening public health capacity will be essential for responding to  future infectious disease outbreaks.", "The SARS outbreak also revealed gaps in U.S. government protective  measures, including difficulties in arranging medical evacuations from  overseas and the inability to trace and contact individuals exposed to SARS  during travel. In regard to tracing international travelers who may have  been exposed to an infectious disease, we believe that amending HHS  regulations to specify that the agency has authority to obtain this  information would assist this effort. This action would facilitate HHS\u2019s  ability to obtain necessary contact information (1) from airlines or shipping  companies that may have concerns about sharing passenger information  with HHS, or (2) in the event that issues involving coordination with other  federal agencies cannot be effectively resolved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["This report is making three recommendations to improve the response to  infectious disease outbreaks. First, to strengthen the international  response, we recommend that the Secretary of Health and Human Services,  in collaboration with the Secretary of State, work with WHO and official  representatives from other WHO member states to strengthen WHO\u2019s  global infectious disease network capacity to respond to disease  outbreaks, for example, by expanding the available pool of public health  experts.", "Second, to help Health and Human Services prevent the introduction,  transmission, or spread of infectious diseases into the United States, we  recommend that the Secretary of HHS complete the necessary steps to  ensure that the agency can obtain passenger contact information in a  timely and comprehensive manner, including, if necessary, the  promulgation of regulations specifically for this purpose.", "Third, to protect U.S. government employees and their families working  overseas and to better support other U.S. citizens living or traveling  overseas, we recommend that the Secretary of State continue to work with  the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Defense to identify  public and private sector resources for medical evacuations during  infectious disease outbreaks and develop procedures for arranging these  evacuations. Such efforts could include  working with private air ambulance companies and the Department of  Defense to determine their capacity for transporting patients with an  emerging infectious disease such as SARS, and  working to develop agreements under which U.S. medical facilities near  international ports of entry will accept medically evacuated patients  with infectious diseases such as SARS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["HHS, State, and WHO provided written comments on a draft of this report  (see apps. IV, V, and VI for a reprint of HHS\u2019s, State\u2019s, and WHO\u2019s  comments). They also provided technical and clarifying comments that we  have incorporated where appropriate. HHS said the report is a good  summary of the SARS outbreak in Asia and the actions taken by WHO,  affected countries, and U.S. agencies. HHS stated that the report\u2019s  recommendations are appropriate and emphasized the national and  international interagency collaboration that will be required to implement  them in preparation for the next epidemic. HHS also noted that to carry out  some of the recommendations, sensitive legal and privacy issues and  diplomatic concerns must be carefully addressed. HHS also noted that the  report contains a useful overview of WHO\u2019s efforts to revise its  International Health Regulations and correctly ties WHO\u2019s increased effort  to the impact of SARS and lessons learned. In that regard, HHS provided  additional information on coordination and collaboration efforts it took  during the outbreak.", "State indicated that the report is a useful summary of the SARS outbreak  and its impact and documents important lessons for other infectious  disease outbreaks beyond the 2003 SARS epidemic. Regarding our first  recommendation, State said it is committed to working with WHO and its  member states to strengthen the response capacity of WHO\u2019s global  infectious disease network. Regarding our recommendation on contact  tracing of arriving passengers infected or exposed to infectious disease,  State noted that it has been working on this issue with its interagency  partners since the SARS outbreak but underscored that serious legal issues  still exist for both the United States and other governments. State also  agreed with our recommendation on developing procedures for arranging  medical evacuations during an airborne infectious disease outbreak. State  indicated that it is working with CDC to develop protocols on how to  handle medical evacuations for quarantinable diseases but noted that  capacity for such medical evacuations will be limited, as will capacity of  U.S. medical facilities to handle a large influx of patients.", "WHO stated that, overall, the report provides a factual analysis of the  events surrounding the emergence of SARS and addresses the major  weaknesses in national and international control efforts. WHO noted,  however, that the report presents major criticisms of the response by  China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan to SARS but does not reflect these  governments\u2019 actions throughout the SARS epidemic or the depth and  intensity of their control efforts later on. WHO also stated that the report  puts little emphasis on other countries that experienced problems\u2014 Canada, for example. We disagree that the report does not adequately  balance the governments\u2019 shortcomings with accomplishments, as the  report includes specific sections on improved screening and reporting of  SARS cases, rapid isolation and contact tracing, enhanced hospital  infection control practices, and quarantine measures. The report details  steps Asian governments have taken in response to SARS to build capacity  for future outbreaks. The preponderance of our evidence on Asian  governments\u2019 response was provided directly by Chinese, Hong Kong, and  Taiwan government and public health officials and from post-SARS  evaluation reports produced by these governments and WHO-sponsored  conferences. We focused our report on the response of China, Hong Kong,  and Taiwan since 95 percent of the SARS cases occurred there. The  response of other countries, such as Canada was outside the scope of our  examination.", "Regarding our discussion of WHO\u2019s global infectious disease network,  WHO stated that GOARN is one of the mechanisms by which WHO  mobilizes technical resources for outbreak investigation and response  provided further information about the role of the Western Pacific Regional  Office (WPRO) in the SARS response. We clarified the role of GOARN and  expanded our discussion on the activities of WPRO. WHO also said that its  response was challenged, but not constrained, by limited resources. While  we agree with this more general characterization, we believe that not being  able to obtain the appropriate multidisciplinary staff and sustain a response  over time were significant constraints that warrant serious attention in  preparing for future emerging infectious diseases. WHO also noted that the  world\u2019s dependence on a fragile process and on the personal commitment  and sacrifice of WHO and GOARN staff is a concern."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To assess WHO\u2019s actions to respond to SARS in Asia, we analyzed WHO  policy, program, and budget documents, including WHO\u2019s Web-based  situation updates and guidelines that served as the primary instrument for  disseminating information on SARS.
