In addition, the act shifted important responsibilities for welfare from the federal government to the states. Housing programs, some of them dating back to the 1980s, and recent changes in housing policies have also encouraged work and self-sufficiency. The changes in housing policies are intended to make public housing agencies, as well as tenants, less dependent on federal subsidies.", "Many recipients of federal housing assistance have been or will be affected by the changes in both welfare and housing programs and policies. According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s (HUD) data, about 29 percent of the households that received housing assistance also received Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) as of September 1996. A majority of these households reside either in public housing or in private rental units\u2014under HUD\u2019s Section 8 certificate and voucher programs\u2014that they select and that HUD subsidizes through payments by public housing agencies to landlords of a portion of each household\u2019s rent. Because households that receive housing assistance generally pay 30 percent of their income for housing, changes in tenants\u2019 incomes resulting from welfare reform will affect the rental revenue that public housing agencies receive and the amounts of the subsidies they need from HUD to cover their operating costs. Several federal departments, the states, and local public housing and welfare agencies have roles in efforts to move families from welfare and housing assistance to work and self-sufficiency."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Purpose, Provisions, and Status of Welfare Reform", "paragraphs": ["The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 established time limits and work requirements to promote self-sufficiency for families on welfare. The act replaced the entitlement program\u2014AFDC\u2014with block grants to the states under Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). The fixed amounts of states\u2019 grants under the new law are based on the amount of their grants in specified fiscal years under prior law, supplemented for population increases under certain circumstances. In total, TANF grants to the states are authorized at $16.5 billion per year. With respect to state funding, the federal welfare reform law includes a \u201cmaintenance of effort\u201d provision requiring the states to provide 75 or 80 percent of their historic level of funding. Under the act, the states must meet statewide mandatory requirements for the percentage of families engaged in work activities or their TANF grants will be reduced. In turn, if a recipient family fails to participate as required, the state must reduce and may terminate the family\u2019s cash assistance. The act also imposed a 60-month lifetime limit on the receipt of TANF benefits for most individuals. In addition, the federal welfare reform law increased federal funding for child care subsidies for low-income families under the Child Care and Development Fund, authorized to provide $3 billion in fiscal year 1997 and increase to $3.7 billion by 2002. The act also tightened the eligibility requirements for food stamps and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), a source of cash assistance for some children with special needs, immigrants, and others.", "In subsequent legislation, the Congress restored SSI benefits for many legal aliens, ensured Medicaid coverage for some children who became ineligible for SSI benefits, and authorized $3 billion in welfare-to-work grants to the states for fiscal years 1998 and 1999, to be overseen by the Department of Labor.

These efforts are designed to promote self-sufficiency on the part of both tenants and housing agencies. Specifically, HUD now manages a variety of self-sufficiency programs, such as the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program, which provides employment-related services for tenants of public and assisted housing who volunteer for the program. The Congress, through appropriations bills, has implemented changes in public housing policies to encourage work. The revised policies eliminate requirements for public housing agencies to give preference only to the poorest of the poor in selecting tenants and allow the agencies to establish local preferences, ceiling rents, and adjustments to earned income. HUD and the Congress have also proposed permanent legislation that would, among other things, consolidate public housing programs and increase the mix of incomes among tenants."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Self-Sufficiency Programs", "paragraphs": ["Since the mid-1980s, HUD has provided housing-based self-sufficiency and economic opportunity programs to deliver supportive services to the tenants of public and assisted housing. These programs have provided job training, counseling, and placement services; child care; and transportation. Several of these programs require coordination with other local efforts. One of the most widely used of these programs, FSS, was created under the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-625) to help the tenants of public and assisted housing reduce their reliance on welfare and gain employment through education, training, and supportive services. Since fiscal year 1993, HUD has required housing agencies that receive additional public housing units or Section 8 certificates and vouchers to participate in FSS. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (42 U.S.C. 11901 et seq.), as amended, authorized the Public and Assisted Housing Drug Elimination program, whose goal is to provide alternative approaches to reducing crime and drug activity in public and assisted housing. Under this program, HUD awards grants to housing agencies and owners of assisted housing for activities such as protective services, drug prevention programs, and youth sports programs. Other self-sufficiency programs include the Economic Development and Supportive Services grant program and Jobs Plus, both of which provide housing agencies with additional resources and incentives to encourage tenants to achieve self-sufficiency.

These changes eliminated the requirement that housing agencies select families from their waiting lists on the basis of federal preferences and allowed the agencies to establish local preferences, ceiling rents, and adjustments to earned income. Local preferences enable housing agencies to select working families, those in employment and training programs, veterans, and persons living in the immediate vicinity to fill vacant units. The agencies may determine which preference(s) to implement as long as they do not change the makeup of their developments in a way that would displace elderly or disabled tenants.", "Ceiling rents\u2014levels above which rents no longer rise with increases in tenants\u2019 incomes\u2014are designed to attract, retain, and support working families, who are generally thought to provide leadership to housing developments and serve as role models for other tenants. A ceiling rent must reflect the reasonable market value of the housing unit and cannot be less than the monthly per-unit operating costs. HUD considers ceiling rents useful in easing the rent burden on working families residing in public housing. In addition, ceiling rents can create incentives for tenants to save money and purchase their own homes. The Continuing Resolution provided a transition rule allowing housing agencies to establish ceiling rents until HUD issues final regulations. HUD proposed a regulation on ceiling rents for public housing in November 1997.", "Like ceiling rents, adjustments to earned income can be used to attract working families, increase the mix of incomes among public housing tenants, and help tenants save money and become homeowners. Adjustments to earned income allow housing agencies to exclude certain types of income in calculating rents.

Of these, the most important for housing agencies are operating subsidies (to offset some or all of any shortfall between rental revenue and operating costs) and modernization funds. HUD also provides rental assistance to tenants through certificates and vouchers. Housing agencies can compete for a variety of grants, such as those for operating Drug Elimination programs. Housing agencies can also compete for Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere (HOPE) grants to revitalize severely distressed housing through both physical improvements and activities, such as training and education, to promote residents\u2019 self-sufficiency.

Report 105-175), we identified (1) the impact of welfare reform on the revenue sources, employment status of tenants, and roles of selected housing agencies and (2) HUD\u2019s role in assisting housing agencies and their clients as they adapt to welfare reform.", "To obtain information about the impact of welfare reform on the revenue sources, employment status of tenants, and roles of selected housing agencies, we interviewed and gathered studies from HUD officials, researchers, and interest groups, including those representing housing agencies and the recipients of housing assistance. To identify the factors that determine tenants\u2019 prospects of moving from welfare to work, we reviewed various studies on welfare and housing. We also contracted with Mathematica Policy Research, Incorporated, to use its Simulation of Trends in Employment, Welfare, and Related Dynamics (STEWARD) model to estimate the impact of alternative welfare reform plans and economic scenarios on welfare recipients with and without housing assistance. Appendix III provides additional information on the work performed by Mathematica. In addition, we selected four states for field work\u2014California, Louisiana, Massachusetts, and Minnesota. As table 1.1 indicates, these states have differing approaches to welfare reform, a significant number of tenants who receive TANF benefits, geographical diversity, varied poverty levels, housing agencies of different sizes, and varied unemployment rates. To identify changes resulting from welfare reform in the selected states, we obtained and reviewed the states\u2019 TANF plans and related studies. To learn more about the states\u2019 implementation of welfare reform and to determine whether the states had involved housing agency officials in their welfare reform efforts, we interviewed and obtained plans, reports, and other documents from state welfare, housing and community development, and labor officials using standard sets of questions that we developed. To obtain additional perspectives, we used a standard set of questions to interview and collect information from officials representing HUD field offices, state associations, public housing and community groups, and mayoral and legislative offices. Appendix V provides maps of the states showing the selected housing agencies.", "Within each state, we visited a minimum of four housing agencies to obtain more detailed information about the anticipated effects of welfare reform. We selected housing agencies on the basis of their size, location, tenants\u2019 characteristics (including reliance on cash assistance), local economic conditions, and approaches to providing social services. As table 1.2 indicates, we generally selected a small (250 to 499 federally funded public housing units), medium (500 to 1,249 federally funded public housing units), large (1,250 to 4,999 federally funded public housing units), and extra large (5,000 or more federally funded public housing units) housing agency in each state. In California, we selected six agencies\u2014two small, two medium, one large, and one extra large\u2014because of the size of the state. We did not select a medium-sized housing agency in Minnesota because none of the agencies in the state has from 500 to 1,249 public housing units. Instead, we selected the Duluth housing agency because, with 1,261 units, it is the closest to the medium range. The housing agencies that we visited in Massachusetts and rural California generally own and manage additional units under state or U.S. Department of Agriculture programs. In addition, all but one of the selected housing agencies operated certificate and voucher programs, which ranged in size from 30 to 28,134 authorized certificates and vouchers. Before visiting the selected housing agencies, we sent them a survey to obtain information on their housing stock, revenue sources, and tenants\u2019 incomes and demographics. During our visits to the housing agencies, we used a standard set of questions for our interviews with the agencies\u2019 executive directors, finance managers, social service coordinators, occupancy specialists, and tenants and tenant associations. We also interviewed local government officials, social service officials, and housing advocacy groups about their expectations for welfare reform and the actions that housing agencies might take or have taken in response to welfare reform. In addition, we obtained reports on housing agencies\u2019 self-sufficiency efforts, analyses of housing agencies\u2019 financial positions, and copies of documents on welfare reform used by the housing agencies.

We believe that, with a few exceptions, the data were close enough to state that the data for the selected housing agencies reported in the Picture Book are reliable for these agencies. Our analysis was based on responses to our request from all 18 housing agencies in our review. For about 75 percent of the data in our review that could be verified, there were no differences between the data reported by the housing agencies and the MTCS data. For an additional 10 percent of the data, differences of 1 to 2 percent were reported. However, for several housing agencies, the number of tenant-based Section 8 certificates and vouchers reported by the housing agencies differed from the MTCS data by more than 5 percent. To determine whether this difference was meaningful, we summed the numbers for all of the housing agencies and found a difference of about 24 percent between the two sets of numbers; the housing agencies reported higher total numbers than the Picture Book. The data for one housing agency, operated by the city of Los Angeles, was responsible for a significant portion of this difference. We also identified differences in the data on tenants\u2019 incomes. For example, the differences between the housing agencies\u2019 figures for tenants\u2019 average annual incomes and the Picture Book\u2019s figures ranged from 2 percent to 30 percent; the housing agencies generally reported lower average annual incomes for tenants in public housing, while the Picture Book reported lower average annual incomes for tenants receiving certificates and vouchers.

As figure 2.1 shows, the housing agencies we visited received 31.1 percent of their operating revenue from rental income, 43.5 percent from HUD\u2019s operating subsidies, 15.8 percent from Section 8 administrative fees, and 9.5 percent from other sources. The percentage of revenue that each housing agency received from rental income ranged from about 18.6 percent at the Shreveport housing agency to about 68.7 percent at the Hibbing housing agency. Eleven of the 18 housing agencies received more funds from rental income than from HUD\u2019s operating subsidies. See appendix IV, table IV.8, for additional information about the revenue sources for the selected housing agencies.", "At the time of our review, welfare reform was evolving at both the federal and the state levels. Therefore, housing agency officials, tenants, social service providers, government officials, and interest groups said it was too early to predict welfare reform\u2019s impact on rental revenue with any certainty. At the federal level, for example, some benefits for legal immigrants were restored and additional funds were appropriated to provide welfare-to-work programs in the states. At the state level, housing agency officials and tenants continue to face great uncertainty. For example, when we visited California, the state had only recently adopted welfare reform legislation, and counties were still formulating plans for implementing the reforms in January 1998. In Massachusetts, where some TANF recipients will lose benefits in December 1998, state officials had not determined as of April 1998 what groups would be among the 20 percent of beneficiaries who would be exempted from the 5-year federal limit on the receipt of benefits.", "Officials at many of the housing agencies we visited expected welfare reform to affect their revenue, but some found it difficult to separate the effects of welfare reform from those of other economic changes. While some housing agency officials attributed recent changes in rental revenue to increases in TANF recipients\u2019 earnings under welfare reform, others ascribed the changes to different causes. In Massachusetts, officials at the Chicopee and Lawrence housing agencies believed their rental revenue was rising because more tenants were working under welfare reform, but the officials were uncertain what would happen in December 1998, when the state\u2019s 2-year time limit went into effect. They reasoned that the people who could go to work fairly easily were doing so but that when the time limit hit, the people who could not find employment at reasonable wages might see their incomes plummet and housing agencies might be faced with falling rental revenue. In Merced County, the executive director said that turnover had increased with the 1995 closing of Castle Air Force Base; however, he attributed the recent exodus of residents on welfare to their need to find work before they lost their TANF benefits. Similarly, the executive director of the New Bedford housing agency attributed its high turnover to the long-term stagnation of the economy in southeastern Massachusetts, while staff said tenants\u2019 Section 8 rental payments had recently decreased because tenants were losing income through sanctions imposed on them for failing to follow the state\u2019s TANF requirements.", "Officials at the housing agencies we visited also expressed uncertainty about the impact that welfare reform\u2019s tighter eligibility requirements for food stamps could have on housing agencies\u2019 rental revenue. Although food stamps are not considered income in tenants\u2019 rent calculations, changes in food stamp benefits may affect the rents that tenants can afford to pay. In California, where reductions in food stamp benefits were among the few provisions of welfare reform that had been implemented when we visited, the executive director at the Butte County housing agency said that several tenants had moved out after losing their food stamps. In Louisiana, where cash assistance levels are lower than in the other states we visited, housing agency officials and tenants said the loss of food stamps would have a significant impact. One housing agency official in East Baton Rouge said that in the past recipients might have sold their food stamps to meet their cash obligations. While housing agency officials and tenants in several locations said they would expect families who had lost their food stamps to have difficulty paying their rent because they would need their income to buy food, in Boston where affordable housing is scarce, tenants said that families might forgo food in order to pay their rent. Housing agency officials in Lawrence, where much of the private housing is substandard, said they thought their tenants might also pay their rent before buying food.", "Because of restrictions in food stamp eligibility, some housing agency officials said that uncollected rents or turnover might increase. Housing agencies varied in their estimates of the likelihood that they would be able to evict tenants for not paying their rent. For example, officials at a Minnesota housing agency, a California housing agency, and two Louisiana housing agencies said that they would evict people for not paying rent, while officials at two Massachusetts housing agencies said that the law probably would require them to exempt tenants who could not meet the minimum rent requirements.", "Besides being concerned about possible declines in rental revenue, housing agency officials raised questions about their ability to maintain their public housing units if operating costs rose or HUD\u2019s funding did not fully meet their needs for operating subsidies. Officials at the Kern County, Hibbing, and St. Paul housing agencies said that operating costs might also increase if turnover among residents increased as a result of welfare reform. In addition, when we asked whether HUD would be likely to fully meet the housing agencies\u2019 operating subsidy needs during the next fiscal year, most housing agency finance officials thought that it would not.", "Some housing agency executive directors and finance directors were also concerned about welfare reform\u2019s impact on revenue from the Section 8 tenant-based assistance program. If the incomes of Section 8 tenants fall, housing agencies cover short-term increases in subsidies with reserves set aside for that purpose. However, officials at the Duluth, Minneapolis, and San Bernardino housing agencies said that in the longer term, the number of households served by the program might have to be reduced."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Housing Agency Officials Lack Resources for Analyzing Welfare Reform\u2019s Impact", "paragraphs": ["Housing agency staff lack some of the basic information they would need to analyze the impact of welfare reform and said that they do not have resources to devote to collecting and using this kind of information. Although housing agency staff are required to collect information on all tenants\u2019 income sources, family composition, and minority status, they are required to collect information on education only for tenants in the FSS program. Information on education and prior work experience for all tenants would be useful because recent research has shown that education, prior work experience, age, and minority status are important determinants of the speed with which an individual may leave welfare. In addition, housing agency officials would probably need basic information about their state\u2019s welfare reform plan and local employment opportunities. According to housing policy analysts at the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, if housing agencies had the information, only the large housing agencies would have access to the research skills needed to analyze the impact of welfare reform on tenants\u2019 incomes. New Orleans, a large troubled housing agency, has recently hired a strategic planner, but the finance director at the Butte County housing agency, a small California agency, said he would like HUD to analyze the data for his agency.", "In addition to information and resources for predicting tenants\u2019 incomes, housing agencies might also need to understand how welfare reform would affect the demand for public and assisted housing. For example, officials at the housing agency in Hibbing, where private housing is inexpensive, said that if the agency\u2019s current tenants become independent of welfare and leave public housing, the housing agency could be left with vacant units or units housing nonworking poor tenants. Then, new tenants might pose greater social and economic problems for the housing agency. Similarly, at the New Bedford housing agency, managers questioned whether public housing could compete with private housing if tenants\u2019 incomes rose. If the housing agencies use HUD\u2019s new rent and admission policies to attract working families, the interaction with the local housing market would become more complex.", "Despite the difficulties, three of the housing agencies we visited had completed some quantitative estimates of the impact of welfare reform. A finance official at the Los Angeles housing agency said that agency officials had estimated the financial impact of the governor\u2019s original welfare reform plan. They projected a 3- to 6-percent loss in rental revenue, not taking into account any reductions in the agency\u2019s operating subsidy. Adding a 3-percent increase for inflation to the 3- to 6-percent decrease in rental income, the Los Angeles housing agency estimated a possible total loss of 6 to 10 percent under welfare reform. These estimates were completed before some benefits were restored for legal immigrants and additional funds were allocated to the states to provide welfare-to-work programs by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. According to the housing agency\u2019s planning director, the final welfare reform plan, adopted by the California legislature in August 1997, has a stronger safety net than the governor\u2019s original plan. Thus, he does not expect rental revenue to fall by more than 5 percent under the adopted plan. However, because the adopted plan includes many more variables than the governor\u2019s plan, the agency has decided that it is too early to undertake a new detailed estimate at this time. In addition, two Minnesota housing agencies we visited estimated the impact of a state welfare reform provision on their revenue. Under Minnesota\u2019s welfare reform plan, households that receive both TANF and housing assistance were scheduled to have their TANF benefits reduced by $100. In developing their estimates, housing agency staff assumed that the adjusted incomes of tenants receiving TANF benefits would fall by $100. Then, because tenants generally pay 30 percent of their adjusted income in rent, the staff assumed that the housing agencies\u2019 rental revenue would fall by $30 a month for each resident receiving TANF benefits. To calculate the monthly drop in rental revenue, they multiplied the number of TANF recipients by $30. Their estimates assumed that the number of tenants receiving TANF benefits and the adjusted incomes of these tenants would remain fixed over a 12-month period."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Tenants Face Challenges While Welfare Reform and New Rent Policies Offer Some Support and Incentives to Work", "paragraphs": ["At the housing agencies we visited, the residents of assisted housing were facing challenges in seeking employment and the housing agencies were struggling to use new rent and admission policies to provide support and incentives for working families. The challenges facing tenants seeking employment included a lack of job readiness skills, basic literacy skills, child care, and transportation. However, officials in welfare and employment offices in the states were developing new programs that could help to address these challenges. In addition, recent appropriations laws have given housing agencies, for a limited time, the flexibility to change some rent rules\u2014such as those that increase rent with every increase in income\u2014that can discourage work. Recent appropriations laws also allow housing agencies to give preference in admission to certain groups, such as working tenants.

Research has shown that lack of prior work experience is a major factor in increasing the length of time that people stay on welfare. Recent analysis by staff at Mathematica Policy Research, Incorporated, for GAO also suggests that single mothers on TANF with less prior work experience are less likely than single mothers with more work experience to become employed. These results also show that TANF recipients who receive housing assistance have less work experience than other TANF recipients. See appendix III for a more detailed description of Mathematica\u2019s results.", "In the states we visited, managers, tenants, service providers, and local government officials cited poor language skills as a significant barrier to moving tenants from welfare to work. In areas with large immigrant populations, such as California; St. Paul and Minneapolis, Minnesota; and New Bedford, Chicopee, and Lawrence, Massachusetts, officials cited lack of literacy in the native language and a shortage of courses in English as a second language (ESL) as difficulties. In California, where employment for those who speak only Spanish is possible in some areas, officials or residents at all six of the housing agencies we visited said that those who did not speak English well would have a difficult time finding employment. Because of economic incentives, church sponsorship, and family ties, St. Paul and Minneapolis attracted large pools of Hmong (from Southeast Asia) and Somali immigrants. Both groups lack proficiency in English in an area where English is necessary for employment. In Massachusetts, where over 25 percent of the public housing residents at the housing agencies we visited were Hispanic, managers, tenants, local government officials, and service providers at three of the four locations cited low literacy skills as a severe challenge. Also, the executive directors of the New Orleans and East Baton Rouge housing agencies, state and local officials, and HUD field officials cited low literacy rates among Louisiana welfare recipients and housing agency tenants as a serious barrier to employment.", "Lack of affordable child care was also mentioned as a barrier for tenants by housing agency officials and tenants we interviewed. While the federal welfare reform law provides additional child care funds to the states, some housing agency officials and tenants said that access to child care is sometimes a problem. Officials and/or tenants at 10 of the 18 housing agencies we visited said that child care was unavailable or unavailable during late hours or that residents needed child care. Even when child care centers are located at public housing sites, they do not necessarily serve the public housing tenants. For example, in Boston, the resident initiatives director explained that in the past, child care centers in public housing units had not been under contract to reserve a large number of spaces for residents\u2019 children. In addition, tenants did not always have the resources to pay for child care services. He said it was not surprising to find that only 30 percent of the children in the child care centers were public housing tenants. In New Bedford, we visited a child care center that was using the housing agency\u2019s space but, at the time of our visit, was not serving any of the development\u2019s children. The executive director of the New Bedford housing agency said that he contracted with the child care center to improve relations with the surrounding neighborhood.", "Some housing agency officials and tenants said transportation was a barrier to achieving independence from welfare because mass transportation sometimes does not exist from the neighborhoods where public and assisted housing tenants live to those where jobs are likely to be found. In seven locations, either city or housing agency officials and tenants said bus service did not exist, did not operate on a reasonable schedule, or did not reach areas where public and assisted housing tenants live.", "Some housing agency staff and tenants, interest groups, and federal and local officials thought that welfare reform would have different effects on the tenants of public housing and tenants receiving Section 8 tenant-based assistance. Staff at the New Bedford, Minneapolis, Lawrence, and San Bernardino housing agencies noted that those with tenant-based assistance were more likely to be independent and have more control over their lives, while officials or residents at the Boston, Chicopee, Duluth, and Hibbing housing agencies said that those in public housing could face discrimination because of their address. However, the Director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Association and housing agency officials in Hibbing, Los Angeles, and Kern County noted that Section 8 residents do not have the same access to programs and services as the residents of more concentrated public housing units. In addition, housing agencies can provide space for these activities at public housing developments.", "Nationwide, the welfare rolls have declined dramatically, and the states have additional budgetary resources to spend on low-income families. Because of the dramatic decline in caseloads, the fixed amounts of the federal grants to the states under the new law, and the maintenance-of-effort provision in TANF requiring the states to provide 75 or 80 percent of their historic level of funding, we estimate that the total assistance\u2014federal and state\u2014available in fiscal year 1997 for states\u2019 low-income programs was about $4.6 billion more than would have been available under the AFDC program. Between January 1996 and September 1997, the welfare rolls decreased by 16 percent in California and Minnesota, 20 percent in Massachusetts, and 47 percent in Louisiana. Although it was too early at the time of our review to tell to what extent the residents of public and assisted housing on TANF were receiving services, welfare and employment officials in the states we visited were implementing new and revised child care, training, and transportation efforts that could address the barriers cited by housing agency managers and tenants. According to a recent survey of state child care agencies, California is offering pilot programs to train TANF recipients to become child care and development teachers, and Minnesota has provided $700,000 for grants to increase the availability of culturally appropriate child care options. Massachusetts is redirecting its Career Centers to serve low-income residents, while Louisiana is using its Family Independence Work Program to provide transportation for TANF recipients attending training or community service activities. According to the manager of the state social service office in Caddo Parish, each parish welfare office contracts for transportation services with local providers. In Shreveport, for example, the office contracts with the local bus company to provide TANF recipients with monthly bus passes, while in a more rural area of the same county, cabs take recipients to training courses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of Policies to Attract and Keep Working Families Is Limited", "paragraphs": ["Beginning with the Continuing Resolution in 1996, the Congress gave housing agencies the flexibility to adopt \u201clocal admission preferences\u201d for a limited time.

In a 1997 survey of its members, the Public Housing Authorities Directors Association (PHADA) found that about 59 percent of housing agencies surveyed were using local preferences. Of those that were using these preferences, about 40 percent said they were giving preference in admission to households with income from wages. Some of the housing agencies we visited had adopted preferences for working families or for those in training programs with varying success. In Kern County, the housing agency staff said local preferences are helping the housing agency move toward creating mixed-income developments. However, an official at the San Bernardino housing agency said the agency is abandoning the local preference for working families after finding it difficult to administer. According to this official, families who initially qualified under the local preference and were put on the waiting list were no longer working when a unit became available.

Over 80 percent of the respondents who had implemented ceiling rents and over 70 percent who had adopted adjustments to earned income said they had done so because these tools would help them attract and retain working families. Of the housing agencies we visited, over one-third had implemented ceiling rents and one-third had implemented adjustments to earned income. About half of the housing agency managers we interviewed believed ceiling rents and/or adjustments to earned income would be very or somewhat effective in encouraging tenants to work. But even at the housing agencies where these policies had been adopted, they were relatively new, and few families were enjoying their benefits. For example, at the housing agencies with ceiling rents that we visited, the percentage of tenants paying ceiling rents ranged from less than 1 percent to 6 percent.", "Housing agency officials in Boston, Duluth, Hibbing, and St. Paul said that adopting ceiling rents and adjustments to earned income would reduce their revenue, since the policies would reduce the amount of rent tenants would pay the housing agency. Officials in Butte and St. Paul also said that the policies were administratively burdensome. For example, they said that, to administer the adjustment to earned income, they must keep two sets of financial records\u2014one showing their income and expenses with the income adjustment and a second showing their financial position as it would have been without the adjustment. Finally, the Minneapolis housing agency said that it would not actively pursue these policies until after the passage of a federal public and assisted housing reform bill.

In Louisiana, a state welfare official said she did elicit input from the public housing community at a state housing conference, but housing interests were not represented on the state\u2019s welfare reform task force. In addition, officials at state welfare offices and housing agencies said the states had not targeted funds for employment, training, and support services to housing agencies with large TANF populations; however, TANF recipients with housing assistance are eligible for the same services as other TANF recipients. At the housing agencies we visited, officials were somewhat more likely to be involved at the local level during the implementation of welfare reforms. In Massachusetts, the Deputy Director of the Department of Transitional Assistance said that welfare offices and public housing agencies have always interacted; however, the department is encouraging them to interact and communicate more often around the issue of welfare reform, and they are certain that this is happening. In California, where budgetary resources for employment services, supportive services, and training increased by nearly 60 percent in the state fiscal year that began in July 1997 and resources for child care increased by over 125 percent, state officials said counties had the flexibility to involve public housing agencies in developing their local implementation plans.

For example, the executive director of the Butte County housing agency said that when housing agency staff approached welfare officials to form a collaboration between the state\u2019s self-sufficiency programs and FSS, the officials said the 5-year FSS program sent the wrong message because California has a 2-year limit on the receipt of TANF benefits. When we visited, staff and tenants at the housing agency were just discovering that they could tailor their program to meet changing needs. The director of the Butte County Department of Social Welfare also described efforts to set up one-stop centers for TANF recipients in collaboration with the local private industry council and the local employment and training office. She said the effort was moving slowly because of a lack of available space; however, she had not brought in the housing agency as a partner.", "Similarly, in Massachusetts, where the Lawrence housing agency was awarded an $800,000 EDSS grant to move welfare recipients toward employment through an intensive employment and training program, the program\u2019s requirements were not well coordinated with those of the state plan or of other local employment and training efforts. Tenants at the Lawrence housing agency said that participants in the program, who might be mothers of school-age children, were required to participate in 30 hours of training a week, while the state welfare plan required them to work or participate in community service for 20 hours a week. Thus, participants in the program faced the possibility of having to be away from their homes for 50 hours a week. Although the Lawrence area\u2019s private industry council used the same trainer and offered similar programs, the executive director of the Lawrence housing agency said he needed his own program because the state could meet its welfare reform participation rate requirements without ever getting to his tenants.", "Some housing agencies and local welfare offices are beginning to coordinate more to ensure the success of local welfare reform efforts and housing self-sufficiency programs.

In general, the latter\u2014and their tenants\u2014have less time to adapt to welfare reform. Researchers with the Institute for Policy Studies at the Johns Hopkins University have shown that welfare recipients with housing assistance have longer spells on welfare than those without housing assistance. Thus, welfare recipients with housing assistance are more likely than other welfare recipients to reach the limits on their receipt of TANF benefits without having found employment, and their employment prospects worsen as their time limits decline. While Massachusetts and Louisiana will reach their 2-year limits by the end of 1998, Minnesota has a 5-year limit that did not start until July 1997.

For example, the executive directors of the Duluth and Hibbing housing agencies expected welfare reform to have a negative impact on their housing agencies, even though they were not facing an imminent time limit. However, according to the Hibbing housing agency, the region has been severely affected by a long-term decline in the iron ore industry. Similarly, in Massachusetts, the generally negative expectations of the New Bedford housing agency\u2019s executive director may be attributable to the long-term economic decline in southeastern Massachusetts.

Many of the agencies, particularly smaller ones, lack experience in analyzing the data and in translating the results of analyses into actions\u2014such as establishing appropriate self-sufficiency programs or rent policies, as discussed in chapter 2. Providing the agencies with data and guidance for analyzing the data could assist them in assessing the impact of welfare reform on their tenants\u2019 incomes and their own rental revenue. While such an effort might take time in the short run, it could pay off in the long run by equipping the agencies to monitor, analyze, and respond to the needs of their tenants and thus to operate more independently and effectively in the future.", "In the states that we visited, public housing agencies\u2019 historical lack of involvement in state and local decision-making has continued under welfare reform, as we learned from the agencies\u2019 executive directors, most of whom did not help to develop their state\u2019s welfare reforms. Now, as the states implement their welfare reforms, the agencies may remain on the sidelines unless HUD makes a comprehensive effort to let the state offices know that, in many locations, housing agencies could provide good places for delivering services. HUD can use its resources\u2014data, expertise, and staff at the state level\u2014and encourage housing agencies to use their physical facilities, to build links with the state offices and leverage federal and state funds for tenants. For example, HUD can rely on staff in its field offices to contact state offices and statewide service providers to market the benefits of using assisted housing developments as places to deliver services related to welfare reform. Similarly, HUD can systematically encourage housing agency officials to initiate such contacts at the local level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To assist public housing agencies in their efforts to help residents move from welfare to work, GAO recommends that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development increase communications with field offices and housing agencies to clarify HUD\u2019s role in welfare reform, explain how current programs can be used to complement welfare reform efforts, and identify sources of information about other federal welfare reform efforts; provide additional technical assistance and data on tenants\u2019 characteristics along with guidance that would help housing agencies use the data to assist in managing the units and in determining what impact welfare reform might have on the agencies; and develop a comprehensive strategy that relies on each field office to promote the benefits of using assisted housing developments as places to deliver services related to welfare reform and to help link other field office and housing agency staff with federal, state and local welfare reform efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["HUD commended us for the report\u2019s overall conclusions and said that they reflect many of the agency\u2019s own concerns. HUD was also pleased that the report recognized the Department\u2019s commitment to making welfare reform work. According to HUD, it is important that our report recognizes the need for a great deal of coordination within HUD; between HUD and the housing agencies; and among HUD, the housing agencies, and the other players in the welfare reform effort. In addition, HUD said that all three of the report\u2019s recommendations have a great deal of merit and that it plans to implement them.", "HUD did not believe that the draft report sufficiently acknowledged the initiatives undertaken by the Department to deal with welfare reform. For example, HUD said the report did not address (1) departmental legislative proposals containing a number of provisions related to welfare reform and (2) new program initiatives undertaken or planned by HUD\u2019s Office of Public and Indian Housing and Office of Policy Development and Research. In addition, HUD said the report did not sufficiently acknowledge the numerous efforts taken by the Department to coordinate with other federal agencies and that references to \u201cinformal\u201d coordination seemed inadequate. After reviewing HUD\u2019s comments, we added additional references to HUD\u2019s legislative proposals in the introductory chapter; however, EDSS and TOP, the welfare-to-work vouchers, and the expanded empowerment zones were already mentioned in this chapter. We considered the comments about HUD\u2019s new program initiatives but concluded that the report already included the primary efforts that could be documented at the time of our review. In response to HUD\u2019s comments about its coordination with other federal agencies, we expanded our description of HUD\u2019s efforts to coordinate with other federal agencies and eliminated references to \u201cinformal\u201d external coordination. We also added several additional examples of HUD\u2019s external coordination efforts.", "Finally, HUD said that it has several efforts under way or about to begin that will result in information sharing and will make use of the lessons in our report. For example, HUD said that Policy Development and Research staff are preparing guidelines for housing agencies to help them look at the data they have in hand and the data they might need to gather to do their own assessments of the impact of welfare reform on their rental revenue. In addition, Public and Indian Housing staff are finalizing a best practices guidebook on welfare-to-work programs and techniques being used in public housing agencies. HUD said that it has also begun work on a book of welfare-to-work case studies that will expand the scope of the best practices guidebook to show how a variety of HUD funding sources are already being used to help families on welfare make the transition to work."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
