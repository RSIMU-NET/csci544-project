The project, begun in 1997, was intended to dispose of large quantities of weapons-grade plutonium no longer required for national security. Prior to 2011, NNSA's project staff failed to recognize signs that the project would not be completed on time or within its approved cost. An independently conducted analysis, prepared in 2014 in response to a GAO recommendation, determined that NNSA staff did not recognize early problems because they were inexperienced in project management. To strengthen oversight, NNSA in late 2010 and 2011 began actions, such as conducting additional reviews and transferring oversight of the project to a newly established office specializing in project management. NNSA continued to identify the contractor's performance problems, such as the lack of credible, reliable cost and schedule data. These continued problems contributed to NNSA's decision to terminate the project.", "DOE requires that project staff document and share project management lessons learned on capital asset projects like the MOX project, but not all lessons are to be documented consistently or shared in a timely manner. GAO found that DOE's and NNSA's offices document project management lessons learned differently and that not all of the documented lessons learned are readily accessible to other staff. Additionally, GAO found that DOE does not require that project staff share lessons learned for capital asset projects until the start of construction, which can occur many years after the start of the project. Under key practices, such lessons should be stored in a logical, organized manner, be easily retrievable, and be submitted in a timely manner (see fig.). By developing requirements that clearly define how and where project management lessons learned should be documented and requiring that the lessons be shared in a timely manner, DOE could improve its lessons-learned process and help improve the success of future capital asset projects. Also, for capital asset projects, DOE does not require the evaluation of the results of all corrective actions to respond to lessons learned to ensure that problems are resolved, consistent with key practices. By developing requirements to evaluate the effectiveness of corrective actions, DOE could better verify whether the actions had the intended outcome."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations, including that DOE and NNSA develop requirements for defining how and where project management lessons learned for capital asset projects should be documented and shared routinely and in a timely manner, and for evaluating the effectiveness of corrective actions taken in response to lessons learned.

DOE and NNSA use  the capital asset acquisition process to undertake many of these  projects. The cost of these projects can vary greatly, with projects  estimated to cost less than $750 million designated as nonmajor, and  those estimated to cost greater than or equal to $750 million designated  as major. Some of the more complex, first-of-a-kind, major nuclear  construction projects can cost several billions of dollars.", "For many years, NNSA has encountered numerous cost, schedule, and  technical challenges that resulted in a reassessment of alternatives and,  in some cases, the cancellation of entire projects or portions thereof.  NNSA terminated one such project\u2014the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication  Facility (MOX) project\u2014after experiencing numerous cost, schedule, and  technical challenges. DOE initiated the MOX project in 1997 at its  Savannah River Site in South Carolina as a key component of NNSA\u2019s  strategy to dispose of large quantities of weapons-grade plutonium  deemed no longer required for national security. Construction began in  2007 after DOE formally approved the project\u2019s cost estimate of $4.8  billion and estimated completion date of September 2016. Since  construction began in 2007, DOE\u2019s cost estimate for the MOX project  increased significantly to about $17.2 billion, and the estimated  completion date for the project was extended to as late as 2048, a  potential delay of nearly 32 years.", "In February 2016, DOE proposed terminating the MOX project in favor of  an alternative, referred to as \u201cdilute and dispose,\u201d which was expected to  be less expensive than the MOX project. Congress continued funding  the MOX project. For example, the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2018 required DOE to proceed with MOX construction unless,  among other things, the Secretary certified that the life-cycle cost of the  dilute and dispose option would be less than half the life-cycle cost of the  MOX project. In May 2018, the Secretary of Energy submitted the  certification and reported that the life-cycle cost estimate was $19.9 billion  for the dilute and dispose option compared with $49.4 billion for the MOX  project. In October 2018, NNSA terminated the MOX project. At the time  of its termination, NNSA had spent nearly $6 billion on the MOX project.", "Significant cost increases and schedule delays are not unique to the MOX  project, as DOE and NNSA have historically struggled to complete  projects within their initial cost and schedule estimates. Since 1990, we  have designated DOE\u2019s management of major contracts and projects,  including those executed by NNSA, as an area at high risk for fraud,  waste, abuse, and mismanagement. In response, DOE and NNSA have  undertaken a number of efforts to improve their management of contracts  and projects, and in February 2013, we narrowed the focus of the high- risk designation to major projects within DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental  Management and NNSA to acknowledge progress made in managing  nonmajor projects. However, not all of the actions taken by DOE and  NNSA have resulted in improved project management. As we found in  April 2015, NNSA has had a long history of identifying corrective actions  and declaring them successfully resolved, only to identify additional  actions to address the same problems that had reemerged. The repeat  nature of some of these problems and their considerable effect on the  cost and schedule of DOE and NNSA projects has raised concerns that  lessons from past experiences on projects are not being identified and  applied to current and future projects.", "Given NNSA\u2019s shift in focus from the MOX project to the alternative dilute  and dispose approach, you requested that we review issues related to  DOE\u2019s and NNSA\u2019s oversight of the MOX project.

This  strategy, now undertaken through NNSA\u2019s Plutonium Disposition  program, originally planned to dispose of the plutonium through a dual  approach\u2014(1) conversion into mixed-oxide fuel and (2) immobilization in  glass or ceramic material\u2014but NNSA later cancelled the immobilization  approach in favor of the approach for only mixed-oxide fuel. In 1999,  DOE awarded a contract to design, construct, and operate a MOX facility  to the contractor consortium of Duke, Cogema, Stone & Webster, LLC\u2014 now called MOX Services, LLC (MOX Services).", "In February 2002, NNSA reported to Congress that the construction of the  MOX project would begin in fiscal year 2004, with operations set to begin  in fiscal year 2007, and cost nearly $1 billion to design and construct.  However, as figure 1 shows, construction of the MOX project did not  begin until 2007 after DOE formally approved the project\u2019s estimated cost  of about $4.8 billion and estimated completion date of September 2016.", "In December 2008, DOE approved a revised cost estimate for completing  construction of the MOX project of $4.9 billion and a 1-month delay in the  start of operations to October 2016. From 2009 through 2011, the  estimated cost to complete construction of the MOX project remained at  $4.9 billion. However, the MOX project\u2019s cost and schedule estimate  changed significantly in 2012. That year, at NNSA\u2019s direction to update  the estimate, the MOX contractor submitted a proposal to increase the  cost of the facility to about $7.7 billion\u2014an increase of about $2.8 billion  from the 2008 estimate\u2014with the start of operations delayed by about 3  years, to November 2019.", "After receiving the MOX contractor\u2019s revised estimate that indicated  significant cost increases and schedule delays to the project, NNSA  stated in its fiscal year 2014 budget request that pursuing the MOX  approach might be unaffordable and proposed to slow down construction  while the agency assessed alternative approaches for plutonium  disposition. After a series of reviews, DOE ultimately concluded that  pursuing an alternative disposition approach\u2014referred to as \u201cdilute and  dispose\u201d\u2014could significantly reduce the life-cycle cost of the Plutonium  Disposition program, compared with continuing the program using the  MOX approach. Following the identification of a potentially less costly  approach to plutonium disposition, in February 2016, DOE\u2019s fiscal year  2017 budget request proposed terminating the MOX project in favor of  pursuing the dilute and dispose approach. Congress appropriated  funding for the MOX project for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 and directed  DOE to continue work on the project.", "In August 2016, DOE issued a revised cost estimate of approximately  $17.2 billion to complete construction of the MOX project by 2048. In the  face of this significant cost increase, the National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 2018 authorized the Secretary of Energy to terminate  the MOX project if, among other things, he could certify that the remaining  life-cycle cost for an alternative option for carrying out plutonium  disposition would be less than approximately half of the estimated  remaining life-cycle cost of carrying out the MOX project. In May 2018,  DOE completed this certification and notified Congress of its intention to  terminate construction of the MOX project and to instead pursue the dilute  and dispose option.

The NNSA staff responsible for overseeing the  MOX project at that time were generally inexperienced in overseeing  complex nuclear construction projects. From 2007 through 2011, staff  overseeing the MOX project were primarily familiar with large  programmatic initiatives and operations but had little experience in  managing large, complex first-of-a-kind nuclear construction projects,  according to a May 2014 root cause analysis. Although information  available to the NNSA staff showed that there were cost and schedule  problems that indicated the increasing likelihood that the project would  not be completed within its approved total cost estimate of $4.9 billion, the  staff did not recognize and fully resolve four key problems.", "First, information about the contractor\u2019s use of inaccurate rates to  estimate the time needed to complete certain construction activities\u2014 commonly referred to as unit rates or planned production rates\u2014indicated  that the project would not be completed within its approved cost estimate.  These rates are used to reflect levels of productivity during construction  and to help develop projects\u2019 cost and schedule estimates, including  updates to annual forecasted estimates. Following the start of  construction in August 2007, the MOX contractor began to experience  lower-than-estimated productivity rates for key construction activities,  according to the May 2014 root cause analysis report. Despite this  issue, the contractor did not incorporate more realistic assumptions  regarding the unit and production rates, such as by updating the  estimated costs and time needed to complete specific construction  activities, when developing the contractor\u2019s annual forecasted estimates  of the project\u2019s total cost for 2008 through 2011. MOX contractor  representatives told us that the unit rates they used to develop cost and  schedule estimates were realistic based on assumptions at that time and  that DOE was involved in the development of the unit rates. In addition,  the MOX contractor\u2019s representatives told us that expected improvements  in unit rates did not materialize because of higher than expected levels of  worker turnover.", "NNSA staff overseeing the project at that time did not recognize that the  unit rates for calculating and updating unit rate estimates should be  realistic and reflect levels of productivity during construction, as called for  in project management principles, or resolve the issues. As a result, the  staff did not take action to resolve the MOX contractor\u2019s continued use of  unrealistic unit rates that did not reflect actual construction progress being  made. Furthermore, NNSA staff did not recognize the extent to which  decreased productivity by the contractor created future cost increases and schedule delays or resolve the issue. Consequently, from 2008 to  2011, the MOX contractor continued to use its overly optimistic and  unrealistic unit rate estimates when developing its annual forecasted cost  estimates.", "Second, the MOX contractor\u2019s annual forecasted estimates for the project  consistently increased from 2008 through 2011, and the level of  confidence in those estimates decreased, indicating that the project would  not be completed within its approved cost estimate. Beginning in 2008,  the MOX contractor submitted an annual update to its forecasted estimate  for the project. These estimates increased each year, rising by about  $140 million to $280 million annually, with the estimated total project cost  increasing from about $4.1 billion in 2008 to about $4.7 billion in 2011 (an  increase of about 15 percent). The MOX contractor\u2019s representatives said  they attempted to mitigate the increases, such as by identifying cost  savings on the project. Additionally, as the May 2014 root-cause analysis  report stated, the level of confidence for completing the MOX project  within the approved $4.9 billion total project cost estimate declined each  year, from an 85 percent likelihood of completing the project within the  estimate in 2009 to 45 percent in 2011. Both the annual increases in  forecasted estimates and the annual decline in level of confidence  illustrated the increasing likelihood that the MOX contractor would not  complete the project for $4.9 billion.", "As a result of inexperience, the NNSA staff overseeing the project at that  time did not adequately examine the potential consequences of such cost  performance trends over the future schedule and through project  completion or resolve the issues. As the May 2014 root-cause analysis  report stated, NNSA staff did not fully recognize how the risks and  challenges the MOX project faced negatively affected not only the  project\u2019s performance but also its cost and schedule. For example, that  report found that the staff were unable to determine that there were  fundamental problems with completing the MOX project\u2019s design and with  maintaining construction efficiency and progress; both of which  contributed to schedule delays and cost increases. The May 2014 root- cause analysis report stated that because of inexperience in project  management, NNSA staff did not direct the MOX contractor to develop a  more realistic and achievable forecasted estimate for the total cost to  complete the MOX project until January 2012.", "Third, information about procuring materials out of sequence and the  resulting rework indicated that the project would not be completed on  schedule or within its approved cost estimate. According to NNSA  officials, the MOX contractor\u2019s method for measuring earned value  incentivized the contractor to purchase and procure materials early and,  in a number of cases, out of sequence, as this helped demonstrate  progress. For example, figure 4 shows outdoor \u201claydown yards\u201d and an  offsite warehouse storing large amounts of commodities, such as pipes  and electrical panels, that NNSA officials said the MOX contractor  procured earlier than needed. The May 2014 root-cause analysis report  stated that between 2007 and 2011, the equipment and material procured  out of sequence resulted in the need for rework in some cases because  later design changes required changes to the equipment or the need to  procure different items, leading to additional costs for the project.", "The MOX contractor\u2019s representatives told us they disagreed with  NNSA\u2019s characterization that they procured material too early. According  to the contractor representatives, they purchased materials in support of  both the project schedule and planned construction end date of 2016, as  well as to achieve the efficiencies through bulk pricing or reduced delivery  charges from procuring larger quantities of items or multiple items at the  same time. Additionally, the MOX contractor representatives disagreed  that they structured the methods for measuring earned value performance  to claim earned value in ways that did not reflect actual progress. In  particular, the MOX contractor representatives said that NNSA staff were  involved in the development of the original methods used for measuring  earned value.", "NNSA staff did not take steps to resolve the issues with the  disproportionate value earned by the MOX contractor for purchasing,  procuring, and placing certain commodities until 2015 when the MOX  contractor revised its methods for measuring earned value.  Consequently, the reported commodity installation data based on the  MOX contractor\u2019s methods for measuring claimed earned value inflated  the amount of progress being made on the construction of the MOX  project compared with the amount of work completed.", "Fourth, information about the use of management reserve funds early in  the project indicated that the project would not be completed within its  approved baseline. To address cost increases experienced early in the  project, the MOX contractor began to use the project\u2019s management  reserve funds. A May 2010 surveillance review of the MOX contractor\u2019s  EVM system prepared for DOE by an independent contractor identified  this issue and concluded that the rate at which the MOX contractor was  using its management reserve indicated that it was unlikely that there  would be any reserve left to address any risks that were expected to be  encountered later in the project. DOE\u2019s June 2011 follow-up review of  the MOX contractor\u2019s EVM system found that the MOX contractor was no  longer covering cost variances by using management reserve; however,  the MOX contractor\u2019s previous use of management reserve to cover cost  overruns had resulted in inaccurate, inflated cost performance and  understated forecasted cost estimates. The MOX contractor\u2019s  representatives told us they disagreed with the premise that the  management reserve was used to obscure cost performance. Moreover,  they noted that NNSA\u2019s cost-accounting and management staff worked  with the contractor on all EVM issues, including the use of management  reserve.", "NNSA staff did not recognize and resolve issues with the contractor\u2019s use  of the management reserve to mitigate cost overruns or the effect on the  project\u2019s cost performance and forecasted cost estimates in part because,  as the May 2014 root cause analysis report stated, the staff possessed  little experience in project management. According to project  management principles, management reserve should be prevented from  being consumed too early so as to ensure that enough reserve remains  available to address any problems that may arise late in the project. The  inexperienced NNSA staff also did not recognize that certain problems  were creating cost overruns because, as stated in the May 2010  surveillance review, the MOX contractor\u2019s use of the management  reserve to cover such overruns hid the problems and did not alleviate  their root causes. As a result of not recognizing or resolving the MOX  contractor\u2019s inappropriate use of the management reserve earlier, NNSA  reported inaccurate measurements of cost performance to DOE and other  stakeholders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE\u2019s Project Management Changes Strengthened Oversight of the MOX Project", "paragraphs": ["In late 2010 and 2011, DOE began to implement actions to strengthen  project management across the department, including NNSA. These  actions, which agency officials said were primarily undertaken in  response to project management problems we and others had identified,  contributed to the steps NNSA began to take to strengthen its project  management and oversight of the MOX project. Changes that  strengthened NNSA\u2019s oversight of the MOX project included: (1) initiating  project peer reviews and (2) making several organizational changes to  improve project oversight. These changes to DOE\u2019s and NNSA\u2019s  oversight of the MOX project contributed to the decision to terminate the  project.", "First, in its November 2010 update to requirements for capital asset  projects, DOE established a requirement to conduct peer reviews at least  once a year for large or high-visibility projects with a total project cost of  $100 million or greater. The update required peer reviews more frequently  for complex projects or those experiencing performance challenges.  According to DOE and NNSA officials, they added the requirement in  response to a recommendation in our May 2008 report. According to  NNSA officials, as a result of this requirement, NNSA began conducting  peer reviews of the MOX project in 2011. These reviews led NNSA to  identify significant cost and schedule problems at the MOX project and  included a number of recommendations to improve project performance.  For example, a March 2012 NNSA peer review found that the MOX  project\u2019s total cost may have been understated by anywhere from $600  million to $900 million, in part because the contractor\u2019s estimated unit  rates and planned production rates were not reflective of the actual  performance at that time. Moreover, the peer review found that the  estimated completion date of October 2016 was also at risk. As a result,  the peer review team recommended, among other things, that the MOX  contractor develop an update to its formal cost and schedule estimate.", "As a result of the findings and recommendations from its peer reviews,  NNSA requested and the MOX contractor submitted in September 2012 a  proposal that included a revised cost estimate for the MOX project of  about $7.7 billion and an estimated completion date of November 2019.  In response to the significant cost increases, schedule delays, and project  risks captured in the MOX contractor\u2019s updated cost and schedule  estimate, NNSA proposed a slowdown of MOX project construction  activities in its fiscal year 2014 budget request to begin assessing  alternative plutonium disposition strategies.", "Second, NNSA carried out several organizational changes starting in  2011 that led to improved oversight of the MOX project in some areas and the continued identification of cost and schedule problems.  Specifically, NNSA transitioned management and oversight of the MOX  project from the Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation to the Office  of Acquisition and Project Management, an office newly created in  January 2011 to improve project oversight through the application of  project management principles. In 2013, the Office of Acquisition and  Project Management created the MOX Project Management Office at the  Savannah River Site to provide project and contract management  oversight for the MOX project.", "After establishing the MOX Project Management Office, the Office of  Acquisition and Project Management sought to better address long- standing staffing challenges. For example, a May 2006 external  independent review conducted for DOE found that, among other things,  NNSA understaffed the oversight of the MOX project and recommended  that DOE acquire sufficient personnel with the proper skills to manage  and perform oversight of the project. However, NNSA did not address  this issue until after the creation of the Office of Acquisition and Project  Management. The Office of Acquisition and Project Management  increased the number of staff with specific project management skillsets  at the MOX Project Management Office from 20 for fiscal years 2010 to  2012 to 36 (18 federal employees and 18 support service contractors) for  fiscal years 2016 to 2018.", "As a result of the staffing changes, the NNSA MOX Project Management  Office strengthened its oversight of the MOX project, which contributed to  the identification of additional problems, as described below.", "Conducted more in-depth assessments of the MOX contractor\u2019s  EVM system. After initially certifying the MOX contractor\u2019s EVM  system in May 2008, a May 2010 surveillance review of the MOX  contractor\u2019s EVM system prepared for DOE by an independent  contractor identified a number of issues. The MOX contractor  addressed the issues, according to DOE\u2019s June 2011 review, resulting  in the recertification of the EVM system at that time. According to  NNSA officials, NNSA\u2019s MOX Project Management Office conducted  more in-depth assessments of the MOX contractor\u2019s EVM system  starting in 2013. These assessments led NNSA staff to identify a  number of concerns with the contractor\u2019s EVM system, such as  earned value data errors; overstatements of the data on the  percentage of work completed in certain areas; and in one instance,  about $300 million in known cost growth that was not incorporated  into the MOX project\u2019s forecasted estimate of total project cost.", "According to NNSA officials, in March 2016, the NNSA federal project  director requested an in-depth review of the contractor\u2019s EVM system  because of the continued identification of issues with the system, and  the MOX contractor not adequately addressing them. According to its  October 2016 review, DOE\u2019s Office of Project Management identified  significant deficiencies representing systematic and material internal  control weaknesses and concluded that the MOX contractor\u2019s EVM  system could not be relied upon to provide credible and reliable cost  and schedule performance data for either the project\u2019s current status  or its forecasted cost and schedule estimates. As a result, DOE\u2019s  Office of Project Management rescinded the MOX contractor\u2019s EVM  system certification because the system was no longer in compliance  with the relevant standards.", "Implemented a more rigorous invoice review process. According  to NNSA officials, prior to 2014, NNSA did not have a rigorous  process in place to review the contractor\u2019s invoices. The officials said  that NNSA staff did not review all invoices and, for the reviews that  were completed, they did not always thoroughly examine the details  behind the invoices, such as reviewing invoices to verify that costs  were allowable under DOE regulations. The NNSA officials told us  that as part of their efforts to improve oversight of the MOX  contractor\u2019s invoice submissions, NNSA\u2019s MOX Project Management  Office staff developed a more rigorous invoice review process that  resulted in a September 2014 guide. In addition, the NNSA MOX  Project Management Office assigned an additional staff member to (1)  help conduct invoice reviews due to the volume of work needed to  review the MOX contractor\u2019s invoices and (2) ensure that payments  were made within the 14 days generally required by regulation.  According to NNSA officials, as a result of the changes implemented  by the office, NNSA identified a number of potentially unallowable  costs ranging from less than $1,000 to more than $2 million.", "Reviewed the MOX contractor\u2019s annual incurred costs. NNSA  officials said that incurred cost audits were supposed to be conducted  at least annually for the MOX project and that the Defense Contract  Audit Agency was supposed to conduct the audits. However, these  officials explained that due to a significant backlog, the Defense  Contract Audit Agency did not complete all of the required audits. In  light of the Defense Contract Audit Agency\u2019s significant backlog\u2014as  well as a requirement prohibiting the agency from conducting non- defense agency audits\u2014the NNSA MOX Project Management Office  arranged to have a third party conduct an audit of the MOX  contractor\u2019s fiscal year 2010 incurred costs. This third-party audit  identified more than $30 million in potentially unallowable costs.", "The significant cost and schedule problems that NNSA staff identified  after strengthening its oversight of the MOX project contributed to NNSA\u2019s  decision to terminate it. Project management principles state that effective  project management helps organizations to, among other things, increase  the chances of success; resolve problems and issues; and identify,  recover, or terminate failing projects. After NNSA\u2019s project peer reviews  and the MOX contractor\u2019s proposed update to the project\u2019s cost and  schedule estimate showed the significant likelihood of additional cost  growth and schedule delays, NNSA proposed slowing down construction  of the MOX facility in 2013 and ultimately terminated the project in  October 2018."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOE Has Requirements for Documenting and Sharing Lessons Learned, but They Do Not Ensure Consistent or Timely Documentation or the Evaluation of Corrective Actions", "paragraphs": ["As outlined in DOE Order 413.3B, DOE requires that project management  staff document and share project management lessons learned on capital  asset projects like MOX but does not require that all project management  lessons learned from capital asset projects be documented consistently  or shared in a timely manner.

Moreover, information in the database  should be updated regularly and provide a logical system for organizing  information that is easily retrievable and made available to any requester.  We have also found that relying on person-to-person discussions to share  lessons learned can be problematic because personal networks can  dissolve\u2014for example, through attrition or retirement\u2014and informal  information sharing does not ensure everyone is benefiting from the  lessons that are gleaned. Further, by not documenting and saving all  lessons learned (e.g., those shared through person-to-person  exchanges), there is also generally no way to ensure the validation of the  information shared. This is not consistent with the key practice from the  Center for Army Lessons Learned, which states that by documenting and  saving project management lessons learned in a logical, organized  manner such as an electronic database, lessons learned can be archived,  managed, and made available for review by other projects and applied to  them at a future date.", "Because DOE Order 413.3B does not indicate where all project  management lessons learned should be documented and saved in a  consistent manner, the department cannot ensure that future capital asset  projects will be able to take advantage of experiences from past projects.

Consequently, DOE and NNSA staff are not required to  submit lessons learned during the CD-0, CD-1, and CD-2 phases of a  project. These earlier phases, which involve upfront planning and design  for the selected project, often occur many years before the approval and  start of construction. Notably, both the MOX and Uranium Processing  Facility (UPF) projects took about 10 years to reach the start of  construction (CD-3) and experienced cost increases and schedule  delays.", "We and others have previously found that lessons learned should be  submitted in a timely manner so as to ensure that key information is  available to identify and address problems or incorporate successful  activities as early and quickly in the process as possible. For example, we  found that lessons-learned reports (i.e., reports documenting lessons- learned reviews) should be prepared promptly so that knowledgeable  personnel are available to contribute to the reports, important details are  recalled accurately, and there are no delays in the dissemination of  lessons learned.
