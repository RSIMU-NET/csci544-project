The Air Force allotted $2.8 billion (i.e., directed the use of the appropriated funds) and expended $2.4 billion of these funds for the ARA. U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) uses ARA funds to support airlift operations. Specifically, the Air Force requests ARA funds in its annual Operations and Maintenance budget request and subsequently provides these funds to TRANSCOM to assist in paying for airlift services (see figure). Amounts requested, allotted, and expended varied from year-to-year, in some cases by hundreds of millions of dollars, in part due to changes in the amount of airlift services provided by TRANSCOM.", "The Air Force has not been including specific ARA information in its budget requests since fiscal year 2010. For fiscal years 2007 through 2009, Air Force budget requests explicitly stated ARA amounts. Air Force officials stated their budget presentation was changed to reduce the overall number of budget line items. In addition, TRANSCOM has not been providing cost estimates in time to support Air Force budget preparations. Specifically, TRANSCOM has been providing this information 2 months later than the Air Force needs it to support budget deliberations. The Air Force and TRANSCOM have taken some initial steps to address this issue, but these efforts lack substantive details regarding formalizing the necessary processes to ensure timely information. Until the Air Force and TRANSCOM resolve this issue, Congress will not have sufficient and complete information to inform its decisions on appropriating funds for ARA.", "TRANSCOM has a rate-setting process, but faces challenges producing accurate workload forecasts. To provide information to its customers during the annual budget development process, TRANSCOM sets airlift rates in advance of the fiscal year of expenditure. Workload forecasts influence the rate-setting process. Inaccurate forecasts can lead to unreliable budget requests and hinder effective and efficient operational planning. GAO found that forecast inaccuracy (i.e., the variance between the forecast and the actual workload) averaged 25 percent and was becoming increasingly inaccurate since fiscal year 2007. GAO found that TRANSCOM has several workload forecasting challenges. Specifically, TRANSCOM lacks an effective process to gather workload projections from customers. It also no longer uses forecasting accuracy metrics and has not established forecast accuracy goals to monitor its performance. Furthermore, TRANSCOM does not have an action plan to improve its increasingly inaccurate workload forecasts.

The TWCF conducts businesslike activities to  generate revenue from the sale of goods or services to customers, such  as the military services or combatant commands, to cover costs  expended in support of those services. The military services\u2019 Operations  and Maintenance appropriations support their transportation needs, such  as airlift services provided by TRANSCOM. In fiscal year 2017, the TWCF  incurred costs of about $5 billion for airlift services, with the Air Force as  its largest customer.", "TRANSCOM generally sets the rates it charges for airlift services at a  level lower than the costs it incurs. It does this to be competitive with  commercial air service providers and assure that the military services and  combatant commands use government-owned and contracted aircraft  and facilities to the greatest extent possible. According to TRANSCOM  officials, the use of government owned aircraft allows TRANSCOM to be  sure that mobilization capacity is maintained, helps air crews meet  training requirements, and supports readiness. When revenue is  insufficient to support the costs of maintaining airlift capability, the Air  Force provides additional appropriated funds through the Airlift Readiness  Account (ARA). The Air Force allots (i.e., directs the use of these funds)  to the ARA from its Operations and Maintenance funding appropriated by  Congress. According to TRANSCOM and Air Force officials,  TRANSCOM records the ARA amount as a funded order (i.e., the amount  to be paid by the Air Force is agreed to before the order is recorded).  The Air Force then provides appropriated funds to pay for airlift services.  A simplified depiction of this process is shown in figure 1 below.", "House Report 115-200, which accompanied a bill for the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, included a provision for  GAO to review the Airlift Readiness Account in conjunction with the  Transportation Working Capital Fund.

Next, forecasters use information  from the military services and combatant commands that may affect  each category of workload, if available, and adjust workload estimates  as needed.", "However, according to TRANSCOM officials, personnel conducting  forecasts have limited visibility over factors that may influence  forecasts, such as demand for transportation services, due to the lack  of information obtained from their customers (i.e., the military services  and Combatant Commands). Attempts to collect information from the  military services and combatant commands have been made on an ad  hoc basis. For example, in April 2016 TRANSCOM\u2019s Commander  solicited information from the military services\u2019 senior leadership  regarding their future transportation requirements, including airlift  needs. The message emphasized the importance of forecasting to  inform budget requests and management decisions to improve  operational efficiency. However, according to TRANSCOM officials,  the Air Force\u2014who is TRANSCOM\u2019s largest customer for airlift  services\u2014was the only military service that provided the requested  information in response to the TRANSCOM\u2019s Commander\u2019s one-time  request. According to TRANSCOM officials, the other military services  have not provided the requested information for workload projections  because the services do not understand how they would benefit from  providing the information and TRANSCOM\u2019s terminology and  processes are not familiar to the services. As a result, TRANSCOM\u2019s  ad hoc approach has not obtained quality information from its  customers to use in forecasting workload.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  management should use quality information that is appropriate,  current, complete, accurate, accessible, and provided on a timely  basis to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives. Furthermore, we found other  defense organizations have provided a mechanism for customers to  routinely communicate projected workload information. For example,  the Defense Logistics Agency and their customers work together to  evaluate historical demand data for spare parts and tailor forecast  plans for those spare parts based on projected future usage. To this  end, communications with customers are expected to be consistent  and to use terminology shared in common with customers. Options  are presented in a manner that is readily understood by customers in  a format determined by customers\u2019 needs to encourage the most  efficient and effective solutions available.", "TRANSCOM no longer uses forecast accuracy metrics and has  not established forecast accuracy goals: In 2012, TRANSCOM  developed a forecasting process, and according to officials started  providing forecast performance metric briefings to TRANSCOM senior  leadership on a quarterly basis in fiscal year 2014. TRANSCOM\u2019s  overall forecast accuracy improved slightly in 2015. However,  according to TRANSCOM officials, these forecast briefings were  canceled after the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 because they were  viewed as minimally useful for budgeting, and were not used to  position airlift capacity to meet operational needs. In addition,  TRANSCOM officials stated that they no longer measure forecast  performance. We found that overall forecast inaccuracy was higher for  fiscal years 2016 and 2017 than any other year we reviewed, as  indicated above in figure 4.", "However, TRANSCOM\u2019s January 2015 forecasting instruction  requires forecast accuracy metrics to be developed to support  management decisions and forecast variance from actual workload to  be reviewed. Furthermore, the Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government state that management should define objectives  in specific and measurable terms to enable the design of internal  control for related risks, establish activities to monitor performance  measures and indicators, and assess performance against plans,  goals, and objectives set by the entity.", "TRANSCOM does not have a corrective action plan for improving  workload forecasts: TRANSCOM officials acknowledge that workload  forecasting needs improvement, and told us that TRANSCOM does not  have an action plan to improve its forecasting processes to inform  budgetary and operational decisions. In October 2013, TRANSCOM  considered, but did not adopt, a process designed to help ensure senior  management has visibility over issues, including forecasting, known as  Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP). We reported that the Army  implemented this process in 2013 after Army officials concluded that they  could leverage commercial best practices to improve logistics  performance (see sidebar). We discussed the S&OP process with  TRANSCOM officials, and they told us that the possibility of adapting the  process to military logistics was not readily accepted at TRANSCOM  because of organizational resistance to change. Initial organizational  resistance to change was also experienced by the Army, as discussed in  our prior report. However, according to the Army, the benefits of  implementing S&OP resulted in a 50 percent reduction in forecast error,  and a decision was made to deploy the S&OP process for use across all  Army depots and arsenals by the end of fiscal year 2018. Adopting a  corrective action plan, or approach such as S&OP can help TRANSCOM  focus and improve planning efforts resulting in improved and more  accurate workload forecasting.", "Furthermore, according to TRANSCOM\u2019s January 2015 forecasting  instruction, opportunities to improve forecasts should be assessed.  Additionally, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  state that management should complete and document corrective actions  to remediate internal control deficiencies on a timely basis to achieve  established objectives. Our prior work has also shown that organizations  benefit from corrective action plans for improvement.", "TRANSCOM officials told us that producing accurate workload forecasts  is challenging, and we agree that there are some inherent difficulties in  accurately forecasting airlift workload on an annual basis. However, our  prior work on aviation forecasting has noted that forecasting is inherently  uncertain, but managing the risk related to that uncertainty is essential to  making informed decisions. Improved forecasting by addressing the  weaknesses identified could allow for more effective financial planning  and enable more efficient airlift operations. For example, TRANSCOM  estimated needing an ARA amount of $772 million for fiscal year 2016.  However, according to our analysis of TRANSCOM financial records, the  TWCF did not require support from ARA funds because actual revenue  from airlift services exceeded its costs by $148 million in fiscal year 2016.", "Inaccurate forecasts can lead to unreliable budget requests and hinder  effective and efficient operational planning necessary to provide  customers with the service they need. For example, according to a 2017  Air Force Audit Agency report, flying channel passenger flights at 85  percent of capacity may result in estimated savings of about $30 million  over a 6-year period. Our past work also shows that underutilization of  cargo airlift capacity is a longstanding issue. Improving forecast  accuracy would help TRANSCOM manage airlift services more efficiently,  make better use of budgetary resources to maximize airlift capacity more  effectively, and result in an ARA budget estimate that is more accurate. In  response to our findings and discussions, TRANSCOM officials stated  they plan to begin reviewing TRANSCOM\u2019s workload forecasting process  and determine a path ahead in June 2018. However, the outcome and  timeframes for this review are uncertain. Furthermore, TRANSCOM  leadership still must approve and fully implement changes to forecasting  processes, metrics, and goals.", "Unless TRANSCOM fully implements an effective process to obtain  projected workload requirements from its customers on a routine basis,  uses forecast accuracy metrics and establishes goals, and develops an  action plan, airlift workload forecasting will not improve. We acknowledge  that eliminating volatility entirely in the ARA budget request is unlikely  given that there will be unexpected and unpredictable workload  adjustments due to changes in the global security environment or natural  disasters. We also understand improving workload forecasts through  the use of goals, metrics, and an action plan for improvement will not  eliminate the inherent volatility associated with the ARA budget request  amount. However, these improvements would allow TRANSCOM to  better manage the inherent risks associated with the accuracy of  forecasts and improve ARA estimates used to inform future Air Force  Operations and Maintenance budget requests."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Each year DOD spends billions of dollars on airlift services flying  personnel and cargo worldwide. The clarity of budget estimates and the  accuracy of forecasts for airlift services are essential for Congress and  DOD to make informed decisions.

Additionally, TRANSCOM  continues to face challenges in forecasting its workload, which is a key  factor in estimating the ARA.
