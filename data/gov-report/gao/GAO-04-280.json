No comprehensive data are available on the extent of these practices, but they appear most likely to occur among subprime mortgages--those made to borrowers with impaired credit or limited incomes. GAO was asked to examine actions taken by federal agencies and states to combat predatory lending; the roles played by the secondary market and by consumer education, mortgage counseling, and loan disclosure requirements; and the impact of predatory lending on the elderly."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While only one federal law--the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act--is specifically designed to combat predatory lending, federal agencies have taken actions, sometimes jointly, under various federal consumer protection laws. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has played the most prominent enforcement role, filing 19 complaints and reaching multimillion dollar settlements. The Departments of Justice and Housing and Urban Development have also entered into predatory lending-related settlements, using laws such as the Fair Housing Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. Federal banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, report little evidence of predatory lending by the institutions they supervise. However, the nonbank subsidiaries of financial and bank holding companies--financial institutions which account for a significant portion of subprime mortgages--are subject to less federal supervision. While FTC is the primary federal enforcer of consumer protection laws for these entities, it is a law enforcement agency that conducts targeted investigations. In contrast, the Board is well equipped to routinely monitor and examine these entities and, thus, potentially deter predatory lending activities, but has not done so because its authority in this regard is less clear. As of January 2004, 25 states, as well as several localities, had passed laws to address predatory lending, often by restricting the terms or provisions of certain high-cost loans; however, federal banking regulators have preempted some state laws for the institutions they supervise. Also, some states have strengthened their regulation and licensing of mortgage lenders and brokers. The secondary market--where mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities are bought and sold--benefits borrowers by expanding credit, but may facilitate predatory lending by allowing unscrupulous lenders to quickly sell off loans with predatory terms. In part to avoid certain risks, secondary market participants perform varying degrees of \"due diligence\" to screen out loans with predatory terms, but may be unable to identify all such loans. GAO's review of literature and interviews with consumer and federal officials suggest that consumer education, mortgage counseling, and loan disclosure requirements are useful, but may be of limited effectiveness in reducing predatory lending. A variety of factors limit their effectiveness, including the complexity of mortgage transactions, difficulties in reaching target audiences, and counselors' inability to review loan documents. While there are no comprehensive data, federal, state, and consumer advocacy officials report that the elderly have disproportionately been victims of predatory lending. According to these officials and relevant studies, older consumers may be targeted by predatory lenders because, among other things, they are more likely to have substantial home equity and may have physical or cognitive impairments that make them more vulnerable to an unscrupulous mortgage lender or broker."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report responds to your request that we evaluate issues related to  predatory home mortgage lending.

Once relatively rare, government enforcement  actions and private party lawsuits against institutions accused of abusive  home mortgage lending have increased dramatically in the last 10 years.  In  2002 alone, there were dozens of settlements resulting from accusations of  abusive lending.  In the largest of these, a major national mortgage lender  agreed to pay up to $484 million to tens of thousands of affected  consumers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Nature and Attributes of Predatory Lending", "paragraphs": ["Predatory lending is an umbrella term that is generally used to describe  cases in which a broker or originating lender takes unfair advantage of a  borrower, often through deception, fraud, or manipulation, to make a loan  that contains terms that are disadvantageous to the borrower.  While there  is no universally accepted definition, predatory lending is associated with  the following loan characteristics and lending practices:  Excessive fees.  Abusive loans may include fees that greatly exceed the  amounts justified by the costs of the services provided and the credit  and interest rate risks involved.  Lenders may add these fees to the loan  amounts rather than requiring payment up front, so the borrowers may  not know the exact amount of the fees they are paying.", "Excessive interest rates.  Mortgage interest rates can legitimately vary  based on the characteristics of borrowers (such as creditworthiness)  and of the loans themselves.  However, in some cases, lenders may  charge interest rates that far exceed what would be justified by any risk- based pricing calculation, or lenders may \u201csteer\u201d a borrower with an  excellent credit record to a higher-rate loan intended for borrowers with  poor credit histories.", "Single-premium credit insurance.  Credit insurance is a loan product  that repays the lender should the borrower die or become disabled.  In  the case of single- premium credit insurance, the full premium is paid all  at once\u2014by being added to the amount financed in the loan\u2014rather  than on a monthly basis.  Because adding the full premium to the  amount of the loan unnecessarily raises the amount of interest  borrowers pay, single-premium credit insurance is generally considered  inherently abusive.", "Lending without regard to ability to repay.  Loans may be made  without regard to a borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan.  In these cases,  the loan is approved based on the value of the asset (the home) that is  used as collateral.  In particularly egregious cases, monthly loan  payments have equaled or exceeded the borrower\u2019s total monthly  income.  Such lending can quickly lead to foreclosure of the property.", "Loan flipping.  Mortgage originators may refinance borrowers\u2019 loans  repeatedly in a short period of time without any economic gain for the  borrower.  With each successive refinancing, these originators charge  high fees that \u201cstrip\u201d borrowers\u2019 equity in their homes.", "Fraud and deception.  Predatory lenders may perpetrate outright fraud  through actions such as inflating property appraisals and doctoring loan  applications and settlement documents.  Lenders may also deceive  borrowers by using \u201cbait and switch\u201d tactics that mislead borrowers  about the terms of their loan.  Unscrupulous lenders may fail to disclose  items as required by law or in other ways may take advantage of  borrowers\u2019 lack of financial sophistication.", "Prepayment penalties.  Penalties for prepaying a loan are not  necessarily abusive, but predatory lenders may use them to trap  borrowers in high-cost loans.", "Balloon payments.  Loans with balloon payments are structured so that  monthly payments are lower but one large payment (the balloon  payment) is due when the loan matures.  Predatory loans may contain a  balloon payment that the borrower is unlikely to be able to afford,  resulting in foreclosure or refinancing with additional high costs and  fees.  Sometimes, lenders market a low monthly payment without  adequate disclosure of the balloon payment.", "Predatory lending is difficult to define partly because certain loan  attributes may or may not be abusive, depending on the overall context of  the loan and the borrower.  For example, although prepayment penalties  can be abusive in the context of some loans, in the context of other loans  they can benefit borrowers by reducing the overall cost of loans by  reducing the lender\u2019s prepayment risk.", "According to federal and industry officials, most predatory mortgage  lending involves home equity loans or loan refinancings rather than loans  for home purchases.  Homeowners may be lured into entering refinance  loans through aggressive solicitations by mortgage brokers or lenders that  promise \u201csavings\u201d from debt consolidation or the ability to \u201ccash out\u201d a  portion of a borrower\u2019s home equity.  Predatory lending schemes may also  involve home improvement contractors that work in conjunction with a  lender.  The contractor may offer to arrange financing for necessary repairs  or improvements, and then perform shoddy work or fail to complete the  job, while leaving the borrower holding a high-cost loan.  Abuses in loan  servicing have also increasingly become a concern.  Abusive mortgage  lenders or servicing agents may charge improper late fees, require  unjustified homeowner\u2019s insurance, or not properly credit payments.  In  November 2003, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department  of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) reached a settlement with a  large national mortgage servicer, Fairbanks Capital, after the company was  accused of unfair, deceptive, and illegal practices in the servicing of  mortgage loans.  The settlement will provide $40 million to reimburse  consumers.", "Originating lenders or brokers that engage in abusive practices can make  high profits through the excessive points and fees that they charge,  particularly when borrowers make their payments regularly.  Even when a  loan enters foreclosure, the originator of  a predatory loan may still make a  profit due to the high up-front fees it has already collected.  Moreover, a  lender that sells a loan in the secondary market shortly after origination no  longer necessarily faces financial risk from foreclosure.  Similarly, a  mortgage broker that collects fees up front is not affected by foreclosure of  the loan.", "According to HUD and community groups, predatory lending not only  harms individual borrowers but also can weaken communities and  neighborhoods by causing widespread foreclosures, which reduce property  values.  Predatory lending also serves to harm the reputation of honest and  legitimate lenders, casting them in the same suspicious light as those  making unfair loans and thus increasing their reluctance to extend credit to  the traditionally underserved communities that are often targeted by  abusive lenders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Emergence of Subprime Mortgage Market", "paragraphs": ["The market for mortgage loans has evolved considerably over the past 20  years.  Among the changes has been the emergence of a market for  subprime mortgage loans.  Most mortgage lending takes place in what is  known as the prime market, which encompasses traditional lenders and  borrowers with credit histories that put them at low risk of default.  In  contrast, the subprime market serves borrowers who have poor or no  credit histories or limited incomes, and thus cannot meet the credit  standards for obtaining loans in the prime market.  It is widely accepted  that the overwhelming majority of predatory lending occurs in the  subprime market, which has grown dramatically in recent years.  Subprime  mortgage originations grew from $34 billion in 1994 to more than $213  billion in 2002 and in 2002 represented 8.6 percent of all mortgage  originations, according to data reported by the trade publication Inside  B&C Lending.  Several factors account for the growth of the subprime  market, including changes in tax law that increased the tax advantages of  home equity loans, rapidly increasing home prices that have provided many  consumers with substantial home equity, entry into the subprime market by  companies that had previously made only prime loans, and the expansion  of credit scoring and automated underwriting, which has made it easier for  lenders to price the risks associated with making loans to credit-impaired  borrowers.", "Originating lenders charge higher interest rates and fees for subprime loans  than they do for prime loans to compensate for increased risks and for  higher servicing and origination costs.  In many cases, increased risks and  costs justify the additional cost of the loan to the borrower, but in some  cases they may not.  Because subprime loans involve a greater variety and  complexity of risks, they are not the uniformly priced commodities that  prime loans generally are.  This lack of uniformity makes comparing the  costs of subprime loans difficult, which can increase borrowers\u2019  vulnerability to abuse.", "However, subprime lending is not inherently abusive, and certainly all  subprime loans are not predatory.  Although some advocacy groups claim  that subprime lending involves abusive practices in a majority of cases,  most analysts believe that only a relatively small portion of subprime loans  contain features that may be considered abusive.  In addition, according to  officials at HUD and the Department of the Treasury, the emergence of a  subprime mortgage market has enabled a whole class of credit-impaired  borrowers to buy homes or access the equity in their homes.  At the same  time, however, federal officials and consumer advocates have expressed  concerns that the overall growth in subprime lending and home equity  lending in general has been accompanied by a corresponding increase in  predatory lending.  For example, lenders and brokers may use aggressive  sales and marketing tactics to convince consumers who need cash to enter  into a home equity loan with highly disadvantageous terms.", "Originators of subprime loans are most often mortgage and consumer  finance companies, but can also be banks, thrifts, and other institutions.   Some originators focus primarily on making subprime loans, while others  offer a variety of prime and subprime loans.  According to HUD, 178  lenders concentrated primarily on subprime mortgage lending in 2001.   Fifty-nine percent of these lenders were independent mortgage companies  (mortgage bankers and finance companies), 20 percent were nonbank  subsidiaries of financial or bank holding companies, and the remainder  were other types of financial institutions.  Only 10 percent were federally  regulated banks and thrifts.", "About half of all mortgage loans are made through mortgage brokers that  serve as intermediaries between the borrower and the originating lender.   According to government and industry officials, while the great majority of  mortgage brokers are honest, some play a significant role in perpetrating  predatory lending.  A broker can be paid for his services from up-front fees  directly charged to the borrower and/or through fees paid indirectly by the  borrower through the lender in what is referred to as a \u201cyield spread  premium.\u201d  Some consumer advocates argue that compensating brokers  this way gives brokers an incentive to push loans with higher interest rates  and fees.  Brokers respond that yield spread premiums in fact allow them  to reduce the direct up-front fees they charge consumers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Extent of Predatory Lending Is Unknown", "paragraphs": ["Currently no comprehensive and reliable data are available on the extent of  predatory lending nationwide, for several reasons.  First, the lack of a  standard definition of what constitutes predatory lending makes it  inherently difficult to measure.  Second, any comprehensive data collection  on predatory lending would require access to a representative sample of  loans and to information that can only be extracted manually from the  physical loan files.  Given that such records are not only widely dispersed  but also generally proprietary, to date comprehensive data have not been  collected.  Nevertheless, policymakers, advocates, and some lending  industry representatives have expressed concerns in recent years that  predatory lending is a significant problem.  Although the extent of  predatory lending cannot be easily quantified, several indicators suggest  that it may be prevalent.  Primary among these indicators are legal  settlements, foreclosure patterns, and anecdotal evidence.", "In the past 5 years, there have been a number of major settlements  resulting from government enforcement actions and private party lawsuits  accusing lenders of abusive lending practices affecting large numbers of  borrowers.  Among the largest of these settlements have been the  following:  In October 2002, the lender Household International agreed to pay up to  $484 million to homeowners across the nation to settle allegations by  states that it used unfair and deceptive lending practices to make  mortgage loans with excessive interest and charges.", "In September 2002, Citigroup agreed to pay up to $240 million to resolve  charges by FTC and private parties that Associates First Capital  Corporation and Associates Corporation of North America (The  Associates) engaged in systematic and widespread deceptive and  abusive lending practices.  According to FTC staff, under the settlement  close to 1 million borrowers will receive compensation for loans that  misrepresented insurance products and that contained other abusive  terms.", "In response to allegations of deceptive marketing and abusive lending,  First Alliance Mortgage Company entered into a settlement in March  2002 with FTC, six states, and private parties to compensate nearly  18,000 borrowers more than $60 million dollars.", "Further, between January 1998 and September 1999, the foreclosure rate  for subprime loans was more than 10 times the foreclosure rate for prime  loans. While it would be expected that loans made to less creditworthy  borrowers would result in some increased rate of foreclosure, the  magnitude of this difference has led many analysts to suggest that it is at  least partly the result of abusive lending, particularly of loans made without  regard to the borrower\u2019s ability to repay.  Moreover, the rate of foreclosures  of subprime mortgage loans has increased substantially since 1990, far  exceeding the rate of increase for subprime originations.  A study  conducted for HUD noted that while the increased rate in subprime  foreclosures could be the result of abusive lending, it could also be the  result of other factors, such as an increase in subprime loans that are made  to the least creditworthy borrowers.", "In the early 1990s, anecdotal evidence began to emerge suggesting that  predatory lending was on the rise.  Legal services agencies throughout the  country reported an increase in clients who were facing foreclosure as a  result of mortgage loans that included abusive terms and conditions.  These  agencies noted that for the first time they were seeing large numbers of  consumers, particularly elderly and minority borrowers, who were facing  the loss of homes they had lived in for many years because of a high-cost  refinancing.  Similar observations were also reported extensively at forums  on predatory lending sponsored by HUD and the Department of the  Treasury in five cities during 2000, at hearings held in four cities during  2000 by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board),  and at congressional hearings on the issue in 1998, 2001, 2002, and 2003.", "Federal officials and consumer advocates maintain that predatory lenders  often target certain populations, including the elderly and some low- income and minority communities.  Some advocates say that in many  cases, predatory lenders target communities that are underserved by  legitimate institutions, such as banks and thrifts, leaving borrowers with  limited credit options.  According to government officials and legal aid  organizations, predatory lending appears to be more prevalent in urban  areas than in rural areas, possibly because of the concentration of certain  target groups in urban areas and because the aggressive marketing tactics  of many predatory lenders may be more efficient in denser  neighborhoods."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Emergence of Predatory Lending As Policy Issue", "paragraphs": ["The federal government began addressing predatory home mortgage  lending as a significant policy issue in the early 1990s. In 1994, the Congress  passed the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA), an  amendment to the Truth in Lending Act that set certain restrictions on  \u201chigh-cost\u201d loans in order to protect consumers. In 1998, as part of an  overall review of the statutory requirements for mortgage loans, HUD and  the Board released a report recommending that additional actions be taken  to protect consumers from abusive lending practices.  HUD and the  Department of the Treasury formed a task force in 2000 that produced the  report Curbing Predatory Home Mortgage Lending, which made several  dozen recommendations for addressing predatory lending.14, As discussed in chapters 2 and 3, a variety of federal, state, and local laws  have been used to take civil and criminal enforcement actions against  institutions and individuals accused of abusive lending practices.  Various  federal agencies have responsibilities for enforcing laws related to  predatory lending.  In addition, some state or local enforcement  authorities\u2014including attorneys general, banking regulators, and district  attorneys\u2014have used state and local laws related to consumer protection  and banking to address predatory lending practices.

Federal agencies  have applied provisions of these laws to seek redress for consumers who  have been victims of predatory lending.  Among the most frequently used  laws are TILA, HOEPA, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act  (RESPA), and the FTC Act.  Congress has also given certain federal  agencies responsibility for writing regulations that implement these laws.   For example, the Board writes Regulation Z, which implements TILA and  HOEPA, and HUD writes Regulation X, which implements RESPA.  Also, in  some cases, DOJ has brought actions under criminal fraud statutes based  on conduct that can constitute predatory lending.", "TILA, which became law in 1968, was designed to provide consumers with  accurate information about the cost of credit. Among other things, the act  requires lenders to disclose information about the terms of loans\u2014 including the amount being financed, the total finance charge, and  information on the annual percentage rate\u2014that can help borrowers  understand the overall costs of their loans.  TILA also provides borrowers  with the right to cancel certain loans secured by a principal residence  within 3 days of closing or 3 days of the time at which the final disclosure is  made, whichever is later.", "In 1994, Congress enacted the HOEPA amendments to TILA in response to  concerns about predatory lending.  HOEPA covers certain types of loans  made to refinance existing mortgages, as well as home equity loans, that  satisfy specific criteria.  HOEPA covers only a limited portion of all  subprime loans, although there is no comprehensive data on precisely what  that portion is.  The law is designed to limit predatory practices for these  so-called \u201chigh-cost\u201d HOEPA loans in several ways.  First, it places  restrictions on loans that exceed certain rate or fee thresholds, which the  Board can adjust within certain limits prescribed in the law.  For these  loans, the law restricts prepayment penalties, prohibits balloon payments  for loans with terms of less than 5 years, prohibits negative amortization,  and contains certain other restrictions on loan terms or payments.   Second, HOEPA prohibits lenders from routinely making loans without  regard to the borrower\u2019s ability to repay.  Third, the law requires lenders to  include disclosures in addition to those required by TILA for consumer  credit transactions to help borrowers understand the terms of the high-cost  loan and the implications of failing to make required payments.  Each  federal banking regulator is charged with enforcing TILA and HOEPA with  respect to the depository institutions it regulates, and FTC is primarily  responsible for enforcing the statutes for most other financial institutions,  including independent mortgage lenders and nonbank subsidiaries of  holding companies.  In enforcing TILA and HOEPA, FTC has required  violators to compensate borrowers for statutory violations.  Under certain  circumstances, HOEPA provides for damages in addition to the actual  damages a person sustains as a result of a creditor\u2019s violation of the act.", "RESPA, passed in 1974, seeks to protect consumers from unnecessarily  high charges in the settlement of residential mortgages by requiring lenders  to disclose details of the costs of settling a loan and by prohibiting certain  other costs.  Among its provisions is a prohibition against kickbacks\u2014 payments made in exchange for referring a settlement service, such as  lender payments to real estate agents for the referral of business.  RESPA  also prohibits unearned fees such as adding an additional charge to a third  party fee when no or nominal services are performed.  These practices can  unjustly increase the costs of loans and the settlement process.  HUD  enforces RESPA, working closely with federal banking regulators and other  federal agencies such as the FTC and the Department of Justice. HUD often  brings joint enforcement actions with these agencies, using RESPA and the  statutes enforced by the other federal agencies. In addition, the banking  regulators may prohibit violations of RESPA in their own regulations.", "The FTC Act, enacted in 1914 and amended on numerous occasions,  provides the FTC with the authority to prohibit and take action against  unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. FTC has  used the act to address predatory lending abuses when borrowers have  been misled or deceived about their loan terms.", "Various criminal fraud statutes prohibit certain types of fraud sometimes  used in abusive lending schemes, including forgery and false statements.   DOJ and HUD have used these statutes to fight fraudulent schemes that  have resulted in borrowers purchasing homes worth substantially less than  their mortgage amounts or borrowers being unfairly stripped of the equity  in their homes.  HUD officials have described some of these fraudulent  activities as constituting predatory lending.", "The following other federal laws have been used to a lesser extent to  address abusive lending:  The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, and  other factors in housing-related transactions, and the Equal Credit  Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits discrimination against borrowers in  the extension of credit.

Many federally  and state-chartered banks and thrifts, as well as their subsidiaries, are part  of larger financial holding companies or bank holding companies.  These  holding companies may also include nonbank financial companies, such as  finance and mortgage companies, that are subsidiaries of the holding  companies themselves.  These holding company subsidiaries are frequently  referred to as affiliates of the banks and thrifts because of their common  ownership by the holding company.  As shown in figure 2, the federal  regulators of federally and state-chartered banks and thrifts also regulate  the subsidiaries of those institutions.  For example, as the primary  regulator for national banks, OCC also examines operating subsidiaries of  those banks.  On the other hand, federal regulators generally do not  perform routine examinations of independent mortgage lenders and  affiliated nonbank subsidiaries of financial and bank holding companies  engaged in mortgage lending.", "Some disagreement exists between states and some federal banking  regulators over states\u2019 authority to regulate and supervise the operating  subsidiaries of federally chartered depository institutions.  For example,  OCC issued an advisory letter in 2002 noting that federal law provides the  agency with exclusive authority to supervise and examine operating  subsidiaries of national banks and that the states have no authority to  regulate or supervise these subsidiaries.  Some representatives of state  banking regulators expressed concerns to us about this because of the  subsidiaries\u2019 potential involvement in predatory lending practices.  OCC  has stated that the subsidiaries of the institutions it regulates do not play a  large role in subprime lending and that little evidence exists to show that  these subsidiaries are involved in predatory lending.  But some state  enforcement authorities and consumer advocates argue otherwise, citing  some allegations of abuses at national bank subsidiaries.  However, several  state attorneys general have written that predatory lending abuses are  \u201clargely confined\u201d to the subprime lending market and to non-depository  institutions, not banks or direct bank subsidiaries.  OCC officials stated  that the agency has strong monitoring and enforcement systems in place  and can and will respond vigorously to any abuses among institutions it  supervises.  For example, OCC officials pointed to an enforcement action  taken in November 2003 that required restitution of more than $100,000 to  be paid to 30 or more borrowers for fees and interest charged in a series of  abusive loans involving small \u201ctax-lien loans.\u201d", "A second issue relates to the monitoring and supervision of certain  nonbank subsidiaries of holding companies.  As noted previously, many  federally and state-chartered banks and thrifts, as well as their subsidiaries,  are part of larger financial or bank holding companies.  These holding  companies may also include nonbank subsidiaries, such as finance and  mortgage companies, that are affiliates but not subsidiaries of the federally  regulated bank or thrift.  Although these affiliates engage in financial  activities that may be subject to federal consumer protection and fair  lending laws, unlike depository institutions they are not subject to routine  supervisory examinations for compliance with those laws.  While the Board  has jurisdiction over these entities for purposes of the Bank Holding  Company Act, it lacks authority to ensure and enforce their compliance  with federal consumer protection and fair lending laws in the same way  that the federal regulators monitor their depository institutions.", "One reason for the concern about these entities is that nonbank  subsidiaries of holding companies conduct a significant amount of  subprime mortgage lending.  Of the total subprime loan originations made  by the top 25 subprime lenders in the first 6 months of 2003, 24 percent  were originated by nonbank subsidiaries of holding companies.  In  addition, of the 178 lenders on HUD\u2019s 2001 subprime lender list, 20 percent  were nonbank subsidiaries of holding companies.  These types of  subsidiaries have also been targets of some of the most notable federal and  state enforcement actions involving abusive lending.  For example, The  Associates and Fleet Finance, which were both nonbank subsidiaries of  bank holding companies, were defendants in two of the three largest cases  involving subprime lending that FTC has brought.", "The Associates case illustrates an important aspect of the current federal  regulatory oversight structure pertinent to predatory lending.  The Board  has authority under the Bank Holding Company Act to condition its  approval of holding company acquisitions.  The Board used this authority  in connection with Citigroup\u2019s acquisition of European American Bank  because of concerns about the subprime lending activities of The  Associates, which Citigroup had acquired and merged into its CitiFinancial  subsidiary.  As a condition of approving the acquisition of European  American Bank, the Board directed that an examination of certain  subprime lending subsidiaries of Citigroup be carried out to determine  whether Citigroup was effectively implementing policies and procedures  designed to ensure compliance with fair lending laws and prevent abusive  lending practices.  However, the Board does not have clear authority to  conduct the same type of monitoring outside of the Bank Holding Company  Act approval process.  Although the Board has the authority to monitor and  perform routine inspections or examinations of a bank holding company,  this authority apparently does not extend to routine examinations of  nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies with regard to  compliance with consumer protection laws.  The Bank Holding Company  Act, as amended by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, authorizes the Board to  examine a nonbank subsidiary for specific purposes, including \u201cto monitor  compliance with the provisions of (the Bank Holding Company Act) or any  other Federal law that the Board has specific jurisdiction to enforce against  such company or subsidiary.\u201d Federal consumer protection laws do not  give the Board specific enforcement jurisdiction over nonbank  subsidiaries.", "For this reason, FTC is the primary federal agency monitoring nonbank  subsidiaries\u2019 compliance with consumer protection laws.  FTC is the  primary federal enforcer of consumer protection laws for these nonbank  subsidiaries, but it is a law enforcement rather than supervisory agency.   Thus, FTC\u2019s mission and resource allocations are focused on conducting  investigations in response to consumer complaints and other information  rather than on routine monitoring and examination responsibilities.   Moreover, as discussed elsewhere in this report, states vary widely in the  extent to which they regulate practices that can constitute predatory  lending.", "The HUD-Treasury report on predatory lending argued that the Board  should take more responsibility for monitoring nonbank subsidiaries of  bank holding companies, in part to ensure that consumer protection laws  are adequately enforced for these institutions.  Similarly, in 1999, GAO  recommended that the Board monitor the lending activities of nonbank  mortgage lending subsidiaries of bank holding companies and consider  examining these entities if patterns in lending performance, growth, or  operating relationships with other holding company entities indicated the  need to do so. In its written response to GAO\u2019s recommendation, the  Board said that while it has the general legal authority to examine these  entities, it has neither the clear enforcement jurisdiction nor the legal  responsibility for engaging in such activities, as Congress has directly  charged FTC with primary responsibility over enforcement with regard to  these entities.", "Among federal agencies, the Board is uniquely situated to monitor the  activities of the nonbank mortgage lending subsidiaries of financial and  bank holding companies by virtue of its role as the regulator of holding  companies and its corresponding access to data (such as internal operating  procedures, loan level data, and current involvement in subprime lending)  that are not readily available to the public.  In addition, the Board has  extensive experience monitoring and analyzing HMDA data.  The recent  changes in HMDA reporting requirements will increase the Board\u2019s ability  to effectively monitor nonbank mortgage lending subsidiaries of holding  companies for lending abuses.", "In contrast to the specific limits on the Board\u2019s examination authority, its  authority to enforce the federal consumer protection laws against nonbank  subsidiaries is somewhat less clear.

The Board is in a position to help  ensure compliance with federal consumer protection laws by certain  subsidiaries of financial and bank holding companies if it were clearly  authorized to do so.  While concerns about predatory lending extend well  beyond the activities of the nonbank subsidiaries of holding companies,  these entities represent a significant portion of the subprime mortgage  market.  Monitoring the mortgage lending activities of the nonbank  subsidiaries would help the Board determine when it would be beneficial to  conduct examinations of specific nonbank subsidiaries.  The Board could  then refer its findings to DOJ, HUD, or FTC or take its own enforcement  action if a problem exists.  Granting the Board concurrent enforcement  authority\u2014with the FTC\u2014for these nonbank subsidiaries of holding  companies would not diminish FTC\u2019s authority under federal laws used to  combat predatory lending.", "The significant amount of subprime lending among holding company  subsidiaries, combined with recent large settlements in cases involving  allegations against such subsidiaries, suggests a need for additional  scrutiny and monitoring of these entities.

The  Board also noted that the approach would pose tradeoffs, such as different  supervisory schemes being applied to nonbank mortgage lenders based on  whether or not they are part of a holding company.  Because nonbank  mortgage lenders that are part of a financial or bank holding company are  already subject to being examined by the Board in some circumstances,  they are already subject to a different supervisory scheme than other such  lenders.  For example, in its comments the Board noted that it may on  occasion direct an examination of a nonbank lending subsidiary of a  holding company when necessary in the context of applications that raise  serious fair lending or compliance issues.  Accordingly, we do not believe  that clarifying jurisdiction as contemplated in the Matter would result in a  significant departure from the current supervisory scheme for nonbank  mortgage lenders.  The Board also noted that that there could be some  additional cost to the nonbank mortgage lending subsidiaries of financial or  bank holding companies, as well as to the Board, if the Board were to  exercise additional authority.  We agree and believe that Congress should  consider both the potential costs as well as the benefits of clarifying the  Board\u2019s authorities.", "The FTC expressed concern that our report could give the impression that  we are suggesting that Congress consider giving the Board sole  jurisdiction\u2014rather than concurrent jurisdiction with FTC\u2014over nonbank  subsidiaries of holding companies.

To illustrate the difference in regulatory and enforcement  approaches, our draft report contrasted the Board\u2019s routine examination  authority with the FTC\u2019s role as a law enforcement agency.  In its  comments, FTC noted that it uses a number of tools to monitor nonbank  mortgage lenders, of which consumer complaints is only one.  The agency  also commented that a key difference between the FTC and the Board is  that the Board has access to routine information to aid in its oversight as  part of the supervisory process.

Other  state laws, such as those of Georgia, New Jersey and North Carolina, use  triggers that are lower than those in HOEPA and therefore cover more  loans than the federal legislation.  Some states design their triggers to vary  depending on the amount of the loan.  For example, in New Mexico and  North Carolina, covered loans greater than $20,000 are considered high  cost if the points and fees on the loan exceed 5 percent of the total loan  amount (North Carolina) or equal or exceed it (New Mexico).  In these  states, loans for less than $20,000 are considered high cost if the points and  fees exceed either 8 percent of the total or $1,000.  In the remaining 5  states, the predatory lending laws apply to most mortgage loans; there is no  designation of loans as high cost.  For example, West Virginia\u2019s law in effect  generally prohibits lenders from charging prepayment penalties on any  loans and restricts points and fees to either 5 or 6 percent, depending on  whether the loan includes a yield spread premium.

As  secondary market participants\u2014such as the Wall Street investment firms  that have been the major underwriters for subprime securities\u2014have  grown more willing to purchase these instruments, subprime originators  have gained access to an important source of liquidity that has allowed  them to make more subprime loans.", "As shown in figure 4, the process of securitization starts with borrowers  obtaining mortgages either directly from a lender or through a broker. The  lender then creates a pool\u2014a separate legal entity that purchases the  mortgages and issues securities based on them.  The lender hires a credit  rating agency, which has no direct financial interest in the deal, to confirm  the value of the securities based on the expected return and risks of the  underlying mortgages.  At the same time, the lender hires an underwriter to  sell the securities to investors.  The value of the securities is based  exclusively on the mortgages themselves and is separate from the financial  condition of the original lender.  Finally, a servicer is hired to collect  mortgage payments from the borrowers and disburse interest and principal  payments to the investors.  The process described above is for  securitizations performed via private conduits\u2014that is, without the  participation of government-sponsored enterprises.", "Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are relatively recent entrants into the  subprime market; Freddie Mac began purchasing subprime loans in 1997  and Fannie Mae in 1999.  Both companies have moved slowly and have  limited their purchases to the segment of the subprime market with the  most creditworthy of subprime loans.  At present, the companies are  believed to represent a relatively small portion of the overall secondary  market for subprime loans.  The exact portion they represent is not clear,  but a study conducted for HUD estimated that the companies purchased  about 14 percent of the subprime loans originated in 2002.  Both Fannie  Mae and Freddie Mac have stated publicly that they plan on expanding  their role in the subprime market in the future.  In part, this may be a result  of the affordable housing goals that HUD set for the GSEs in October 2000,  which increased the goals for loans made to low- and moderate-income  borrowers.  HUD recommended that the GSEs consider enhancing their  roles in the subprime market\u2014which often serves low- and moderate- income borrowers\u2014to help standardize mortgage terms in that market and  potentially reduce interest rates for subprime borrowers.  While the GSEs  are currently believed to represent a small portion of the secondary market  for subprime lending, some market observers believe their share will grow.", "The growth of the secondary market for subprime loans has potentially  benefited some consumers.  By providing subprime lenders with a new  source of liquidity, these lenders face lower funding costs and reduced  interest rate risk, in part because the supply of lenders willing to make  loans to borrowers with impaired credit has increased.  Many analysts say  that, as a result, mortgage loans are now available to a whole new  population of consumers and interest rates on subprime loans made by  reputable lenders have fallen.  In addition, increased securitization of  subprime lending may lead to more uniform underwriting of subprime  loans, which could further reduce origination costs and interest rates to  consumers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Secondary Market for Subprime Loans Can Facilitate Predatory Lending", "paragraphs": ["While the development of a secondary market for subprime loans may have  benefits for borrowers, it can also provide a source of funds for  unscrupulous originators that quickly sell off loans with predatory terms.   The secondary market can complicate efforts to eliminate predatory  lending by separating ownership of a loan from its originator.  This  separation can undermine incentives to reduce risk in lending and create  incentives that may increase the attractiveness of making loans with  predatory terms.  As noted earlier, some originators of subprime mortgage  loans make their profits from high origination fees.  The existence of a  market that allows originating lenders to quickly resell subprime loans may  reduce the incentive these lenders have to ensure that borrowers can repay.   Further, lenders often market their products through brokers that do not  bear the risks associated with default, as brokers are compensated in up- front fees for the loans they help originate.  Some lenders and state officials  told us that unscrupulous brokers sometimes deceive originating lenders  regarding borrowers\u2019 ability to repay.  Even if deceived, lenders who  originate the loans and then sell them in the secondary market ultimately  may not bear the risk of a loan default.  Taken together, these  circumstances can undermine efforts to combat predatory lending  practices.", "Market forces provide some incentives to deter secondary market  purchasers from purchasing predatory loans because these loans create  both credit and reputation risk.  However, predatory loans do not in all  cases create unusual financial risks or losses for secondary market  purchasers.  For example, in most states loan purchasers are generally not  liable for damages that may have resulted from the origination of abusive  loans that they purchased, mitigating much of the legal risk of buying loans  that may have violated laws addressing predatory lending.  Moreover, loans  with predatory features may carry very high interest rates and have barriers  to prepayment, which may more than compensate for the increased credit  risks associated with subprime loans.", "However, investors\u2019 insistence on the use of credit enhancements in the  securitization process may offset or mitigate the incentives to engage in  predatory lending of originators who sell loans to the secondary market.", "Credit enhancements, which refer to a variety of approaches used to  reduce the credit risk of an obligation, are common in securitization  transactions, in part because of concerns that originators may try to pass  on lower-quality loans.  Because the price investors will pay for securities is  based on risk as well as return, sellers use the enhancements to lower the  risk and thus raise the price of securities.  For example, the securities may  be overcollateralized by ensuring that the value of the collateral backing  the securities\u2014in the case of mortgage backed securities, the face value of  the loans\u2014exceeds the value of the securities being offered for sale.  The  difference provides a \u201ccushion\u201d or reserve against possible credit losses  and permits a higher loss rate on the total mortgage pool without  endangering payments to the owners of the securities.  Securitizers can  also include recourse provisions in their loan purchases that require sellers  to take back loans in the event of borrower default.  As a result of these  factors, the degree to which originators of loans sold in the secondary  market\u2014including loans with abusive terms\u2014are insulated from credit  risks associated with those loans varies, and the profits from selling the  loans may vary with the costs of credit enhancement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Due Diligence Can Help Purchasers Avoid Predatory Loans, but Efforts Vary among Secondary Market Participants", "paragraphs": ["Secondary market purchasers of residential mortgage loans undertake a  process of due diligence designed to minimize legal, financial, and  reputation risk associated with the purchase of those loans.

For example, if such  loans violate relevant municipal, state, or federal laws, purchasing them  could, in some cases, expose the buyers to legal risks such as lawsuits,  fines, and penalties.  Moreover, predatory loans may be more likely to go  into default, increasing financial risk without a commensurate increase in  expected returns.  In addition, many industry officials told us that  reputation risk is a major reason why they want to avoid purchasing  predatory loans.

For example, an electronic review of loan  data can flag characteristics such as interest rates that appear excessive  but are nonetheless legal.  A loan-level file review, in which a purchaser  reviews the physical loan origination documents, offers access to more  information and can highlight items such as points and fees and the  borrower\u2019s capacity to repay.  While nearly all purchasers of loans use due  diligence to check for legal compliance, purchasers set their own  guidelines for what other loan characteristics meet their standards.", "While due diligence in the secondary market is important, the role that it  can play in deterring predatory lending by performing due diligence is  limited.

For example, the guidelines state that Fannie Mae\u2019s approved lenders may  not \u201csteer\u201d a borrower who qualifies for a standard loan to a higher cost  product, may not make loans without regard to the borrower\u2019s ability to  repay, and may not in most instances charge more than 5 percent of the  loan amount in points and fees.  Freddie Mac issued similar guidelines to its  sellers and servicers in December 2000.

When a residential mortgage-backed security is  created from a pool of loans, an independent credit rating agency examines  the security\u2019s underlying loans and assigns it with a credit rating, which  represents an opinion of its general creditworthiness.  Credit rating  agencies need to monetize (measure) the risk associated with the loans  underlying a security in order to assign a credit rating.

The two other major credit rating agencies,  Moody\u2019s and Fitch, also said that the law would limit their ability to rate  mortgage-backed securities in Georgia.", "In response to these events, the Georgia legislature amended the Georgia  Fair Lending Act on March 7, 2003.  The amendments eliminated the  category of \u201ccovered home loans\u201d and the restrictions that had existed for  that category of loans.  In addition, the amendments greatly reduced the  scope of assignee liability under the law, restricting such liability to \u201chigh-  cost\u201d loans, and then only when the assignee is unable to show that it has  exercised reasonable due diligence to avoid purchasing them.  In addition,  the amendments capped the amount of damages an assignee can face and  prohibited assignee liability in class-action lawsuits.  Once these  amendments were passed, credit rating agencies announced that they  would once again rate securities backed by mortgage loans originated in  Georgia, and lenders said they would continue to do business in the state.

In the case of Georgia, however, it is  unclear whether the problem was assignee liability itself or the scope and  characteristics of the specific assignee liability provisions contained in the  original law.  Georgia\u2019s original law created concern in large part because  of perceived ambiguities in defining which loans were subject to assignee  liability and because assignees\u2019 liability was subject to unlimited punitive  damages.

However, unreceptive consumers, lack of access to loan  documents, fraudulent lending practices, and the uneven quality of  counseling services can affect the success of these counseling efforts.  For  instance, some consumers may simply not respond to counseling.  Officials  at HUD have noted that not all first-time homebuyers avail themselves of  prepurchase counseling, and that some consumers who do attend  counseling sessions ignore the advice and information given to them.   Further, counselors may not have access to loan documents containing the  final terms of the mortgage loan.  Although lenders are required to provide  a good-faith estimate of the mortgage terms, they are not required to  provide consumers with the final and fixed terms and provisions of a  mortgage loan until closing.

Finally, the quality of mortgage counseling can  vary because of a number of factors.  For example, one federal official cited  an instance of a mortgage company conducting only cursory telephone  counseling in order to comply with mandatory counseling requirements.", "Although some states have mandated counseling for certain types of loans,  serious practical barriers would exist to instituting mandatory prepurchase  mortgage counseling nationally.

Lenders originated about 10 million mortgage loans in  2002 in the United States.  The cost of providing counseling for all or many  of these loans would be high, and it is unclear who would or should be  responsible for paying it.  In addition, there is a need for trained, qualified  counselors, according to federal officials and representatives of consumer  and advocacy groups, and currently no system exists for effectively  training large numbers of counselors while maintaining quality control.", "HUD requires counseling for its reverse mortgages.  These mortgages allow  homeowners to access the equity in their home through a lender, who  makes payments to the owner.  Borrowers who receive a home equity  conversion mortgage insured through FHA must attend a consumer  information session given by a HUD-approved housing counselor.

Federal agencies, advocacy groups, and the mortgage industry  have said that mortgage disclosures are an important source of information  for borrowers, providing key information on loan terms and conditions and  enabling borrowers to compare mortgage loan products and costs.   Representatives of the lending industry in particular have said that  disclosures can play an important role in fighting predatory lending, noting  that clear, understandable, and uniform disclosures allow borrowers to  understand the terms of their mortgage loans and thus make more  informed choices when shopping for a loan.", "However, industry and advocacy groups have publicly expressed  dissatisfaction with the current scheme of disclosures as mandated by  TILA and RESPA.

Industry groups claim that the proposal  would help fight predatory lending by helping consumers understand loan  costs up front and thus enable consumers to compare products, or  comparison shop.  Several advocacy organizations and an industry group  say the proposed rules would still allow unscrupulous mortgage originators  to hide illegal or unjustified fees.", "Although streamlining and improving mortgage loan disclosures could help  some borrowers better understand the costs and terms of their loans, such  efforts may play only a limited role in decreasing the incidence of predatory  lending practices.  As noted above, mortgage loans are inherently complex,  and assessing their terms requires knowing and understanding many  variables, including interest rates, points, fees, and prepayment penalties.   Brokers and lenders that engage in abusive practices may target vulnerable  individuals who are not financially sophisticated and are therefore more  susceptible to being deceived or defrauded into entering into a loan that is  clearly not in their interests.  Even a relatively clear and transparent system  of disclosures may be of limited use to borrowers who lack sophistication  about financial matters, are not highly educated, or suffer physical or  mental infirmities.

By targeting these owners,  unscrupulous lenders are more easily able to \u201cstrip\u201d the equity from a  borrower\u2019s home by including unjustified and excessive fees into the cost  of the home equity loan.  Federal officials and consumer groups say that  abusive lenders often try to convince elderly borrowers to repeatedly  refinance their loans, adding more costs each time.  \u201cFlipping\u201d loans in this  way can over time literally wipe out owners\u2019 equity in their homes.", "In addition, some brokers and lenders aggressively market home equity  loans as a source of cash, particularly for older homeowners who have  limited cash flows and can use money from a home equity loan for major  home repairs or medical expenses.  In the overall marketplace it is  common, and can be advantageous, to tap into one\u2019s home equity when  refinancing.  However, unscrupulous brokers and lenders can take  advantage of an elderly person\u2019s need for cash to steer borrowers to loans  with highly unfavorable terms.", "Further, diseases and physical impairments associated with aging can  make elderly borrowers more susceptible to abusive lending.  For example,  declining vision, hearing, or mobility can restrict elderly consumers\u2019 ability  to access financial information and compare credit terms.  In such  situations potential borrowers may be susceptible to the first lender to  offer what seems to be a good deal, especially if the lender is willing to visit  them at home or provide transportation to the closing.  Physical  impairments like poor hearing and vision can also make it difficult for older  borrowers to fully understand loan documents and disclosures.", "Similarly, while many older persons enjoy excellent mental and cognitive  capacity, others experience the diminished cognitive capacity and  judgment that sometimes occurs with advanced age.  Age-related  dementias or mental impairments can limit the capacity of some older  persons to comprehend and make informed judgments on financial issues,  according to an expert in behavioral medicine at the National Institute on  Aging.  Furthermore, a report sponsored by the National Academy of  Sciences on the mistreatment of elderly persons reported that they may be  more likely to have conditions or disabilities that make them easy targets  for financial abuse and they may have diminished capacity to evaluate  proposed courses of action.  The report noted that these impairments can  make older persons more vulnerable to financial abuse and exploitation.   Representatives of legal aid organizations have said that they frequently  represent elderly clients in predatory lending cases involving lenders that  have taken advantage of a borrower\u2019s confusion and, in some cases,  dementia.", "Finally, both the National Academy of Sciences report and representatives  of advocacy groups we spoke with noted that elderly people\u2014particularly  those who live alone\u2014may feel isolated and lonely, and may lack support  systems of family and friends who could provide them with advice and  assistance in obtaining credit.  Such individuals may simply be more willing  to discuss an offer for a home equity loan made by someone who  telephones or knocks on their door, makes personal contact, or makes an  effort to gain their confidence.  These personalized marketing techniques  are common among lenders and brokers that target vulnerable individuals  for loans with abusive terms.", "Federal officials, legal aid services, and consumer groups have reported  that home repair scams targeting elderly homeowners are particularly  common.  Elderly homeowners often live in older homes and are more  likely to need someone to do repairs for them.  The HUD-Treasury report  noted that predatory brokers and home improvement contractors have  collaborated to swindle older consumers.  A contractor may come to a  homeowner\u2019s door, pressure the homeowner into accepting a home  improvement contract, and arrange for financing of the work with a high- cost loan.  The contractor then does shoddy work or does not finish the  agreed-on repairs, leaving the borrower to pay off the expensive loan.", "The result of lending abuses, such as losing a home through foreclosure,  can be especially severe for the elderly.  The National Academy of Sciences  report noted that losing financial assets accumulated over a lifetime can be  devastating to an elderly person, and that replacing them is generally not  viable for those who are retired or have physical or mental disabilities.  The  financial losses older people can suffer as a result of abusive loans can  result in the loss of independence and security and a significant decline in  quality of life.  Moreover, older victims of financial exploitation may be  more likely to become dependent on social welfare services because they  lack the funds to help compensate them for their financial losses.", "Elderly consumers represent just one of several classes of people that  predatory lenders appear to target.
