NRC created the estimates as a transparency measure to assist stakeholders\u2014including licensees and potential applicants\u2014with planning for the costs of future NRC oversight activities. However, NRC did not specify what costs are included across these cost estimates, such as those related to project management. According to GAO's analysis of NRC documents, such costs for some NRC actions can account for about two thirds of total hours billed. By clearly defining the costs in its public cost estimates, NRC could enhance transparency and increase the value of the estimates as a budgeting and planning tool for stakeholders, in accordance with NRC's Principles of Good Regulation .", "Budgeting . NRC has made some changes to its budgeting process to better enable stakeholders to determine how it spent its appropriation.

As required by  the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, NRC  annually assesses and collects fees totaling about 90 percent of its  annual budget authority. To reach this amount, NRC establishes two  types of fees:  1.  Service fees, which recover the costs of licensing and other services  provided by NRC and are charged by applying an hourly fee rate,  and;  2.  Annual fees, which recover the remainder of budgeted costs not  covered by service fees.", "To establish these service and annual fee rates, NRC uses an annual  rulemaking process. NRC issues a proposed fee rule and final fee rule,  both of which are published in the Federal Register, and also prepares  and makes available on its website work papers that provide more  detailed information on the agency\u2019s fee calculations. After NRC\u2019s fee  rates are determined through this annual rulemaking process, NRC uses  those rates to bill its licensees.", "From fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year 2010, NRC\u2019s budget, and hence  its regulatory fees, grew as it hired additional staff in anticipation of a  substantial increase in NRC\u2019s workload due to a projected large number  of applications for new nuclear power plants and interest in new reactor  designs, among other things. However, the expected growth in the  nuclear power sector did not materialize, and instead the commercial  nuclear industry decreased in size, with nine operating reactors closing  between January 2013 and January 2020 and only one new operating  reactor entering service during that time. In this context, NRC undertook  several initiatives aimed at streamlining agency processes and better  positioning the agency to respond to these changes in external  conditions, such as standardizing its billing codes.", "In 2017 and 2018 we reported on various actions to improve NRC\u2019s fee- setting, billing, and budgeting processes, and NRC\u2019s Office of the  Inspector General (OIG) recommended additional actions on these  topics. For example, we recommended that NRC clearly present  information in NRC\u2019s proposed fee rule, final fee rule, and fee work  papers by defining and consistently using key terms. Additionally, we  reported that NRC was undertaking an initiative to transition to electronic  billing, and we recommended various actions to improve its planning for  that transition.", "Since we last reported on these issues, NRC\u2019s budget authority and  regulatory fees have declined.

The  Independent Offices Appropriations Act of 1952 provides broad authority  to federal agencies, including NRC, to assess user fees or charges to  identifiable beneficiaries through regulation. The Omnibus Budget  Reconciliation Act of 1990 requires that NRC recover approximately 90  percent of its annual budget authority through fees assessed to licensees,  excluding amounts appropriated for any one of a number of specified  purposes. The law requires that NRC first use its authority from the  Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952 to collect service fees for  specific services provided. However, because those fees do not equal 90  percent of NRC\u2019s budget authority, NRC also assesses annual fees. To  the maximum extent practicable, the annual fees assessed must have a  reasonable relationship to the cost of the regulatory services provided  and may be based on how NRC allocates resources for regulating  licensees or fee classes. The licensees regulated by NRC encompass a  broad range of commercial uses of nuclear material such as use in  commercial nuclear power reactors; the use of radioactive materials in  medical, academic, and industrial settings; and the transport, storage,  and disposal of radioactive materials and waste. For the purpose of  setting service and annual fees, NRC established nine fee classes.  Figure 1 shows NRC\u2019s total budget authority and the amounts NRC  collected through service and annual fees from licensees for fiscal years  2014 through 2019.", "NRC sets its service fees and annual fees through the federal rulemaking  process every year. Under this process, NRC first drafts and then  publishes a proposed fee rule in the Federal Register, after which  interested parties have 30 days to comment. NRC develops the proposed  fee rule by allocating its resources for regulating the fee classes and  calculating its proposed hourly fee rate, which is the same rate for all fee  classes, and annual fees, which vary by fee class. NRC bases its  calculations for the proposed fee rule on its appropriation for the current  fiscal year, if enacted. If the agency has not received its appropriation by  the time it begins calculating fees, it bases these calculations on the  President\u2019s Budget. As part of this process, NRC generally posts fee work  papers providing additional details to support the proposed fee rule. After  the 30-day comment period, NRC adjusts its hourly fee rate for service  fees and annual fees, as needed, and drafts a final fee rule. Finally, NRC  publishes a final fee rule that includes its responses to comments  received on the proposed fee rule. The final fee rule becomes effective 60  days after publication.", "In recent years, GAO and NRC internal initiatives identified several key  findings and made recommendations to improve NRC\u2019s fee-setting  process, including the following:  In 2016, NRC\u2019s Fees Transformation Initiative recommended process  improvements related to updating NRC\u2019s fee rules and associated  work papers.", "In 2017, we recommended that NRC clearly present information in  NRC\u2019s proposed fee rule, final fee rule, and fee work papers such as  by defining and consistently using key terms so that stakeholders  could understand fee calculations.", "In 2017, we also recommended that NRC develop objective,  measurable, and quantifiable performance goals and metrics that  would enable NRC to assess its efforts to improve the transparency  and timeliness of its fee-setting process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NRC\u2019s Billing Process", "paragraphs": ["NRC\u2019s billing process for annual fees is based solely on the annual fee  rate that is set through the rulemaking process.

Once NRC determines that billable work needs to be done, NRC program  office staff and contractors perform the work. NRC follows the steps in the  billing process shown in figure 2.", "NRC assigns an activity code under which billable work is accomplished.  Both NRC staff and contractors can perform work under the same billing  codes. Once the hours charged have been reviewed, NRC aggregates  the charges in its financial accounting system. Then, NRC staff and  supervisors verify the hours billed to that activity code on a monthly basis  through a formal, agency-wide billing validation process. On a quarterly  basis, NRC will send invoices through the U.S. Postal Service or  electronically to licensees, who have 30 days from issuance of the invoice  to review and pay the invoice before being assessed late fees.

We were unable to assess licensees\u2019 satisfaction with the updated invoices because NRC  issued them after we had completed our review. In January 2018, NRC  updated the service fee invoices it sends to licensees, in response to  NRC internal initiatives, to include the names of NRC staff and of  contractors billing time, along with the updated EPIDs and CACs.  According to our analysis of a sample of invoices from before and after  January 2018, NRC has consistently made these changes to invoices. As  shown in figure 3, NRC\u2019s updated invoices provide the quarterly total of  all charges for a given regulatory action as an EPID total. CACs are no  longer specific to a project or site and can now be reused to represent the  same type of work for different EPIDs. NRC staff and contractors can  charge multiple CACs to the same EPID during a given quarter.", "All 11 licensees we interviewed stated that the changes NRC made to the  invoices were positive. Seven licensees stated that the inclusion of staff  names made it easier to understand what they were being billed for, and  five licensees stated that the inclusion of CACs improved NRC\u2019s billing  process.", "In 2016, NRC\u2019s Fees Transformation Initiative recommended a process  improvement to include information on the progress of work performed on  inspection reports, but NRC ended this initiative in 2018 without making  updates to the inspection reports. NRC determined that the updated  information on invoices, described previously, resulted in sufficient  improvements to transparency. However, two licensees we interviewed  told us that including information on the progress of work performed  would assist licensees with their planning and budgeting. According to our  analysis of NRC documents and a licensee we interviewed, some NRC  regulatory oversight actions can take several years to complete, with  charges to licensees from a single action spanning multiple quarterly  invoices. One licensee explained that, as a result, not having information  on the progress of work performed on ongoing regulatory actions can  make it more difficult to budget. This is because the licensee does not  know how far NRC is in completing an activity, and NRC may invoice for  a large amount of additional costs that the licensee did not anticipate.", "One of NRC\u2019s program offices has a policy regarding when to  communicate information on the progress of work performed on ongoing  regulatory actions, but the remaining NRC program offices we spoke with  do not. Specifically, the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation has a  policy to communicate with operating reactor licensees if it anticipates  significant changes to the forecasted completion date or hours billed to  complete the action. Furthermore, officials in this office said that it has a  practice to notify the licensee when it estimates that NRC will expend  over 125 percent of the initial estimate of hours for a given regulatory  action. These officials said that the office created this policy and  practice to improve its communication with licensees, in support of NRC\u2019s  Principles of Good Regulation, which includes guidance on transparency.  They further stated that this policy and practice benefit licensees by  allowing them to better budget and plan for NRC\u2019s work. Additionally, they  benefit NRC by helping the agency to better manage its resources and  workload, according to these officials.", "In contrast, officials from the Office of New Reactors and the Office of  Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards stated that they do not have a  policy regarding communicating with licensees about the progress of work  performed on ongoing regulatory actions. Furthermore, there is no  agencywide policy or guidance regarding this communication. Officials from the Office of New Reactors stated that the office tracks percent  completion as an internal metric, but does not communicate this  information to licensees. The Office of Nuclear Material Safety and  Safeguards does not track regulatory actions by percent completion. NRC  officials told us that it is difficult to provide accurate estimates of work  progress to licensees because NRC\u2019s ability to meet anticipated cost and  schedule estimates depends on the complexity of the NRC action. NRC\u2019s  Principles of Good Regulation and NRC\u2019s Organizational Values list  openness as a key principle and value, respectively. According to those  documents, being open\u2014that is, transparent and forthright\u2014should guide  every action NRC takes, how it performs administrative tasks, and how it  interacts with stakeholders, such as licensees.

NRC officials said that NRC project managers are in regular contact with  licensees about the status of ongoing NRC activities; however, three  licensees we interviewed stated that NRC\u2019s project managers do not  always communicate about the status of the regulatory action, which can  make planning and budgeting more difficult. This is in part because the  program offices do not each have a policy regarding when NRC should  provide updates on cost and schedule. Formalizing when NRC staff are to  communicate information to licensees on the progress of work performed  could enhance transparency and make planning and budgeting easier for  licensees, as they would have more information about when an action is  expected to be completed or when it will cost more than NRC\u2019s initial  estimate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Supplemental Billing Information", "paragraphs": ["NRC formally communicated to licensees that supplemental billing  information about contractor charges is available and developed guidance  on how that information should be provided in response to two GAO  recommendations.

NRC officials  stated that the purpose of the biweekly summaries is to provide licensees  with information on costs that accrued in that particular period to help  licensees estimate their quarterly bill amount. We recommended that  NRC formally communicate to all licensees that these two supplemental  billing reports were available and how to request them, as we found that  not all licensees were aware this information was available.

NRC also developed  guidance on what billing information related to contractor charges NRC  staff can provide to licensees, along with a process map for how to  respond to licensee requests for contractor information.", "In contrast, while NRC has continued to provide biweekly summaries to  licensees upon licensee request, the agency has not formally  communicated the existence of these reports to licensees. Seven of the  11 licensees we interviewed receive the biweekly reports, and five of  these licensees said the reports allow them to better track billable activity  through the quarter. The remaining four licensees we interviewed were  unaware that NRC can provide these reports. Agency officials stated that  they do not have the capacity to provide these biweekly reports to all  licensees, as the current process is manual and labor-intensive.

We have previously reported that licensees had identified  challenges with planning for future work and budgeting to pay future costs  because NRC had not provided certain information about the agency\u2019s  billable work, such as cost estimates.", "Beginning in September 2017, staff from several NRC program offices  posted public cost estimates relating to six types of regulated entities:  operating reactors, new reactors, fuel facilities, spent fuel storage and  transportation, decommissioning, and uranium recovery. The cost  estimates, which are based on historical expenses and are calculated  using a sample of licensing and oversight actions, include the low, high,  and average number of NRC staff hours billed for each action, as well as  some estimates for contractor charges for certain tasks. According to  agency officials, NRC does not use these estimates as part of its  budgeting and fee-setting processes since these public cost estimates  are a resource for identifying possible costs, but are not tailored to a site- specific NRC action. Instead, the estimates assist stakeholders with  planning for the costs of future NRC work.", "The Fees Transformation Steering Committee created guidance that the  program offices should update the estimates periodically, and NRC also  posted on its public website that these estimates would be updated  biennially. However, we found that, as of December 2019, NRC\u2019s  program offices had updated only two of the six estimates. When we  discussed this with NRC officials at that time, the Office of the Chief  Financial Officer sent out a reminder to the program offices to update  their estimates by January 31, 2020.", "Additionally, we found that NRC program offices did not clearly define  what costs\u2014such as project management\u2014are included across the six  public cost estimates, which may limit stakeholders\u2019 ability to understand  them. For example, the cost estimate for operating reactors included  \u201cinspection support\u201d activities and defined what types of costs are  included in this category. In contrast, the cost estimate for fuel facilities  included a category for \u201cproject management activities,\u201d but did not define  what types of costs are included in this category. The remaining four cost  estimates did not mention project management costs, so it is unclear  whether the estimates include these types of costs. According to our  analysis of NRC documents and licensees we spoke with, project  management costs for some NRC actions can account for about two  thirds of total hours billed. Thus, increased transparency of these costs  could help stakeholders\u2014such as NRC licensees or potential  applicants\u2014better understand the full cost of NRC\u2019s regulatory actions.", "The Fees Transformation Steering Committee provided high-level  guidance to the program offices for developing cost estimates, but the  guidance did not specify what costs to include when creating these  estimates. According to NRC officials, the Committee did not provide  specific guidance regarding cost estimates because activities in the cost  estimates may vary based on the specific activities conducted by the  program offices and it wanted the program offices to have flexibility when  creating the estimates. We recognize that some activities in the cost  estimates will vary based on the different activities conducted by the  program office.

These reductions were a result of  NRC\u2019s corporate workload reductions to reflect efficiencies as well as  current and projected declines in agency workload, among other things.  However, actual obligations for Corporate Support as a percentage of  NRC\u2019s total agency-wide obligations increased by about 2.3 percent  during this same time period.

In some years, reductions in Corporate Support were offset by  pay increases consistent with federal government-wide guidance and  investments in information technology, among other items. In addition,  NRC officials said that Corporate Support as a percentage of NRC\u2019s total  obligations increased because program resources decreased as NRC\u2019s  projected workload declined.", "In addition to presenting actual obligation data in its annual budget  justification, NRC began presenting more detailed information on the  status of funds it carried over from previous fiscal years starting in its  fiscal year 2018 budget justification.
