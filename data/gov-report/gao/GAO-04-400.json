OOC, a 15-person office with about $2 million in expenditures during fiscal year 2003, administers and enforces various CAA provisions related to fair employment and occupational safety and health among certain legislative branch agencies. OOC's current Executive Director has been in place since April 2001 and its General Counsel joined the Office in June 2003. The mandate directed GAO to assess the OOC's overall effectiveness and efficiency and to make recommendations, as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["OOC is in the early stages of a concerted and vitally needed effort to improve and strengthen management control across the Office and to carry out its mission more effectively and efficiently while safeguarding its institutional independence. OOC's success in completing this important effort depends upon making significant progress on a number of key management control areas: Sharpen focus on results. OOC's current strategic planning initiative is beginning to address the more fundamental question of the Office's effectiveness rather than the Office's traditional focus on activities and outputs, such as the number of cases processed and inspections conducted. OOC's planning initiative can also provide a vehicle for engaging and consulting with key congressional and other stakeholders on OOC's purposes, how those purposes will be achieved, how progress will be assessed, and for sustaining feedback on what progress is being made and what additional improvement opportunities exist. The planning initiative is still very much a work in progress and continued efforts are needed in a number of key areas including developing results oriented performance measures. Ensuring an effective program structure. As OOC shifts its focus from outputs and activities to results, it must put in place a more effective program structure that includes new ways of doing business. OOC has taken a number of actions to administer the CAA, such as managing a dispute resolution process and conducting investigations and inspections to ensure compliance with safety and health standards. However, OOC is not fully in compliance with the CAA's requirement concerning biennial safety and health inspections of legislative branch agency facilities. OOC also needs to expand on recent efforts to develop programs that are based on collaboration with legislative branch agencies. Building effective communication emphasizing outreach and coordination. OOC's congressional and other stakeholders whom we interviewed said that OOC recently has used a more collaborative approach rather than the \"gotcha\" approach of the past. On the other hand, several agency officials said that current interactions with OOC could be improved. To facilitate more effective communications, OOC should establish congressional and agency protocols to document agreements between the Congress, legislative branch agencies, and OOC on what can be expected as OOC carries out its work. Creating and sustaining an enhanced management control environment. Since its creation, OOC has operated without having any formal performance management system for its Executive Director and General Counsel. OOC should establish an enhanced management control environment and strengthen accountability by requiring performance agreements between the Board and both the Executive Director and General Counsel, as well as expanding and improving on OOC's performance management system for all staff. Another important challenge concerns the lack of institutional continuity that may occur due to statutory term limits on OOC's leadership positions. To prevent the loss of critical organizational knowledge, the Congress should consider changing the term limits contained in the CAA."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Congress established the Office of Compliance (OOC) in 1995 as an  independent office within the legislative branch to administer and enforce  various provisions of the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA) related  to fair employment and occupational safety and health. As mandated by the  Consolidated Appropriations Resolution of 2003 Conference Report, we  examined OOC\u2019s effectiveness and efficiency in fulfilling its responsibilities  and role as set out in the CAA. Our specific objective was to assess key  management controls in place at OOC and identify what improvements, if  any, could be made to strengthen OOC\u2019s effectiveness and efficiency.", "Management controls, also known as internal controls, are a major part of  managing an organization. They comprise the plans, methods, and  procedures used to meet missions, goals, and objectives and, in doing so,  support performance-based management. Effective management control  also helps in managing change to cope with shifting environments and  evolving demands and priorities. As programs change and as agencies  strive to improve operational processes and implement new technological  developments, management must continually assess and evaluate its  management control to assure that activities being used are effective and  updated when necessary.", "To meet our objective, we analyzed applicable laws, legislative history,  rules, and regulations; obtained and analyzed written documentation of  guidance, policies, procedures, and performance of OOC; met with the  OOC Board of Directors; conducted interviews with OOC executives,  managers, and staff; met with key congressional stakeholders and officials  in other legislative branch agencies and offices; and performed selected  reliability and validity tests of OOC\u2019s administrative dispute resolution  database. We also drew on key management practices and guidance  identified in previously issued GAO reports, where appropriate.", "In addition, to assist OOC in its management control improvement efforts,  we provided OOC with briefings, reports, and examples of best practices in  the areas we reviewed. For example, at OOC\u2019s request, GAO officials  provided briefings on our approach to strategic planning and provided  copies of GAO strategic planning documents. We plan to continue working  with OOC\u2019s leadership and to meet with them regularly to discuss the  progress of their management reform initiatives. We performed our work in  Washington, D.C., from January 2003 through January 2004 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. See appendix I for  additional information on our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Enacted on January 23, 1995, the CAA as amended, applies 12 federal civil  rights, workplace, and labor laws to legislative branch employees who  were previously exempted from such coverage.", "By passing the CAA, the Congress extended to approximately 30,000  employees of the legislative branch certain fair employment and  occupational safety safeguards. The CAA applies to current employees,  applicants for employment, and former employees of the following  organizations:  Congressional Budget Office,  Office of the Attending Physician,  Office of the Architect of the Capitol, and  Office of Compliance.", "The CAA did not include GAO, the Library of Congress (LOC), and the  Government Printing Office (GPO) in many of its provisions because the  employees at these organizations already enjoyed the protections of many  of the civil rights laws extended to legislative branch staff by the CAA prior  to its enactment. For example, GAO, LOC, and GPO employees were  already protected against discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex,  and national origin (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16); discrimination based on age (29  U.S.C. \u00a7 633a); and discrimination based on disability (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12209). In  addition, GAO, LOC, and GPO employees already enjoyed the protections  provided by the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203) and by the  Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103 for GPO  and LOC employees; 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 732(e) for GAO employees). Furthermore,  all three organizations have individualized processes for resolving  employee disputes. For example, GAO uses an independent entity, the  Personnel Appeals Board, to adjudicate employment disputes involving  GAO employees.", "The CAA does extend the protections of the Employee Polygraph  Protection Act, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, the  Uniform Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, the Family  and Medical Leave Act, the public access provisions of the Americans with  Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Occupational Safety and Health Act to GAO  and LOC employees.", "OOC\u2019s duties are divided among a Board of Directors, an Executive  Director, and a General Counsel, as shown in figure 1.", "The five-member Board of Directors has the duty of administering appeals  for the CAA\u2019s dispute resolution process. Employees or employers covered  by the CAA who are dissatisfied with the final decision resulting from a  dispute resolution process hearing may request that the Board review the  decision. From 1996 through 2003, the Board has heard 20 appeal cases.  The Board is also responsible for appeals of decisions by hearing officers  with respect to complaints filed by the General Counsel regarding  occupational safety and health issues, disability access concerns, and  labor-management relations violations.", "The CAA also assigns the Board the duties of developing and issuing  regulations to implement the rights and protections of employees for 9 of  the 12 laws included in the CAA. The Board has issued regulations, which  were approved by the Congress, for the Family and Medical Leave Act,  federal labor-management relations provisions found in Chapter 71 of title  5 U.S. Code, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and Worker Adjustment and Re- Training Act. The CAA also provides that OOC may apply existing  regulations promulgated by executive branch agencies for regulations not  issued by the Board, except for regulations regarding labor-management  relations. Before the Board\u2019s adopted regulations can become effective,  they must first be placed in the Congressional Record for a comment  period and must subsequently be approved by the Congress. The Board has  delegated much of the work to complete these duties to OOC\u2019s Executive  Director.", "The Executive Director has overall responsibility for managing OOC\u2019s  education and dispute resolution processes as well as directing OOC\u2019s  staffing and budgeting functions. Reporting directly to the Executive  Director are two deputies, to whom the Executive Director has delegated  specific functional roles in addition to those identified in the CAA: the  Deputy Executive Director for the House is responsible for managing  OOC\u2019s education and information distribution functions, and the Deputy  Executive Director for the Senate is responsible for administering OOC\u2019s  dispute resolution process.", "The OOC General Counsel\u2019s duties include investigation and enforcement  of the Occupational Safety and Health Act and ADA requirements and  managing labor-management relations unfair labor practice case  processing and court litigation. Assisting the General Counsel is an  attorney and an inspector detailed from the Department of Labor to  investigate and enforce occupational safety and health standards with the  assistance of part-time contractors on a limited basis.", "In summary, OOC\u2019s organizational structure has a leadership hierarchy with  different top leadership functions shared among the Board of Directors,  Executive Director, and General Counsel. This organizational structure of  shared functions is largely due to statutory requirements that OOC carry  out a variety of different roles\u2014including adjudication, education, and  enforcement\u2014as it applies the 12 workplace laws covered by the CAA. In  order to provide for a degree of needed independence between these  different functions, the CAA established an organizational structure that,  among other things, gave the Board the responsibility for hearing appeals  of the dispute resolution process for cases that are initially within the  province of the Executive Director or General Counsel.", "While the CAA gives the Board of Directors the authority to appoint and  remove OOC\u2019s four senior executives\u2014the Executive Director, General  Counsel, and two Deputy Executive Directors\u2014the Board does not play an  active role in the daily operational management of OOC. Instead, OOC\u2019s  part-time Board focuses on its adjudicatory and policy functions including  hearing appeals and issuing regulations. Although the CAA designates  OOC\u2019s Executive Director as the organization\u2019s chief operating officer, the  law provides the General Counsel with independent authority to investigate  and enforce matters concerning occupational safety and health, disability  access, and labor-management relations. In practice, this has resulted in a  division of OOC by function, with the Executive Director responsible for  hiring and managing staff to carry out the education and dispute resolution  process functions and the General Counsel responsible for hiring attorneys  and managing staff in his operational areas.", "OOC is staffed by 15 employees, including 4 in statutorily appointed  positions. As figure 2 shows, OOC\u2019s annual expenditures have ranged from  a high of $2.15 million in fiscal year 1997 to a low of $1.80 million in fiscal  year 2001. Fiscal year 2003 expenditures were $2.02 million. In general,  these expenditures are allocated between the duties performed by the  Executive Director, General Counsel, and Board of Directors. Over the past  7 fiscal years, functions that are the responsibility of the Executive  Director have accounted for most of OOC\u2019s expenditures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OOC Has Effort Under Way to Sharpen Focus on Results", "paragraphs": ["Since August 2003, the OOC Board, its senior leadership team, and OOC\u2019s  employees have been exerting a concerted effort\u2014consistent with our  suggestions\u2014to more fully define the fundamental results, or outcomes,  that OOC seeks to achieve. OOC\u2019s operations and reporting have  traditionally been activity or output focused (e.g., number of requests for  mediation received, time within phases of the process, and number of  occupational safety and health inspections conducted). Such information is  important to managing OOC and to ensuring that its scarce resources are  efficiently targeted. However, the current Board and OOC leadership have  undertaken OOC\u2019s first strategic planning initiative in recognition that  despite the real value from output information, such data do not address  the more fundamental question of the effectiveness of OOC\u2019s efforts. That  is, OOC\u2019s current planning effort is intended to help OOC and its  congressional and other stakeholders ensure that OOC\u2019s activities and  outputs are optimizing the Office\u2019s contribution to results, such as a safer  and healthier workplace and one free from discrimination and other forms  of conflict. Our discussions with OOC stakeholders across the Congress  and legislative branch agencies confirmed the need for and importance of  the current planning effort.", "Effective management control requires that an organization establish its  organizational objectives in the form of a set of defined mission, goals, and  objectives. Furthermore, we found that leading organizations consistently  strive to ensure that their day-to-day activities support their organizational  missions and move them closer to accomplishing their strategic goals.  Thus, OOC is not alone among organizations in seeking to answer critical  questions about its overall effectiveness. Our assessments over the last  decade of executive agencies\u2019 implementation of the Government  Performance and Results Act (GPRA) have consistently found that  executive agencies have struggled with shifting the focus of their  management and accountability from outputs to results. At OOC\u2019s  invitation, we have met with OOC\u2019s leadership to share our wealth of  information and perspective on executive agencies\u2019 efforts under GPRA, as  well as our own experiences in strategic planning, performance planning,  and accountability reporting at GAO. While maintaining our respective  institutional independence, we are prepared to offer OOC continuing  support as its planning efforts proceed.", "OOC\u2019s planning initiative is important to ensuring that OOC\u2019s programs,  activities, and limited resources are contributing to results that are making  improvements in the work and work environments of legislative branch  employees. OOC\u2019s efforts to achieve this goal are complicated by the  inevitable tension that arises between organizations charged with the duty  to implement and enforce regulations and the agencies subject to those  regulations. Under the current draft of its strategic plan, OOC defines its  mission as working to \u201cadvance safety, health, and workplace rights for  employees and employers of the Legislative Branch as mandated by the  Congressional Accountability Act.\u201d OOC is developing strategic objectives  (goals) in three areas: effectively enforce and administer the CAA; educate,  collaborate, and facilitate the regulated community; and maintain an  efficient and accountable workplace (within OOC). More specifically:   Effectively enforce and administer the CAA: Regulatory enforcement  and administration focuses on operation of dispute resolution  procedures and investigation and prosecution of alleged violations.", "Educate, collaborate, and facilitate for our regulated community: The  Office will encourage and facilitate positive change in the employment  cultures within the regulated community to stimulate compliance with  the entire CAA; and effectively communicate with the Congress  regarding the status quo and potential enhancement of the CAA.", "Maintain an efficient and accountable workplace: Efficiency involves  not only careful and wise use of appropriated funds, but also continued  utilization of resources in a way that allows for timely and expeditious  completion of office activities and functions in order to better serve our  regulated community.", "OOC\u2019s effort to develop a results-oriented strategic plan is an important and  positive development that is still very much a work in progress\u2014as the  Board and OOC\u2019s senior leadership clearly appreciate. Perhaps most  important is OOC\u2019s recognition that its planning effort provides a vehicle  for engaging and consulting with key congressional and other stakeholders  on the fundamental purposes of OOC (strategic goals), how those purposes  will be achieved (programs and strategies), how progress will be assessed  (performance measures), and what progress is being made and  improvement opportunities exist (accountability reporting). More  specifically, as OOC\u2019s draft plan and our discussions with the Board and  OOC\u2019s leadership have confirmed, OOC is committed to an approach that  meets its statutory responsibility by adopting a more cooperative and  collegial approach with legislative branch offices and agencies, while at the  same time maintaining its enforcement capability and safeguarding its  institutional independence. The planning effort underway provides the  opportunity to reach agreement with key congressional and other  stakeholders on the direction\u2014and potential limits\u2014of this new  commitment.", "OOC has held a series of discussions with selected congressional  stakeholders and plans additional outreach with them and other  stakeholders as the planning effort moves forward. In fact, as we have  found by looking at leading results-oriented organizations, the production  of the actual strategic planning document is one of the least important  parts of the planning process. Leading results-oriented organizations  understand that strategic planning is not a static or occasional event, but  rather a dynamic and inclusive process. By working with and actively  engaging key congressional and other stakeholders in its planning effort,  OOC can better justify to stakeholders its current budget and staff  resources allocation and program efforts then, as appropriate, OOC can  build a business case for additional resources and new initiatives that OOC  leadership may believe are necessary for an agreed-upon mission and set of  strategic goals.", "In short, if done well, strategic planning is continuous and provides the  basis for everything that the organization does each day. Moving forward,  OOC plans to align key programs and strategies with each of these  objectives. In that regard, OOC managers have begun drafting several work  plans intended to link OOC\u2019s programs and activities to the strategic  objectives contained in the draft plan. Similar to the strategic plan, these  work plans are still in draft and therefore do not yet provide a clear linkage  between OOC\u2019s strategic objectives and the day-to-day operations of these  functions.", "OOC\u2019s strategic planning also needs to include the development of results- oriented performance measures. OOC is committed to this effort and has  \u201cplace-markers\u201d in its draft plan for these measures. OOC could benefit  from considering the experiences of leading organization in results- oriented performance measurement. Results-oriented organizations we  have studied, which were successful in measuring their performance,  developed measures that were:  tied to program goals and demonstrated the degree to which the desired   limited to the vital few that were considered essential to producing data   responsive to multiple priorities, and   responsibility-linked to establish accountability for results.", "Similar to decisions about strategic goals, determining the appropriate set  of performance measures should also be based on input from key  stakeholders to determine what is important to them to determine OOC\u2019s  progress and assess its performance. Put most directly, agreed-upon  performance measures are the key to providing the Congress with the data  it needs to answer a key question that the current fiscal environment is  demanding of all agencies across the federal government: \u201cWhat are we  getting for our investment in this agency, and is it worth it?\u201d"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OOC Is Beginning to Integrate Information Technology Planning into its Strategic Plan", "paragraphs": ["OOC officials said that they are committed to making better use of IT in the  future, and to ensuring that doing so is accomplished in a prudent and  systematic fashion.

For example, it established an Information Technology Task Force in May  2003, and consistent with our suggestions to OOC leadership, the task force  has been charged with developing parallel IT strategies: one addressing  near-term, stay-in-business IT needs and the other addressing long-term IT  modernization needs. Thus far, the task force has met numerous times and  has been guided in this initiative by a private consultant. It has also, for  example, reviewed the current IT environment and has surveyed OOC staff  about IT needs and preferences.", "With respect to near-term needs, OOC is taking steps to address immediate  shortfalls in its ability to produce the information it needs to manage  current operations and workloads. For example, OOC is investing a few  weeks of staff time to create a new Access database to provide a temporary  solution to meet certain case-tracking information needs. In our view, such  relatively small, low-risk investments that provide immediate mission value  are appropriate near-term steps.", "However, before pursuing strategic, modernized system solutions, it is  important that OOC first position itself for successfully doing so by  establishing certain basic IT management capabilities. These capabilities  include, among other things, developing a picture or description, based on  OOC\u2019s strategic plan, of what it wants its future IT environment to look like,  putting in place and following defined and disciplined processes for  allocating limited resources across competing IT investment options,  employing explicit and rigorous IT system acquisition management  processes, and ensuring that needed IT human capital knowledge and skill  needs and shortfalls are identified and systematically addressed. According  to OOC officials, each of these areas will be addressed. If they are not, the  risk of being unable to effectively leverage technology in achieving  strategic mission goals and outcomes will be increased.", "OOC\u2019s current use of IT is limited. For example, OOC\u2019s automated  administrative dispute resolution case tracking system does not have the  capability to notify system users when a case closes or should be closed.  OOC\u2019s system manager said they must periodically review some cases  manually and update the system for closed cases. OOC officials told us that  they had experienced some data quality problems during early  implementation stages of the dispute resolution case tracking system, but  had tested the system in March 2003 to determine if corrective actions were  effective. According to OOC officials, the data accuracy test demonstrated  that the information was now reliable, although they said the test was  performed informally and they had no documentation on the methodology  and the test results. We performed our own independent test of data quality  for this system as part of this review and found that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. (See app. I for  additional information on our reliability and validity reviews of OOC\u2019s  database.)", "OOC also recognizes the need to make better use of IT when enforcing the  Occupational Safety and Health Act-related provisions of the CAA. For  example, OOC\u2019s Office of the General Counsel is considering the purchase  of specialized IT software that would centralize and automate a variety of  tasks concerning the occupational safety and health-related cases it  handles, including assessing risk, monitoring case status, and tracking  agency abatement efforts. In November 2003, after meeting with us to  discuss best practices in IT acquisition and planning, OOC\u2019s General  Counsel established a group to develop specific selection criteria to assess  potential IT case management software. As part of this process, the group  and an outside IT consultant gathered information from both legislative  and executive branch agencies including the Architect of the Capitol  (AOC), LOC, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration  (OSHA) concerning their practices and experiences with similar IT  applications. OOC expects to complete this evaluation process by the end  of March 2004.", "In regards to the accounting and budgeting system used by OOC, a 2003  audit by an independent accounting firm of LOC\u2019s financial statements  found that the system was reliable. LOC administers the accounting and  budgeting system and the accounting firm\u2019s findings were addressed to  LOC. Although the auditors reported the system was, overall, reliable, they  also reported that there were two IT-related deficiencies that could  adversely affect the user\u2019s ability to meet its financial management  objectives. The deficiencies were that (1) security practices over IT  systems need to be improved and (2) LOC needs to establish a  comprehensive disaster recovery program to maintain service continuity,  minimize the risk of unplanned interruptions, and recover critical  operations should interruptions occur. The audit recommended that the  LOC address these deficiencies as a high priority.

Similarly, 272 of the cases that were closed that same year and were  reported as resulting in civil actions being filed with the district court were  also associated with this same single-issue group request.

OOC could not  provide us with a specific number of the individuals included in these  group requests who actually received counseling or mediation services in  1999 or 2001. According to OOC, dispute resolution data is presented in this  manner because the CAA specifically requires the Office to report on the  total number of individuals requesting counseling or mediation. While this  information is needed to meet existing statutory reporting requirements,  other data, such as the actual number of counseling and mediation sessions  held, could provide a helpful complement to the data which OOC currently  reports, as well as a more useful indicator of its actual workload.", "In addition to rethinking how it might supplement the way it currently  reports on single-issue large group requests, OOC should consider other  potential improvements on how it measures its activities and workload.  Such improvements can play an important role in helping organizations  both obtain a fuller understanding of the process and implications of its  activities as well as provide stakeholders with more transparent and  complete information. OOC is exploring options in this area and we have  offered our assistance in this regard. One possibility would be for OOC to  benchmark its data against that reported by other federal agencies, when  comparable measures exist, or against OOC\u2019s own past performance when  such measures do not.

The General Counsel\u2019s resources, however, have not  kept pace with this growth. The General Counsel\u2019s financial expenditures  increased by less than 5 percent from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2003.

In contrast to most other CAA  requirements, OOC is not fully in compliance with the CAA requirement  that it \u201cconduct periodic inspections of all facilities\u201d of the agencies  covered by the provision.

In 2000, OOC experienced a sharp  spike in charges filed with the number jumping to 38 in that year. OOC was  unable to provide a definitive reason for this increase, but told us that it  was probably related to the large group cases going through OOC\u2019s dispute  resolution process as these cases raised issues that could relate to charges  of unfair labor practices. Despite the relatively stable number of new unfair  labor practice charges received by OOC since 2001, the backlog of cases  still pending at the end of the year has almost doubled, increasing from 6 in  2001 to 11 in 2003 (as of December 9, 2003).", "OOC\u2019s Executive Director is responsible for a variety of other functions  relating to labor-management relations including supervising union  elections and resolving issues involving such matters as good faith  bargaining.

Toward this end, OOC is exploring the possibility of acquiring a  specialized regulatory case-tracking database application that would  enable the General Counsel and his staff to take a more strategic and risk- based approach towards their work, including such decisions as assigning  cases, determining the appropriate amount of follow-up required, and  informing the selection of particular facilities for its biennial inspections.  Until OOC decides on whether, and which, permanent case-tracking  software system it may adopt, staff in the General Counsel\u2019s office have  been developing a new Microsoft Access database intended to offer a short- term solution to OOC\u2019s need to more effectively track basic information  related to its occupational safety and health related caseload, such as case  type, key dates, principal parties involved, and actions planned and  accomplished.

However, focusing on the right activities is especially  important in times of economic scarcity, when the benefit of having  programs that deliver a maximum impact towards achieving results is  particularly critical. For example, in light of increasing demands for safety  and health inspections, and the very small number of OOC staff available to  conduct those inspections, OOC\u2019s General Counsel and his staff have begun  to explore possible approaches to leverage OOC\u2019s limited resources  through constructive engagement with legislative agencies.

The impact of OOC\u2019s initiative may be  somewhat limited until OOC develops a deeper understanding of what  would make this type of supplemental training useful in the view of USCP\u2019s  management and officers. Specifically, a senior USCP official who was  directly aware of this effort informed us that although the training  contained some good material, it was not sufficiently tailored to USCP to  be very useful.", "The value of thinking about outcomes and the relationship between  activities and outcomes can also help OOC make determinations about  whether it is providing the right mix of services and activities to achieve its  overall goals. For example, until recently OOC\u2019s education efforts have  been largely focused on activities such as sending mass mailings of written  material to the homes of legislative branch employees, distributing fliers  and bulletins to legislative agencies for subsequent distribution, and  conducting general information sessions for new employees. Moreover,  OOC\u2019s education efforts would benefit from better analysis of the types of  complaints that have been made. As noted above, OOC tracks the number  of cases it handles and how they proceed through established processes. It  does not, however, currently gather data on the nature of complaints. While  protecting the confidentiality of OOC\u2019s case files must continue to be of  primary concern, OOC could also seek ways to examine if common issues  are being raised.

Another staff member told us that, at a minimum,  it would have been helpful if OOC followed the notice by contacting them  directly to ensure that they were aware of the proposed rules and the  subsequent 30-day comment period, explaining that such announcements  are easy to miss if one is not looking for them.

According to OOC, the  decision to hold the hearing was consistent with feedback OOC had  received several years earlier from some congressional stakeholders.  However, instead of creating an opportunity for stakeholders to provide  additional feedback, the Board had to cancel the session because only one  person had agreed to speak at the hearing. Congressional staff told us that  the Congress\u2019 lack of participation in the hearing was not an indication of a  lack of interest in the issues to be discussed, but was due to concerns about  the nature and structure of the forum.

The CAA gives OOC\u2019s General  Counsel considerable authority to inspect and investigate places of  employment under the jurisdiction of employing agencies covered by the  CAA and does not require him to provide advance notice before starting an  investigation or visiting buildings or facilities. However, to foster a  constructive working relationship with the agencies they regulate, OOC\u2019s  General Counsel and a staff member told us that it has been a long-standing  policy of OOC to immediately notify the agency involved when the Office  receives a safety and health-related complaint. In addition, except in cases  of emergency or when any delay might pose a danger, it is also OOC's  policy to give agencies the option of attending an opening conference  before proceeding with the investigation. However, officials at two  agencies told us that there have been cases, including some within the past  year, where OOC has failed to follow its policy on agency notification. They  said these instances have contributed to misunderstandings, confusion,  and, in at least one case, the perception among senior agency officials \u201cthat  a \u2018gotcha\u2019 mentality still exists at OOC.\u201d While OOC and the agency  involved in this last case do not agree concerning the facts and significance  of OOC\u2019s actions that led to this comment on the part of the agency, the  situation provides an illustration of the differences that exist in perceptions  between OOC and some agency officials.", "In addition, agency officials told us that often OOC would not follow up  with agency officials on the status and disposition of investigations in a  timely or consistent manner. For example, agency officials told us of cases  where, after meeting with OOC staff to discuss the findings of a particular  investigation and responding with a plan to address the issues, they did not  hear back from OOC for months, or in several instances, for a year or more.  The agency official we spoke with explained that this absence of closure  complicated efforts to resolve the current status of cases.", "Our review of OOC's procedure manual for handling safety and health- related complaints found that it did not provide a clear, complete, and up- to-date source of OOC's policies and procedures on how the Office  responds to such complaints. In addition, the manual did not provide clear  time frames on when OOC would communicate to agencies during this  process. For example, the manual has not been updated since 1997 and  does not contain any specific language on the Office's policy of providing  agencies with opening conferences as described to us by OOC's General  Counsel and his staff. In response to follow-up requests, OOC staff did  provide us with a separate one-page document, dated May 1999, which  described topics discussed at an opening conference. However, this  document also did not clearly set forth OOC's policy on agency  notification, and it was not clear how it was used and how widely it had  been distributed. OOC\u2019s General Counsel has recently acknowledged the  need to revise and update these procedures, but he told us that because of  other needs he has not given this a high priority.", "To establish channels that facilitate open and effective communication,  organizations need to clearly set out procedures\u2014such as communication  protocols\u2014that they will consistently follow when doing their work.

The development of these self-assessments  is an important first step in improving the performance and assuring the  accountability of OOC and its executive team.", "OOC\u2019s current efforts to develop a strategic plan provide an ideal  opportunity for the Office to build on this first step. Once OOC has reached  agreement with its stakeholders and has completed its strategic plan, it can  take the next step and develop results-oriented performance agreements  with its senior executives that are directly linked to organizational goals  embodied in its strategic plan\u2014the absence of which is a major limitation  of the current effort. We have reported on a number of benefits of  performance agreements that may have direct importance to achieving  improved performance at OOC. Performance agreements have:  Strengthened alignment of results-oriented goals with daily  operations. Performance agreements define accountability for specific  goals and help to align daily operations with agencies' results-oriented,  programmatic goals.", "Fostered collaboration across organizational boundaries.", "Performance agreements encourage executives to work across  traditional organizational boundaries or \"silos\" by focusing on the  achievement of results-oriented goals.", "Enhanced opportunities to discuss and routinely use performance  information to make program improvements. Performance  agreements facilitate communication about organizational performance,  and provide opportunities to pinpoint improved performance.", "Provided a results-oriented basis for individual accountability.", "Performance agreements provide results-oriented performance  information to serve as the basis for executive performance evaluations.", "Maintained continuity of program goals during leadership  transitions. Performance agreements help to maintain a consistent  focus on a set of broad programmatic priorities during changes in  leadership.", "In addition to assuring accountability and alignment of operations to  results, performance agreements could help OOC ensure it maintains a  common and consistent vision and approach to the implementation of the  CAA. In the past, a lack of such a common vision on how OOC should  approach the enforcement of workplace health and safety requirements or  interact with stakeholders resulted in clashes between the Executive  Director and the previous General Counsel. Specifically, a number of  congressional and legislative agency officials we interviewed had the  perception that a previous General Counsel\u2019s emphasis on a strict \u201cgotcha\u201d  approach toward enforcement led to a combative and adversarial  relationship with legislative agencies and other stakeholders that was at  odds with the more collaborative approach supported by OOC\u2019s Executive  Director.", "OOC\u2019s current Board, Executive Director, and General Counsel told us that  they share a common commitment to pursuing a collaborative and  constructive approach towards enforcing the CAA. OOC\u2019s recent effort to  develop a strategic plan is a reflection of the common vision of the  organization\u2019s mission, goals, and operational approach shared by OOC\u2019s  current leaders. In addition, they appear to enjoy good working  relationships among themselves. However, the standards of effective  management control and OOC\u2019s own past experience demonstrate the need  for the office to take appropriate steps to address the OOC\u2019s organizational  structure and presents a challenge to effective management control."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effective Human Capital Management Is Also a Key Factor in Management Control", "paragraphs": ["Effective human capital management is an important factor contributing to  management control as well as an organization\u2019s ability to achieve results.  We have identified two human capital challenges currently facing OOC: (1)  the need to ensure leadership continuity and preserve critical  organizational knowledge in the face of the impending loss of a large  number of leaders over the next 2 years and (2) the need to establish a  modern, effective, and credible performance management system with  appropriate safeguards for all OOC employees."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Leadership Continuity Is Key to Management Control", "paragraphs": ["Sustained focus and direction from top leadership is a key component of  effective management. Management control requires that organizations  consider the effect upon their operations if a large number of employees\u2014  including executives and other leaders\u2014are expected to leave and then  establish criteria for a retention or mitigation strategy.", "OOC currently faces a considerable loss of knowledge and leadership  capacity due to impending turnover of its Board of Directors. This  expected loss is the result of CAA provisions that limit current Board  members to a single 5-year term. For example, within the next year-and-a- half all five members of the current Board will reach the end of their terms.  When the Congress crafted the CAA, it included a provision to provide for  staggered terms for OOC\u2019s Board. However, delays in the appointment of  successors to the original group of board members resulted in the  appointment of several new members at the same time. Specifically, the  Chair and two members of the five-member Board were appointed in  October 1999 and are scheduled to complete their terms in September  2004. The terms of the two remaining Board members will end eight  months later in May 2005.", "The situation is only slightly better for OOC\u2019s four appointed executives.  Similar to the Board, the CAA restricts OOC\u2019s four appointed executives to  nonrenewable 5-year terms of service. In addition, this restriction also  prevents the possibility of having a deputy executive director serve in the  role of executive director, making the potential of succession planning  among this group of executives impossible. The terms of all but the General  Counsel will expire within 6 months of each other in 2006. If one considers  both OOC\u2019s Board and its senior executives together, eight out of nine of  the organization\u2019s top officials will have left by September 2006. The loss of  such a large proportion of OOC\u2019s senior leadership within a relatively short  period will likely result in a loss of leadership continuity, institutional  knowledge, and expertise that has the potential of adversely impacting  OOC\u2019s performance at least in the short term.", "Other federal agencies with functions similar to OOC do not restrict their  board members from serving subsequent terms. For example, there are no  statutory restrictions on the five board members of the EEOC and the three  board members of the Federal Labor Relations Authority from serving  addition terms. In addition, the statute governing the National Labor  Relations Board permits the five board members to be reappointed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Need for Modern, Effective, and Credible Approach to Performance Management", "paragraphs": ["We have previously reported that performance management systems can  create a \u201cline of sight\u201d showing how team, unit, and individual performance  can contribute to overall organizational results. An explicit alignment of  daily activities with broader results is one of the defining features of  effective performance management systems in high-performing  organizations. Organizations naturally need to develop performance  management systems that reflect their specific structures and priorities.  Given OOC\u2019s small size and specific situation, it is important that it  considers these and other key practices in the context of its own needs,  capabilities, and circumstances.", "In September 2002, OOC rolled out its first formal performance  management system to staff who report to the Executive Director. OOC  assesses employees on eight performance dimensions: (1) job knowledge  and technical skills, (2) overall quality of work, (3) employee and  professional relationships, (4) planning and organization, (5) work habits,  (6) judgment, (7) initiative and creativity, and (8) development. Supervisors  are to meet with their staff twice a year to provide ratings and feedback on  the previous 6-month assessment period. They also are to hold an interim  meeting halfway through each assessment period. For these eight  performance dimensions, supervisors give each employee two separate  ratings\u2014the first describes the employee\u2019s overall achievement in the  performance dimension, and the second represents the progress of the  employee toward achieving specific goals established at the start of the  evaluation cycle.", "On one hand, OOC\u2019s decision to establish a formal performance  management system covering at least some of its employees represents a  good first step and its performance management system exhibits some  positive characteristics. For example, OOC\u2019s requirement that supervisors  and employees meet at least four times a year to discuss the employees\u2019  recent performance and individual goals provides regular opportunities for  staff to discuss and act on feedback. On the other hand, there are areas  where the system can be improved as OOC\u2019s efforts in this area move  forward. For example, OOC\u2019s current performance management system  assesses staff against the eight performance dimensions identified above  without providing specific standards or detailed descriptions of the  behaviors associated with varying levels of performance. For instance, for  the performance dimension \u201coverall quality of work,\u201d the only descriptive  standard provided is \u201cconsistently produces competent work.\u201d OOC should  explore the usefulness of including descriptions of competencies\u2014those  specific skills or supporting behaviors that employees are expected to  demonstrate as they carry out their work\u2014in its performance management  system to provide a basis for making judgements about an individual\u2019s  performance and contribution to OOC\u2019s results.", "In addition, OOC\u2019s current performance management system does not  apply to the General Counsel or any OOC attorneys who report to him.  These employees continue to work without any formal performance  management system in place. Moving forward, the involvement of  employees will be crucial to the success of any efforts by OOC to create a  new performance management system or reform and expand its existing  one.
