To meet these mission requirements, the office relies on several IT systems, as well as the infrastructure managed by the Library of Congress's central IT office. However, GAO and others have identified challenges with this environment. For example, comments solicited by the Copyright Office from external users have described limitations in the performance and usability of the office's electronic copyright registration system, and the Copyright Office has expressed concerns about the integrity of the files stored in the Library's servers. Organizationally, responsibility for managing the office's IT environment is shared between the Copyright Office's Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Library's central IT office. The Library has serious weaknesses in its IT management, which have hindered the ability of the Library and the Copyright Office to meet mission requirements.

The office has also published a report that summarizes stakeholder comments on the current IT environment and makes several recommendations to improve this environment.", "However, the office has not adequately justified these proposed investments. Specifically, it has not identified the business needs they are intended to meet, expected costs, or how they align with the agency's strategic plan, as called for by Library IT investment management policy. The office also did not present the investments to the Library's IT investment review board, which was established to select investments for funding that meet defined criteria and ensure that such investments are not duplicative of existing investments or activities performed within the Library. Copyright officials stated that these initiatives were in early stages and the office was not yet in a position to develop this information. However, without identifying key costs and benefits of proposed initiatives and presenting this information to the Library-wide investment review board, decision makers at the Library and the Copyright Office do not have the assurance that the selected investments support the organization's goals and do not duplicate existing activities. In addition, the office does not have an IT strategic plan, and officials described difficulties in developing such a plan given that the Library has not yet developed one. As noted in a recent GAO review of the Library's IT management, the Library has recently committed to developing an updated IT strategic plan, and it will be important for the Copyright Office's own strategic planning to be aligned with this effort."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Copyright Office (1) develop key information to support proposed initiatives for improving its IT environment and submit them to the Library's IT investment review board for review, and (2) develop an IT strategic plan that is aligned with the Library's strategic planning efforts.

As part of that responsibility, it performs a number of key functions,  including copyright registration, recordation, and statutory licensing.", "Registration. The Copyright Office examines applications for  registering copyrights, along with any accompanying copies of the  work (called the deposit), to determine whether they satisfy statutory  requirements. Copyright registration is a legal formality intended to  make a public record of the basic facts of a particular copyright, but is  not required by law or as a condition of copyright protection.  According to the Copyright Office, in fiscal year 2014, the Copyright  Office registered about 476,000 creative works for copyright, including  about 219,000 literary works and 65,000 sound recordings.", "Recordation. Authors, heirs, and other parties submit a variety of  documents to the Copyright Office for public recordation, including  copyright assignments, licenses, security interests, and termination of  transfers. Like registration, a copyright owner is not required to record  such changes to ownership, but there are certain incentives in the law  for those who do. The Copyright Office recorded about 7,600  copyright records in fiscal year 2014.", "Statutory Licenses. The Copyright Office administers several  statutory licenses set forth in the Copyright Act that manage and  disperse royalty payments, including those pertaining to copyright  owners\u2019 rights related to television programming that is retransmitted  by cable operators and satellite carriers. The disposition of these  private funds is determined by a board of copyright royalty judges,  called the Copyright Royalty Board. The work of the board is  reviewable by the Register, but the board reports to the Librarian as  head of the agency. According to the Copyright Office, in fiscal year  2014, it collected approximately $315 million in royalties and made  disbursements in accordance with the decisions of the Copyright  Royalty Board.", "In addition to registration, recordation, and statutory licensing, the office  also performs other functions. For example, the Register is charged with  advising Congress on national and international issues relating to  copyright and provides assistance to federal departments, the judiciary,  and the public on such topics.

In  this role, the office may facilitate, demand, negotiate, or exempt the  provision of these copies. Absent an exemption, the law requires that one  or two copies of the best edition of every copyrightable work published  in the United States be sent to the office within 3 months of publication,  regardless of whether the creator registers the work. This mandatory  deposit requirement is designed, in part, to serve the Library. Specifically,  according to the Copyright Office, copyright deposit (whether through  registration or mandatory deposit) is a means by which the Library  obtains about 20 percent of its collections.", "While the Copyright Office resides within the Library of Congress, it also  has responsibilities that distinguish it from the Library.

Specifically, the office uses multiple systems to, among  other things, allow the public to electronically register works with the  office, assist it in examining copyright registrations for such submissions,  and allow the office to record documentation related to copyright transfers  and provide that information to the public. The office manages mission- related systems and, in some cases, procures its own equipment, which  is hosted within the Library\u2019s infrastructure (i.e., networks,  telecommunications, and data center). Table 2 describes selected  systems used by the office to support its registration, recordation, and  licensing functions.", "The office uses these systems to meet its major statutory responsibilities,  as described below:", "Registration. The primary system used in the registration process is  eCO. To register a copyright, a creator generally submits a completed  application, the relevant fee, and the deposit copies to the Copyright  Office. This can be done in one of three ways: (1) by submitting all  three of these items in physical form (e.g., paper); (2) by submitting all  three items online (through eCO); or (3) by submitting the application  and fee online and providing the deposit in physical form.", "Copyright Office staff process these materials based on the method of  submission. For example, for applications received in physical form,  Copyright Office staff must scan the application, enter the application  information and fee payment (check, cash, or deposit account) into  eCO, manually process the related fees, and affix a barcode to the  deposit copy. Regardless of how the materials are submitted, a  registration specialist uses the eCO system to validate the accuracy of  the information entered into eCO and review the application and  materials to ensure that they meet the criteria for copyright  protection. Printed registration certificates are generated and mailed  to the recipient designated on the application, and an image of the  certificate is stored in the Copyright Imaging System.", "If the deposit was provided in physical form and is not selected for the  Library\u2019s collections, it is stored in a warehouse and tracked using  either eCO or the Box Number Control System. Digital deposits are  stored in servers within the Library of Congress\u2019s data center.  Information about the copyright registration (for example, author  names and titles of work) is also made available online to the public  through the Copyright Voyager system. Figure 2 below depicts the  copyright registration process.", "Recordation. Copyright Office staff currently use several systems to  record documents related to changes in copyright. The public,  however, must submit the documentation to be recorded in physical  form since there is currently no online means for doing so.  Specifically, to record a document, an individual must submit the  related documentation (with an original signature) and the relevant  fee.", "Once received by the Copyright Office, the documents must be  scanned and the information must be entered into either eCO or  several legacy systems. Copyright Office officials stated that they are  incorporating the functionality of most of the registration and  recordation systems into eCO. During the transition, however,  Copyright Office staff must use one of two parallel business  processes to record copyright changes. Specifically, if the Copyright  Office received a document during or prior to January 2013, Copyright  staff must type the information into the Copyright Office Documents  System, and the documentation must be scanned twice\u2014once into  eCO and once into the Copyright Imaging System. Then the specialist  must manually number the document and assemble the recordation  package (including certificate, cover sheet, and numbered document)  to be sent back to the submitter. If the office received the document  after January 2013, all data entry and scanning is completed in eCO,  and the recordation package is electronically bundled, printed, and  sent back to the submitter. Similar to the registration process, once  the change is processed, the information is available to the public  using the Copyright Voyager system, which is available online (see  fig. 3).", "Licensing. Licensing Division staff members examine statements of  account and process royalty payments. Since 1992, licensing staff  have used the Licensing Division System to examine and process  statements of account. In 2010, the Copyright Office began an  initiative to reengineer its licensing business processes and develop a  new system (called the Electronic Licensing Information System) to  replace the Licensing Division System. The office launched a pilot of  the new system in October 2014 and plans to use information  gathered during that pilot to improve the new system before its  deployment.", "According to Copyright Office staff, the office has recently taken steps to  incorporate the functionality from all registration and recordation systems  into eCO. Specifically, according to Copyright Office officials, most of the  systems supporting the registration and recordation processes were  developed in the 1990s, have far exceeded their shelf-life, are running on  obsolete technology, and do not meet current security standards required  by Library policy. Because of these limitations, as already noted, the  Copyright Office plans to incorporate the functionality of these legacy  systems into eCO and ultimately retire them, with the changes expected  to be completed by January 2016. According to the Director of the Office  of Public Records and Repositories at the Copyright Office, moving the  recordation functionality to eCO is an interim step to address immediate  needs. In addition, the Copyright Office CIO stated that supporting the  transition of legacy system functions has required the office to divert  resources otherwise intended to make updates to eCO."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Office\u2019s Current Technical Environment Has Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Our work, Copyright Office employees, and external users have all  identified challenges with the Copyright Office\u2019s current IT environment,  including eCO and the infrastructure supporting that system that is  managed by the Library\u2019s central IT office (ITS), as described below:  Both internal and external users have described challenges with eCO  related to performance, stability, and usability. For example, internal  registration staff said that eCO sometimes freezes multiple times a day,  requiring the staff to restart the system or their computers, which  ultimately decreases productivity. ITS officials noted that they plan to  move eCO onto its own data storage server in an attempt to temporarily  address these issues. However, there is disagreement about whether this  will fix the problem, since the underlying cause was never identified. ITS  officials stated that the suspected underlying cause of the issue is within  the eCO system, which is managed by the Copyright Office, and that this  is just a temporary solution. However, the Copyright Office CIO  disagrees, and believes that eCO having its own server will fix this  problem.", "Other users of eCO internal to the Copyright Office have also  experienced issues with the system. For example, according to one of the  office\u2019s registration specialists, eCO\u2019s interface requires them to input the  same information multiple times on multiple screens. He noted that this  type of re-work takes additional time and increases the chance of errors.  External users have also described challenges with eCO. For example, in  an online survey by the Copyright Office, 35 percent of eCO users were  dissatisfied with the ease of use of eCO. One respondent stated that \u201cthis  is, hands down, the worst site I have ever had to navigate\u201d and noted that  it took the individual 4 hours to submit the registration application.", "In our March 2015 report on the Library of Congress\u2019s IT management,  we determined that while the Library had established a security and  privacy program that covers service units, including the Copyright Office,  it had not fully implemented management controls to ensure the  protection of its systems and information, including both the front-end  eCO system and the infrastructure that stores copyright deposits. For  example, as of February 2015 the Copyright Office did not have  necessary security documentation for eCO, including (1) complete  security testing, (2) a current authorization to operate, and (3) a privacy  impact assessment. More generally, the Library did not always require  two-factor authentication for access to sensitive Library resources,  establish and implement a process for documenting approvals for  permissions to access systems, or ensure that sensitive information  transmitted across its network was being adequately encrypted. These  limitations increase the risk that Library systems\u2014including those used by  the Copyright Office\u2014will not limit access appropriately and that an  individual could gain unauthorized access to system data. To address  these issues, we made a number of recommendations to better protect  the Library\u2019s IT systems and reduce the risk that the information they  contain will be compromised.", "Both the Copyright Office and ITS recently identified data integrity issues  when performing analyses of the eCO system. For example, one analysis  found that eCO was not properly saving registration certificates, although  the root cause was not identified. In addition, the Copyright Office\u2019s  General Counsel stated that the Library has used settings and controls  that do not provide a sufficient level of integrity for the office\u2019s digital  records, and that the Copyright Office does not have means of verifying  the integrity of files maintained in those systems.", "The Copyright Office has a legal responsibility to retain unpublished  works (including digital works) for the length of the copyright, which could  be as long as 120 years. A report developed by a contractor for ITS noted  that no current technology exists that would allow for digital deposits to be  stored for the required length of time. According to the report, maintaining  access to the deposits in the future requires migration to new storage  solutions as technology evolves. Although the Copyright Office has  communicated this requirement to ITS, a service-level agreement for this  requirement has not been established between ITS and the Copyright  Office.", "These technical challenges and the need for improvements have been  acknowledged both by the current Register of Copyrights and by the  office\u2019s external stakeholders. For example, in October 2011, the Register  released a document identifying a series of priorities and special projects  intended to improve the quality and efficiency of the office\u2019s services. The  special projects included, among others, the need for technical upgrades  to the eCO registration system and reengineering of the recordation  process. Further, in March 2013, the Copyright Office solicited public  comments on the electronic registration and recordation functions. The  comments received, which the Copyright Office made publicly available  on its website, ranged from basic frustrations with eCO, such as the need  to make the workflow viewable throughout the registration process, to  requests for new features, such as instant message, video  communication, webinars, and customer support during West Coast  hours.", "In November 2013, the Register reiterated the need for technical  improvements. Specifically, she stated that the Copyright Office\u2019s  technical capacities, such as its bandwidth, networking equipment,  electronic storage capacity, hardware, and software, do not fully  accommodate services such as registration that require short-term and  long-term solutions.", "In a September 2014 hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, the  Register further discussed the need to modernize the Copyright Office,  because of issues with the registration user interface, the quality of public  records, security concerns, interoperability, and overall customer service.  The Register also discussed backlogs in processing registration and  recordation documents, specifically stating that such issues relating to  recordation are systemic and cannot be improved until the recordation  system is redesigned and brought online.", "Finally, in December 2014, the Copyright Office developed a report that  described the need to reengineer the recordation process, including  potentially making changes to the law. This report was informed by,  among other things, public comments provided in response to a Federal  Register notice and roundtable meetings. This report also discussed  shortcomings in the current recordation process described by the public,  including the time it takes for the office to process these documents, the  difficulties in submitting the documents in physical form, and inaccuracies  caused by recordation specialists transcribing the physical documents."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Copyright Office Shares Responsibility for IT Management with the Library of Congress, but Organizational Weaknesses Hinder Its Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["As noted previously, responsibilities for managing IT at the Copyright  Office are shared between Copyright Office staff and organizations at the  broader Library level.

Within the Copyright Office, the Office of the CIO is  responsible for advising the Register on the development and  implementation of technology policy, providing strategic direction for the  office\u2019s IT initiatives, and serving as a liaison with ITS. The CIO office has  21 staff that manage several of the Copyright Office\u2019s IT systems, most  notably eCO, and assume overall responsibility for operating the systems  at an acceptable level of risk for the office.

These  issues have in turn affected the Copyright Office\u2019s ability to carry out its  responsibilities. Specifically, our report identified the following challenges:  The Library does not have the leadership needed to address IT  management weakness. For example, the Library CIO does not have  responsibility for all of the Library\u2019s commodity IT or the ability to  adequately oversee mission-specific system investments made by the  service units. Also, the Library has not had a permanent CIO in over 2  years. Since the departure of the most recent permanent CIO in 2012,  four individuals have served as acting CIO, and another was recently  appointed to serve in an interim capacity until a permanent CIO is found.  According to the Register, the absence of a permanent CIO has resulted  in a lack of routine communication between senior Library and Copyright  leadership about IT. In addition, the Library has not clearly defined the  responsibilities and authorities governing the relationship of the Library  CIO and component organizations. Of particular concern is the lack of  clearly defined relationships between the Library CIO and the two service  unit CIO positions at the Library, one of which is the Copyright CIO.", "From the Copyright Office\u2019s perspective, the lack of clearly defined roles  and responsibilities at the Library has impeded its ability to carry out its  mission. According to the Register, because the Copyright Office has  unique statutory requirements and business needs, IT issues should not  be decided solely by Library staff outside of the Copyright Office or simply  according to an internal Library regulation. For example, the Library\u2019s  requirement that the Copyright Office provide \u201cbest editions\u201d for deposits  that are to be added to the Library\u2019s collection has been interpreted to  mean that these deposits should be provided in hard copy. However,  according to the General Counsel of the Copyright Office, this  requirement is a chief cause of delays in processing registration  applications and hampers the ability of the office to modernize the  copyright registration system and move to a fully electronic process.", "In addition, according to the Copyright Office\u2019s General Counsel, as a  result of its subordinate status within the Library of Congress, the  Copyright Office lacks adequate control over mission-critical IT resources  and decisions, thus frustrating its basic statutory purpose of creating,  maintaining, and making available to the public an authoritative record of  copyright ownership and transactions. For example, Copyright Office staff  expressed concerns regarding ITS\u2019s control of servers containing its  deposit files.

For example, ITS had one service- level agreement with the Copyright Office for the eCO system; however,  that agreement was incomplete. Specifically, the service-level agreement  did not include all of the services that ITS provides to the Copyright  Office. As a result, services that ITS provides to the Copyright Office may  not be meeting the office\u2019s business needs. For example, according to the  Copyright CIO, ITS controls when eCO is to be shut down for  maintenance and outages had, at times, been scheduled during periods  of heavy traffic from the office\u2019s external users.", "Finally, our report found that inconsistent satisfaction with the services  provided by ITS had likely contributed to duplicative or overlapping efforts  across the Library. Specifically, service units across the Library performed  many of the same functions as ITS; for example, the Copyright Office  provides Internet management and desktop support services, which  overlap similar services by ITS. In addition, service units within the Library  had purchased their own commodity IT in the past 3 years. For example,  the Copyright Office had purchased laptops, mobile devices, servers, and  workstation software, even though these may be duplicative of those that  the Library has procured. Our report also raised questions about recent  budget requests made by the Copyright Office, and whether those  proposed requests may create additional services that overlap those  already provided by ITS.", "In our report on the Library\u2019s IT management, we made a number of  recommendations to address the weaknesses we identified. These  included, among others, appointing a senior executive for IT (i.e., a CIO)  who has responsibility for commodity IT throughout the Library and  clarifying the relationship between that official and IT leadership at the  service unit level; fully establishing and implementing a Library-wide  approach to service-level agreements; and conducting a review of the  Library\u2019s IT portfolio to identify potential areas of duplicative activities and  spending."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "The Copyright Office Has Yet to Develop Plans for Improving Its IT Environment", "paragraphs": ["Although the Copyright Office has acknowledged many of the reported  organizational and technical challenges we have identified previously, the  office has not yet developed plans to improve its IT environment.

Importantly, we have also reported that  high-performing organizations manage investments in a portfolio  approach through an investment review board. In this way, selection  decisions can be made in the context of all other investments, thus  minimizing duplication across investments.", "Consistent with these best practices, the Library has an established policy  and process for service units to propose IT investments for selection  through the Library\u2019s IT Steering Committee, which acts as the agency\u2019s  investment review board. Specifically, before an investment is selected  for funding, service units are to prepare (1) an investment proposal, which  includes identifying the business problem, a proposed solution, the  expected benefits, how the solution aligns with the Library\u2019s strategic  plan, initial 3-year cost estimate, and expected funding sources, and (2)  an investment charter, which includes a budget plan and a cost-benefit  analysis. The service units are also required to present this information to  the Library\u2019s IT Steering Committee, which makes recommendations for  investments to be selected for funding.

In addition, in the  absence of critical information such as specific needs, costs, and  benefits, it is unclear whether the office\u2019s request to allocate about $7  million to these IT-related investments constitutes an effective and  efficient use of Copyright Office and Library resources. Further, because  the investments have not been reviewed by the Library\u2019s IT investment  review board and compared to the entire portfolio of IT systems, there is a  risk that they may duplicate existing efforts within the agency.

Even with all of the identified challenges, however, the office is  adding significant new functionality onto this already-burdened system, by  transferring legacy system functionality onto it. Significant IT management  weaknesses of the Library exacerbate the technical issues, making it  difficult for the Library and the Copyright Office to address the technical  challenges.

Importantly, although the office has requested over $7 million  for its proposed IT initiatives, it has not yet fully articulated its business  needs or expected costs and benefits for these initiatives. Instead, the  office has been reacting to current needs\u2014such as retiring legacy  systems\u2014rather than developing clear plans for needed IT improvements  that take into account such inevitabilities. In addition, because the office  has not presented these investments to the Library\u2019s IT investment review  board, it is unclear whether these investments will overlap with activities  that are already performed by the Library\u2019s central IT office, and are thus  a wasteful use of taxpayer funds.
