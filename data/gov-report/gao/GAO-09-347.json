These programs--Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program--are administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). There have been reports of crowded conditions in emergency departments, often associated with adverse effects on patient quality of care. In 2003, GAO reported that most emergency departments in metropolitan areas experienced some degree of crowding (Hospital Emergency Departments: Crowded Conditions Vary among Hospitals and Communities, GAO-03-460). For example, two out of every three metropolitan hospitals reported going on ambulance diversion--asking ambulances to bypass their emergency departments and instead transport patients to other facilities. GAO was asked to examine information made available since 2003 on emergency department crowding. GAO examined three indicators of emergency department crowding--ambulance diversion, wait times, and patient boarding--and factors that contribute to crowding. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed national data; conducted a literature review of 197 articles; and interviewed officials from HHS and professional and research organizations, and individual subject-matter experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Emergency department crowding continues to occur in hospital emergency departments according to national data, articles we reviewed, and officials we interviewed. National data show that hospitals continue to divert ambulances, with about one-fourth of hospitals reporting going on diversion at least once in 2006. National data also indicate that wait times in the emergency department increased, and in some cases exceeded recommended time frames. For example, the average wait time to see a physician for emergent patients--those patients who should be seen in 1 to 14 minutes--was 37 minutes in 2006, more than twice as long as recommended for their level of urgency. Boarding of patients in the emergency department who are awaiting transfer to an inpatient bed or another facility continues to be reported as a problem in articles we reviewed and by officials we interviewed, but national data on the extent to which this occurs are limited. Moreover, some of the articles we reviewed discussed strategies to address crowding, but these strategies have not been assessed on a state or national level. Articles we reviewed and individual subject-matter experts we interviewed reported that a lack of access to inpatient beds continues to be the main factor contributing to emergency department crowding, although additional factors may contribute. One reason for a lack of access to inpatient beds is competition between hospital admissions from the emergency department and scheduled admissions--for example, for elective surgeries, which may be more profitable for the hospital. Additional factors may contribute to emergency department crowding, including patients' lack of access to primary care services or a shortage of available on-call specialists. In commenting on a draft of this report, HHS noted that the report demonstrates that emergency department wait times are continuing to increase and frequently exceed national standards. HHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, hospital emergency departments are a  major part of the nation\u2019s health care safety net.

Emergency department staff report being under increasing pressure, and  concerns have been raised that they face challenges in providing timely  and effective emergency medical care. For example, considerable  attention has been given to reports of ambulance diversion\u2014that is,  emergency departments requesting that ambulances that would normally  bring patients to their hospitals go instead to other hospitals that are  presumably less crowded. Concerns have also been raised about the  frequency of patients remaining in the emergency department\u2014taking up  staff and resources\u2014after the decision has been made to admit them to  the hospital or transfer them to another facility, a practice known as  boarding. In addition, reports of long wait times in emergency  departments have led to concerns of potential adverse effects on the  quality of care for patients, such as prolonged pain and suffering.", "We have reported on the extent of crowding in emergency departments  and factors contributing to crowding. In 2003, we reported results from  our survey of more than 2,000 hospitals with emergency departments  located in metropolitan areas of the country and from our site visits to  communities where media and other sources had reported problems with  emergency department crowding. Using three indicators of crowding\u2014 diversion, patients leaving the emergency department before a medical  evaluation (presumably due to long wait times in the emergency  department), and boarding\u2014we found that while most emergency  departments across the country experienced some degree of crowding,  crowding was much more pronounced in some hospitals and areas than in  others. Generally, hospitals that reported the most problems with  emergency department crowding were in metropolitan areas with  populations of 2.5 million or more. We also found that crowding is a  complex issue and that one key factor contributing to crowding at many  hospitals was the inability of hospitals to move admitted patients out of  emergency departments and into inpatient beds. Reasons given for why  hospitals did not have the capacity to meet demand for inpatient beds  from emergency department patients included financial pressures leading  to limited hospital capacity and competition between admissions from the  emergency department and scheduled admissions, such as for elective  surgery. Finally, we reported on strategies that were implemented to  address emergency department crowding in the six communities that we  visited; however, we found that studies assessing the effect of these efforts  were limited.", "Since our 2003 report, Congress and others have raised concerns that  hospital emergency departments are continuing to experience crowded  conditions that could potentially compromise the nation\u2019s ability to  provide effective emergency medical care. For example, in September  2003 the Institute of Medicine (IOM) convened a committee to examine,  among other things, emergency department crowding. In addition, in June  2007 the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a  hearing at which experts in hospital emergency care testified on the state  of the nation\u2019s emergency care. Given this continued interest, you asked to  us to report on information made available with respect to emergency  department crowding since we issued our 2003 report. Specifically, this  report examines information made available about (1) three indicators of  emergency department crowding\u2014ambulance diversion, wait times, and  patient boarding, and (2) factors that contribute to emergency department  crowding.", "To conduct this work, we reviewed national data, conducted a literature  review, and interviewed federal and other officials. First, we obtained and  reviewed national data on emergency department diversion and wait times  for 2001 through 2006 from the National Center for Health Statistics  (NCHS) and data on hospital admissions\u2014which were related to factors  of crowding\u2014from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality  (AHRQ). We obtained nationally-representative data from NCHS and  AHRQ beginning with 2001 because these data became publicly available  in 2003 or later, meeting the criterion for inclusion in our analysis. At the  time we conducted our analysis, the most recent year for which data were  available from NCHS and AHRQ was 2006. In addition, some data from  NCHS were not available for all years between 2001 and 2006 because of  revisions made by NCHS to questions on surveys used to collect  information or a low response rate to certain questions on these surveys.  As part of our review of available national data on emergency department  diversion and wait times, we analyzed wait times in the emergency  department using NCHS\u2019s data on recommended time for a patient to see a  physician based on patient acuity levels. We also reviewed national data  on emergency department utilization to set up a context for our work. In  this report, we present NCHS estimates; for those cases in which we  report an increase or other comparison of these estimates, NCHS tested  the differences and found them statistically significant. To assess the  reliability of national data from NCHS and AHRQ, we discussed the data  with agency officials and reviewed the methods they used for collecting  and reporting these data. We resolved discrepancies we found between the  data provided to us and data in published reports by corresponding with  officials from NCHS to obtain sufficient explanations for the differences.  Based on these steps, we determined that these data were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes.", "We also conducted a literature review of 197 articles, including articles  published in peer-reviewed and other periodicals, publications from  professional and research organizations, and reports issued by federal and  state agencies. In examining the information made available since 2003  about indicators of crowding during our literature review, we analyzed  articles for what was reported on the effect of crowding on patient quality  of care and on proposed strategies to address crowding. We reviewed 197  articles, publications, and reports (which we call articles) on emergency  department crowding published on or between January 1, 2003, and  August 31, 2008. These included articles reporting on results of surveys  conducted by the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and  the American Hospital Association that provided information on  ambulance diversion that was not available from NCHS. A complete  bibliography for the literature review can be viewed at GAO-09-348SP.", "Finally, we interviewed officials from federal agencies and one state  agency, professional and research organizations, other hospital-related  organizations, and individual subject-matter experts to obtain and review  information on indicators of emergency department crowding and factors  that contribute to crowding. We interviewed federal officials from HHS\u2019s  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Office of the Assistant  Secretary for Preparedness and Response, and officials from NCHS and  AHRQ who have conducted research on emergency department utilization  and crowding. We also interviewed officials from professional and  research organizations, including ACEP, the American Hospital  Association, the American Medical Association, the Center for Studying  Health System Change, and the Society for Academic Emergency  Medicine. Some of the officials from ACEP and the Society for Academic  Emergency Medicine whom we interviewed have also published research  in peer-reviewed journals. Additionally, we interviewed hospital-related  organizations, including those involved in hospital accreditation and in  developing quality measures for hospital emergency department care, and  officials from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.

We reported that  crowding was more evident in certain types of hospitals, such as in  hospitals with higher numbers of staffed beds, teaching hospitals, public  hospitals, and hospitals designated as certified trauma centers.", "In terms of factors that contribute to crowding, we reported that crowding  is a complex issue and no single factor tends to explain why crowding  occurs. However, we found that one key factor contributing to crowding  was the availability of inpatient beds for patients admitted to the hospital  from the emergency department. Reasons given by hospital officials and  researchers we interviewed for not always having enough inpatient beds  to meet demand from emergency patients included economic factors that  influence hospitals\u2019 capability to meet periodic spikes in demand and  emergency department admissions competing with other admissions for  inpatient beds. Other additional factors cited by researchers and hospital  officials as contributing to crowding included the lack of availability of  physicians and other community services\u2014such as psychiatric services\u2014 and the fact that emergency patients are older, have more complex  conditions, and have more treatment and tests provided in the emergency  department than in prior years.", "Further, we reported that hospitals and communities had conducted a  wide range of activities to manage crowding in emergency departments,  but that problems with crowding persisted in spite of these efforts. These  activities included efforts to expand capacity and increase efficiency in  hospitals, and community activities to implement systems and rules to  manage diversion. These efforts were unable to reverse crowding trends at  hospital emergency departments, and we found that studies assessing the  effect of these efforts were limited."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Indicators of Emergency Department Crowding", "paragraphs": ["Researchers use the indicators we reported on in 2003 to point to  situations in which crowding is likely occurring in emergency  departments. These indicators can point to when crowding is likely  occurring but they also have limitations. For example, patients boarding in  the emergency department can indicate that the department\u2019s capacity to  treat additional patients is diminished, but it is possible for several  patients to be boarding while the emergency department has available  treatment spaces to see additional patients. Table 2 provides the definition  of the three indicators of emergency department crowding we reviewed in  this report\u2014diversion, wait times, and boarding\u2014and lists the usefulness  and limitations of using these indicators to gauge crowding. Regarding  wait times, in our 2003 report, we used \u201cleft before a medical evaluation\u201d  as an indicator of crowding related to long wait times in an emergency  department. Since we issued our report in 2003, researchers have used  intervals of wait times\u2014including the length of time to see a physician and  the total length of time a patient is in the emergency department\u2014to  indicate when an emergency department is crowded. As a result, for this  report, we examined wait times more broadly, including data on the time  for patients to see a physician, length of stay in the emergency department,  and visits in which the patient left before a medical evaluation.", "Researchers have developed a conceptual model to analyze the factors  that contribute to emergency department crowding and develop potential  solutions. This model partitions emergency department crowding into  three interdependent components: input, throughput, and output.  Although factors in many different parts of the health care system may  contribute to emergency department crowding, the model focuses on  crowding from the perspective of the emergency department.

The three indicators of emergency  department crowding\u2014diversion, wait times, and boarding\u2014are most  directly related to the input, throughput, and output components,  respectively, of the model; but the causes of these indicators can relate to  other components. For example, a hospital emergency department might  experience long wait times\u2014an indicator associated with the throughput  component\u2014because of delays in patients receiving laboratory results  (related to throughput) or because staff are busy caring for patients  boarding in the emergency department due to a lack of access to inpatient  beds (related to output).

This reason was reported by 9 articles we reviewed and by  officials from ACEP, the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, the  Center for Studying Health System Change, and three individual subject- matter experts whom we interviewed. In 2006, IOM reported that hospitals  might prefer scheduled admissions over admissions from the emergency  department because emergency department admissions are considered to  be less profitable. One reason that admissions from the emergency  department are considered to be less profitable is because these  admissions tend to be for medical conditions, such as heart failure and  pneumonia, rather than surgical procedures, such as joint replacement  surgeries and scheduled cardiovascular procedures. Available data from  AHRQ\u2019s 2006 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project show all 20 of the  most-prevalent diagnosis-related groups (DRG) associated with  admissions from the emergency department in 2006 were for medical  conditions rather than surgical procedures. In contrast, 7 of the 20 most- prevalent DRGs for nonemergency department admissions in 2006 were  for surgical conditions.

When patients do not have a primary care physician, or cannot  obtain an appointment with a primary care physician, they may go to the  emergency department to seek primary care services. In addition, patients  who do not have access to primary care may defer care until their  condition has worsened, potentially increasing the emergency department  resources needed to treat the patient\u2019s condition. These situations involve  patients that could have been treated outside of the emergency  department and may add to the number of patients seeking care at the  emergency department.", "Articles we reviewed provided conflicting information on the effect of  increasing numbers of uninsured patients on emergency department  crowding. Five of the 22 articles that mentioned a lack of access to  primary care as a factor also reported that increasing numbers of  uninsured patients also contributed to emergency department crowding.  For example, 1 article indicated that a reason for longer wait times at 30  California hospitals in lower-income areas was that these hospitals treat a  disproportionate number of uninsured patients who may lack access to  primary care. Two other articles we reviewed, however, suggested that  increasing numbers of uninsured patients is not a factor contributing to  crowding. For example, the Center for Studying Health System Change  reported that contrary to the popular belief that uninsured people are the  major cause of increased emergency department use, insured Americans  accounted for most of the 16 percent increase in visits between 1996  through 1997 and 2000 through 2001. In addition, officials from AHRQ  noted that a larger proportion of patients using the emergency department  are insured than uninsured."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Shortage of Available On-Call Specialists", "paragraphs": ["Seven articles and officials from the Center for Studying Health System  Change, ACEP, the American Hospital Association, and the American  Medical Association whom we interviewed reported that a shortage of on- call specialists available to emergency departments is a factor that  contributes to emergency department crowding. Hospitals often employ  on-call specialists, meaning specialists such as neurosurgeons or  orthopedic surgeons who only travel to the hospital or emergency  department when needed and called. When patients wait for long periods  in the emergency department for an on-call specialist who is not  immediately available\u2014for example, busy covering other hospitals or in  surgery\u2014these patients might not receive timely and appropriate care. In  addition, these patients may utilize treatment spaces and resources that  could be used to treat other patients, potentially crowding the emergency  department.", "In 2006 IOM reported that over the preceding several years, hospitals had  found it increasingly difficult to secure specialists for their emergency  department patients. Additionally, another article reported the results of  a 2007 American Hospital Association survey of hospital chief executive  officers that asked about maintaining on-call specialist coverage for the  emergency department. While this survey had a low response rate, it  indicates that hundreds of emergency departments reported experiencing  difficulty in maintaining on-call coverage for certain specialists. For  example, of those chief executive officers that responded to the survey  (840 chief executive officers; 17 percent of those surveyed), 44 and   43 percent noted difficulty in maintaining emergency department on-call  coverage for orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons, respectively.  Additionally, officials from the Center for Studying Health System Change  told us that delays in obtaining specialty services may contribute to  crowding. None of the articles we reviewed, nor officials or individual  subject-matter experts we interviewed, quantitatively assessed the  relationship between the availability of on-call specialists and emergency  department crowding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Difficulties in Transferring, Admitting, or Discharging Psychiatric Patients", "paragraphs": ["Three articles we reviewed and officials from NCHS, ACEP, and the  Center for Studying Health System Change whom we interviewed reported  difficulties transferring, admitting, or discharging psychiatric patients from  the emergency department as a factor contributing to emergency  department crowding. One of these articles reported the results of a  national ACEP survey of emergency physicians that asked about  psychiatric patients in the emergency department. Of the physicians  responding to the survey (328 physicians; approximately 23 percent of  those surveyed), about 40 percent reported that, on average, psychiatric  patients waited in the emergency department for an inpatient bed longer  than 8 hours after the decision to admit them had been made, including  about 9 percent who reported that psychiatric patients waited more than  24 hours. Medical patients in the emergency department\u2014those diagnosed  with nonpsychiatric conditions\u2014generally waited less time for an  inpatient bed: 7 percent of responding physicians reported that, on  average, medical patients waited longer than 8 hours after the decision to  admit them had been made; slightly less than 1 percent reported that the  medical patients waited more than 24 hours. In addition, the survey  respondents indicated psychiatric patients waiting to be transferred or  discharged added to the burden of an already crowded emergency  department and affected access for all patients requiring care. Also,  officials from NCHS said that psychiatric patients in the emergency  department are a national concern because they are frequent visitors to  the emergency department and they may spend more than 24 hours in an  emergency department.", "National data from NCHS show that, in 2006, psychiatric patients  constituted a small percentage of emergency department visits but had a  longer average length of stay in the emergency department. Almost   3 percent of emergency department visits in 2006 were by patients  presenting with a complaint of a psychological or mental disorder and  these patients had an average length of stay in the emergency department  that was longer than the average length of stay for all other visits   (397 minutes, compared to 194 minutes for all other visits). Emergency  department patients with psychiatric disorders may need to be isolated  from other patients and may require resources that are not available in  many hospitals. Hospital emergency departments often have limited or no  specialized psychiatric facilities and emergency department staff may  experience difficulties transferring such patients to other facilities,  admitting them to the hospital, or discharging them from the emergency  department. Additionally, emergency department staff may spend a  disproportionate amount of time and resources caring for psychiatric  patients while these patients wait for transfer, admission, or discharge."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Possible Factors That Contribute to Crowding", "paragraphs": ["Our literature review identified five other factors that may contribute to  emergency department crowding.

We  analyzed available NCHS data for 2001 through 2006 on diversion and  wait times to determine what changes, if any, have occurred over time.  We analyzed wait time data by patient acuity level and hospital  characteristics, such as hospital ownership, metropolitan or  nonmetropolitan area location, and geographic region. We analyzed wait  times in the emergency department using NCHS\u2019s data on recommended  time for a patient to see a physician based on patient acuity levels.  Further, to determine the average length of stay in the emergency  department for patients who presented with a psychological or mental  disorder, we analyzed emergency department length of stay by the type of  patient complaint at time of the visit. We also analyzed NCHS data on  emergency department utilization by payer source, including Medicare,  Medicaid, and the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, self pay, no  charge or charity care; and by hospital characteristics, such as whether the  hospital was located in a metropolitan or nonmetroplitan area, to provide  context for our work. We also reviewed and analyzed data from the  Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality\u2019s (AHRQ) Healthcare Cost  and Utilization Project to determine the diagnosis-related groups (DRG)  most commonly associated with hospital admissions from the emergency  department and most commonly associated with non-emergency  department admissions\u2014information we determined was related to  factors that contribute to crowding. We obtained NCHS and AHRQ data  beginning with 2001 because these data became publicly available in 2003  or later, meeting the criterion for inclusion in our analysis. Some data  were not available from NCHS for all years between 2001 and 2006  because of revisions made by NCHS to questions on surveys used to  collect information and because of low response rates to certain questions  on these surveys. At the time we conducted our analysis, the most recent  year for which data were available from NCHS and AHRQ was 2006. In this  report, we present NCHS estimates; for those cases in which we report an  increase or other comparison of these estimates, NCHS tested the  differences and found them statistically significant. To assess the  reliability of national data from NCHS and AHRQ, we interviewed agency  officials and reviewed the methods they used for collecting and reporting  these data. We resolved discrepancies we found between the data  provided to us and data in published reports by corresponding with  officials from NCHS to obtain sufficient explanations for the differences.  Based on these steps, we determined that these data were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes.", "To examine information available since 2003 about three indicators of  emergency department crowding and the factors that contribute to  crowding, we conducted a literature review. In examining information  made available since 2003 about indicators and factors of crowding during  our literature review, we analyzed articles for what was reported on the  effect of crowding on patient quality of care and proposed strategies to  address crowding. We conducted a structured search of 16 databases that  included peer-reviewed journal articles and other periodicals to capture  articles published on or between January 1, 2003, and August 31, 2008.

For these articles, we identified the number of respondents and response  rates, and for those with lower response rates, we noted them in our  report. From all of these sources, we identified over 300 articles,  publications and reports (which we call articles) published from   January 1, 2003, through August 31, 2008. Within the more than 300  articles, we excluded articles that were published outside of the United  States, reported on subjects or data from outside the United States, were  only available in an abstract form, had a focus other than day-to-day  emergency department operations, or were unrelated to emergency  department crowding.
