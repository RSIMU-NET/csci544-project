In April 2016, USAID and State repurposed $215 million for Zika from funds appropriated for Ebola. Subsequently, the Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act, 2016, provided over $175 million in supplemental funding to USAID and State to support Zika response efforts overseas.

USAID obligated 95 percent of the total funding. USAID and State provided some country information to Congress but did not provide, or take steps to track, funding on a country basis. According to USAID officials, tracking funding information by country would be helpful in the future. The ability to compile funding by country when responding to future infectious disease outbreaks would enable USAID to provide additional information to key decision makers to better support spending oversight and inform budgetary and planning decisions.", "In response to the Zika outbreak, USAID and State supported a broad range of activities overseas, including mosquito control, research efforts, and medical evacuations. In one activity, USAID implementing partners monitored mosquito populations; in another, they researched methods to reduce Zika virus transmission rates. USAID implementing partners reported various outputs from selected activities. For example, an implementing partner reported that its awareness campaign on Zika prevention reached more than 5 million people.", "USAID faced sustainability and timeliness challenges in implementing its Zika response. According to agency and other officials, one-time funding and a short time frame posed a challenge related to sustainability of Zika response activities. In response, USAID worked to align activities with those of host governments and other organizations so they could continue in the long term. However, USAID's emergency response planning did not fully address the challenge of timely implementation of response activities in countries without bilateral USAID health programs. Twenty-two of 26 countries with Zika response activities did not have bilateral USAID health programs when the Zika outbreak began. As a result, response activities took additional time to deploy in some countries where USAID first had to establish relationships with key host country officials. Although USAID developed an infectious disease response plan in 2018, the plan does not provide guidance on how to address the timely implementation challenge in countries without bilateral health programs. By improving its planning, such as by adding such guidance in its 2018 plan, USAID would be better positioned to respond quickly to future disease outbreaks."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["USAID should (1) take steps to ensure it is able to compile funding information by country for future infectious disease emergency responses and (2) take steps to improve its infectious disease response planning.

While USAID did not intend to  continue U.S. Zika response activities after the one-time emergency  funding, sustainability was a consideration and posed a challenge due to  the short implementation time frame, according to agency and  implementing partner officials. One official further elaborated that Zika  funding efforts occurred during the acute phase of the outbreak, which  made it difficult to focus on long-term needs. For example, an  implementing partner said that Zika-affected children require long-term  care that host country governments may not be able to support after U.S.  assistance ends. In addition, host country government officials, U.S.  government officials, and implementing partners said that some Zika  activities may not be sustainable after U.S. assistance is finished due to a  lack of funds and limited capacity to continue the work.", "To address this challenge and support the long-term continuation of Zika  response activities, implementing partners aligned their activities with  those of host country governments and other organizations. Implementing  partners reported working with governments and other organizations to  incorporate Zika activities into their plans and practices so they could  continue over the long term. One implementing partner and the  Dominican Republic\u2019s Ministry of Health, for example, planned mosquito  control efforts together, and a Ministry of Health official said they intend to  continue those control efforts after the end of Zika funding. Implementing  partners in various countries also stated that Zika activities brought  broader benefits to mosquito control, disability services, maternal health  care, surveillance efforts, and emergency preparedness, which facilitated  partners\u2019 efforts to align their Zika response activities. For example, an  implementing partner reported using Zika funding to develop  organizational guidelines for treating Zika-affected children, which will be  used by the health care system in Dominican Republic to treat children  with related disabilities in the long term. According to some implementing  partners in countries we visited, they developed Zika protocols and  guidelines in response to new scientific information, trained government  and other personnel on the protocols, and worked with officials of host  country governments and other organizations to encourage adoption of  Zika activities. For example, according to an agency official, an  implementing partner in Peru developed a curriculum for epidemiologists  and trained them on how to detect and contain mosquito-borne diseases,  such as Zika. The agency official said that the implementing partner  shared the training curriculum and materials with Peru\u2019s Ministry of Health  so it could continue the trainings after the end of Zika funding.", "According to implementing partners, they also involved local communities  in activities to increase community ownership and address sustainability.  For example, an implementing partner official said they trained a cadre of  community volunteers in Guatemala and El Salvador on behavior change  practices so that they can continue activities after the end of Zika funding.  In addition, implementing partner officials said that engaging with  communities to learn about needs and resources is important to  continued community interest in activities. For example, an implementing  partner that works with communities on health priorities developed an  approach that includes a toolkit for identifying a community\u2019s specific risks  for Zika and the efforts best suited to helping the community eradicate  mosquito breeding sites. In places affected by violence, some  implementing partners engaged with communities to better understand  how to prioritize community worker and volunteer safety to enable the  continuation of activities. For example, an implementing partner in  Guatemala engaged with local communities to understand areas they  recommended health workers avoid due to safety concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USAID Only Partially Mitigated the Challenge to Timely Implementation in Some Countries Where It Did Not Have Health Programs", "paragraphs": ["Agency and implementing partner officials described timely  implementation of activities in some countries without bilateral USAID  health programs as a second key challenge. Twenty-two out of the 26  countries where USAID implemented its Zika response activities were  countries without bilateral USAID health programs. USAID officials stated  that, as a result, there were no USAID health program officials present in  these countries to build on relationships with host country health officials  and help facilitate the start of implementing partners\u2019 activities during the  Zika response. USAID officials noted two reasons that working with host  country governments took time. First, some U.S. Zika response activities  started after a decline in Zika cases, when some host country  governments were no longer as focused on countering the disease.  Implementing partners responded to this situation by identifying related  health service improvements that could stem from implementing a Zika  response and were of interest to the host country governments. Second,  agency and implementing partner officials said that in some countries  without bilateral USAID health programs it also took time to identify the  appropriate points of contact and establish relationships\u2014preliminary  steps needed to obtain approval from the host country government before  activities could get underway. According to USAID officials, these  relationships are critical to navigating bureaucratic systems and assist in  designing activities that meet the needs of host country governments and  communities, which are needed for timely implementation.", "USAID took some steps to address the timely implementation challenge  in countries without bilateral health programs. For example, according to  USAID officials, USAID worked with multilateral partners that had a health  presence in those countries and relied on regional field-based Zika  coordinators to build relationships with in-country points of contact. As  noted above, however, agency officials indicated that Zika response  activities took additional time to deploy in some of the countries without  bilateral USAID health programs. Further, implementing partners reported  it took additional time to start up activities in those countries because of  the time it took to obtain approval for them from the ministries of health.  For example, one implementing partner reported that activity startup was  postponed for nearly 3 months until it received approval from the host  country government. Another implementing partner said it was a  challenge to get information on Zika from the host country government or  establish dialogue until USAID officials became involved. USAID officials  also said that efforts to start and integrate Zika response activities in  countries with ongoing USAID health programs did not face a number of  the obstacles to timely implementation experienced in countries without  bilateral USAID health programs.", "According to federal internal control standards, agencies should design  control activities, such as a plan, to achieve their objectives and address  related risks, such as the challenge related to timely implementation. In  an effort to enhance its planning for outbreaks, USAID developed an  infectious disease response plan in July 2018 during the time frame of our  review. However, the plan does not provide specific guidance on how to  address the challenge of initiating emergency response activities in  countries without bilateral USAID health programs, such as by noting  particular practices that implementing partners and other officials can use  to address that challenge. For example, our fieldwork and interviews with  USAID officials indicate that the following may be helpful practices for  infectious disease response:  Immediately establish an in-country working group that includes  implementing partners, host country government officials, and U.S.  government officials to help initiate and coordinate outbreak response.", "Communicate a current list of health ministry and other relevant  government officials to implementing partners and other officials so  they can quickly identify the appropriate points of contact.", "According to USAID officials, USAID missions maintain regular contact  with host country governments, maintain contact lists, and participate in  coordination meetings. However, in the case of overseas Zika response,  some implementing partner officials in the field told us that they did not  initially know who to contact in the host country government. Likewise, a  host country government official told us that a working group on Zika  outbreak response was not established until after officials recognized that  implementing partner and host country government officials did not have  regular channels of communication. By taking steps to improve planning  for countries without bilateral USAID health programs\u2014such as by adding  specific guidance for initiating emergency response activities in such  countries to its July 2018 plan\u2014USAID would be better positioned to  quickly build relationships with health ministry and other key government  officials in host countries and thus be better able to provide a timely  infectious disease response to future outbreaks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Zika virus quickly spread to dozens of countries in 2015 and 2016,  prompting WHO to declare the virus and associated health risks an  international public health emergency. As future infectious disease  outbreaks arise, Congress will be called on to fund overseas response  efforts, as it did with the Zika outbreak, and USAID is likely once again to  play a vital role in those efforts. Because USAID did not provide key  decision makers with information on how Zika funding was distributed  across the various countries where it conducted response activities,  decision makers lack visibility into a key aspect of the overall U.S. Zika  response overseas. The ability to compile this information by country  when responding to future infectious disease outbreaks would enable  USAID to provide key decision makers, including Congress and agency  officials, with additional information to better support spending oversight  and inform budgetary and planning decisions.", "Further, while USAID took steps to address the challenge of sustaining  Zika response activities over the long term, it did not fully mitigate the  challenge of timely implementation of activities in countries without  bilateral USAID health programs. As a result, the agency\u2019s response to  Zika took additional time in some countries without bilateral USAID health  programs.
