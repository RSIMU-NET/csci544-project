The forecasting of crises has been historically difficult for all forecasters. The Fund, with the World Bank, has made progress in implementing initiatives to prevent crises, but several challenges remain. To obtain better information about country financial sector weaknesses, the Fund and Bank introduced the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) to report on member countries' financial sectors and the Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) to assess member countries' adherence to 12 standards. Assessments have not been completed in some major emerging market countries primarily because participation is voluntary, and use of this information has been mixed. For example, some private sector market participants have found the reports untimely, outdated, and dense. The Fund is considering two approaches to restructuring unsustainable sovereign debt; however, there are significant challenges to implementing them. One approach involves creating an international legal framework that would allow a specified majority of a country's external creditors to restructure most private sector loans. Under the second approach, the Fund is encouraging members to include renegotiation clauses in individual bonds. Many private sector representatives wish to maintain the existing process in which the Fund assists resolution by providing loans to some eligible members. In response to concerns that its resources may have unintended negative impacts during a crisis, the Fund has clarified and strengthened its criteria for lending to members experiencing crises."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In May 2000, in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis, the newly  appointed Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF or  the Fund) announced his plans to strengthen the Fund\u2019s reform initiatives  to enable the Fund to more effectively safeguard the stability of the  international financial system. Building on reform initiatives instituted in  the mid-1990s, after the Mexican financial crisis of 1994\u201395, these new  initiatives were designed to better anticipate, prevent, and resolve  sovereign financial crises. A sovereign financial crisis can occur when a  country is unable or unwilling to honor its debt obligations and investors  lose confidence in that country\u2019s financial markets.

In response to the crisis, Mexico quickly adopted a  strong and ultimately successful program of adjustment and reform. To  support the program, the Fund approved a loan of $17.8 billion to Mexico\u2014 one of the largest loan commitments it had ever made to a country.  One of  the major reasons cited for the crisis was the lack of timely, reliable, and  publicly available economic, financial, and sociodemographic data for  Mexico. Beginning in 1996, to correct this weakness, the Fund created data  standards to guide countries in disseminating better data to the public.  However, as we reported in 1997, the Fund needed to address a number of  other financial, economic, and political challenges, in addition to data  limitations, to better anticipate, prevent, and resolve financial crises.", "Before the Fund could fully address these challenges, the Asian financial  crisis of 1997\u201398 occurred. After the Asian financial crisis, the Fund  assessed the effects of its responses to the crisis and reassessed its role in  safeguarding the stability of the international financial system, including  rethinking its core mission, operations, and lending activities. The Fund  also recognized that it needed to improve its ability to anticipate financial  crises; monitor countries\u2019 activities; and increase public awareness,  particularly that of the investment community. Recognizing its inability to  anticipate past crises, the Fund instituted a quarterly vulnerability  assessment framework in 2001 to identify countries that may be  susceptible to crisis.", "To improve its ability to prevent future crises, the Fund and the World Bank  in 1999 began performing joint assessments of member countries\u2019 financial  sectors to help identify and monitor existing and potential weaknesses.

These include standards to improve  transparency in government economic data; fiscal, monetary, and financial  policies; and guidelines on strengthening the financial and corporate  sectors.", "The Fund acknowledges that it would be almost impossible to anticipate or  prevent all crises. According to the Fund, past efforts to resolve financial  crises during the 1990s were lengthy and very costly to debtor countries.

Through the WEO,  the IMF provides current and following year forecasts for countries and  regions of key economic variables such as economic growth, inflation,  and current account. According to Fund staff, WEO forecasts use the  best available information and represent the most realistic estimate of  key economic variables, including those that could help anticipate a  financial crisis. The IMF uses these forecasts as an input in the  vulnerability assessment to gauge the impact of unanticipated adverse  changes in the global environment. For example, the WEO forecasts for  selected countries may be recalculated to examine the impact of sudden  increases in oil prices or an unanticipated recession in the advanced  economies.", "Early Warning System models:  The Fund uses internal and private  sector EWS models that compute the probability of a country having a  crisis over the following 12 to 24 months. The model examines a series  of vulnerability indicators, including whether a country\u2019s real exchange  rate is overvalued, or whether the country has significantly depleted its  foreign exchange reserves. The output of the EWS models helps the  Fund focus on specific areas of vulnerability. For example, if one  variable, such as the exchange rate, signals a crisis, the Fund would  more closely examine related components of the vulnerability  assessment, such as a country\u2019s external financing requirements.", "Country external financing requirements:  On a quarterly basis, the  Fund produces an internal assessment of a country\u2019s ability to meet its  total external debt obligations and estimates whether that country has  sufficient foreign exchange to avoid a crisis.

We found that the WEO had a poor record of  forecasting such declines in GDP, tending instead to follow existing  positive economic growth trends. In addition, the IMF indicates that the  current account is a key variable in explaining financial crises. We found  that for the current account, the accuracy of 75 percent of WEO country  forecasts was worse than simply assuming that next year\u2019s value is the  same as this year. The WEO\u2019s difficulty forecasting both GDP and current  account demonstrate poor performance in anticipating the severe financial  crises of the past decade.", "WEO Has Performed Poorly at Forecasting Recessions In most cases, countries experiencing a financial crisis also experience a  severe recession in which their GDP declines significantly. Although most  recessions do not involve a major financial crisis, successful anticipation of  recessions, especially the most severe ones, would greatly increase the  likelihood of anticipating impending financial crisis. However, we found  that the WEO has a poor track record of forecasting recessions, including  those directly associated with a financial crisis.", "The WEO did not forecast most of the recessions that occurred in emerging  market countries in the last 10 years. During the 1991\u20132001 forecast period,  134 recessions occurred in all 87 emerging market countries. We found that  the WEO correctly forecast only 15, or 11 percent, of those recessions,  while predicting an increase in GDP in the other 119 actual recessions. The  WEO is considerably more likely to forecast a recession when a recession  has occurred in the prior year. However, a prior year recession did not  occur in two-thirds of the recessions that the WEO failed to forecast. Thus,  WEO forecasts generally follow the existing growth trend within a country,  making it unlikely that the WEO would correctly forecast an unanticipated  recession. Furthermore, this tendency to follow the current growth trend  makes it especially difficult for the WEO to anticipate a financial crisis  because nearly all of the crisis-related recessions of the last decade  occurred in years following positive economic growth.", "Further illustrating our point, the WEO was unable to anticipate large  declines in GDP, also known as recessions, that corresponded to 14 major  financial crises of the past decade, including the Mexican and Asian  financial crises (see table 1).", "The WEO\u2019s failure to identify these recessions demonstrates that it did not  anticipate the corresponding financial crises. In 14 cases, we found that the  WEO forecast strong economic growth, averaging a 4.4 percent increase in  GDP, despite large declines in actual GDP in 13 of 14 cases. In fact, actual  GDP declined by an average of 5.7 percent during the first full year of these  14 financial crises. Indonesia presents the most startling disparity, in which  the WEO forecast a growth of 6.2 percent in its GDP, when in fact  Indonesia\u2019s GDP declined by almost 14 percent in the first full year of its  financial crisis.", "WEO Does a Poor Job in Forecasting the Current Account According to the Fund, a country\u2019s current account (primarily exports  minus imports of goods and services) is a key variable in anticipating  crises. Crises are associated with problems of external financing that result  from a country having difficulty obtaining foreign exchange. Since exports  are an important source of foreign exchange for developing countries,  projections of a country\u2019s current account balance provide information  about the country\u2019s ability to earn foreign exchange and to service its  external debt.  According to the Fund, an unsustainably large current  account deficit can contribute to or precipitate a crisis.", "We found that WEO forecasts for current account were inaccurate most of  the time. Our analysis for the 87 emerging market countries shows that, for  more than 75 percent of the countries, the WEO current account forecasts  were less accurate than if the Fund had simply assumed that the next year\u2019s  current account would be the same as this year\u2019s. The results are even more  dramatic for G-7 countries; a forecast of no change was a better predictor  than the WEO forecast for six of the seven countries. This demonstrates  that, even in stable economies with excellent data, the WEO has done a  poor job of forecasting this key crisis anticipation variable.

Forecasts  produced by private sector economic forecasters, governments, and  multinational agencies including the IMF and the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development, routinely fail to foresee the  coming of crises and recessions, and often fail to outperform the naive  model, which simply assumes that next year\u2019s outcome will be the same as  this year\u2019s. This is true even for evaluations of recent U.S. forecasts of GDP  and inflation. Our review of a number of forecast evaluation studies  confirms that the inability to predict recessions is a common feature of  growth forecasts for both industrialized and developing countries.

Some private sector participants find the  published reports untimely, outdated, and too dense to be useful in making  investment decisions.

Fund evaluations  acknowledge that the institution failed to collect information that could  have enabled it to detect financial and corporate sector vulnerabilities and  to provide appropriate policy advice to the affected countries before the  crises occurred.", "In response to this, in the late 1990s, the Fund and the Bank jointly  launched two initiatives to prevent the long-term likelihood of financial  crises. The first initiative, the Financial Sector Assessment Program  (FSAP), consists of in-depth assessments of key elements of member  countries\u2019 financial sectors. These elements include the structure of  financial markets, financial systems\u2019 response to changes in key variables  such as exchange rates, legal arrangements for crisis management, and the  quality of financial sector supervision. The second initiative, the Reports on  the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC), consists of assessments  of member countries\u2019 adherence to 12 standards related to transparency  in government policy making and operations, financial sector regulation,  and corporate sector practices (see appendix V).  Building on earlier  efforts to assess transparency, in 1999, the IMF and the Bank began  conducting joint assessments of observance of standards related to  financial sector regulation, covering areas such as banking supervision and  securities regulation. The Bank began performing assessments of  standards related to corporate sector practices, including private sector  accounting rules and corporate governance principles, in 2000. Some  transparency, financial sector, and corporate sector standards may be  assessed under the FSAP. Country participation in both initiatives is  voluntary. The Fund and the Bank initially considered making participation  in the ROSC assessments mandatory for member countries after  determining that the Fund\u2019s Articles of Agreement could allow such a  requirement.", "IMF or World Bank staff lead FSAP and ROSC assessment teams, with  participation by experts from national central banks and supervisory  agencies and standard-setting bodies such as the Basel Committee and the  International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). Before  undertaking an FSAP or ROSC, the Fund and the Bank work with country  governments to choose areas on which to focus. During the assessment  process, FSAP and ROSC teams conduct at least one in-country visit,  allowing team members to work with government officials from the finance  ministry, the central bank, and regulatory bodies to collect information for  the assessment. For example, an FSAP team in Russia analyzed financial  information for the largest banks and single largest corporation to  determine how changes in economic variables such as oil prices might  affect the banking system. The South Korean ROSC team interviewed  government officials at financial sector regulatory entities and private  sector representatives to determine how closely regulatory practices  conform to standards and to identify weaknesses that could put the  financial sector at risk.", "The two initiatives provide information to assist four parties that play a role  in crisis prevention: the Fund, the World Bank, member country  governments, and private sector investors. In-depth information on  member countries\u2019 financial sectors and adherence to standards of good  practice is intended to help the IMF and the Bank fulfill their missions.  Fund staff identify countries\u2019 vulnerabilities and develop appropriate  advice to redress them; Bank staff identify long-term financial sector  development needs and formulate relevant lending and nonlending  responses. Member countries can use these assessments to help prioritize  reform agendas and win domestic support for difficult policy decisions that  may make their financial sectors and institutions more resistant to crisis.  The Fund and the Bank often provide technical assistance to help  governments build capacity to implement reforms.

The assessments also provide  recommendations to address these issues. The findings and  recommendations inform the discussions of policy issues that Fund  officials have with member country authorities during Article IV  consultations. For example, when an FSAP was performed in Mexico,  Mexican authorities had begun replacing a system where the government  fully insured all bank deposits with one that covers deposits up to a certain  limit. The FSAP team was concerned because this reform was undertaken  before Mexico had developed a well-defined framework for closing  unprofitable banks. Without a clear framework for bank closures, the  introduction of limited deposit insurance could damage depositor  confidence in the banking system and precipitate a banking crisis.  According to Fund officials, the FSAP team and Mexican authorities  discussed the need to create such a framework, and a subsequent Article IV  mission reviewed the government\u2019s progress in this area. In Poland, an  FSAP team discovered that Polish households and small businesses had  high levels of debt held in foreign currency. The team was concerned that a  depreciation of Polish currency could raise the cost of these loans and  cause widespread repayment difficulties, which could in turn lead to a  banking crisis. FSAP team members raised this issue with Polish central  bank authorities and followed up again during the next Article IV  consultation. In both countries, government officials followed the Fund\u2019s  advice and implemented reforms.

Appendix VIII contains a record of  country participation in and publication of FSAP and ROSC assessments.  Fund and Bank staff encourage participation in FSAP and ROSC  assessments by countries whose economies have worldwide or regional  implications or have known vulnerabilities to a financial crisis, but officials  acknowledge that some governments have persistently resisted their  efforts. According to our analysis, between 1999 and 2003, 45 percent of  33 major emerging market countries participated in an FSAP.  However,  the Fund has not performed FSAPs in important countries such as China  and Thailand because their authorities have not agreed to participate.  These gaps in participation limit the Fund\u2019s ability to develop policy advice  based on in-depth knowledge of their financial sectors.", "According to the Fund, the Mexican and Asian financial crises were caused,  in part, by vulnerabilities in areas covered by the ROSCs.  Our analysis  found gaps in participation in assessments of several key standards that the  Fund identifies as contributing factors to past crises (see figure 3).  For  example, only one-third of major emerging market countries have  participated in assessments of their adherence to standards for  dissemination of economic and financial data. About half have participated  in the fiscal, monetary and financial policy formulation assessments and  the banking supervision assessment. In addition, Fund documents point to  limited progress in assessing adherence to the four World Bank-led  corporate sector standards (accounting, auditing, corporate governance,  and insolvency regimes), which play a key role in the effective operation of  domestic and international financial systems. Less than one-third of the 33  major emerging market countries have participated in one or more  assessments related to accounting and auditing.", "The Fund asserts that its delayed response in preventing or mitigating the  Mexican and Asian crises was partially caused by insufficient information  on these vulnerabilities. For example, according to the IMF, the Mexican  government\u2019s publicly available data was outdated and incomplete in 1993\u2013 94, which contributed to significant delays in responding to the country\u2019s  excessive indebtedness. The Fund also was unaware of some Asian  countries\u2019 unsound corporate accounting practices, which contributed to  the Asian financial crisis.

According to the Bank, country participation in corporate  sector assessments has been lower than in areas related to transparency  and financial sector regulation because the Bank has experienced delays in  finalizing standards and methodologies for evaluating the corporate sector.  For example, the methodologies for performing assessments of the  accounting and auditing standards were not finalized until October 2000.", "Bank officials acknowledge that even when assessments are available,  Bank staff do not always incorporate the issues raised as a key priority in  formulating its country development assistance programs.

The Lending into Arrears Policy increases the  likelihood that a country\u2019s private sector lenders would agree to reduce the  value of their loans because Fund resources reduce short-term fiscal  pressures experienced by the country while in default. A country is eligible  for Fund resources while in default if the Fund determines that the debt  burden is unsustainable, and the country is making satisfactory progress in  implementing reforms. Additionally, the country must have demonstrated a  good faith effort to reach a restructuring agreement with creditors to  restore its ability to repay its debt.
