Moreover, DOE\u2019s missions have changed focus over the years. For example, whereas DOE was once geared toward the production of nuclear weapons, it is now focused on restoring the environment at the facilities contaminated by that nuclear production.

Thirty-one of the major systems were terminated prior to completion.

The strategic plan also includes a functional section on corporate management that cuts across the four business lines. But DOE itself is not organized into four business lines. It has three large headquarters program offices, many smaller individual headquarters offices, operations and field offices, and a number of contractors that manage and operate DOE facilities across the country.", "Because the business lines in DOE\u2019s strategic plan are not aligned with the organizational structure, more than one DOE organization contributes to the same business line. For example, DOE\u2019s three main headquarters program offices are Defense Programs, Energy Research, and Environmental Management. Both the Office of Defense Programs and the Office of Environmental Management contribute to the environmental quality business line as do two smaller headquarters offices. Similarly, the Office of Defense Programs and five other headquarters offices contribute to the national security business line.", "The relationships among programs and business lines become more complicated when the field-level structure is considered. DOE\u2019s field structure includes 10 major operations and field offices and several area offices. Each of these offices may contribute to the business lines through various headquarters offices. For example, the Oak Ridge Operations Office performs work for each of the three main headquarters program offices as well as for other headquarters offices and, in doing so, performs work for all four business lines. Because Oak Ridge conducts its work through the contractors that manage its facilities, the performance of the work for the business lines is broken down further and accomplished at organizations below the operations office level.

After receiving feedback from the program and field levels on this draft, Environmental Management officials plan to develop a draft national plan by early 1998. Although the goals of the plan are not final, the basic direction is to (1) clean up as many DOE sites with environmental problems as possible by the year 2006, acknowledging that cleanup at some sites will not be completed by then; (2) reduce costs and increase productivity during the cleanup process; and (3) comply with all regulatory requirements.

Defense Program officials told us that this plan minimizes the need for subordinate strategic plans. However, the officials acknowledged that offices may still develop strategic or multiyear plans to provide more detail or direction, or to market or publicize specific programs and projects.

Although the Sandia National Laboratories had an institutional plan, it also had prepared a separate strategic plan. We found that the contractors at both Savannah River and Oak Ridge also prepared strategic plans for their own operations.
