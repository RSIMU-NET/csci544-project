For example, in 2007 the National Taxpayer  Advocate expressed concerns about how the loans were offered to  consumers and whether consumers adequately understood the product.  Consumer advocates questioned the high interest rates the loans could  carry, how loan fees reduced EITC benefits taxpayers received, and the  ramifications of borrower default. In a 2008 advance notice of proposed  rulemaking, IRS and the Department of the Treasury also shared concerns that refund anticipation loans offered tax preparers an incentive  to fraudulently inflate refund claims and to market the loans to taxpayers  who might not understand the full cost of the product.", "Banking regulators raised concerns as well. OCC and FDIC noted  consumer protection and safety and soundness risks to banks that  offered refund anticipation loans. FDIC encouraged consumers to have  tax refunds directly deposited into their own bank accounts and raised  concerns about other options that claimed to speed up a refund for a  sizable cost, according to FDIC officials. The Office of Thrift Supervision,  which had supervisory authority over federal thrifts at the time, ordered a  medium-sized thrift to cease making refund anticipation loans in 2010.  In part due to concerns expressed by OCC, national banks stopped  offering the loans by 2010 and FDIC-supervised banks stopped offering  them by 2012.", "An IRS decision also contributed to FDIC enforcement actions on refund  anticipation loans. Before 2011, IRS used a tool called the debt indicator  that acknowledged whether any of a taxpayer\u2019s refund could be used to  pay certain outstanding debts. IRS provided the debt indicator to tax  preparers at the time the taxpayer\u2019s return was filed electronically. Banks  used the debt indicator in their underwriting tools to help determine a  borrower\u2019s likelihood of loan repayment. FDIC determined that without the  debt indicator, a bank would have to develop and adopt a more robust  underwriting process to make these loans in a safe and sound manner.  According to FDIC, IRS\u2019s elimination of the debt indicator created a safety  and soundness concern because it removed a key data element used for  determining a borrower\u2019s ability to repay. Losing this information  increased the risk of loss for lenders and at that time helped inform  FDIC\u2019s consent orders with two banks under its supervision to stop  offering refund anticipation loans.

For example, in 2016, IRS data show  about 468,500 returns with a refund anticipation loan indicator and in  2017 the number appeared to spike to about 1.7 million. However, as  discussed earlier, the data for these two years may be misleading  because they likely conflate refund anticipation loans with refund  advances.

We  determined the data alone did not provide a reliable count of refund  transfers, refund anticipation loans, or refund advances in 2016, 2017,  and 2018, but were adequate to suggest general trends when  supplemented with other information. To supplement the IRS data, we  collected information from reports issued by the National Consumer Law  Center, reviewed Securities and Exchange Commission filings for two  selected tax preparers, and interviewed representatives from National  Consumer Law Center and both tax preparers on the offerings of tax-time  financial products.

We also discussed changes in the market and product offerings  with nine of the industry providers with whom we met. We accessed  provider websites before and during the 2018 tax season. The tax  preparation firms were selected because they are national tax preparation  chains, and the five banks were selected because they partnered with the  national tax preparation chains and major developers of tax preparation  software. In addition, we reviewed studies related to these products  published by GAO, federal agencies, four consumer advocacy and  research groups, and two academic researchers. We used these studies  primarily to corroborate findings from our data analysis.

We statistically controlled for various income, education, and  demographic factors. While the FDIC data contain a rich set of  demographic and economic variables, they include limited data on  characteristics specifically related to tax filing. To identify specific tax-filing  characteristics associated with product use, we also used a probability  sample of data from IRS from the 2014, 2015, and 2016 tax years to  calculate the percentages of taxpayers who used tax-time financial  products according to various tax-filing characteristics, including tax filing  status and tax filing method.

We selected the two states and Washington, D.C. to  ensure a mixture of state and local laws governing the products and  providers. From the two states and Washington, D.C., we selected one  metropolitan statistical area based on the concentration of product users  and the proximity to lower-income households.

Our  investigators posed as taxpayers seeking tax preparation services who  wanted to pay for the tax preparation fees with the expected refund or  obtain an advance based on their anticipated tax refund. They requested  available documents associated with tax preparation, refund advance and  refund transfer products, and different disbursement options and fees.  Because GAO investigators did not experience the tax preparation or the  product application process, we were not able to assess the timing of any  disclosures typically made after the tax return preparation process would  begin. In addition, we received some consumer-facing disclosures and  product agreements that were typically provided during the product  application process from two tax preparers and two banks.", "We also conducted a content analysis of websites of eight selected tax  preparers that offer tax-time financial products. The tax preparers were  selected as national providers of tax preparation services with an online  presence, and the results are not generalizeable to the retail tax  preparation industry.

Odds  ratios that are less than 1.00 indicate that households or heads of  households with those characteristics are less likely to use tax-time  financial products. For categorical variables, this increase or decrease in  the likelihood of product use is in comparison to an omitted category, or  reference group. For example, the odds ratio for households headed by  African Americans is statistically significant and 1.36. This implies that the  odds of tax-time financial product use for households headed by African  Americans are 1.36 times the odds of use for households headed by  whites, holding other factors constant. Put another way, households  headed by African Americans are about 36 percent more likely to use tax- time financial products than households headed by white individuals, if  other conditions remain constant.

Prepaid cards are often used to disburse funds  from a tax-time product. Based on our analysis of providers\u2019 promotional  content, in some cases a tax preparer will offer prepaid cards as the only  disbursement option. The cards generally carry additional fees for long- term use (such as monthly, withdrawal, reload, and inactivity fees).  Prepaid cards usually are reloadable and can be used to pay bills and  make retail purchases. IRS does not have guidelines for disclosing fees  for the long-term use of prepaid card. However, OCC requires that banks  disclose if a tax product may be used on a long-term basis and disclose  fees associated with extended use of the product.", "During our visits, seven of the nine tax preparers provided the option to  have the tax refund deposited on a prepaid card. However, only two of the seven preparers noted any potential fee information associated with  the short or long-term use of prepaid cards. These two preparers said that  there was no additional charge to have the taxpayer\u2019s refund deposited  on a prepaid card, and the other five did not explain whether any fees  would be charged for this transaction.", "Five of the seven preparers that offered a prepaid card explained that the  card could be used for transactions other than receiving the tax refund.  However, only two of the five disclosed any fee information associated  with long-term use of the card. Another two of the five preparers referred  our undercover agents to the issuer of the card for additional information.  The remaining preparer did not disclose that additional fees would apply  to long-term use of the card.", "Four of the eight tax preparation websites we reviewed disclosed partial  information about fees related to the disbursement of funds to the  taxpayer. Three of the eight websites only disclosed disbursement fee  information related to use of prepaid cards. We found fee information in  one of the eight websites only after doing a word search. Fees associated  with the long-term use of prepaid card fees were not disclosed by three of  the six preparers that offered this disbursement option. Two websites  disclosed partial fee information and only one disclosed all the fees and  terms associated with the long-term use of a prepaid card. Six of these  websites advised the taxpayer to see the terms and conditions of the  card, four included a link to the terms and conditions of the card, and two  did not include a link.", "Bank documents generally disclosed the fees associated with different  disbursement methods such as paper checks and prepaid cards;  however, fees related to the long-term use of prepaid cards were not  always disclosed.
