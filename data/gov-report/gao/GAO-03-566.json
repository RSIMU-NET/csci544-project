To monitor the project and coordinate the U.S. decision  on whether to finance the renovation, the department will undertake  diplomatic, federal financing and budgeting, and construction activities  that will require participation from numerous government officials and  organizations with the necessary expertise. A framework that describes the  task force\u2019s mission, program goals, and coordinating mechanisms will help  ensure that each organization has a clear understanding of its role,  responsibilities, and expectations. The development of this framework is  important because the task force\u2019s monitoring role is likely to continue  through the four remaining phases of the renovation project.", "Furthermore, with established mission and program goals, the department  could specify resource needs, including appropriate skills needed to  achieve a successful outcome of the project.

Some key questions and issues to be addressed  include the following:  If the United States offers to finance the renovation, how would it  structure a loan to the United Nations? What should be the loan\u2019s terms  and conditions? Would the United States provide a loan that fully funds  the renovation project? If there are cost increases during the renovation,  would the United States provide additional financing and, if so, under  what terms and conditions?", "Does the United Nations have internal controls in place to effectively  manage changes in costs, scope, and schedule throughout the design  and construction of the project?", "To what extent are U.N. officials coordinating the renovation design and  construction with that of the proposed new visitors center?", "What types of incentives will the United Nations include in its contracts  with design and construction firms to ensure that their work meets U.N.  expectations?", "Since the design phase provides the greatest opportunity to make  decisions that could minimize future building maintenance and  operating costs, to what extent are these future costs being considered  during the design phase?", "How will U.N. officials ensure that value-engineering principles\u2014a  formal technique used by contractors or independent teams to identify  methods of constructing projects more economically\u2014are applied  during the design and construction phases?", "The department\u2019s position on each of these issues and the level of  monitoring it will undertake will drive its resource and expertise needs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The United Nations has used a reasonable process thus far to develop its  renovation plans, but it is still early in the project and changes in the  schedule and cost estimates are to be expected.

If the  planned swing space is not available, the United Nations will have to  reconsider its renovation approach, potentially leading to delays in the  renovation process. The United States, however, has not yet taken a  position on whether or how to finance the renovation. In addition, careful  management and oversight of a project of this magnitude and complexity  will be necessary to minimize schedule and scope changes. The  renovation\u2019s completion, final cost, and quality could be adversely affected  if the United Nations does not provide adequate staff to manage the  renovation and establish careful controls to limit scope changes.

We did not assess the financial impact  to the federal government of the renovation if the United Nations sought  other financing options, or if the United Nations did not undertake the  renovation and repaired or replaced major building systems as they failed.  We reviewed the most current renovation cost estimates, the renovation  cash flow statement, the U.N.

We used the Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s Credit Subsidy Calculator to estimate the  interest and default subsidies for interest-subsidized loans under various  terms. In doing so, we made several key assumptions including the interest  rate, the U.S. disbursal of funds, and a repayment plan.

The building would be  used as swing space during the 4 years of the renovation. Afterwards, the  United Nations would relocate most of its New York City staff that  currently work in office space outside the Headquarters complex to the  swing space building.
