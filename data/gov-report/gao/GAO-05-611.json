A heavily armed paramilitary force equipped with such items as automatic weapons protects ESE sites. GAO was asked to examine (1) the extent to which ESE protective forces are meeting DOE's existing readiness requirements and (2) the actions DOE and ESE will need to take to successfully defend against the terrorist threat identified in the October 2004 design basis threat (DBT) by DOE's implementation deadline of October 2008."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Protective forces at the five ESE sites containing weapons-grade nuclear material generally meet existing key DOE readiness requirements. Specifically, GAO determined that ESE protective forces generally comply with DOE standards for firearms proficiency, physical fitness levels, and equipment standardization and that the five ESE sites had the required training programs, facilities, and equipment. However, GAO did find some weaknesses at ESE sites that could adversely affect the ability of ESE protective forces to defend their sites. For example, despite the importance of training exercises in which protective forces undergo simulated attacks by a group of mock terrorists (force-on-force exercises), DOE neither sets standards for individual protective force officers to participate in these exercises, nor does it require sites to track individual participation. In another example, GAO found that protective force officers at all five of the ESE sites reported problems with their radio communications systems. Specifically, according to 66 of the 105 protective force officers GAO interviewed, they did not always have dependable radio communications as required by the DOE Manual 473.2-2, Protective Force Program Manual. Security officials stated that improvements were under way. To successfully defend against the larger terrorist threat contained in the 2004 DBT by October 2008, DOE and ESE officials recognize that they will need to take several prompt and coordinated actions. These include transforming its current protective force into an \"elite force\"--modeled on U.S. Special Forces, developing and deploying new security technologies to reduce the risk to protective forces in case of an attack, consolidating and eliminating nuclear weapons material between and among ESE sites to reduce security costs, and creating a sound ESE management structure that has sufficient authority to ensure coordination across all ESE offices that have weapons-grade nuclear material. However, because these initiatives, particularly an elite force, are in early stages of development and will require significant commitment of resources and coordination across DOE and ESE, their completion by the 2008 October DBT implementation deadline is uncertain."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Energy (DOE) has long recognized that a successful  terrorist attack on a site containing the material used in nuclear weapons,  such as plutonium or highly enriched uranium, could have devastating  consequences for the site and its surrounding communities. The risks  associated with these materials, which in specified forms and quantities are  referred to as Category I special nuclear material, vary but include theft for  use in an illegal nuclear weapon; the creation of improvised nuclear  devices capable of producing a nuclear yield; and the creation of so-called  \u201cdirty bombs,\u201d in which conventional explosives are used to disperse  radioactive material.", "Because terrorist attacks could have such devastating consequences, an  effective safeguards and security program is essential. For many years, a  key component for DOE security programs has been the development of  the design basis threat (DBT), a classified document that identifies the  potential size and capabilities of adversary forces. DOE issued its current  DBT in October 2004 in response to recommendations in our April 2004  report, congressional criticism, and a new review of intelligence data. The  October 2004 DBT identifies a larger terrorist threat for DOE sites than had  previous DBTs. Consequently, DOE is not requiring full compliance until  October 2008 in order to allow its sites adequate time to implement  measures to defeat this larger terrorist threat. Private contractors, who  operate DOE\u2019s facilities, counter the terrorist threat contained in the DBT  with a multifaceted protective system. While specific measures vary from  site to site, a key universal component of DOE\u2019s protective system is a  heavily armed protective force equipped with such items as automatic  weapons, night vision equipment, body armor, and chemical protective  gear.", "The following two major organizations in DOE are responsible for securing  Category I special nuclear material:   The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a separately  organized agency within DOE, is responsible for the nation\u2019s nuclear  weapons programs and manages six sites that contain Category I special  nuclear material.", "DOE\u2019s Office of the Under Secretary for Energy, Science and  Environment (ESE) is responsible for DOE operations in areas such as  energy research, basic physical science research, and environmental  cleanup and manages five sites that collectively contain substantial  quantities of Category I special nuclear material.", "We reported on security at NNSA sites in May 2003 and April 2004. We  found that NNSA needed to improve the management of its safeguards and  security program and that while some action had been taken in response to  the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, additional action was needed to  ensure that DOE\u2019s sites were adequately prepared to defend themselves.  Since the attacks of September 11, DOE has focused on the security of its  NNSA sites more than it has on its ESE sites. Consequently, you asked us  to determine for the five ESE sites with Category I special nuclear material  (1) the extent to which ESE protective forces are meeting DOE\u2019s existing  readiness requirements and (2) what actions DOE and ESE will need to  take to successfully defend against the larger terrorist threat identified in  the October 2004 DBT by DOE\u2019s implementation deadline of October 2008.", "To determine the extent to which protective forces at ESE sites are meeting  existing DOE readiness requirements, we reviewed DOE policies and other  pertinent literature about the factors that affect the readiness of forces,  such as military forces, that are like those defending ESE sites. We  conducted structured interviews with 105 ESE protective force officers at  the five ESE sites that contain Category I special nuclear material. While  the responses from these interviews are not projectable to the entire  universe of ESE protective force officers, we did speak to about 10 percent  of the total protective forces at the five sites. Even though not projectable,  we randomly selected protective force officers to interview at each site in  order to help assure their independence from the views of site  management. We asked the officers questions designed to determine their  readiness to defend the sites, including questions about their morale,  training, and equipment. We also reviewed the training records of the 105  officers to determine if key elements of their training complied with  existing DOE training requirements. In particular, we reviewed selected  firearms and physical fitness qualifications to determine if these officers  complied with existing DOE requirements and regulations. Finally, we  reviewed the equipment used by ESE protective forces to determine if it  met current DOE requirements. Further details on our interview  procedures and random selection methods are found in the scope and  methodology appendix at the end of this report.", "To determine what actions DOE and ESE will need to take to successfully  defend against the new threat identified in the October 2004 DBT by DOE\u2019s  implementation deadline of October 2008, we reviewed the October  2004  DBT and associated guidance documents. We discussed the October 2004  DBT with officials in DOE\u2019s Office of Security and Safety Performance  Assurance and with officials in ESE\u2019s Offices of Environmental  Management; Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology; and Science.  Finally, where available, we reviewed documents prepared by ESE officials  on how they plan to comply with the October 2004 DBT. Appendix I  presents a detailed description of our scope and methodology. We  performed our work between March 2004 and July 2005 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Office of the Under Secretary for Energy, Science and Environment  comprises nine program offices, including the Offices of Environmental  Management; Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology; and Science and  accounts for about 57 percent of DOE\u2019s fiscal year 2006 budget request (see  fig. 1).", "ESE has five sites that collectively have substantial quantities of Category I  special nuclear material. (See table 1.) For fiscal year 2006, DOE requested  over $300 million for security at these five sites. This represents about 70%  of the entire security budget request for ESE. (See table 2.) Contractors  operate all of these sites.", "Within DOE\u2019s Office of Security and Safety Performance Assurance, DOE's  Office of Security develops and promulgates orders and policies to guide  the department's safeguards and security programs. DOE\u2019s overall security  policy is contained in DOE Order 470.1, Safeguards and Security Program,  which was originally approved in 1995. The key component of DOE's  approach to security is the DBT, a classified document that identifies the  characteristics of the potential threats to DOE assets. A classified  companion document, the Adversary Capabilities List, provides  additional information on terrorist capabilities and equipment. The DBT  has been traditionally based on a classified, multiagency intelligence  community assessment of potential terrorist threats, known as the  Postulated Threat. The threat from terrorist groups is generally the most  demanding threat contained in the DBT.", "DOE counters the terrorist threat specified in the DBT with a multifaceted  protective system. While specific measures vary from site to site, all  protective systems at DOE's most sensitive sites employ a defense-in-depth  concept that includes the following:  a variety of integrated alarms and sensors capable of detecting   physical barriers, such as fences and antivehicle obstacles;  numerous access control points, such as turnstiles, badge readers,  vehicle inspection stations, radiation detectors, and metal detectors;  operational security procedures, such as a \u201ctwo person\u201d rule that  prevents only one person from having access to special nuclear  material; and  hardened facilities and vaults.", "Each site also has a heavily armed protective force that is often equipped  with such items as automatic weapons, night vision equipment, body  armor, and chemical protective gear. These protective forces comprise  Security Police Officers that are classified into three groups: Security  Police Officer-I, Security Police Officer-II, and Security Police Officer-III.  Security Police Officer-Is are only assigned to fixed, armed posts.  Generally, very few of these officers are used at ESE sites because of the  limited roles they can fill. Security Police Officer-IIs generally are assigned  to posts such as access control booths, or to foot or vehicle patrols. Finally,  Security Police Officers-IIIs are responsible for operations such as hostage  rescue and the recapture and recovery of special nuclear material.  According to federal regulations, Security Police Officers-IIIs have more  demanding physical fitness and training standards than Security Police  Officers-Is or Security Police Officers-IIs. At the ESE sites we visited,  protective forces work for private contractors and are unionized. The  number of qualified Security Police Officers-IIs and Security Police  Officers-IIIs at ESE sites is shown in table 3.", "Protective force duties and requirements, such as physical fitness  standards, are explained in detail in DOE Manual 473.2-2, Protective Force  Program Manual, as well as in DOE regulations (10 C.F.R. pt. 1046,  Physical Protection of Security Interests). DOE issued the current  Protective Force Program Manual in June 2000. Although protective forces  are expected to comply with the duties and requirements established in  DOE policies, deviations from these policies are allowed as long as certain  approval and notification criteria are met. Following are the three types of  deviations:   Variances: Variances are approved conditions that technically vary from  DOE security requirements but afford equivalent levels of protection.", "Waivers: Waivers are approved nonstandard conditions that deviate  from DOE security requirements that, if uncompensated, would create a  potential security vulnerability. As such, waivers require implementation  of what DOE calls compensatory measures. Compensatory measures  could include deploying additional protective forces or curtailing  operations until the asset can be better protected.", "Exceptions: Exceptions are approved deviations from DOE security  requirements that create a safeguards and security vulnerability.  Exceptions are approved only when correction of the condition is not  feasible, and compensatory measures are inadequate.", "In addition to complying with these security requirements, DOE protective  systems, including protective forces, also must meet performance  standards. For example, DOE sites are required to demonstrate that their  protective systems are capable of defending special nuclear material  against terrorist forces identified in the DBT. The performance of  protective systems is formally and regularly examined through  vulnerability assessments. A vulnerability assessment is a systematic  evaluation process in which qualitative and quantitative techniques are  applied to detect vulnerabilities and arrive at effective protection of  specific assets, such as special nuclear material. To conduct such  assessments, DOE uses, among other things, subject matter experts, such  as U.S. Special Forces; computer modeling to simulate attacks; and  force-on-force exercises, in which the site's protective forces undergo  simulated attacks by a group of mock terrorists. In addition to their use in  evaluating the effectiveness of physical protection strategies, DOE believes  force-on-force exercises are the most realistic representation of adversary  attacks that can be used to train protective forces.", "Through a variety of complementary measures, DOE ensures that its  contractors are complying with DOE\u2019s safeguards and security policies,  including protective force duties and requirements, and that its systems are  performing as intended. Contractors perform regular self-assessments and  are encouraged to uncover any problems themselves. In addition to routine  oversight, DOE orders require field offices to comprehensively survey  contractors' operations for safeguards and security every year. DOE's  Office of Independent Oversight and Performance Assurance provides yet  another check through its comprehensive inspection program. This office  performs comprehensive inspections roughly every 18 months at each DOE  site that has specified quantities of Category I special nuclear material. All  deficiencies (findings) identified during surveys and inspections require the  contractors to take corrective action.", "Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, DOE security policies  have been under almost constant reexamination and have undergone  considerable change. For example, the department\u2019s security polices have  been undergoing a streamlining process for nearly 2 years. In addition, as  we pointed out in our April 2004 report, DOE worked for almost 2 years to  develop and issue a new DBT. When DOE issued its first post-September 11  DBT in May 2003, we recommended that DOE reexamine it because, among  other things, it contained a terrorist threat that was less than the threat  identified in the intelligence community\u2019s Postulated Threat. DOE agreed  to reexamine the 2003 DBT and issued a revised and more demanding DBT  in October 2004. The October 2004 DBT significantly increased the terrorist  threat to DOE facilities and required enhanced protection strategies for  DOE facilities. Under the new DBT, sites with Category I special nuclear  material will not have to be fully prepared to defend their sites against the  terrorist threat contained in the new 2004 DBT until October 2008. By July  29, 2005, DOE sites will have to forward 2004 DBT implementation plans to  the Deputy Secretary of Energy and, within 3 months, begin submitting  quarterly DBT implementation reports. At the time of our review, cost  estimates were still preliminary, but security officials at ESE sites said that  they may require collectively an additional $384-$584 million over the next  several years in order for all ESE sites with Category I special nuclear  material to meet the 2004 DBT."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Protective Forces at ESE Sites Generally Meet Established DOE Readiness Requirements, but Some Weaknesses in Protective Force Practices Exist", "paragraphs": ["We found that the majority of the 105 protective force members we  interviewed at ESE sites generally believe that they currently are ready to  perform their mission of protecting the site\u2019s special nuclear material.

This  view is shared by most protective force officers (74 out of 105) and their  contractor protective force managers who report that they are not at all  confident in their current ability to defeat the new threats contained in the  2004 DBT. In response, DOE has proposed the development of an \u201celite  force\u201d that would be patterned after the U. S. military\u2019s Special Forces.", "However, creating this elite force is a complex undertaking and will be a  challenge to fully realize by the October 2008 implementation deadline.", "Even before the issuance of the 2004 DBT, DOE had become concerned  about protective force preparedness because of intense demands placed on  protective forces following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The  need to increase security at DOE sites as rapidly as possible following the  2001 attacks meant that DOE protective forces worked extensive overtime.  DOE\u2019s Inspector General, DOE\u2019s Office of Security and Safety Performance  Assurance, and GAO reported on the potential for large amounts of  protective force overtime to increase fatigue, reduce readiness, and reduce  training opportunities for protective forces.", "In recognition of this situation, in September 2003, the Secretary of Energy  directed DOE\u2019s Office of Performance Assurance and Independent  Assessment, now a part of the Office Security and Safety Performance  Assurance, to conduct a special review to determine the effectiveness of  the management of protective forces and protective force capabilities. This  classified review, which was issued in June 2004 and covered five NNSA  sites and one ESE site, found that the current organization and tactics of  DOE protective forces need improvement to deal with possible terrorist  threats. Historically, DOE protective forces had been more concerned with  a broad range of industrial security and order-keeping functions than with  preparation to conduct a defensive battle against a paramilitary attacker, as  is described in the 2004 DBT. The June 2004 review recommended a shift to  an aggressive military-like, small-unit, tactical defense posture, which  included enhanced tactical training standards to allow protective forces to  move, shoot, and communicate effectively as a unit in a combat  environment. The review also recommended more frequent, realistic, and  rigorous force-on-force performance testing and training for the  department\u2019s protective forces.", "Based on this review, the Secretary of Energy proposed transforming  DOE\u2019s protective force that safeguards special nuclear material into an  \u201celite force\u201d with training and capabilities similar to the military\u2019s Special  Forces units. Subsequently, in June 2004, the Deputy Secretary of Energy  directed the formation of a Protective Forces Working Group to formally  review missions, standards, and current protective force status as the basis  for developing recommendations on policy, training, and equipment that, if  enacted, could serve as the basis for creating an elite force. This working  group consisted of representatives from DOE\u2019s Office of Security and  Safety Performance Assurance, NNSA, and ESE\u2019s Office of Environmental  Management. In August 2004, the working group recommended a set of  near-term actions that could be used to elevate protective force  capabilities. These included instituting more demanding medical and  physical fitness standards, increasing tactical training, and reorganizing  protective forces into tactically cohesive units. In October 2004, the  working group also recommended considering federalizing DOE protective  forces as a long-term option. In January 2005, the Deputy Secretary of  Energy endorsed the report\u2019s findings and directed that implementation  actions begin.", "Most protective force officers we interviewed generally support some of  the ideas embodied in the elite force concept. Specifically, most protective  force officers (74 out of 105) at the ESE sites we visited reported that they  are not at all confident in their current ability to defeat the new threats  contained in the 2004 DBT. In particular, some protective force officers  believed that they would be outgunned and overwhelmed by the terrorist  force identified in the 2004 DBT. In addition, some feared they could be  surprised by a large terrorist force because of the sites\u2019 security strategy  and the physical layout of their sites. Some sites are already responding to  the elite force concept by increasing tactical training, and others plan to  institute \u201ctraining relief shifts,\u201d which will increase the amount of time  protective force officers have available for uninterrupted training. Some  sites also have ambitious plans for constructing new facilities to enable  increased tactical training.", "Nevertheless, despite broad support and some sites\u2019 progress, DOE\u2019s  proposal for an elite force remains largely in the conceptual phase. DOE  has developed a preliminary draft implementation plan that lays out  high-level milestones and key activities, but this plan has not been formally  approved by the Office of Security and Safety Performance Assurance. The  draft implementation plan recognizes that DOE will have to undertake and  complete a number of complex tasks in order to develop the elite force  envisioned. For example, DOE will have to revise its existing protective  forces policies to incorporate, among other things, the increased training  standards that are needed to create an elite force. This may be a  time-consuming effort.", "As we reported in April 2004, the DOE policy process emphasizes  developing consensus through a laborious review and comment process by  program offices. We found that this policy process contributed to the  nearly 2 years it took the department to develop DOE\u2019s first  post-September 11, 2001, DBT. Likewise, DOE has been working on a  streamlined overall security policy for nearly 2 years. Once this streamlined  policy is formally issued, now scheduled for summer 2005, DOE\u2019s draft  implementation plans for an elite force call for the new policy to  immediately undergo revision to incorporate elements of the elite force  concept. DOE\u2019s Office of Security has not yet identified a time frame for  completing these actions. In addition, DOE officials believe that broader  DOE policies will have to be revised. For example, DOE security officials,  as well as contractor protective force managers, see some DOE health and  safety policies and practices as an impediment because they do not allow  the kind of realistic and physically demanding training that is required for  an elite force. According to these officials, revising these policies will  require broad, high-level support within DOE. Furthermore, some DOE  protective force requirements, such as medical, physical fitness, and  training standards are mandated by DOE regulations. Changing these  regulations, according to a DOE security official, would require DOE to  follow rule-making procedures. All these protective force policies and  regulations, as well as broader DOE policies are contained in collective  bargaining agreements between protective force unions and protective  force contractors and in protective force contracts, which also will need to  be modified to create the kind of elite force that DOE believes is necessary  to defeat the 2004 DBT.", "Some site security officials recognize that they will have to carefully craft  transition plans for currently employed protective force officers who may  not be able to meet the new standards required for an elite force. Some of  these officials have expressed concern about the ability of some protective  force officers to meet more rigorous physical and training standards that  are likely to be part of an elite force. DOE field security officials and  contractor protective force managers likewise have expressed concern  about finding ways for less capable protective force officers to move into  different roles or retire from service with a sense of dignity. Because all the  protective forces at the five ESE sites we visited operated, at the time,  under separate contracts and separate collective bargaining agreements,  there is no uniform benefit or retirement plan for protective forces, and  these benefits, according to one contractor security official, differ  considerably among sites. Some contractor protective force managers  recognized that they needed such mechanisms as early retirement  incentives and more attractive retirement packages to make the effective  transition to an elite force. They believed, however, that they would not be  able to provide these mechanisms, most of which are quite expensive,  without DOE\u2019s help. Officials from the one protective force contractor,  which had a placement and income protection program for protective force  officers who could no longer meet existing DOE requirements, said that  payouts from the program have far exceeded contributions and that the  program will have to be restructured in the near future.", "Given these complexities, DOE security officials recently told us that  implementing all the measures associated with the elite force concept will  take about 5 years to complete. With this time line, the development of the  elite force will be under way by the new DBT\u2019s implementation deadline of  October 2008, but the full benefit of an elite force, according to DOE\u2019s own  preliminary plans, will not be realized until fiscal year 2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Believes Security Technologies Can Improve the Effectiveness of Protective Forces", "paragraphs": ["DOE is seeking to improve the effectiveness and survivability of its  protective forces through the development and deployment of new security  technologies. The department believes technologies can reduce the risk to  protective forces in case of an attack and provide additional response time  to meet and defeat an attack. Many of the ESE sites we visited currently  possess some advanced security technology. For example, all sites operate  central alarm stations that often integrate hundreds of alarms and dozens  of sensors, such as video cameras and infrared and microwave detection  systems, as well as redundant communications systems. Some sites also  have thermal imaging sensors, which can detect adversaries at long ranges  and in all types of weather. Some of these sensors have data links that  allow the information to be rapidly shared. One site deploys classified  devices that can immobilize or delay the movement of an adversary.", "DOE officials believe that additional technology can further enhance site  security. The Office of Security and Safety Performance Assurance is  assisting sites in identifying and deploying existing technologies to enhance  protection systems, principally through the following programs:   Technology and Systems Development Program. DOE has funded this  program for many years, although funding has been reduced in recent  years. Specifically, DOE provided over $20 million for this program in  fiscal year 2004. However, DOE only requested $14.5 million for this  program in fiscal year 2006\u2013about 1 percent of the entire DOE security  program budget. Moreover, the program has had only limited success in  developing technologies that can actually be deployed. The Director of  DOE\u2019s Office of Security and Safety Performance Assurance recently  stated that DOE has not yet taken the formal steps necessary to  coordinate investment in emerging security technologies to ensure they  are deployed at DOE sites in a timely manner.", "Site Assistance Visit Program. Immediately after the issuance of the  2004 DBT, DOE\u2019s Office of Security and Safety Performance Assurance  embarked on site assistance visits\u2014a targeted effort to encourage the  use of technologies that could offset the more costly  manpower-intensive approaches needed to meet the more demanding  requirements of the DBT. These site assistance visits focus on new and  emerging security technologies. Each site visit lasts approximately 2  weeks and consists of exercises and simulations designed to evaluate  each site\u2019s preliminary plans for meeting the new DBT and to  demonstrate how technologies can assist in countering the 2004 DBT in  a cost-effective manner. DOE conducted these visits between October  2004 and April 2005. Four of the five ESE sites we examined have  received these visits. DOE\u2019s Office of Security and Safety Performance  Assurance completed the final report on the results of the site  assistance visits in May 2005. DOE plans to use the results of these visits  to help justify its fiscal year 2007 budget.", "Even before the site assistance visits, ESE sites were actively considering  advanced security technologies. For example, at least two ESE sites are  considering installing automatic weapons that can be operated from  remote, secure locations\u2014known as remotely operated weapons systems  within DOE. A few ESE protective forces also supported this push toward  technology, especially technology that allows more timely detection of  adversaries. Specifically, 16 of the 105 protective force officers we  interviewed said they needed enhanced detection technologies that would  allow adversaries to be detected and engaged at much greater ranges than  is currently possible at most sites."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ESE\u2019s Strategy for Meeting the New DBT Relies Heavily on the Consolidation of Special Nuclear Materials", "paragraphs": ["ESE\u2019s current strategy for meeting the October 2008 deadline for  compliance with the 2004 DBT relies heavily on the consolidation and  elimination of special nuclear materials between and among other ESE  sites. At all five of the ESE sites with Category I special nuclear material,  material consolidation and elimination are important goals for the site and  the responsible DOE program office and are inextricably tied to security  plans. However, neither ESE nor DOE has developed a comprehensive,  departmentwide plan to achieve the needed cooperation and agreement  among the sites and program offices to consolidate special nuclear  material, as we recommended in our April 2004 report. In the absence of  such a comprehensive, coordinated plan, completing some of these  significant activities by the October 2008 DBT implementation deadline is  unlikely. In particular:   Savannah River Site. Currently, special nuclear material is stored in  three separate, widely dispersed areas at the Savannah River Site\u2014an  Office of Environmental Management (EM) site. In November 2004, EM  directed the site to consolidate all its current and future storage of  Category I special nuclear material into a single area by fiscal year 2007.  This consolidation will free up over 100 protective force officers who  currently guard facilities at the sites\u2019 two other areas. It will also allow  for a substantially increased protective force presence at the single  remaining area and could save the site over $100 million in expected  costs to implement measures to defend the site against the 2004 DBT.", "Hanford Site. Hanford, another EM site, had plans to transfer most of  its special nuclear material to the Savannah River Site by the end of  fiscal year 2006. However, a number of factors threaten to delay this  transfer of material. These factors include (1) NNSA\u2019s Office of Secure  Transportation\u2019s shipping and load restrictions on transporting special  nuclear material across the United States, (2) the Savannah River Site\u2019s  inability to store some of Hanford\u2019s special nuclear material in its  present configuration, and (3) the Savannah River Site\u2019s current lack of  facilities to permanently dispose of Hanford\u2019s special nuclear material.  Faced with these challenges, EM decided in February 2005 to postpone  shipping material from Hanford until these issues could be resolved.  Hanford had begun planning for such a contingency, but the site will  now have to expend additional funds of about $85 million annually to  protect these materials against the 2004 DBT.", "Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory and  Argonne National Laboratory-West.

Removal will  allow a substantial number of its protective forces to transfer to the  nearby Argonne National Laboratory-West site, which has a continuing  Category I special nuclear material mission. These additional protective  forces will be critical to helping the site meet the 2004 DBT. However, a  recent DOE site assistance visit suggested that several other facilities at  the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory may  have some previously unrecognized Category I special nuclear material.  Site security officials report that they are trying to resolve these issues  with DOE\u2019s Office of Security and Safety Performance Assurance. If any  of these other Idaho National Engineering and Environmental  Laboratory facilities do have Category I special nuclear material, they  will require additional protection, which could severely damage the  current DBT implementation plans for both Idaho sites. In addition,  because of its remote location, the robust design of some of its facilities,  its large protective force, and extensive training facilities, the Idaho  National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory is now being  evaluated as a potential future consolidation location for NNSA  Category I special nuclear material.", "Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

The Office of Nuclear Energy, Science  and Technology is responsible for this down-blending program.  However, the costs for this program have risen steeply, even without the  additional security costs of the meeting the 2004 DBT. In addition, the  Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology and the Office of  Science have not formally agreed on which program office will bear the  brunt of the estimated $53 million annual security costs required to meet  the implementation deadline for the 2004 DBT. If these issues can be  resolved, down-blending operations are scheduled to begin in fiscal year  2009 and to be completed in fiscal year 2012.

First, ESE lacks a formally  appointed senior security advisor or a centralized security organization. In  contrast, NNSA has such a position. Specifically, Title 32 of the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, which created NNSA,  established the position of Chief, Defense Nuclear Security, to serve as the  primary security advisor to the NNSA Administrator. The Chief is  responsible for the development and implementation of NNSA security  programs, including the physical security for all NNSA facilities. Over the  past several years, ESE has recognized the need for such a position and has  sought to fill the security advisor role through the use of employees  temporarily detailed from other organizations. For example, beginning in  2004, a detailee from the Office of Security and Safety Performance  Assurance has served as the Acting Director for ESE Security. The current  acting director was preceded by a visiting White House Fellow. However,  the position of the Director for ESE Security has no programmatic  authority or staff. This lack of authority limits the director\u2019s ability to help  facilitate ESE and DOE-wide cooperation on such issues as material  down-blending at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and material  consolidation at other ESE sites.", "Second, ESE does not have a consolidated headquarters security office. In  April 2005, the recently confirmed ESE Under Secretary stated that ESE  was composed of \u201cinstitutional \u2018stovepipes\u2019\u201d and that this structure has  hampered strategic management within ESE. ESE has explored creating a  consolidated headquarters security office, but each of the three program  offices we examined continues to maintain its own headquarters security  offices. These offices, however, are organized and staffed differently. For  example, the Office of Environmental Management\u2019s headquarters security  office has more than 17 professional security personnel on staff. In  contrast, the headquarters offices of Science and of Nuclear Energy,  Science and Technology each have only one and two security professionals  on staff, respectively. For the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and  Technology this situation is problematic because its security  responsibilities are increasing with the consolidation of two of its sites into  the Idaho National Laboratory and with the Oak Ridge National  Laboratory\u2019s down-blending program.

We  conducted multiple rounds of interviews with DOE headquarters officials  and conducted document reviews. We also met with DOE and protective  force officials at five sites under the oversight of DOE\u2019s Office of the Under  Secretary for Energy, Science and Environment: Oak Ridge National  Laboratory, Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory,  Argonne National Laboratory\u2013West, the Savannah River Site, and the  Hanford Site.", "To determine the extent to which protective forces at Office of the Under  Secretary for Energy, Science and Environment sites are meeting DOE\u2019s  existing readiness requirements, we reviewed DOE policies to determine  current requirements. We also reviewed pertinent literature about the  factors that affect the readiness of military forces. We conducted  structured interviews with 105 ESE protective force officers at the five ESE  sites. We took several steps to ensure that we selected protective force  officers independently and interviewed protective force officers with  varying levels of experience. We interviewed a nonprobability sample of  protective force officers from all five ESE sites. Even though we are not  generalizing to the population as a whole, at each site we randomly  selected the protective force officers to interview. Random selection  protects against selection bias and helps assure that the officers we  interviewed were independent of site management. Specifically, we  obtained a complete roster of all protective force officers at each site,  which included the name, position, area assignment, and length of service  for each protective force officer and identified the dates and potential time  slots for the interviews during our site visits. We submitted modified  rosters to the security contractor with the potential interview time slots,  and the contractor resubmitted this roster with the availability of each  protective force officer. We then stratified protective force officers by  position, rank, and length of service and assigned them random numbers  from a random number table. We also assigned random numbers, in  sequence from the random number table, to protective force officers at  each site, eliminating random numbers to ensure that no random number  was ever used twice. The random numbers assigned to protective force  officers were placed in chronological order and officers were selected  based on the lowest random number assigned, their availability during the  prescribed time slots, position, area assignment, and length of service.  Lastly, we informed the security contractor at each site of those protective  force officers we wished to interview prior to our site visit. The structured  interviews were administered by two-person teams to Security Police  Officer-IIs and Security Police Officer-IIIs. We asked the officers questions  designed to determine their readiness to defend the sites, including  questions about their morale, training, and equipment. We also reviewed  the training records and physical fitness qualifications of the 105 officers to  determine if key elements of their training complied with existing DOE  training requirements. In particular, we reviewed selected firearms and  physical fitness qualifications to determine if these officers complied with  existing DOE requirements and federal regulations.", "Finally, we reviewed the equipment ESE protective forces use to determine  if it met current DOE requirements. For example, we reviewed the  minimum standard duty equipment that was employed at each site. We also  checked to ensure that most sites\u2019 armorers were certified as required by  DOE and, for most sites, we inspected armories, inspection records, as well  as firearms inventory procedures.
