GAO was asked to testify on its May 2005 report Military and Veterans' Benefits: Enhanced Services Could Improve Transition Assistance for Reserves and National Guard (GAO-05-544) and to highlight its concerns about TAP for the Reserves and National Guard. That report (1) assessed TAP administration, including program participation, and (2) identified actions agencies are taking and challenges they face in improving TAP."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Jointly administered by the Departments of Defense (DOD), Labor (DOL), and Veterans Affairs (VA), the transition assistance program (TAP) is intended to help service men and women successfully adjust to civilian life after serving in the military. Originally created in 1990, TAP is composed of four components that are coordinated through meetings of TAP managers and interagency agreements. In fiscal year 2004, about 309,000 service members were released from active duty after serving at least 180 days and were eligible for TAP, including about 38 percent who were members of the Reserves and National Guard. Both the method of delivery and level of participation in the program components vary. Notably, few members of the Reserves and National Guard have time to attend most of TAP. Because they demobilize within days after returning from overseas, members of the Reserves and National Guard participate in an abbreviated version of some components and generally do not have time for any employment preparation. Participation of service members in the Disabled TAP component is unknown because VA does not track this information. DOD, DOL, and VA have taken actions to improve TAP's content and increase participation among full-time active duty service members. However, they continue to face challenges serving Reserve and National Guard members because of their rapid demobilization. To improve program content, the agencies have updated, or plan to update, their manuals, forms, and briefing materials. To increase participation, DOL and VA provide some employment workshops and veterans' benefits briefings overseas, and DOD is considering a policy change that would mandate participation in all components. While the agencies have not assessed when and where to offer TAP for members of the Reserves and National Guard, DOL has pilot programs in three states that will offer employment workshops after members return home."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our review of transition  assistance for members of the armed forces, including members of the  Reserves and National Guard. The increased role of the armed forces in  military operations around the world, and the greater reliance on the  Reserves and National Guard, has focused national attention on what is  done to help service members successfully transition from the military  back to civilian life. Originally created in 1990, the transition assistance  program (TAP) has four components: (1) preseparation counseling, (2)  employment workshops, (3) briefings on veteran\u2019s benefits, and (4)  information for veterans with disabilities. Overall these components  provide a range of information on specific services and benefits, including  employment and relocation assistance, education opportunities, health  and life insurance, and financial planning. Jointly administered under  agreements among the Departments of Defense (DOD), Labor (DOL), and  Veterans Affairs (VA), TAP is intended to serve military personnel who  separate and members of the Reserves and National Guard who are  released after at least 180 days of active duty. About 309,000 service  members who left active military service met these criteria in fiscal year  2004, including about 38 percent who were Reserve and National Guard  members.", "As you requested, today I will discuss our recent report on transition  assistance, which (1) assesses TAP\u2019s administration, including program  participation and (2) identifies actions agencies are taking and challenges  they face in improving TAP. My comments highlight concerns we  identified regarding how transition assistance is being provided to  members of the Reserves and National Guard.", "To develop the information for our report, we reviewed the legislative  history of TAP, its program materials, and participation statistics. We also  interviewed responsible officials from each of the three administering  agencies, the armed forces, Reserve Affairs, and the National Guard  Bureau. In addition, we visited Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where many  Army service members are sent after serving in Afghanistan and Iraq. Our  purpose was to observe TAP firsthand and talk with those who  participated, including members of the Army Reserve and National Guard  who were briefed during their demobilization. We also used for reference  the body of prior GAO work on related issues shown at the end of this  testimony. We conducted our work from December 2004 through April  2005 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.", "In summary, we found variations in the delivery and participation in the  program components. Notably, few members of the Reserves and National  Guard had time to attend most of TAP. The delivery of TAP varied in the  amount of personal attention participants receive, the length of the  components, and the instructional methods used. Participation also varied.  For example, participation was higher for the mandated preseparation  counseling and generally lower for the employment workshops, where  attendance is voluntary. In addition, while full-time active duty service  members may participate in the full range of TAP services, members of the  Reserves and National Guard participate in an abbreviated version of  some components and generally receive no employment preparation  because they are often released from active duty within days after they  return from overseas. The agencies administering TAP have taken actions  to improve its content and increase participation, but they continue to face  challenges serving Reserve and National Guard members because of their  rapid demobilization. To improve program content, the agencies have  updated, or plan to update, their manuals, forms, and other briefing  materials, and DOL is assessing its employment workshop curriculum  using focus groups and survey data. To increase participation, DOL and VA  provide some employment workshops and veterans\u2019 benefits briefings  overseas, and DOD is considering a policy change that would mandate  participation in all components. While the agencies have not assessed  when and where to offer TAP for members of the Reserves and National  Guard, DOL has pilot programs in three states that will offer employment  workshops after the members return home."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The role of the armed forces in the global war on terrorism and in military  operations in Afghanistan and Iraq has heightened concerns about the  assistance that these and other service members receive when they  transition back into civilian life. All service members who have been on  active duty for at least 180 days are eligible for TAP, and those separating  because of disability are eligible regardless of the length of their active  duty service.", "About 309,000 servicemen and women separated from the military in fiscal  year 2004 with sufficient time on active duty to meet the TAP eligibility  criteria. Of these, about 192,000 were members of the full-time active duty  armed forces\u2014the Air Force, Army, Navy, or Marine Corps. The remaining  117,000 were members of the Reserves and National Guard, many of  whom had been employed in civilian occupations before they were called  to active duty. In recent years, more members of the Reserves and  National Guard have been called to active duty and sent overseas than at  any time since the Korean War. Further, the number of days they spend on  average in active duty status has doubled since 1990, when TAP was  established. DOD expects this trend to continue through at least fiscal year  2007, with Reserves and National Guard members serving on active duty  for a year or more on average.", "Each agency administering TAP is responsible for the content and delivery  of one of the program\u2019s four core components, as shown in figure 1. In the  first component, DOD provides preseparation counseling, which includes  a brief overview of available services and benefits. Separating service  members complete a checklist during this component, certifying that they  have been informed of the services available to them and identifying any  subsequent services they wish to receive. The second component is an  employment workshop conducted over 2 or 2 \u00bd days by certified  facilitators following a DOL guide. The third component covers veterans\u2019  benefits, including disability compensation, and is often provided on the  last day of the employment workshop by VA. VA also conducts the fourth  component\u2014the Disabled Transition Assistance Program (DTAP)\u2014-which  offers information and counseling, primarily on vocational rehabilitation  and employment options. Service members are required to attend  preseparation counseling by law; participation in the other components is  voluntary, unless DOD or the armed forces decide otherwise. For example,  participation in the employment workshop has been mandatory for those  separating from the Marine Corps since the policy went into effect in  December 2001.", "Considerable time is set aside for the employment workshops. From 22 to  30 hours are scheduled for the delivery of all TAP components, with 16 to  20 hours devoted to the employment workshop. This emphasis on  preparation for civilian employment is consistent with the purpose of TAP,  which was designed to serve full-time active duty service members who  generally had little prior civilian employment experience and might have  difficulty transferring skills acquired in the military to the civilian  economy.", "To facilitate interagency coordination and oversight, the administering  agencies established the TAP Steering Committee. Chaired by DOL, the  committee consists of TAP managers from each agency and each of the  armed forces. These TAP managers meet quarterly to discuss issues,  propose initiatives, and act as a sounding board. In addition, as required by  law, an interagency agreement called a memorandum of understanding  clarifies the roles and responsibilities of the agencies involved in all  components of transition assistance except preseparation counseling,  where DOD has sole responsibility. However, separate DOD and armed  forces guidelines establish the procedures governing demobilization of  Reserve and National Guard members. Further, local installation  commanders rather than TAP managers control demobilization schedules.", "Most benefits available to separating service members become available  once they have separated and are veterans. However, service members  must take specific actions while they are still on active duty to be eligible  for certain benefits. Changes enacted in 2004, for example, permit Reserve  and National Guard members called to active duty after September 11,  2001, to obtain a year\u2019s worth of health insurance coverage once they are  released from active duty. However, they must select coverage while on  active duty and enroll within 180 days of release from active duty or forfeit  their right to this benefit. Similarly, to obtain certain education benefits  under the Montgomery GI Bill, members of the Reserves and National  Guard must apply for these benefits while still on active duty.", "Delivery of the TAP components for most participants occurs at one of the  215 transition offices located on military installations. However, Reserve  and National Guard members usually transition at fewer locations,  referred to as demobilization sites. Typically the demobilization process is  rapid, often occurring within a matter of a few days once the service  members arrive back in the United States from overseas. During  demobilization, service members may be expected to participate in as  many as 18 separate briefings on various topics, such as legal and medical  issues, and scheduled activities, such as physical examinations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TAP\u2019s Delivery and Participation Vary", "paragraphs": ["The delivery of TAP varies in the amount of personal attention participants  receive, the length of the components, and the instructional methods used.  Preseparation counseling, for example, may take the form of  individualized, one-on-one counseling sessions of an hour or more, or it  may take the form of group briefings, depending in part on the time  available and the numbers being counseled. Group sessions are more  common at large bases like those of the Army and Marine Corps, where  many individuals are separating. Also, the Army has made use of  technology and offers preseparation counseling at banks of computers  that use interactive programs and include headphones so that participants  can work independently and at their own pace. In the Navy, TAP may take  place on board ships rather than at military installations. At some remote  locations on land, TAP may be delivered by video or telephone due to the  lack of trained personnel on-site.", "Participation in TAP also varies. For example, from fiscal year 2002  through 2004, the Army had about 229,000 service members attending  preseparation counseling\u2014twice as many as any one of the other services.  During the same period, the number of Army Reserve and Army National  Guard members attending preseparation briefings at demobilization  increased more than ten-fold, from about 9,000 to about 93,000. While  participation was higher for the mandated preseparation counseling, it  was generally lower for the employment workshops, where attendance is  voluntary. No data, however, are available regarding participation in the  VA components of TAP. Because the veterans\u2019 benefits briefings are  usually held on the last day of the employment workshops, VA officials  indicated that the participation rates for their briefings should be about  the same as the rates for the employment workshops. Regarding DTAP, no  data are available to determine the number of eligible individuals, and VA\u2019s  records do not distinguish the number who participate in this component  from the total of all recipients of VA outreach briefings. To develop more  accurate program statistics, we recommended that VA keep track of  service members who attend DTAP to ensure that adequate follow-up is  possible with this population, which may be in particular need of the  services. VA responded that it is developing a system to track attendance.", "Because of their circumstances, particularly their rapid demobilization  timetables, many Reserve and National Guard members cannot take  advantage of TAP components offered to full-time active duty military  personnel and instead receive much shorter presentations as part of large  groups at demobilization briefings. For example, members of the Reserves  and National Guard may be offered a 45-minute veterans\u2019 briefing by VA,  while 3 to 4 hours of veterans\u2019 benefits briefing are provided to other  military personnel. Very few members of the Reserve and National Guard  are able to attend the 2 to 2 \u00bd days of employment workshops, although  they receive preseparation counseling. The TAP managers with DOD and  the military services explained that the chief problem is the lack of time  during demobilization, which is often completed in 5 days. In addition,  many of the service members are anxious to return home and are not  interested in prolonging their stay to attend workshops. Further, many  may have jobs at home that are being held for them, so they may not need  to attend the employment workshop. However, employment information  may be useful and relevant for those Reserve and National Guard  members whose businesses may have suffered or gone into bankruptcy in  their absence. Other service members may have worked for companies  that have gone out of business since their active duty began, while others  might prefer to find better jobs than the ones they had before they went on  active duty."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Actions Are Under Way to Improve TAP, but Challenges Remain in Meeting the Needs of Reserves and National Guard", "paragraphs": ["Although several actions are under way or planned to improve TAP,  challenges remain, particularly in designing transition services that better  meet the needs of demobilizing Reserve and National Guard members.  DOD acknowledges that this presents several unique challenges, that the  service members have not been surveyed to determine how to meet their  needs, and that further study might suggest ways to address the  challenges, primarily in the logistics of when and where to offer TAP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Actions Directed at Improving Program Content", "paragraphs": ["To improve program content, the three agencies administering TAP have  plans to take, or have taken, actions to update their TAP manuals, forms,  and other briefing materials, including Internet sites. For example, DOD is  updating information and reconsidering the topics to be covered during  preseparation counseling, based on its assessment of the differing needs of  participants. As a result, DOD plans to eliminate the \u201cone size fits all\u201d  approach currently in place. For full-time active duty service members, it  has drafted an updated counseling checklist, and to meet the needs of  demobilizing Reserve and National Guard members, it has drafted a  separate counseling checklist tailored to their circumstances. This new  checklist provides benefit information applicable to demobilizing Reserve  and National Guard members, such as reemployment rights, employer  support, and loan relief. DOD is taking the same approach to the revision  of the guidebook and other materials used in preseparation counseling in  an attempt to make the materials more relevant for Reserve and National  Guard members.", "DOL and VA are also taking actions to improve the information they  provide on benefits and services available to separating service members.  DOL plans to use focus groups and survey data to assess the strengths and  weaknesses of its employment workshop curriculum in serving the needs  of all service members. VA has improved its marketing activities by issuing  pamphlets, brochures, a videotape, and a wallet-size card with information  on how to obtain further information about VA health care and benefits. In  addition, VA has developed a new curriculum with video, slides, and a  script for DTAP presenters to follow. This standardized DTAP curriculum  is intended to provide extensive information on VA\u2019s vocational  rehabilitation and employment services. VA also issued a quick reference  guide to present information about vocational counseling, rehabilitation,  and employment services available to active duty service members as well  as veterans with service-connected disabilities. Along with this new effort,  VA continues its outreach campaign to contact all service members in  need of these services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Actions Are Planned or Under Way to Increase Participation in TAP", "paragraphs": ["Several actions are also planned or under way to increase participation in  TAP. For instance, a draft DOD directive under consideration would  require all service members to attend the VA briefings and allow all who  indicate an interest to attend the employment workshops. This policy  change would be expected to improve program consistency, increase  overall program access, and encourage commanders to release service  members to attend TAP programs. In our review of TAP in 2002, we found  that some service members faced difficulties being released from military  duties to attend TAP because of the priority accorded their military  mission or the lack of supervisory support for TAP. In addition, DOL and  VA are expanding the availability of their employment workshops and  veterans\u2019 benefit briefings by offering them at some overseas bases where  service members that are likely to separate may access them. Further, the  TAP managers with DOD and the military services are discussing the  development of a centralized database that would automate and manage  information on service member participation in TAP. The new system  would also provide a means to analyze information specifically relevant to  active duty or to Reserve and National Guard service members."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges Remain in Meeting the Needs of Reserve and National Guard Service Members", "paragraphs": ["Despite the actions under way or planned to improve TAP, challenges  remain, particularly in designing transition services that better  accommodate the schedules of demobilizing Reserve and National Guard  service members. For example, staff who provide transition assistance  may not know when Reserve and National Guard units are returning for  demobilization, because national security concerns prevent the release of  information on the movement of large numbers of service members.  Moreover, the time schedules for demobilization vary by service and  demobilization site. Commanders are challenged with trying to balance  demobilizing some units while at the same time mobilizing others. They  also must balance getting Reserve and National Guard members back to  their families as quickly as possible with the extra time needed for  transition assistance. Table 1 describes some of the key differences in  circumstances between Reserve and National Guard members and others  separating that need to be considered.", "We found that during their rapid demobilization, Reserve and National  Guard members may not receive all the information on possible benefits to  which they are entitled. Notably, certain education benefits and medical  coverage require service members to apply while they are still on active  duty. However, even after being briefed, some Reserve and National Guard  members we spoke to did not know that they needed to apply for certain  benefits while still on active duty.", "To deal with the logistical challenges, the TAP managers for DOD and the  military services told us that they are considering the option of providing  some TAP components to Reserves and National Guard members after  they have been demobilized. For instance, VA could present its benefits  briefing and DTAP, where applicable, during a scheduled drill weekend,  after the service members have been home for 45 to 60 days. However, the  TAP managers told us they did not know how many Reserves and National  Guard members might be interested and able to attend such activities.  They also believed such an option would require additional resources and  a directive that Reserve and National Guard commanders allow sufficient  time for staff to provide the transition assistance. Meanwhile, DOL  officials told us that the agency was involved in three state pilot programs  that will offer a version of the employment workshops to the Reserve and  National Guard after they have been released from active duty and have  returned home. The pilot programs should provide DOL with a better  understanding of what is needed to ensure that the employment  workshops meet the needs of Reserve and National Guard members.", "The men and women who serve in our armed forces, particularly now that  the U.S. military has increased its presence in contingency operations  around the world, put their lives on the line every day. For this reason, it is  important that the government do all it can to help servicemen and women  successfully transition to civilian life after service ends. To ensure that  members of the Reserves and National Guard have the opportunity to  benefit from transition assistance, we recommended that DOD, in  conjunction with DOL and VA, determine what demobilizing Reserve and  National Guard members need to make a smooth transition and explore  the logistical options for providing that assistance, such as opportunities  for employment workshops before or after their demobilization and  providing timely information about the need to apply for certain benefits  while still on active duty. DOD concurred with our recommendation.", "Mr. Chairman, this completes my prepared statement.
