The Act allowed workers to join together to form unions and required that employers recognize certified employee unions and bargain \"in good faith.\" Although the Act applied broadly to \"employees,\" it and subsequent amendments excluded certain groups of workers from its coverage. Three-quarters of the civilian workforce--or 103 million of the 135 million people in the labor force as of February 2001--had some form of collective bargaining rights from federal, state, or local statutes. In contrast, 32 million civilian workers were without collective bargaining rights under any law, either federal and state. The portion of the total labor force with collective bargaining rights has likely increased since 1959. Since 1959, no major group of workers has lost bargaining rights under the Act. However, other federal, state, and local laws have extended rights to some workers in the groups excluded from the Act, providing bargaining rights to 14.5 million workers, primarily nonprofit health care workers; federal, state, and local government workers; and agricultural workers. Under two recent Supreme Court cases affecting National Labor Relations Board decisions, some workers currently with bargaining rights may either lose bargaining rights or have their rights diminished. In the Kentucky River decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the Board should revise its test for determining whether a worker is a supervisor, and excluded group under the Act, finding that the Board's test served to categorically include certain employees as covered under the act. Because any future tests used by the Board to determine whether or not employees are supervisors should be less categorical and more case-specific, the Kentucky River decision could increase the number of employees considered supervisory and thus excluded from coverage under the act. In the case of Hoffman Plastic, the Court reversed the Board's decision to award back pay to an undocumented alien worker who was fired for union activity. Although the Court did not exclude undocumented alien workers from protection under the Act, it prohibited the Board from awarding back pay to these documented alien workers whose rights had been violated, stating that this remedy would conflict with federal immigration law."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 1935, the federal National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), also known as the Wagner Act, provided many U.S. workers the right to bargain over wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment with their employers, forming the framework for collective bargaining in the United States.

The act includes the payment of back pay and the reinstatement of employment as remedies for certain violations of the act. It also created an agency called the National Labor Relations Board (Board) to administer and enforce the act. Subsequently, in 1947, the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin Act in 1959 amended the NLRA, among other things, to clarify coverage under the NLRA, prohibit certain union activities, and set requirements on union governance. Together, these statutes established the basic policies and procedures under which most private sector collective bargaining still operates today.", "Although the NLRA applies in general to all \u201cemployees,\u201d certain groups of workers are excluded from its provisions, either by express statutory language in the original act and its amendments or by Board or judicial interpretation. Among the groups of workers excluded from the act are (1) supervisors and managers; (2) independent contractors; (3) employees of certain small businesses; (4) domestic workers; (5) agricultural workers; and (6) federal, state, and local government employees. These categories of excluded workers have been defined through various tests, which the Board can apply to determine coverage of the act. For example, the act sets forth a three-part test for determining supervisory status. Employees are statutory supervisors if (1) they hold the authority to engage in any 1 of 12 listed supervisory functions\u2014hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees or responsibility to direct them, to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action; (2) their exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment; and (3) their authority is held in the interest of the employer.", "While the NLRA underpins much collective bargaining activity in the United States, other federal, state, and local statutes also provide bargaining rights to many individuals excluded from the NLRA, particularly government workers and agricultural workers.

We chose the SBA data because this was the only dataset available that categorically separates each industry by volume of sales receipt. We chose data for 1997 because that was the most recent data available that still used the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code system of industry classification and thus would be comparable with the classification used in the CPS. The SBA data identifies the number of workers by firms\u2019 annual dollar sales volumes so that we were able to calculate the number of employees with and without bargaining rights according to the Board\u2019s jurisdictional standards. We estimated the exclusionary effect of the Board\u2019s small business jurisdictional standards by calculating a percent of employees in each industry who would be employed by a firm with annual dollar sales below the Board\u2019s standard and thus exempt under the Board\u2019s guidelines. We then applied these industry exclusion percentages to the February 2001 CPS Supplement estimates of the total number of workers in each industry classification, yielding a number of excluded workers for each industry classification.(See fig. 4.) Once we estimated these excluded industry totals, we subtracted them from the CPS labor force total. Summing all of the industry totals provides an estimate of the total number of employees effectively excluded from NLRA coverage by the Board\u2019s jurisdictional standards. We did not attempt to estimate those Board jurisdictional standards that did not specify an annual dollar sales volume."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Supervisors/Managers", "paragraphs": ["The NLRA also excludes managers and supervisors from coverage. To estimate the percentage of managers and supervisors by industry, we used data from the 1997 Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 National Compensation Survey (NCS). The NCS provides recent nationally representative employer-reported data on job duties at the establishment level, permitting the estimation of the number of jobs in a particular industry that are supervisory or managerial in nature. Among the information collected in the job survey is a ranking or leveling factor measuring supervisory duties. This factor is designed to account for the additional responsibilities of supervisors and to indicate the hierarchical level of the positioning of the organization. Using this generic leveling factor, jobs are classified according to their supervisory duties. (See table 4.) .", "We obtained NCS-based estimates of the supervisory level percentages for wage and salary employees with full-time status by industry. We then applied these percentages to the CPS full-time workforce estimates by industry to estimate the number of full-time managerial and supervisory employees.

To avoid double counting, we applied the NCS industry level supervisor percentages to the CPS total labor force estimate of full-time wage and salary workers by industry net of the small business exclusion. To calculate the percentage of workers excluded as managers and supervisors, we divided the total number of full-time supervisors by the total number of private sector employees. To the extent that managers and supervisors are part-time employees, we underestimated the total number of employees in that category, although we believe that this number is small.", "The NCS, while it provides reasonable data to estimate the number of supervisors excluded under the NLRA, has several limitations. The NCS data used in this report were collected in 1996 and thus may not completely reflect the hierarchical structure of establishments in 2001. In addition, the NCS data are based on a description of jobs, and while reasonable conceptually, it is not strictly comparable with our worker- based estimates from the CPS. In addition, there were certain occupations that could not be leveled (e.g., musicians), and there are some small groups of jobs that were restricted to a certain level (e.g., personnel managers were restricted to supervisory duties of the first tier or higher). However, we believe that these limitations are probably not large enough to have a significant effect on our estimate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Domestic Workers", "paragraphs": ["The NLRA excludes coverage of domestic workers.

We used these same SOC codes as a definition to exclude agricultural workers from the workforce in the CPS. Because nine states have separate laws that give agricultural laborers bargaining rights with either (1) an agricultural labor act or (2) private employer labor relation acts without exclusion of agricultural workers, we added the estimates of agricultural workers from these states back into the total estimate to account for state and local laws.

We applied all of the state and local laws that excluded certain occupations from coverage\u2014in many cases police officers, firefighters, and teachers\u2014to estimate a percentage of workers with collective bargaining rights within those occupations. We applied a similar methodology for federal employees.

We then adjusted for those agencies, for example, the Central Intelligence Agency, who have been exempted from bargaining rights. We then calculated the percentage of federal employees who were managers or supervisors using the September 2001 Office or Personnel Management\u2019s Central Personnel Data File (CPDF) and reduced the remainder by the number of exempted manager and supervisors in the executive branch workforce.

First, to estimate the number of eligible workforce participants, we counted only those above the age of 18 and below 65 in the 8.7 million number, yielding a total of about 7.1 million persons. (See table 6.) We then accounted for the percent that are likely to be covered by collective bargaining rights in the workforce. We apply an estimate of the private sector labor force covered by the NLRA of 77 percent to obtain an estimate of about 5.5 million persons (5,485,538). Although the bulk of this estimate contains undocumented alien workers, it also includes a small group of so-called quasi-legal residents; persons who are in a variety of transitional immigrant categories but at the time do not have explicit legal or illegal status.", "There were several limitations to consider when determining the estimate of undocumented alien immigrants due to the characteristics and circumstances of this population. We include the quasi-legal population in the residual foreign-born estimate because it includes people who are waiting for action to be taken on their legal migration requests. We included this group in our total estimate because they were assumed to be illegal at the time they were counted in the Census.", "To obtain an estimate of the workers affected by the Hoffman Plastic decision, we assumed that the distribution of undocumented alien workers across industries was identical to that of the total civilian labor force. Our methodology for the entire workforce was conducted in February 2001 while the Census estimates are for the entire year of 2000. In addition, although undocumented alien workers are likely not to be distributed in this manner, it is unclear what their distribution is. For example, undocumented alien workers are probably less likely to be employed in government employment, although they may be more likely to work in small businesses that are exempt from Board jurisdiction and as domestic workers. In addition, we based our assumption that the percentage of private sector workers with collective bargaining rights under the NLRA (77 percent), on our private sector estimate of 78 percent, and then corrected for coverage under the Railway Labor Act. However, there is a high percentage of undocumented alien workers in agriculture, another industry excluded from the NLRA, suggesting that the 77 percent may be an overestimate. On the other hand, undocumented workers may be more likely to be rank and file workers rather than supervisors and thus covered by the NLRA. We also assumed 100 percent Census coverage of the foreign-born population, although, historically, Hispanic populations have been undercounted in the Census, and the majority of undocumented alien immigrants are of Hispanic origin.

An alternative methodology would be to identify those jobs that would confer rights to individuals.
