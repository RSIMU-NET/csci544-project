Many offices reported that workload pressures prevented them from fully using the modules. GAO found that TPSS might not fully achieve its objectives.

To improve the accuracy rate, VBA\u2019s primary training initiative is a computer-assisted training program known as the Training and Performance Support System (TPSS). The program\u2019s purpose is to provide uniform and consistent training to employees in 57 regional offices in order to improve the accuracy and consistency of disability claims processing nationwide. The need to invest in human capital through better training was emphasized in 1993 when a VBA Blue Ribbon Panel reported that VBA needed to improve the training for its regional office employees. In 1998, VBA committed itself to develop the TPSS program, and, as of March 2001, had spent or obligated about $18.6 million of the estimated overall program cost of $32 million.", "You asked us to provide you with information on (1) the status of the TPSS program\u2019s development and implementation and (2) the extent to which TPSS will meet its objectives. To address these issues, we met with VBA officials and reviewed VBA documents. We surveyed all regional offices and visited six of them to determine their experiences with and their views on the TPSS program. At the six offices we visited, we talked with regional office officials and employees who had taken TPSS training. We did not evaluate the effectiveness of any type of training, but we obtained the views of regional offices on the benefits or adequacy of TPSS.

The pension program pays monthly benefits, based on financial need, to wartime veterans who have low incomes and are permanently and totally disabled for reasons not service-connected. When veterans submit disability claims, VBA\u2019s 57 regional offices must follow newly defined requirements for assisting veterans in obtaining evidence to support their claims. For a disability compensation claim, the regional office must (1) obtain the veteran\u2019s existing service medical records and, if the veteran has furnished information sufficient to locate such records, other relevant service records; (2) obtain records of relevant medical treatment or examination of the veteran provided at VA health-care facilities or at VA\u2019s expense; (3) obtain any other relevant records held by a federal department or agency; and (4) provide a medical examination or obtain a medical opinion, if necessary to make a decision on the claim.", "Regional offices have three primary claims-processing positions for which TPSS is intended to provide training. Veterans Service Representatives obtain evidence required for veterans\u2019 claims. Rating Veterans Service Representatives (hereafter referred to as Rating Specialists) analyze the evidence, evaluate service-connected impairments, and assign a rating for the degree to which the veteran is disabled. Decision Review Officers attempt to resolve veterans\u2019 disagreements with regional office decisions and can grant benefits based on the same evidence used by the Rating Specialist. Two of these regional office positions are relatively new\u2014the Veterans Service Representative position and the Decision Review Officer position were implemented during 1998-99 and 2000, respectively.", "If a veteran disagrees with a regional office decision, the veteran may file an appeal asking VA\u2019s Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals to review the decision.The Board makes VA\u2019s final decision on such appeals and can grant or deny benefits, but in some cases the Board may return (remand) the case to the regional office to obtain further evidence and reconsider the decision. In these cases, the regional office either grants the claim or returns it to the Board for a final VA decision.", "Our High-Risk Series states that human capital challenges pose a high risk for VBA, as well as other agencies across the federal government.Specifically, our High-Risk Series states that VBA\u2019s training and recruitment programs may not be adequate to ensure a sufficient workforce of competent claims processors, and the lack of such a workforce could undermine efforts to reduce current problems of claims- processing backlogs and errors. We have published a human capital self- assessment checklist providing a systematic approach to identifying and addressing human capital issues. Our checklist states that an agency should make appropriate investments in education, training, and other developmental opportunities to help its employees build the competencies needed to achieve the agency\u2019s \u201cshared vision\u201d\u2014the mission, vision for the future, core values, goals and objectives, and strategies that define the agency\u2019s direction and expectations for itself and its people. Such investments require an explicit workforce planning strategy, linked to the agency\u2019s strategic and program planning efforts. These planning efforts should identify, among other things, the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to position an agency for its future. In addition, they should provide an explicit link between the agency\u2019s training offerings and curriculums and the competencies identified by the agency for mission accomplishment.", "In VA\u2019s Departmental Performance Plan for fiscal year 2001, VBA links the TPSS program to its strategic goal of providing world-class service to veterans and their families. In working toward this goal, VBA\u2019s top priority is to improve the technical accuracy of claims-processing, and VBA states that the TPSS program is one of its most important initiatives for achieving this objective. To develop TPSS training modules for a specific claims-processing position, the job and tasks for that position must be analyzed in detail. After this analysis, VBA estimates that it takes 14 to 16 months to develop each module, which consists of computer- assisted instruction packages and written instructional materials designed to support cooperative learning by employees who train in groups of two or three. Under VBA\u2019s direction, contractors develop the modules with the help of subject matter experts from VBA\u2019s regional and central offices. Before a module is released, selected regional office employees take the training on a trial basis to validate its effectiveness. Each training module includes a pretest for determining whether an employee needs to take the training. Each module also includes a post-test requiring students to process test cases to determine their mastery of the tasks and work processes.

VBA is waiting for the duties of the new Decision Review Officer position to stabilize before conducting the task analysis necessary to develop the training modules for this position. In addition, after completing the task analysis for the new Veterans Service Representative position, VBA learned it will need to develop many more training modules than originally expected because the position encompasses more tasks and greater complexity than anticipated.Moreover, VBA has decided to give priority to developing modules for the Veterans Service Representative position and thus delay the development of training modules for other categories of employees. Finally, because the Congress enacted legislative changes in the duty-to-assist requirements in November 2000, VBA decided to include these new requirements in the remaining basic rating modules.

For example, 41 regional offices had used the original compensation module, but only 11 had used the routine future examinations module (see table 2). Only 5 regional offices had used all of the available modules to train employees, and 10 regional offices had used only one module.", "VBA had strongly encouraged, but not required, regional offices to use TPSS in their training programs. However, VBA conducted a survey of its own in October 2000 and found that some regional offices still were not using any TPSS modules. As a result, in December 2000, VBA issued a letter mandating the use of TPSS in all regional offices. According to VBA officials, the December mandate required that regional offices use the available basic rating modules to train all new Rating Specialists and use future modules for Veterans Service Representatives to train all new employees filling this position. VBA officials told us that these new training requirements for specific types of employees have also been communicated to the regional offices via nationwide conference calls.", "Based on responses to our survey from the 49 regional offices that had used at least one TPSS module, the most significant hindrance to implementing the modules was lack of time for training due to workload pressures. About 47 percent of these regional offices said that workload pressures affected their use of TPSS to at least a moderate extent. As we reported in May 2000, persistent backlogs of pending claims have resulted in veterans having to endure long waits to receive decisions on their claims. Consequently, regional offices face pressure not only to improve accuracy in processing claims, but also to reduce the backlog of pending claims. A contractor evaluating VBA training reported in April 2000 that \u201ctraining time is too easily given up to the press of productivity.\u201d The six modules that had been released at the time of our survey were designed to require a total of about 24 workdays for an employee to complete."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "TPSS May Not Fully Achieve Some of Its Objectives", "paragraphs": ["In 1998, VBA prepared a rationale supporting the adoption of the TPSS program.

We found that many TPSS modules will not be available when needed to train new employees and that TPSS may not substantially reduce the training period for employees.

Of the 4,000 Veterans Service Representatives and Rating Specialists that were employed as of fiscal year 2000, VBA expects about 1,000 (25 percent) to retire between 2000- 2005. In response, VBA already has hired a total of about 600 new Veterans Service Representatives and Rating Specialists between fiscal years 1998 and 2000.

VBA expects to complete these efforts in March and April 2001, respectively. Additionally, it is considering using the VBA Satellite Network and video teleconferencing facilities to provide training for both Rating Specialists and Veterans Service Representatives. The extent to which these alternatives may eliminate the need to develop some future TPSS modules has not been determined.", "Furthermore, VBA has established a formal 12-week basic training course for all new Rating Specialists beginning in March 2001 and for all new Veterans Service Representatives in April 2001. To provide this training, VBA established training centers for each of the nine Service Delivery Networks under which the regional offices are organized.

This assumption presumed that TPSS would significantly reduce the need for on-the-job training provided by regional offices, which historically has constituted the majority of training.

In a similar vein, a VBA contractor evaluating TPSS training said that TPSS could not fully cover the complexity of the work of Rating Specialists. Such in-depth training can only be gained through on-the-job training and coaching and mentoring while employees are gaining actual experience in processing claims. In our site visits, regional office officials said they believe that achieving full proficiency as a Rating Specialist will require about 2 years, even with TPSS. VBA officials, however, said that such conclusions may be premature because at the time of our review, the regional offices had had relatively limited exposure to TPSS.

However, according to VBA officials, this projected increase in the accuracy rate is not based on an analysis linking employee training to claims-processing accuracy, but rather on professional judgment. The ability to isolate the specific impact of TPSS is difficult because other initiatives implemented by VBA may also affect claims-processing performance. For instance, VBA\u2019s new accuracy measurement system can also affect claims-processing performance because it provides information on specific types of errors. This information can be used to correct the causes of errors, thereby helping to improve the overall accuracy rate. In addition, researchers have found it difficult to link TPSS training to changes in employees\u2019 claims-processing performance. For example, researchers cautioned that while their findings indicated that TPSS training did result in knowledge transfer (over 95 percent of the students who took TPSS module post-tests passed the tests), their evaluation results could not substantiate whether TPSS training had improved standardization or increased claims-processing productivity across regional offices.", "Using its accuracy measurement system, VBA is able to track overall trends in the claims-processing accuracy rate, which may provide a general indicator of whether TPSS is helping to improve accuracy at the national level. However, it may be possible for VBA to collect data that could provide further indications of the impact of TPSS. In fiscal year 2001, VBA is planning to pilot test a new initiative\u2014Systematic Individual Performance Assessment (SIPA)\u2014to assess performance quality and identify training needs at the employee level. SIPA will complement the existing accuracy measurement system by reviewing the quality of a representative sample of the individual employee\u2019s work products. Such data on individual employees\u2019 performance could potentially help provide indications of whether TPSS is having an impact on accuracy. For example, VBA could use such data to monitor the accuracy levels of individual employees as they progress through the TPSS curriculum, as well as compare the accuracy levels of employees who completed training on certain TPSS modules with those employees who did not.
