Legislation enacted in 2009 and 2010 provided additional funding that could significantly expand health center capacity over the next several years. GAO was asked to review HRSA\u0092s process for awarding grants for new delivery sites and possible effects of health centers, such as competition, on other providers. This report examines (1) the actions HRSA has recently taken to target its grants for new delivery sites to health centers in communities with demonstrated need and the outcome of HRSA\u0092s award process in recent years, and (2) the extent to which HRSA-funded health centers collaborate and compete with other health care providers in their service area. GAO focused its work on NAP grants, HRSA\u0092s primary means of establishing new health centers and delivery sites, during fiscal years 2008 through 2011. GAO analyzed HRSA documents and interviewed HRSA officials, and interviewed officials from 11 health centers and providers and officials in their service areas."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Health and Human Services\u0092 (HHS) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) revised its New Access Point (NAP) competitive award process in fiscal year 2011 to increase the emphasis on the need for services in the applicant\u0092s proposed service area, and on the three special populations\u0097migrant and seasonal farmworkers, homeless people, and residents of public housing\u0097designated by the Public Health Service Act. The act requires that certain proportions of Health Center Program funding go to health centers serving the special populations. To increase the emphasis on need, HRSA increased the weight given to need in the application review process. To target health centers serving special populations, HRSA gave extra points in the application process to applicants proposing to serve them. When this was insufficient to meet the required proportions, HRSA moved some applicants ahead of others in the award rank order list, a method it had used in the past. The effect of HRSA\u0092s actions on the award outcome was magnified in fiscal year 2011 because (1) HRSA received less program funding than it had anticipated, and (2) it needed to increase the share of grants going to health centers serving the special populations because HRSA had not applied the statutory proportions when it used American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding to award grants in fiscal year 2009. As a result, HRSA awarded 67 NAP grants in fiscal year 2011, 57 of which went to applicants proposing to serve at least one special population; 13 of the 57 received grants by being moved ahead of other applicants with equal or higher review scores. HRSA announced the extra points in application guidance, but not the potential moving of some applicants ahead of others. As HRSA has periodically needed to take actions to meet its statutory obligations and may need to do so again, evaluating the effectiveness and transparency of its most recent New Access Point grant award process could help it identify lessons and possible improvements for the future.", "Health centers in the communities GAO studied collaborate with other providers and generally do not compete with them for patients, but GAO found greater potential for competition in rural areas. Health center officials described collaborative relationships with other providers that give patients access to services not available through the health center. Health centers and other providers told GAO they generally do not compete for patients; health centers typically serve patients not treated elsewhere, such as uninsured and Medicaid patients. However, because the health center grant covers, on average, about 20 percent of a center\u0092s budget, other funding must also be secured, such as by serving insured patients, for the center to be financially sustainable. This can result in competition with other providers in its service area. During the award process, HRSA takes steps to reduce competition by identifying nearby safety net providers and assessing whether the level of unmet need in the area warrants a grant for a new health center or delivery site. Greater potential for competition exists in rural areas because patients there are more likely to be insured and rural health clinics and certain hospitals might seek to serve some of the same patients as health centers, although they may not offer all of the services required of health centers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of HHS should direct the Administrator of HRSA to evaluate the fiscal year 2011 NAP grant award process for effectiveness and transparency, identify lessons learned, and incorporate any improvements for future funding cycles.

In 2010, more than 1,100 health centers operated more than   8,100 delivery sites across all the states and served more than 19 million  people. These health centers provide comprehensive primary health care  services\u2014preventive, diagnostic, treatment, and emergency services, as  well as referrals to specialty care\u2014without regard to a patient\u2019s ability to  pay.

Among other things, HRSA is required to  ensure that an applicant has made efforts to establish and maintain  collaborative relationships with other health care providers in its service  area before awarding a grant. The scope of a health center\u2019s activities is  delineated in its grant application and consists of its services, delivery  sites, providers, target population, and service area. In addition,  applicants must describe a specific need for services in the area they plan  to serve, based on factors such as unique health care needs of the target  population or particular provider shortages. There are four types of health  centers funded through the Health Center Program: community health  centers, funded to serve all members of an underserved community, and  three types specifically funded to serve designated special populations\u2014 migrant and seasonal farmworkers, homeless people, and residents of  public housing. The four types of health centers were consolidated into a  single program in 1996; prior to the consolidation, the grantees serving  the three designated special populations were funded through separate  programs.", "For each of fiscal years 2009 and 2010, HRSA allocated almost   $2.2 billion in annual appropriations to the Health Center Program; of  that amount, nearly $2 billion each year was used for health center  grants. In addition, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of  2009 (Recovery Act) appropriated $2 billion for health centers to be  used over those 2 years. In fiscal year 2011, HRSA allocated $1.6 billion  in annual appropriations to the Health Center Program. This amount  reflected a reduction of $604 million as a result of a reduction in  appropriations to HRSA and a rescission of appropriations made for that  year for nondefense programs; these reductions occurred after the fiscal  year had begun and resulted in HRSA receiving less funding for the  Health Center Program than it had anticipated. However, the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), as amended by the Health  Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, provided an additional  $11 billion over 5 years\u2014beginning with $1 billion for fiscal year 2011\u2014 for the operation, expansion, and construction of health centers.

In this report, we examine  (1) the actions HRSA has recently taken to target its grants for new  delivery sites to health centers in communities with demonstrated need,  and the outcome of HRSA\u2019s award process in recent years; and (2) the  extent to which federally funded health centers collaborate and compete  with other health care providers in their service area.", "To examine the actions HRSA has recently taken to target its grants for  new delivery sites to health centers in communities with demonstrated  need and the outcome of HRSA\u2019s award process in recent years, we  focused our work on New Access Point grants, because these grants are  HRSA\u2019s primary means of establishing new health centers and delivery  sites, and because applicants are required to demonstrate the need for  health care services in a newly proposed service area. We reviewed  HRSA program documents and web-based resources and interviewed  HRSA officials to obtain information about the agency\u2019s process for  awarding grants, including any changes HRSA made between fiscal  years 2008 and 2011 to the New Access Point grant application guidance  and the criteria used for reviewing and scoring applications. We also  reviewed applicant scores and rankings during that period. We  interviewed health center officials and reviewed grant applications from  nine selected health centers that received New Access Point grants  during fiscal years 2008 through 2011 to obtain the health centers\u2019  perspective on their experience applying for a grant and to review the  information they provided to HRSA. We chose the health centers based  on criteria that included geographic diversity, patient demographics   (e.g., percentage of population in poverty and insurance status), and site- specific information (e.g., number of delivery sites operated by the  grantee and U.S. Census Bureau urban/rural continuum category). We  obtained data used in our selection process from HRSA\u2019s 2010 Uniform  Data System (UDS) and 2009-2010 Area Resource File (ARF), the most  recent data available. To assess the reliability of the UDS and ARF data  elements that we used in our selection, we performed checks, such as  examining the data for missing values, and reviewed related  documentation.

For this objective, we interviewed officials from the six health  center grantees selected for our first objective that received New Access  Point grants in fiscal years 2008 and 2009, but we did not include the  three 2011 grantees. We did not interview officials from the fiscal year  2011 grantees because these grantees received their awards in August  2011 and were not yet fully operational, although we did review their grant  applications for discussions of collaborative efforts. We also interviewed  officials from two additional grantees that were funded prior to 2008\u2014 which were selected using criteria similar to those used for the other  grantees. We asked the officials from both groups of health centers  about their relationships with other providers in their communities,  including any collaboration or competition with them.

To better target resources to communities with a high need for  health center services, in fiscal year 2011 HRSA increased the weight of  the criterion assessing the need for services in the New Access Point  grant application. Certain populations\u2014migrant and seasonal  farmworkers, homeless people, and residents of public housing\u2014are  particularly vulnerable and often have specific health and access  problems. In its 1996 consolidation of the Health Center Program,  Congress began requiring that specific proportions of the program\u2019s funds  be used to serve these populations. Over the years, HRSA has taken  various actions to ensure it was meeting the required funding proportions.  During its fiscal year 2011 New Access Point award process, HRSA for  the first time gave extra points to applicants serving these designated  special populations. Congress also requires HRSA to give special  consideration to organizations serving sparsely populated areas, and in  fiscal year 2011 HRSA also gave extra points to applicants serving  sparsely populated and high-poverty areas. HRSA\u2019s approach of  assigning these extra points\u2014and its description in its application  guidance of how the points would be awarded\u2014increased the  transparency of the grant award process compared to previous years.  However, because the extra points were not sufficient to ensure that  HRSA met its statutorily required funding proportion for migrant health  centers, HRSA also moved applicants serving this population ahead of  other applicants to ensure the required proportion was met, a step that  was not specifically described in the application guidance. Although  HRSA had used such an approach before, the effect in fiscal year 2011  was magnified by the combined effect of the reduction in program funding  and HRSA\u2019s need to increase the share of funding awarded to the  designated special populations as a result of not applying the proportions  when awarding grants with Recovery Act funds in fiscal year 2009. HRSA  has periodically needed to take actions to meet its statutory obligations  and may face such a situation in the future.
