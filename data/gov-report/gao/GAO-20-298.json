Smaller airports (small hub, non-hub, and general aviation) collectively received more AIP funding compared to larger airports (large and medium hub).", "Revenue from federally authorized passenger-facility charges (PFC), a per-passenger fee charged at the ticket's point of purchase, increased by 9 percent, with an annual average of $3.1 billion. Increases in passengers and PFC revenue at larger airports contributed to this increase.", "Airport-generated revenue (e.g., concessions and airline landing fees) increased by 18 percent, with an annual average of $7.7 billion. While both larger and smaller airports experienced increases in these revenues, the larger airports made up 92 percent ($7.1 billion) of these revenues.", "In addition to these sources, some airports obtained financing by issuing bonds, secured by airport revenue or PFCs. According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) data, larger airports were able to generate more bond proceeds than smaller airports in part because larger airports are more likely to have a greater, more certain revenue stream to repay debt.", "Airports' planned infrastructure costs for fiscal years 2019 through 2023 are estimated to average $22 billion annually (in 2017 dollars)\u2014a 19 percent increase over prior estimates for fiscal years 2017 through 2021. These costs are expected to increase in part because airports are planning to invest in more terminal projects. For example, cost estimates for AIP-eligible terminal projects increased about 51 percent when compared to FAA's prior 5-year estimate. FAA and airport association representatives stated that terminal projects can be more expensive than other projects because of the scale of the improvements, which can include renovating terminals to repair aging facilities and accommodate larger aircraft and growth in passengers.", "Officials from GAO's 19 selected airports cited several challenges to funding infrastructure projects. For example, officials stated that the funding and revenue they receive from combined sources may not be sufficient to cover the costs of planned infrastructure projects. The officials also raised concerns about being able to finance future airport-infrastructure projects because they have already obligated their current and future PFCs to service debt on completed and ongoing infrastructure projects. According to FAA data, in fiscal years 2013 through 2017, airports paid a total of $12 billion\u2014or 78 percent of total PFC revenues collected\u2014for debt service. Bond-rating agencies, however, continue to give airports high or stable ratings, and rating agencies' representatives stated that airports' access to capital markets continues to remain favorable. Some airport officials stated that to address funding challenges, they have deferred some needed infrastructure investments or completed projects in phases, steps that increased construction times and costs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["U.S airports are important contributors to our economy and fulfill a variety  of vital roles, from supporting scheduled commercial air service for the  traveling public, to supporting freight transportation and disaster relief.

All dollar amounts calculated from multiple years are presented  in adjusted 2017 dollars. For data on airport-generated net income and  capital contributions, we obtained and analyzed airport financial data from  FAA\u2019s Certification Activity Tracking System (CATS) for fiscal years 2013  through 2017. For AIP grants, we analyzed information from FAA\u2019s  System of Airports Reporting (SOAR) database on AIP grants awarded  by FAA from fiscal years 2013 through 2017.

FAA officials added that larger airports  tend to issue airport revenue bonds, which are backed solely by airport  revenue, while some smaller airports may be able to benefit from bond  proceeds issued by the broader county or municipal government and  backed by that entity's taxing authority."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Projected Planned Airport-Infrastructure Costs Have Increased to an Average of $22 Billion Annually and Include More Investments in Terminal Projects", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "We Estimated Average Annual Costs of $22 Billion for Planned Airport- Infrastructure Investments for Fiscal Years 2019 through 2023", "paragraphs": ["Based on our analysis, airports\u2019 planned infrastructure costs are projected  to average $22 billion annually for fiscal years 2019 through 2023. To  arrive at this estimate, we combined FAA\u2019s $7 billion estimate of AIP- eligible planned infrastructure costs and ACI-NA\u2019s $15 billion estimate of  planned infrastructure costs for projects that are not eligible for AIP  grants. Our $22 billion estimate would represent an increase of 19  percent from FAA\u2019s and ACI-NA\u2019s fiscal years 2017 through 2021  infrastructure cost estimates. This increase is largely driven by an  increase in ACI-NA\u2019s estimate of AIP-ineligible planned projects.  Specifically, ACI-NA\u2019s annual average of about $15 billion in planned AIP- ineligible costs reflects an increase of $3.3 billion or 28 percent when  compared to the annual average estimate of AIP-ineligible projects from  ACI-NA\u2019s fiscal year 2017\u20132021 estimates. Similarly, FAA\u2019s annual  average of $7 billion in planned AIP-eligible costs reflects an increase of  $289 million or 4 percent from FAA\u2019s fiscal year 2017\u20132021 estimates.", "A variety of factors may be contributing to the increase in FAA\u2019s and ACI- NA\u2019s cost estimates, factors that we will discuss later in the report.", "Overall, larger airports (large and medium hub) accounted for 75 percent  of the $22 billion annual cost estimate and make up a greater percentage  of the estimated increase in planned development costs when comparing  the fiscal years 2017 through 2021 and fiscal years 2019 through 2023  estimates. For example:", "Among planned AIP-eligible projects, estimated annual planned- development costs increased from $1.4 to $1.7 billion (an 18 percent  increase) for large hub airports and from $641 to $735 million (a 15  percent increase) for medium hub airports, according to FAA\u2019s cost  estimates. By comparison, estimated planned development costs for  small hub and non-hub airports decreased by 3 and 2 percent  respectively over the same time period.", "Among AIP-ineligible projects, ACI-NA estimates show that annual  planned development costs increased more significantly for medium  hub airports. Specifically, ACI-NA\u2019s report shows that annual planned  development costs for AIP-ineligible projects increased by 22 percent  for large hub airports, 71 percent for medium hub airports, and 29  percent for small hub airports.", "ACI-NA representatives stated that the increase in medium hub airport\u2019s  planned development (for both AIP-eligible and AIP\u2013ineligible projects) is  due to the underinvestment at medium hub airports in prior years.  Specifically, ACI-NA representatives stated that in response to the loss of  air service immediately following the 2007\u20132009 recession, some medium  hub airports scaled back their capital investments. ACI-NA  representatives stated that as passenger traffic has recovered with  economic growth, medium hub airports are now investing in previously  deferred improvements. According to ACI-NA\u2019s report on airports\u2019 capital  development needs for 2019\u20132023, medium hub airports\u2013such as Austin- Bergstrom International Airport (Austin airport), Norman Y. Mineta San  Jose International Airport, and Dallas Love Field Airport\u2013are undertaking  major infrastructure improvement programs. According to officials from  Austin airport, the airport recently completed a 10-year plan for its capital  development program, with an estimated cost of $3.5 billion, for a new  terminal, concourse, airfield improvements, runway improvements, and  improved landside access. Austin airport officials stated that the airport is  20 years old and nearing the end of its lifecycle, and airport officials are  trying to manage aggressive growth while rebuilding the airport.", "The sources of funding and types of infrastructure projects that smaller  and larger airports have planned also differ. For example, smaller airports  have more AIP-eligible planned costs compared to larger airports,  according to FAA cost estimates. Specifically, smaller airports accounted  for about $4.6 billion (or 66 percent) of AIP-eligible project costs for all  airports but, according to ACI-NA cost estimates, only $878 million (6  percent) of AIP-ineligible projects. In addition, among AIP-eligible  projects, while the top four types of infrastructure projects that larger and  smaller airports have planned are similar (see table 1), estimated costs  are more concentrated among the top two project-type categories for  smaller airports. Specifically, reconstruction projects, which are projects  to replace or rehabilitate airport facilities such as runways, and projects to  meet FAA standards for airport design represented about 79 percent of  smaller airports\u2019 AIP-eligible estimated project costs.", "ACI-NA\u2019s data do not break out AIP-ineligible project costs by project  type. As a result, we were not able to determine what types of projects  constitute the largest shares for AIP-ineligible project costs. However,  ACI-NA does provide information about project type across all the  projects in its cost estimate. According to ACI-NA\u2019s representatives, the  types of projects that are generally not funded with AIP grants that  airports need to fund include landside projects, such as terminal projects;  rental car and parking facility projects; concession redesign projects; and  airport access projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Total Planned Infrastructure-Project Costs Have Increased in Part due to Terminal Projects", "paragraphs": ["The increase in planned infrastructure costs for fiscal years 2019 through  2023 can be attributed in part to an increase in planned terminal projects  during this 5-year time period. Specifically, both FAA\u2019s and ACI-NA\u2019s cost  estimates show an increase in planned terminal projects. For example,  according to FAA\u2019s estimates of planned projects funded by AIP grants,  terminal projects now represent the third largest share of total estimated  costs from fiscal years 2019 through 2023 and experienced the greatest  percentage increase over the previous 5-year period. As shown in table 2,  overall annual average cost estimates for terminal projects increased by  51 percent between the two periods. Environmental projects was the only  other project category that had significant increases (about 38 percent),  while estimated costs for many other types of projects decreased.  According to FAA officials, the increase in environmental projects is due  to increases in environmental-related NPIAS costs (such as mitigation of  development impacts and costs for environmental studies) at large and  medium hub airports and additional noise mitigation at hub airports.", "Similarly, according to ACI-NA\u2019s analysis, for fiscal years 2019 through  2023, terminal projects represented 53 percent of the total infrastructure- development costs among both AIP-eligible and AIP-ineligible projects.  Terminal projects included terminal building projects (37 percent) and  projects to provide access to the terminal (16 percent). FAA and ACI-NA  representatives stated that terminal projects can be more expensive than  other types of projects because of the scale of these improvements. For  example, terminal projects may involve complex vertical construction, an  array of special systems such as baggage and passenger screening  systems, and integration of security and access control systems, all of  which can contribute to the overall higher cost of these projects. In  contrast, runway and airfield infrastructure generally rely on common  design standards and standard construction methods according to ACI- NA representatives.", "Additionally, officials from most (16 out of 19) of the airports that we  spoke to stated that they are planning terminal improvement projects over  the next 5 years. Officials from these airports told us they are focused on  making terminal improvements because existing terminals are aging and  in need of repairs and to accommodate an increase in passenger  enplanements due in part to airlines using larger aircraft holding more  passengers. Examples of planned terminal projects at selected airports  and factors contributing to these investments are below.", "Large hub airport terminal project. Officials from a large hub airport  that we spoke to stated that they have two ongoing major terminal  projects. The first project will expand and renovate the airport\u2019s north  terminal. The 468,000-square-feet facility will include a new upper- level mezzanine, seismic upgrades, and an upgraded baggage- handling system, among other improvements. According to airport  officials, capacity constraints and the age of the terminal were factors  for renovating the terminal. Phase 1 of the project began in February  2017 and was completed in mid-2019. As of July 2019, nine gates are  operational. The second phase of construction is expected to be  completed in mid- 2021. The estimated cost of the project is projected  at $658 million. The airport is also developing a new international  arrivals facility at its airport. According to airport officials, this facility is  intended to significantly enhance the international passenger  experience, and improve the arrival process for international  passengers without adding new gates. Airport officials stated that the  current facility is not able accommodate the city\u2019s growing demand for  international travel. The facility is estimated to cost about $968 million  and is expected to open in the fall of 2020.", "Medium hub airport terminal project. According to officials from a  medium hub airport, growth in passenger traffic is driving the need for  a new terminal at that airport. International traffic at the airport has  tripled between 2012 and 2017, with airlines adding three new service  destinations to Europe. According to airport officials, the existing  terminal will soon reach its capacity to handle international arrivals,  and the first phase of the terminal project was substantially completed  in 2019 and cost about $350 million.", "Small hub airport terminal project. Officials from a small hub airport  stated that airlines have started replacing existing aircraft with larger  aircraft, and this process has placed capacity constraints at their  terminal. The terminal was built in 1948, and the passenger waiting  area was built in the 1960s when airlines providing service to the  airport were using aircraft with 100 seats. Now, however, airlines are  using larger aircraft, which can accommodate up to 180 seats. Airport  officials stated that they are beginning construction of a new terminal,  which will expand passenger capacity at the airport. The overall  estimated costs of the terminal project are $513 million, and the  project is expected to be completed in 2028, pending additional  funding.", "FAA officials and ACI-NA representatives agreed that the increased focus  on terminal projects is due in part to airlines changing their business  models and aircraft fleets and an increase in passenger traffic. The  officials stated that as part of the industry\u2019s fleet rationalization efforts,  airlines are eliminating some smaller aircraft and replacing them with  larger aircraft to increase passenger-seating capacity. FAA officials added  that passenger growth at large and medium hub airports is also  contributing to the increase of AIP-eligible terminal costs, as airports need  to expand terminals to add capacity. According to FAA, terminal projects  at large and medium hubs are generally funded through PFCs and other  funding sources rather than through AIP funding. For its 2019\u20132023  NPIAS report, however, FAA officials said they asked airports to provide  information about AIP-eligible projects regardless of whether they were  planning to apply for AIP funding for the projects. According to FAA  officials, this factor may also have contributed to the apparent increase in  AIP-eligible terminal costs. According to FAA, another factor driving the  increase in terminal costs is that seven airports have planned major  terminal projects over the next 5 years. The costs of these projects are  reflected in FAA\u2019s AIP-eligible cost estimate.", "In addition to an increased focus on terminal projects, FAA officials, ACI- NA representatives, and selected airports cited other factors that are  contributing to an increase in infrastructure costs estimates, such as  increased construction costs, an overall healthier economy, increased  traffic, airline consolidation, and airlines\u2019 strategic shift to focus on hub  operations. For example, according to Nashville International Airport\u2019s  officials, a growing economy has resulted in more competition for  construction materials and skilled workers, competition that has increased  construction costs in the Nashville area and has resulted in higher airport  development costs. According to ACI-NA representatives, other larger  cities such as Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and Seattle have also reported  cost escalation in their construction markets."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected Airports Cited Challenges Related to Funding Sources, AIP Eligibility Criteria, and Competing Airport and Airline Priorities", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selected Airports Stated That Insufficient Funding Is a Challenge and That They Are Taking Steps to Address These Challenges", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selected Airports Stated That Planned Infrastructure Costs Exceed Current Funding", "paragraphs": ["Officials from most (18 out of 19) selected airports we interviewed stated  that the funding and revenue available to them from existing funding  sources\u2014such as AIP grants and PFC revenues\u2014may not be sufficient  to cover the costs of future and planned infrastructure projects.

In addition, the  NPIAS estimates represent planned AIP-eligible project costs and do not  reflect actual expenditures.", "Below are some examples of AIP-eligible projects that airport officials  stated will be a challenge to complete without additional funding:", "Airfield safety projects. Officials from a small hub airport stated that  they have two major airfield-safety projects planned that are intended  to align their airport\u2019s current runway and taxiway to FAA safety  standards. According to airport officials, their airport has been on the  FAA\u2019s top-10 list of airports with highest \u201cincursions\u201d for 4 consecutive  years, and officials stated these airfield improvements would help  them mitigate runway incursions at their airport. According to airport  officials, these projects are expected to cost about $230 million, which  they stated is a significant cost for an airport of their size. Their  primary source of funding is AIP funding and PFC revenues; however,  their current AIP formula funding and PFC revenues are not sufficient  to cover the cost of the projects. Without additional funding, officials  said that they will need to complete the project in phases, which could  lead to a multi-year project ranging from 4 to 12 years to complete.  Airport officials stated that a multi-year project of this length would  significantly affect their airport operations and increase overall costs.  They also stated that ideally, it would be most efficient to execute the  project in fewer phases to reduce costs and to benefit airport users,  as construction may negatively affect airport operations.", "Runway rehabilitation project. Similarly, officials from another small  hub airport said their airport receives about $5 million annually in AIP  formula funding, which they said is not sufficient to cover the costs of  their planned runway pavement rehabilitation and reconstruction  project. The total cost of the project is about $20 million. According to  airport officials, if they are unable to find alternate sources of funding  for the project, they will have to postpone the runway project, and  such a postponement would have a significant effect on their airport  operations.", "Runway replacement project. Officials from a medium hub airport  are planning to invest in a new runway project that is expected to cost  about $350 million. The existing runway is nearing the end of its  useful life and needs to be replaced. They anticipate receiving  approximately $4.5 million annually in AIP formula funding and plan to  apply for discretionary AIP funding as well. They stated that currently,  this airport\u2019s PFC revenues have been obligated until 2032 and that  therefore, they are not able to use this funding source to pay for the  runway. According to airport officials, without these funding sources  the airport will be required to use their existing bonding capacity to  pay for this critical infrastructure, a move that would reduce their  future bonding capacity for future critical infrastructure improvements.", "Fourteen airport officials also stated that revenue generated from PFCs is  also not sufficient to cover the costs of planned infrastructure. For  example, officials from one large hub airport stated that they have been  successful in being able to keep up with the pace of growth at their  airport, but based on their forecasts, they anticipate that they would be  unable to meet infrastructure demands without an increase in PFC  funding. Officials from six airports stated that because the PFC cap has  remained at $4.50 since 2000 and has not been adjusted for inflation, the  value of the PFC has decreased. In 2015, we reported that an inflation  adjusted PFC cap would be $6.46. Representatives from eight airlines  that we spoke to, however, disagree that the PFC cap should be  increased citing increases in passenger traffic, increases in PFC  revenues, and availability of other adequate sources of funding.

Specifically, of the $16 billion in PFC revenues (or an annual average of  $3.1 billion) collected in fiscal years 2013 through 2017, airports paid a  total of $12 billion for debt service (or an annual average of $2.5 billion)\u2014 which is about 78 percent of total PFC revenues generated during this  time period. The debt service includes payments on new bonds, existing  bonds, and refinanced bonds which, as previously noted, are collectively  tracked in FAA\u2019s database. As shown in figure 8, over our 5-year time  period, larger airports accounted for the vast majority (over 90 percent) of  the PFCs dedicated to debt service.", "According to ACI-NA\u2019s report on airports\u2019 capital development needs for  2019\u20132023 and some selected airport officials, because airports have  already committed a significant portion of their current and future PFCs to  servicing debt on current or completed projects, airports will have less  PFC funding available for future projects. According to ACI-NA\u2019s report on  airports\u2019 capital development needs for 2019\u20132023, the entire national  airport system is carrying a combined debt of $91.6 billion from past  projects and may be unable to pay for future needed projects unless the  existing cap on PFCs is increased. Officials from three small hub airports  stated that they are currently facing challenges obtaining financing for  infrastructure projects, because they are already fully leveraged and have  pledged their PFCs over the mid- to long-term. For example, officials from  a small hub airport said that they obtained $120 million in financing, which  will be carried until 2040, to build a parking garage and concourse. They  said that because the airport is at capacity for debt issuance, they cannot  take on any new debt for additional infrastructure projects. FAA data  show that as of August 2019, 117 airports (about 30 percent) have  obligated their PFCs past 2030 and that 30 airports (about 8 percent)  have obligated their PFCs past 2040. One airport has obligated its PFCs  through 2070.", "While some airports we spoke to raised concerns about being able to use  debt financing for future airport-infrastructure projects, representatives  from two rating agencies that we spoke to stated that for the airports they  rate, the bond market is currently favorable, allowing for easier and  economical access to financing. Rating representatives stated that  currently, the outlook for domestic airports is either stable or positive due  to the fact that airport passenger traffic growth has exceeded the gross  domestic product\u2019s growth, and airport ratings have remained consistent.  For example, according to one rating agency, since 2012, its airport  ratings have remained consistent and the annual airport outlook in those  years has been \u201cstable\u201d or \u201cstable to positive.\u201d FAA officials added that  while the perspective of rating agencies, bond insurers, and underwriters  are important, a favorable credit rating does not mean that an airport  should make the decision to take on additional debt.

These airport officials stated that  they have deferred or delayed infrastructure investments, completed  projects in phases in order to be able to fund projects in stages, or are  looking for other ways to generate airport revenues from passenger  services or leases. For example, officials from one airport we spoke to  stated that their airport has developed a strategy of breaking up  infrastructure projects into phases so as to utilize available FAA funding.  According to these airport officials, this strategy lengthens the  construction time and results in higher construction costs, but helps the  airport to align its project needs with available FAA funding.

FAA\u2019s AIP handbook provides guidance on the criteria to  determine which components of a project are eligible for AIP funding.  AIP-eligible projects, outlined in statute, include airport planning, airport  development, noise compatibility planning, and noise compatibility  projects. Certain airport projects, such as revenue-producing parking  facilities, hangars, revenue portions of terminals, off-airport roads, and  off-airport transit facilities are not eligible for AIP funding. Some terminal  projects, however, are eligible for AIP funding, such as a terminal  structure shell\u2019s development and development of public use areas  directly related to the movement of passengers and baggage in terminal  facilities within an airport. This eligibility includes public use spaces that  passengers may need to occupy as part of their air travel or utility support  space needed to make the public space operational, including the  mechanical and electrical rooms.", "Four airport officials we spoke to stated that they have infrastructure  projects planned that are eligible for AIP discretionary funding, but that  due to FAA\u2019s criteria for AIP discretionary funding and FAA\u2019s process for  prioritizing projects, it is difficult for airports to receive discretionary  funding for these projects. According to FAA officials, the eligibility criteria  for AIP projects funded through entitlement and discretionary funding are  the same. Discretionary funding, however, has some additional  restrictions. For example, large, medium, and small hub airports are not  eligible to use discretionary funding for terminal building projects. General  aviation airports, however, may use discretionary funding for some airport  terminal projects. In addition, unlike with entitlement funding, discretionary  funding is not reimbursable and airports cannot apply for discretionary  funding for projects that have already begun construction.", "In addition, unlike entitlement funding, not all airports receive  discretionary funding. Airports must compete for the limited amount of  discretionary funding available each year based on FAA\u2019s AIP  prioritization. According to FAA officials, while discretionary funding  criteria do not change year to year, FAA may fund projects with  discretionary funding one year, but a similar project may not receive  discretionary funding a different year due to the project mix that year. FAA  officials also stated that in September 2019, FAA updated its Formulation  of the NPIAS and Airports Capital Improvement Plan order, which lays out  the criteria and prioritization process for selecting projects for  discretionary funding. According to FAA officials, projects with the  highest priority include safety- and runway-related projects, such as  runway signage or resolving complex geometry causing runway  incursions. FAA officials stated that other projects have lower priority and  ranking in the AIP discretionary-funding prioritization process. Below are  examples from airport officials that stated they have certain projects  planned that are eligible for AIP discretionary funding but that they believe  will likely not rank high in FAA\u2019s prioritization:", "Non-airfield projects. According to officials from a large hub airport  we interviewed, the airport has made several investments in their  airfield in the last few years and does not have any major airfield  projects planned. These officials stated that they do have several non- airfield projects planned that are AIP-eligible, such as renovating gate  holding areas in the terminal. However, airport officials stated that  non-airfield projects do not compete well for AIP discretionary funding  based on FAA\u2019s prioritization process. As a result, they do not  anticipate that they will receive AIP funding for these projects.", "Airfield projects. Similarly, airport officials from one medium hub  airport explained that some of the airfield projects that they have  planned, are eligible for AIP discretionary funding, but are not  considered \u201chigh priority\u201d projects according to FAA prioritization  criteria. For example, they currently have a taxiway and apron  upgrade project planned, but this project may not compete well  against other projects when considering FAA\u2019s AIP prioritization  process. According to this airport official, runways are the highest  priority and almost always get AIP funding. The official added,  however, that the farther away you get from the runway, the less likely  it is that you will be able to get AIP funding for the project.", "In addition, five airport officials noted that while overall AIP grant-funding  levels have remained relatively constant in recent years, demand for  discretionary AIP grant funding has increased, thereby increasing  competition for this funding. According to FAA officials, the amount of  funding that FAA has available for discretionary grants changes year-to- year. For example, the amount of discretionary funding allocated to  airports annually can vary based on an airport\u2019s decisions to carry  entitlement funding over multiple years, as entitlement funding that is  carried over becomes discretionary. According to FAA officials, because a  very high percentage of discretionary funding comes from funding that  has been carried over, it is difficult for airports to plan for or count on this  funding being available in any given year. Between fiscal years 2013  through 2017, the amount of discretionary funding that was awarded  averaged $1.6 billion annually. Of this amount, the amount representing  \u201cpure\u201d discretionary funding averaged $56 million annually or about 4  percent of total AIP discretionary funding. Pure discretionary funding  refers to the amount remaining after discretionary set-asides have been  funded. FAA distributes pure discretionary funding to eligible projects at  any airport on a competitive basis.", "As previously discussed, an additional $1 billion in supplemental  discretionary AIP funding was appropriated in 2018, and an additional  $500 million was appropriated in discretionary AIP funding in 2019.  However, according to FAA officials, the number of applications they  received for this funding exceeded the amount of funding that was  available. Specifically, according to officials, FAA received more than  2,500 funding requests totaling more than $10 billion in 2018 for the $1  billion authorized as supplemental discretionary AIP grant funding. As of  May 2019, FAA has awarded or anticipates awarding $985 million in  supplemental discretionary AIP grant funding to 164 airports in 50 states,  the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The supplemental grants fund  projects ranging from runway reconstruction and rehabilitation, to the  construction of taxiways, aprons, and terminals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Competing Airport and Airline Priorities May Affect Airport Infrastructure Investments", "paragraphs": ["About half (12 out of 19) of the airport officials we spoke to stated that  competing airport and airline priorities for capital infrastructure  investments can pose challenges to funding infrastructure projects and  can delay projects. For example, some of these officials stated that if an  airline does not agree that there is a business case or that an  infrastructure project is justified, then that lack of agreement can affect  the airport\u2019s ability to fund the project or delay the project altogether. The  extent to which airlines are involved in the decision-making of airport  infrastructure investments varies by airport and depends on the type of  \u201cuse-and-lease\u201d agreement between the airport and the airline. These  agreements set forth the terms and conditions for establishing airline  rates and charges and investing in capital improvements. Some  agreements have a \u201cmajority-in-interest\u201d (MII) provision, which requires  airports to obtain airlines\u2019 approval for certain infrastructure investments.  One large hub airport stated that they have an MII agreement, requiring  airlines\u2019 approval of certain projects and project financing strategies. They  further explained that debt financing would affect their airline rates and  charges and would therefore require the airport to obtain approval from  airlines before using general airport-revenue bonds on a project. While  airport officials would like to add more gates to the airport and finance  that project with general airport revenue bonds, these officials stated that  some airlines may not support unassigned gate additions because it  could increase competition. According to FAA officials we spoke with,  some airports have been able to move toward shorter-term agreements  with greater flexibility to adapt to changing needs; however, many  agreements still include some form of MII provisions.", "According to officials from four smaller airports, airlines are less likely to  support infrastructure-related increases in airline rates and charges at  smaller airports than at larger airports. For example, a non-hub airport  stated that smaller airports have a more difficult time negotiating higher  rates and charges with airlines because of competition from other nearby  airports. ACI-NA representatives also stated that medium hub airports  that are not connecting hubs for the three large U.S. network airlines have  less of an opportunity to receive capital investments from network airlines  compared to larger airports.", "Representatives from all eight airlines that we spoke to stated that the  types of airport infrastructure projects that they see a need for are  demand-driven infrastructure development projects that expand airfield  capacity, increase the number of gates at an airport, or address safety. Of  these airlines, six also stated that they see a need for infrastructure  development at larger airports in particular. For example, representatives  from one airline stated that they want to collaborate with airports on  capital development projects that are scalable and where passenger  enplanements are increasing. In addition, representatives from five  airlines that we spoke to said that they would like to have more input on  airport infrastructure investment decisions. In addition, representatives  from five airlines raised concerns that airlines do not have a role in  decisions on how airports can invest PFC revenues. According to our  prior work, PFCs provide airports a source of funding for airport  development over which they have greater local control and airlines have  more limited say in their use as compared to the use of airport terminal  rents or landing fees.", "In addition, representatives from two airlines we spoke to said that FAA  exercises limited oversight of infrastructure projects funded by PFCs, and  that this limited oversight results in airports\u2019 using PFC funding for  projects that airlines do not see a need for. The representatives stated  that FAA largely approves most PFC applications for projects and that  they believe FAA should do more to ensure that airports are not using  PFC revenues for unnecessary capital development not supported by  airlines. For example, one airline objected to the use of over $1.5 billion of  PFC funds for the multi-phase construction of the Phoenix Sky Train  linking light rail, parking, and terminals, as representatives believed that  there was not an adequate business case to justify the construction of the  Sky Train. According to these airline officials, because the airport used  PFC revenues for the project, other necessary terminal improvements  have been largely debt funded. According to FAA officials, when  reviewing PFC applications, they assess the extent to which the airport  has demonstrated a need for the project. FAA officials stated that airports  are familiar with FAA criteria and will generally not submit projects that  will not meet the criteria and that could be denied.

Beginning in the 1980s and through the 1990s, governments outside of  the United States began shifting toward privatization and deregulation of  airports. According to the 2016 Airports Council International - World\u2019s  (ACI-World) inventory of privatized airports worldwide, 614 commercial  service airports (14 percent) have private sector participation. Although  ACI-World estimates that a majority (86 percent) of the 4,300 airports with  scheduled traffic around the world are publicly owned by a government or  government entity, airports with private sector participation handle over  40 percent of all global air traffic.", "Today, there is a range of airports\u2019 ownership and operating models.  Through a literature review of ACI-World\u2019s, the Airports Council  International - EUROPE\u2019s (ACI- EUROPE), the International Civil Aviation  Organization\u2019s, and the International Air Transport Association\u2019s reports  and other documents, we identified five general types of airport ownership  structures outside of the United States:", "Government owned and operated: The airport is fully owned and  operated by a public authority or by a mixture of public authorities at a  local, regional, national, or transnational level.", "Government owned and privately operated: The airport is  government owned but the airport operator\u2014considered as the entity  that is responsible for the day-to-day operation of airport services and  facilities\u2014is a private company.", "Partially privatized: The airport is partially privatized (e.g., mixed  public-private ownership), meaning the airports\u2019 shares are owned by  a combination of private investor(s) and public authorities of the  country where the airport is located.", "Fully privatized: The airport is fully owned and operated by a  commercial company wholly owned by private individuals or  enterprises.", "Not-for-profit, private corporation: The airport has been transferred  to or leased by a not-for-profit corporation. The not-for-profit  corporation is expected to be financially self-sufficient and fully  responsible for funding all operating and infrastructure costs.", "While U.S. airports are predominantly publicly owned and operated,  private participation, like private ownership or private operation contracts,  is more common at airports in other countries.", "Airport Ownership in the United States  In the United States, nearly all of the 3,330 commercial-service or  general-aviation airports, designated as part of the national airport  system, are publicly owned by local and state governments, regional  airport authorities, or port authorities. Airport ownership in the United  States has evolved under a public model since the 1920s as a way to  promote the development of the U.S. aviation industry. In 1996, the  Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996 established the Airport  Privatization Pilot Program, which reduced some of the barriers to  privatizing airports, and allowed for commercial service airports to be  leased and for general aviation airports to be sold or leased. However, as  we have previously reported, 18 years following the program\u2019s inception,  two airports have privatized, with one of these airports reverting to public  control.", "While participation in the Airport Privatization Pilot Program has been  very limited, some airports have entered into public-private partnerships  with private entities through management contracts for terminals, which  may be leased or outsourced to airlines or other contractors, or for food,  rental car, and other concession agreements. For example, the Paine  Field Snohomish County Airport in Washington, previously a general  aviation airport, entered into a ground-lease agreement with a private  airport developer\u2014Propeller Airports\u2014to build and operate a small  passenger terminal for commercial service. The terminal was open for  commercial service in March 2019, and is depicted in figure 9. Propeller  Airports is responsible for the landside infrastructure investments and  terminal maintenance. Snohomish County is responsible for maintaining  and operating the airside infrastructure, which includes the runways and  taxiways, but leases the aprons and the terminal land to Propeller  Airports.", "Airport Ownership in Other Countries  Privatized airports are more prevalent in foreign countries. According to a  2016 report by ACI-EUROPE, which examined ownership structures of  airports across Europe, about 41 percent of European airports are fully  privately owned or partially privatized. According to ACI-World, 75  percent of airports with passenger traffic in Europe have private sector  involvement through fully privatized airports or public-private partnerships.  Latin America-Caribbean airports (60 percent) and Asian airports (45  percent) have the second and third highest private sector involvement.  Industry stakeholders we interviewed said that in some Asian countries,  such as Japan and Singapore, airports that were previously government  owned have already privatized or are transitioning to privatization. In addition, while ownership models can vary by country, they can also vary  within a country. For example, according to ACI-EUROPE\u2019s 2016 report,  the United Kingdom\u2019s airports are 53 percent fully private, 26 percent  partially privatized, and 21 percent fully public.", "As we have previously reported, different airport ownership structures,  motivations, and financing have driven airport privatization in other  countries. For example, in several countries, the national government  built, owned, and operated the country\u2019s airports prior to privatization. We  previously reported that national ownership enables a central government  to direct the sale of its airports and can make for a more streamlined  privatization transaction, reducing transaction costs for both the public- sector owner and private-sector bidders. Foreign governments may also  be more motivated to privatize their airports than U.S. public-sector  airport owners. According to the International Civil Aviation Organization,  foreign governments\u2019 reasons for privatizing their airports vary, including  an identified need for private-sector capital investments in existing or new  airports and a national move toward privatization of public assets or  companies. We have previously reported that airports in other countries  often have less access to public funds or tax-exempt bonds than publicly  owned and operated U.S. airports, making them more reliant on private  financing for airport improvements. Our prior work found that a key factor  that can hinder U.S. airport privatization is the loss of some federal AIP  funds and the loss of easy access to tax-exempt financing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Foreign Airports Generally Do Not Rely on Government Funding for Infrastructure Projects", "paragraphs": ["Most of the five foreign airports we selected for our review do not receive  government funding.

Some foreign airport  representatives told us that revenue from airline rates and charges are  not required to be used for aeronautical-related costs or infrastructure, or  within the airport. Some airports, such as Helsinki Airport, may operate  within a consortium network, where revenue is shared among all airports  in the network to cover costs. Additionally, some airports have regulations  for setting airline rates and charges. For example, the Civil Aviation  Authority in the United Kingdom regulates Heathrow Airport\u2019s airline rates  and charges. Selected airport representatives we spoke with said that  they consult airlines when adjusting airline rates and charges. For  example, the Helsinki Airport official said that the airport updates its  airline charges once a year and that airlines have an opportunity for the  airlines to appeal the change.", "Representatives from the International Air Transport Association and the  Steer Group Inc. said that some foreign airports may have higher airline  rates and charges compared to some airports in the United States due to  several factors, including the need to generate returns for private  financing and flexibility in setting rates and charges, as outlined below.", "Generating returns for private financing. Foreign airports with  private investment or financing may have higher rates because they  need to generate returns to pay back private financing. Privately  owned airports may also be under pressure to generate returns for  investors and therefore need to further divert revenue from funding  infrastructure.", "Flexibility in setting rates and charges. Foreign airports generally  have greater flexibility to set airline charges to meet airport needs, a  flexibility that may result in higher rates and charges. For example,  Canadian airports are generally able to set and adjust airline and  passenger charges as needed, and charges vary by airport. In  Singapore, Changi Airport has a passenger charge and a pre-funding  levy for its new terminal project. Airports in the United Kingdom,  including Heathrow Airport, have a regulator that sets the airline and  passenger charge cap, and adjusts it every 2 years.", "In addition, foreign airports have limited airline input on determining  airport capital investments and fees charged to airlines. For example,  according to ACI-WORLD, airports consult airlines on airport charges and  on capital developments, but airport proposals can usually be  implemented even if airlines do not support them, as long as a due and  proper consultation process is held. An international airline stakeholder  said that the extent of airline input on airport capital investment and fees  charged to airlines is dependent on the country\u2019s specific regulatory  model and the willingness of the airport operator to consult with airlines,  but that in some countries, airline consultation is limited. Representatives  from our selected foreign airports said they generally keep airlines  informed. For example, the Toronto Pearson International Airport has a  consultative committee approach with airlines on larger projects costing  over $50 million.

As of  October 2019, for the foreign airports we reviewed, passenger charges  ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $9.65 to $58.58 per local traffic  passenger (see table 4). Industry stakeholders and international airport  association stakeholders said that U.S. airports have a unique ownership  and funding model compared to foreign airports. U.S. airports have an  element of public control of funding through the federal Airport  Improvement Program (AIP) grants and passenger facility charges (PFC),  as projects funded through these sources must receive approval from the  Federal Aviation Administration. According to these stakeholders, U.S.  airports are subject to different regulations related to setting passenger  charges. As a result, we have determined that the comparability of these  charges is limited. In addition, differences in ownership models, private  investment, and funding between U.S. and foreign airports also limited  the comparability of these charges. Table 4 provides an overview of  passenger charges and levies at selected airports in other countries.", "Selected foreign airports adjust passengers\u2019 charges based on the  airport\u2019s building and infrastructure needs and the cost imposed by  passengers on the airport system. How and when these airports make  adjustments varies. For example, one of our selected airports has a  government entity that regulates passenger charges. More specifically,  the Civil Aviation Authority in the United Kingdom regulates Heathrow  Airport\u2019s passenger charges. Every 5 years, the Civil Aviation Authority  determines the maximum amount that the airport can charge based on  the costs incurred by the airport. Other selected airports consider  adjustments on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis, including the Toronto Pearson  International Airport. Representatives from the Toronto Pearson  International Airport said that they set and adjust passenger charges as  needed to fund infrastructure investments. The airport assesses charges  annually and only adjusts the passenger charges if there is a material  imbalance between required cost recoveries against charges. Airport  officials also stated the airport increases airline rates and passenger  charges only when needed to generate sufficient revenue to cover the  costs of planned infrastructure.", "Similar to airline rates and charges, selected foreign airport  representatives told us that there generally are no restrictions on how the  airports use revenue from passenger charges for infrastructure or  operational costs. Industry stakeholders said that some airports, such as  Heathrow Airport, do not have revenue diversion limitations, so revenue  generated from passenger charges at the airport is not required to be  reinvested back into the airport. Comparatively in the United States,  airport revenue is regulated and generally speaking, revenue generated  by the airport must go toward certain costs at the airport.", "Most of our selected foreign airport representatives (4 out of 5) also said  that they rely on debt financing, through private bonds or commercial  loans. Industry stakeholders said that airport debt financing internationally  is similar to that in the United States, but foreign airports generally do not  have access to the municipal bond market. Airports\u2019 bonds are generally  tax exempt in the United States. Representatives of our selected foreign  airports said that they use various types of debt financing, including  commercial loans from financial institutions; equity or debt financing, such  as bonds in commercial capital markets; or loans from private investors.", "Most of our selected foreign airports (3 out of 5) do not receive  government funding. International airport associations said that the extent  to which an airport receives government funding may depend on whether  the government owns the airport or has a role in operating the airport. For  example, Changi Airport officials said that the Singaporean government is  providing Changi\u2019s government-owned, privately operated airport an  unspecified amount of government funding for their new Terminal 5  project. In another example, Toronto Pearson International Airport does  not receive government funding; however, in Canada, small or rural  airports can receive some funding from the Canadian Airports Capital  Assistance Program.

For example, Helsinki Airport provides  direct service to 162 international destinations, including 22 direct flights  to Asia. Helsinki Airport has experienced strong passenger growth in  recent years. In 2018, Helsinki Airport had 21-million passenger  boardings, an increase from the prior year of about 10 percent. Most of  this increase was attributable to international traffic. The Finavia  representative said that Finavia anticipates passenger traffic to slow in  2020, due to an anticipated slowdown in Europe\u2019s economic growth.", "Main Sources of Funding and Financing for Airport  Infrastructure Investments   According to the Finavia representative, Helsinki Airport\u2019s main sources of  funding for infrastructure improvements are (1) airline rates and charges,  (2) passenger charges, (3) other airport-generated revenue, and (4) debt financing. Helsinki Airport collects aeronautical revenue from airline rates and charges and passenger charges directly from the airlines. Helsinki Airport does not receive any public or government funding, despite being government owned, and the airport does not have any public-private partnerships.", "In 2010, Finavia began operating as  a limited liability company, rather  than a government agency. The  Finnish government corporatized  Finavia to align with the European  Union (EU) principles on EU  services, movement of services, and  competition. The Finavia  representative said that the change  in corporate structure helps ensure  that the government is not  subsidizing or promoting unfair  competition practices.", "Airline rates and charges: Helsinki Airport generates revenue from air carrier and other aircraft operator rates and charges such as landing, aircraft parking, and electricity charges. In 2019, Finavia raised airline charges by 2.1 percent from 2018 levels, prompted by higher service costs resulting from airport investments. The Finavia representative said that airline rates and charges make up approximately 40 percent of the airport\u2019s total aeronautical revenue.", "Under the airport network approach,  Finavia can offset losses at one  airport with revenue from a more  successful airport. The Finavia  representative said that some  airports in the network are self- sustaining and generate sufficient  revenue to cover the costs of airport  operations; other network airports  do not.  According to the Finavia  representative, Finavia applies  uniform airport charges within the  airport network to  recover  operational and infrastructure costs", "Passenger charges: Helsinki Airport collects a passenger charge from airlines in order to fund infrastructure used for servicing the passengers. As of January 2019, Helsinki Airport has a euro (\u20ac) 8.60 (U.S. dollar (USD) $9.65) fee per departing passenger and a across the airport network and to  comply with EU directives on  airport charges. \u20ac4.10 (USD $4.60) fee per transferring passenger. The Finavia  representative said that passenger fees make up approximately  60 percent of the airport\u2019s total aeronautical revenue, which  include both airline and passenger fees. According to the Finavia  representative, Helsinki Airport does not designate revenue from  airline and passenger charges for a specific use. Revenue from  airline and passenger charges has been used to cover costs from  providing services and operations within the Finavia network.", "According to the Finavia representative, aeronautical charges,  including airline rates and charges and passenger charges, are  evaluated and updated once a year and Finavia sets the same  charges for all airports in the Finavia airport network.", "Other airport-generated revenue: Helsinki Airport also  generates non-aeronautical revenues from sources such as  concessions, commercial services at terminals, parking services,  security control, and rental income from real estate.", "Debt financing: Helsinki Airport uses debt financing from a  variety sources, including private banks, financial institutions, and  public sector sources such as the European Investment Bank, a  financing institution financed by the European Union, and the  Nordic Investment Bank. The financing that Helsinki Airport has  obtained is similar to traditional debt financing. According to the  Finavia representative, Helsinki Airport does not have any  restrictions or legal requirements on the types of loans that the  airport can take on, nor does Finavia pledge revenue from any  specific source towards the repayment of loans. However, the  Finavia representative stated that Finavia does not issue bonds.  The representative said that generally, the airport has relied on  traditional lending because it is easier to obtain and repay a bank  loan as compared to other types of debt.", "Factors Considered when Setting Airline and Passenger  Charges  The representative said Finavia considers several factors when  setting airline and passenger charges. The Finnish Act on the Airport  and Network and Airport Charges requires that the pricing of airport  charges within the airport network are uniform, common, and  transparent, based on the service level offered, and are applied on  non-discriminatory and equal grounds. Finavia therefore considers  the Finavia airport network revenue; the cost of providing  aeronautical services (including operational and electricity costs);  and the costs of capital for infrastructure investment when setting the  airport\u2019s airline rates and charges. According to the Finavia  representative, Helsinki Airport also considers the airport market to  ensure that its airline and passenger fees are competitive with  similar airports in other European countries. When Finavia makes  changes to its airline or passenger charges, the Finavia  representative said that airlines have an opportunity to appeal the  change. The Finnish Transport and Communications Agency acts as  an independent supervisory authority to process disagreements on  airport charges.", "Coordination with Airlines on Capital Development  As part of the capital development process, Finavia must consult  with airlines to seek input on planned capital investments at the  airport before the airport carries out any major new infrastructure  projects. Finavia organizes these discussions to assist with  negotiations, but the Finavia representative said these discussions  are specific to the individual airport rather than the overall Finavia  network. In addition, according to the Finavia representative, when  setting airline and passenger charges, Finavia consults with airlines  and provides information about how airport charges relate to the  facilities and services at the airport.", "According to the Finavia representative, the Helsinki Airport development  program, initiated in 2014 with a 2030 anticipated completion date, is the  largest expansion project in the airport\u2019s history. It will expand Helsinki  Airport\u2019s capacity and increase the number of gates. For example, the  airport has planned a terminal building project that will expand the  terminal by 45 percent and double the number of gates for wide-body  aircraft from eight to 16 gates.", "In 2016, as seen in figure 10, Helsinki Airport opened one of the  passenger terminal expansions, which added 12 new departure gates to  the airport. On the airside, the airport will also renovate the apron area to  accommodate large aircraft. Additionally, Helsinki Airport is working on a  project to improve luggage and baggage handling capabilities to  accommodate the anticipated increase in baggage volume expected from  airlines\u2019 use of larger aircraft.", "According to the Finavia representative, Helsinki Airport planned these  capital improvements in response to expected passenger traffic growth.

The Civil Aviation Authority\u2014a government agency\u2014 regulates airport charges for U.K. airports with more than 5-million annual  passengers. Airports Council International (ACI)-EUROPE  representatives said that the Civil Aviation Authority regulates Heathrow  on the basis that Heathrow is likely to possess significant market power  for aeronautical services.", "In 1987, the United Kingdom  privatized the British Airports  Authority due to limited government  funding and a need for significant  capital development at large  airports, according to Heathrow  Airport representatives and industry  stakeholders. All seven airports  owned by the authority were  privatized. The authority was  subsequently acquired in 2006 by  an international consortium led by  Ferrovial Aeropuertos S.A. of Spain  (Ferrovial S.A.) and named BAA Ltd.  This entity was later renamed  Heathrow Airport Holdings Limited.", "The United Kingdom became the  first country to privatize its major  airports.

These charges include landing, parking, and emissions  charges. Under the authority of the Civil Aviation Act of 2012, the Civil  Aviation Authority establishes a pricing formula known as the  \u201cmaximum revenue yield,\u201d which sets limits on the airline and  passenger charges on a per-passenger basis. In 2018, Heathrow  Airport generated pounds (\u00a3) 549 million (U.S. dollar (USD) $734  million) in landing and parking charges, according to Heathrow  Airport\u2019s 2018 financial statements.", "Passenger charges: Heathrow Airport has several categories of  passenger charges, which vary in rates depending upon the time of  year of travel; whether the passenger is on a departing, transfer, or  transit flight; or whether the flight destination is inside or outside of the  European Union. For example, under the 2019 charges for Heathrow  Airport, the passenger service charge would range from \u00a319.84 to  \u00a346.02 (USD $25.25 to USD $58.58). In 2018, Heathrow Airport  generated \u00a31.2 billion (USD $1.6 billion) in revenue from passenger  charges, according to Heathrow Airport\u2019s 2018 financial statements.", "Other airport-generated revenue: Heathrow Airport also generates  other revenue from retail airport concessions, parking, and other  sources. Heathrow Airport generated \u00a3656 million (USD $876 million)  from these sources in 2018, according to Heathrow Airport  representatives.", "Debt financing: Heathrow airport also relies on debt financing to fund  infrastructure projects. In 2018, Heathrow (SP) Limited raised  approximately \u00a32.3 billion (USD $3.1 billion) of debt financing to fund  infrastructure projects. According to Heathrow Airport  representatives, as of 2018, the airport has a total debt of \u00a312 billion  (USD $16 billion), which includes shareholders\u2019 indebted equity.", "According to Heathrow Airport representatives, Heathrow Airport\u2019s largest  source of funding is from airline rates and charges and passenger  charges, and in 2018 the airport generated \u00a31.7 billion (USD $2.3 billion)  from airline and passenger charges combined.", "Factors Considered when Setting Airline and Passenger  Charges   As previously discussed, the Civil Aviation Authority is responsible for  economic regulation of Heathrow and other airports in the United  Kingdom. Specifically, it regulates airline and passenger charges and  determines the maximum amount in fees that Heathrow Airport can  charge airlines and passengers on a 5-year basis, with adjustments every  2 years as needed. The level of airport charges that Heathrow levies each  year is in accordance with the aviation authority\u2019s pricing formula.", "Each year, Heathrow Airport publishes Conditions of Use that describes  its airport charges. According to Heathrow Airport representatives, they  have flexibility in how they categorize charges, but the charges must align  with the European Union\u2019s and United Kingdom\u2019s non-discrimination  principle standards and with the Civil Aviation Authority\u2019s regulations.  According to Heathrow Airport representatives, they consider several  factors, such as the infrastructure needs at the airport and the real cost of  providing services, when setting airport charges. They also set charges to  influence and incentivize airline behavior. For example, to incentivize  airlines to replace aircraft with newer, less polluting models, the airport  charges airlines a higher fee per landing when they use older aircraft. In  addition, Heathrow\u2019s passenger fees vary depending on the passenger\u2019s  anticipated airport use and with the costs imposed on the airport system.  For example, passengers on domestic flights have lower charges than  passengers traveling on international flights. This differential is because  domestic passengers do not use the same facilities or the same baggage  facilities as an international passenger and the costs of those facilities are  higher than for facilities serving domestic passengers.", "Coordination with Airlines on Capital Development   Heathrow Airport coordinates with airlines on capital development. For  example, the airport organized an Airport Consultative Committee  structure to obtain input on its most recent capital development plan from  the 93 airlines operating at the airport. According to representatives from  the International Air Transport Association, which is an association that  represents airlines, the airport used this committee to reach agreement  with these airlines on a capital expenditure plan related to development at  multiple terminals at the airport.", "Recent and Planned Infrastructure Investments at Heathrow  Airport   According to Heathrow Airport representatives, within the last 15 years,  Heathrow Airport has completed two large capital-development projects,  and the airport is currently in a planning phase. In 2008, Heathrow Airport  opened Terminal 5, which had a total project cost of \u00a34.3 billion (USD $8  billion).

The  new runway is intended to alleviate constraints on the number of available  slots for landing and takeoff. According to Heathrow Airport  representatives, the new runway is expected to add capacity for at least  an additional 260,000 flights per year, and the overall project will expand  the airport\u2019s surface space by 50 percent. Representatives said that  according to current plans, construction of the runway and associated  terminal is expected to begin in 2022 and operations are expected to start  in 2027.

In 1994, the Canadian  federal government issued the  National Airports Policy, which  created different ownership  structures for NAS and non-NAS  airports.", "The Greater Toronto Airports Authority assumed operations and  management of Toronto Pearson in 1996 through a lease arrangement  with the federal government. According to representatives from the  airports authority, because Toronto Pearson generates the most  revenues among Canadian airports, the authority pays the highest ground  lease rate for Toronto Pearson among Canadian airports.  For every  Canadian dollar (CAD) $1 (U.S. dollar (USD) $0.75) that the airport  authority earns in revenue over CAD $250 million (USD $188 million), it  pays CAD $0.12 cents (USD $.09) for the ground lease.", "For NAS airports, the National  Airports Policy devolved  responsibility for the operations,  management and expenditures of  NAS airports from the federal  government to Canadian Airport  Authorities, which were set up as  not-for-profit and non-share  corporations. The Canadian  government, however, still owns  these airports. Under the law,  Canadian Airport Authorities pay  lease payments to the government  under 60-year leases that include an  option to renew for 20 years. These  airport authorities are required to  invest airport-generated revenues in  airport operation and capital  development.", "Passenger traffic at Toronto Pearson has increased in recent years and  representatives from the Greater Toronto Airports Authority stated that  according to their projections, passenger traffic is expected to continue to  increase. In 2018, about 48-million passengers traveled through Toronto  Pearson\u2014an increase of 2.4 million, or 5 percent, over the prior year.  According to these representatives, about 70 percent of this traffic is from  origin and destination passengers and 30 percent from connecting  passengers. According to the airports authority\u2019s forecasts, passenger  traffic at Toronto Pearson is expected to increase to 85 million in 2037.", "By contrast, for non-NAS airports,  the National Airports Policy  transferred ownership of these  airports from the federal government  to regional or local entities, such as   local municipalities. The  government continues to support  remote and Arctic non-NAS  airports that service isolated  communities.", "Main Sources of Funding and Financing for Airport  Infrastructure Investments   Toronto Pearson\u2019s main sources of funding for capital improvements are  (1) airline rates and charges, (2) passenger charges, (3) other airport- generated revenues, and (4) debt financing. Toronto Pearson does not  receive any government funding, although some limited government  funding is available to smaller airports through Canada\u2019s Airports Capital  Assistance Program.", "Airline rates and charges: Toronto Pearson collects revenue from  airline rates and charges, which include landing fees, terminal fees for  general use of the terminal space, apron fees, deicing facility fees,  and other airline charges. According to representatives from the  Greater Toronto Airports Authority, airline rates and charges at  Toronto Pearson have not been increased since 2012. Toronto  Pearson generated about CAD $510 million (USD $393 million) in  airline rates and charges in 2018 according to Toronto Pearson\u2019s  2018 annual report.", "Passenger charges: Passenger charges, called Airport Improvement  Fees, are fees charged at every major Canadian airport and currently  range from CAD $5 to CAD $40 (USD $3.76 to USD $30.12) per  passenger. Each airport authority sets its own passenger fees, and  there is no cap on how much each airport can charge. According to an  international industry stakeholder, airport authorities, such as the  Greater Toronto Airports Authority, set their respective fees based on  their analysis of what the market can bear. Toronto Pearson\u2019s  passenger fee is CAD $25 (USD $18.82) for departing passengers  and CAD $4 (USD $3.01) for passengers connecting through the  airport as of January 1, 2019. The airport can only use this revenue  for aeronautical-related expenses, such as capital development. The  Greater Toronto Airports Authority has an agreement with each air  carrier that takes off from and lands at Toronto Pearson whereby air  carriers agree to collect passenger fees from each of their enplaned  passengers on behalf of the authority. The airports authority commits  in these agreements to use passenger-fee revenues for capital  programs, including associated debt service. According to  representatives from the Greater Toronto Airports Authority, the  airport has not increased its passenger fees since 2012, as the  increased volume of passengers has generated sufficient revenue for  the airport. In 2018, Toronto Pearson generated CAD $460 million  (USD $355 million) from passenger fees, in the form of Airport  Improvement Fees, according to Toronto Pearson\u2019s 2018 annual  report.", "Other airport-generated revenues: Toronto Pearson also generates  revenue from other sources such as airport concessions, rental  properties, car rentals, parking, and advertising. The Greater Toronto  Airports Authority has more flexibility in how it can use this category of  revenue, including for operating costs and for capital needs.  According to the Greater Toronto Airports Authority\u2019s 2018 annual  report, the long-term objective is to increase the proportion of total  revenues generated through commercial streams at the airport\u2014from  non-aeronautical sources such as parking, retail, and dining  concessions\u2014to over 40 percent. In recent years, commercial  revenues have been the fastest growing component of the airport  authority\u2019s revenues. In 2018, Toronto Pearson generated about CAD  $502 million (USD $387 million) in other airport-generated revenue,  according to Toronto Pearson\u2019s 2018 annual report.", "Debt financing: Canadian airports can generally use equity or raise  debt in capital markets. In 2018, Toronto Pearson obtained CAD $500  million (USD $386 million) in bond financing. According to  representatives from the Greater Toronto Airports Authority, the  authority issues bonds to fund existing bond maturities and capital  programs that exceed cash from operations. Revenue from passenger  fees, in the form of Airport Improvement Fees, are used to service  debt for infrastructure projects. Projects that cost less than CAD $400  million (USD $301 million) are funded with passenger-fee revenues,  airline rates and charges, and other airport-generated revenues,  according to these representatives.", "Factors Considered when Setting Airline and Passenger  Charges  Representatives from the Greater Toronto Airports Authority stated that  the structure that Toronto Pearson has in place allows the airport to  increase airline rates and passenger charges only when needed to  generate sufficient revenue to cover the costs of planned infrastructure.  According to these representatives, charges are assessed annually, but  only change if there is a material imbalance between required cost  recoveries against charges. To establish airline rates and charges and  passenger fees, the Toronto Pearson Airport uses the \u201cdual till\u201d model  whereby airline and passenger charges are set to recover aeronautical  costs only. This contrasts with the \u201csingle till\u201d model where all airport  activities (including aeronautical and non-aeronautical) are taken into  consideration when determining the level of airport charges.  Representatives from the Greater Toronto Airports Authority stated that  Toronto Pearson is unique among Canadian airports in doing so.", "Coordination with Airlines on Capital Development   As part of Toronto Pearson\u2019s passenger-fee agreements with airlines, the  Greater Toronto Airports Authority must consult with airlines and obtain  approval for certain capital projects in excess of CAD $50 million (USD  $38 million). Approval is sought through an airline consultation committee  that the airport authority established to include representatives from  airlines that provide service at Toronto Pearson. If the consultative  committee does not approve a project, the airport must put the project on  hold for 1 year. After the 1-year hold, the project may be initiated.  According to representatives from the Greater Toronto Airports Authority,  if the airport has a major capital project planned, the authority keeps the  airline community informed. In particular, the airport communicates  regularly with the two major Canadian airlines, which make up 70 percent  of the airport\u2019s service volume, to keep them informed of planned  infrastructure improvements.", "Recent and Planned Infrastructure Investments at Toronto  Pearson Airport   In 2018, the Greater Toronto Airports Authority completed several  infrastructure improvements at Toronto Pearson, according to Toronto  Pearson\u2019s 2018 annual report (see fig. 14). Some of these improvements  relate to ongoing projects that the airport initiated in prior years. For  example, the airports authority is upgrading and expanding its capacity at  Terminal 1 to accommodate narrow-body aircraft operations in response  to increased passenger traffic. During 2018, the authority expended CAD  $16 million (USD $12 million) for this project. In addition, the airport  expended about CAD $13 million (USD $10 million) in 2018 to make  improvements at Terminal 3, which is intended to enhance passenger  experience and improve passenger flow. The Greater Toronto Airports  Authority also expended about CAD $23 million (USD $18 million) on  Phase 1 of its baggage-handling improvement project, which will add  baggage-handling capacity and is intended to improve system reliability.", "According to representatives from the Greater Toronto Airports Authority,  the authority has developed a 5-year capital plan that includes several  projects intended to increase capacity and improve passenger flow at the  airport. For example, the airports authority has begun the design phase  for construction of a new concourse at Terminal 1 and an expansion  project at that terminal. The airports authority is also in the design phase  for constructing an integrated Regional Transit and Passenger Centre,  and replacement of the baggage systems. The airport also plans to add  more retail space and provide U.S. Customs and Border Protection space  in the terminal to reduce international passengers\u2019 connecting time by  improving passenger flow. According to representatives from the Greater  Toronto Airports Authority, the estimated cost of its 5-year capital plan is  CAD $3.46 billion (USD $2.61 billion), which will allow the airport authority  to handle 65 million passengers."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["This report discusses (1) levels of federal and other funding that U.S.  airports received from fiscal years 2013 through 2017 for infrastructure  investments, (2) projected costs of planned infrastructure investments at  U.S. airports from fiscal years 2019 through 2023, and (3) any challenges  selected airports face in obtaining airports\u2019 infrastructure funding and  financing.

Because  comprehensive data on airport capital spending is not available, we  framed our research objective to examine funding received rather than  how much airports expended on infrastructure projects. We selected  fiscal years 2013 through 2017 because it was the most recent 5-year  period where complete data were available. For each funding source, we  determined average annual-funding amounts for fiscal years 2013  through 2017 for all U.S. national system airports, as well as separately  for larger airports and smaller airports. We defined larger airports to  include large and medium hubs, and smaller airports to include small  hubs, non-hubs, non-primary commercial service, reliever, and general  aviation airports. We also analyzed how the amounts of funding received  have changed from fiscal years 2013 through 2017. We presented all  funding amounts in 2017 dollars.", "We obtained funding data from various sources, as follows:", "AIP funding: To determine how much funding airports received from  federal AIP grants, we obtained and analyzed data from the Federal  Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) System of Airports Reporting (SOAR)  database on AIP grants awarded by FAA during our study period. This  database includes detailed information about AIP grants and PFC  applications, approvals, and collections. We analyzed the AIP grant  data to determine total annual funding by airport type for fiscal years  2013 through 2017, as well as average annual funding by airport type  and project type over the same time period.", "State grants: Data on state funding for fiscal years 2013 through  2017 are available but are not complete, and we were not able to  obtain additional information to verify the data\u2019s reliability. As part of  our 2015 review of airports\u2019 infrastructure funding, we conducted a  survey in 2014 with the assistance of the National Association of State  Aviation Officials (NASAO), to determine how much funding airports  received from state grants for fiscal years 2009 through 2013.  Results from this survey were reported in our 2015 report and in  NASAO\u2019s August 2015 report, NASAO State Aviation Funding and  Organizational Data Report. For this review, we interviewed NASAO  officials and they confirmed that the level of state funding has largely  remained unchanged since the 2015 study. Therefore, we  incorporated information from the 2015 survey into our current report.", "PFCs: To determine how much funding airports received from PFCs,  we obtained and analyzed data from the SOAR database on PFC  collection amounts at all airports that collected PFCs during fiscal  years 2013 through 2017. Because we were unable to obtain data on  airports\u2019 expenditures of PFC revenues by project type from fiscal  years 2013 through 2017, we instead obtained data on airports\u2019 FAA- approved applications from 1992 through February 2019 showing the  types of projects on which airports intended to spend their PFC  revenue.", "Airport-generated revenue: For airport-generated revenue, which  we defined as revenue available for capital development, we obtained  and analyzed airport financial data from FAA\u2019s Certification Activity  Tracking System (CATS). Examples of airport-generated revenue  include aeronautical revenue (including revenue earned from leases  with airlines and landing fees) and non-aeronautical revenue (such as  earnings from airport terminal concessions and vehicle parking fees).  We analyzed the financial data to determine the amount of airport- generated revenue that airports had available for infrastructure  investments, as well as amounts by airport type, for each fiscal year  2013 through 2017. We calculated airport-generated revenue by using  data for the total operating revenue of an airport, subtracted by the  subtotal of operating expenses, prior to subtracting depreciation,  which yields operating income plus interest income. For data  precision, we used a different methodology to calculate airport- generated revenue than that of our 2015 report on airport finance by  not subtracting an estimated amount of PFCs used to pay for interest  expense. As a result, airport-generated revenue reported here is not  comparable to airport-generated revenue in our 2015 report.", "Airport capital contributions: To determine how much funding  airports received from capital contributions, we analyzed the same set  of airport financial data from CATS that we used for airport-generated  revenue, discussed above.

We  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable to report funding and  financing that airports received from AIP, PFCs, airport-generated  revenue, capital contributions, and bond revenue for fiscal years 2013  through 2017.", "To determine the projected cost of airports\u2019 planned capital development  from fiscal years 2019 through 2023, we combined (1) FAA\u2019s most recent  estimate for AIP-eligible development from its Report to Congress  National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS) 2019-2023, released  in September 2018, and (2) Airports Council International \u2013 North  America\u2019s (ACI-NA) most recent estimate for AIP-ineligible development  for the same time period, as reported in its February 2019 report,  Terminally Challenged: Addressing the Infrastructure Funding Shortfall of  America\u2019s Airports. We developed estimates of infrastructure  development costs for all national system airports, as well as by airport  type. We also presented estimates of AIP-eligible development costs by  project type; these estimates were based on estimates in the NPIAS  report. We did not, however, present estimates of AIP-ineligible data by  project type because ACI-NA\u2019s data do not readily support such a  presentation. We presented all dollar amounts in 2017 dollars. To  identify changes in airports\u2019 project costs of planned infrastructure  investments, we also reviewed FAA\u2019s NPIAS report for fiscal years 2017\u2013 2021 and ACI-NA\u2019s report on airports\u2019 capital development needs for  fiscal years 2017\u20132021, and we compared the estimates in those reports  to the fiscal years 2019\u20132023 estimates.", "ACI-NA\u2019s estimates of U.S. airports\u2019 infrastructure project costs differ from  those of FAA\u2019s due to scope, methodology, and other reasons. For  example, the ACI-NA cost estimate includes estimates for AIP-eligible  and AIP-ineligible projects, while FAA only includes AIP-eligible projects  as required by statute. ACI-NA\u2019s estimate also includes projects that have  already identified funding sources as well as those that have not. By  comparison, FAA only includes projects without identified funding. The  methodology that FAA and ACI-NA use to develop their estimates also  differs. For example, FAA developed its estimates for the fiscal year 2019  through 2023 time period by reviewing information from airport plans that  were available through 2017. According to ACI-NA\u2019s report on airports\u2019  capital development needs for 2019\u20132023, its cost estimates for fiscal  years 2019\u20132023 are based on a survey of 86 airports completed in  2018. This number represents the airports with 90 percent of all  enplanements in 2017. ACI-NA survey respondents were asked to report  all infrastructure costs, including interest, construction and management  costs, architectural and engineering costs, and contingency costs. FAA\u2019s  estimate does not include interest and contingency costs. We reviewed  FAA documentation describing the methodology for producing the NPIAS  cost estimate from airport-planning documents, and interviewed FAA  officials. We determined FAA\u2019s estimate of AIP-eligible planned  infrastructure costs to be reliable for the purposes of our report. Similarly,  we reviewed ACI-NA\u2019s methodology for developing its report on airports\u2019  capital development needs for 2019\u20132023 and interviewed ACI-NA  representatives about their methodology for developing this estimate. We  determined that ACI-NA\u2019s response rates, shares of enplanements  represented by the airports that responded, and ACI-NA\u2019s estimation  methodology were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of presenting an  estimate of planned infrastructure costs for AIP-ineligible projects.", "To obtain information about any challenges airports face in obtaining  airport funding and financing, we reviewed documents from and  conducted interviews with representatives from ACI-NA and airport  officials from 19 selected U.S. airports. We also interviewed  representatives from the American Association of Airport Executives.  Through our document review and interviews, we obtained information  about the sources of funding and financing that airports currently receive,  planned infrastructure projects, and challenges to obtaining funding and  financing for these projects. We selected airports representing different  hub sizes, airports with the highest planned development costs as  reported in FAA\u2019s NPIAS fiscal years 2019\u20132023 report, airports with  increasing and decreasing enplanements in calendar years 2013 through  2017, airports that were mentioned in our literature review and that were  recommended by FAA and other stakeholders whom we interviewed, and  we considered the geographic location of the airport. We also visited  three locations from our selected airports to discuss and view examples  of airports\u2019 planned infrastructure projects. The airports we visited  included Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Spokane International  Airport, and Paine Field Airport. See table 4 for a list of all the airports  where we conducted interviews.", "We also interviewed representatives from Airlines for America (A4A)\u2014the  U.S. airline association\u2014and representatives from eight selected U.S.  airlines to obtain their views on airport infrastructure funding and financing  issues. We selected airlines with the highest passenger traffic, as  measured by revenue passenger miles. In addition, we selected airlines  representing legacy and low cost carriers, and airlines that provide  service outside the United States. Selected airlines that we interviewed  were: Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines,  JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, and United Airlines.  Collectively, the selected airlines transported about 90 percent of total  U.S. passenger traffic in 2018. Because we used a nonprobability sample  of airport and airlines to interview, our interviews are not generalizable.", "Last, to obtain information about how foreign airports fund and finance  infrastructure development, we reviewed documents from and conducted  interviews with international airport associations, international aviation- industry stakeholders, and representatives from four of the five foreign  airports that we selected as case studies. These airports included:  Toronto Pearson International Airport (Canada); Frankfurt Airport  (Germany); Heathrow Airport (United Kingdom); Helsinki Airport (Finland);  and Changi Airport (Singapore). Representatives from Frankfurt Airport  provided us with written responses and documents for our review. See  table 5 for a list of international organizations and foreign airports where  we conducted interviews. For each of the five selected foreign airports,  we collected information about airport infrastructure funding at the  airports, including the sources of funding and financing the airports use,  types of projects the airport has planned, and factors they consider when  setting airport charges, among other topics. In addition, for each of our  case studies, we presented financial information in the appropriate foreign  currency as well as in U.S. Dollars (USD) in parentheses. We converted  foreign currency information to U.S. Dollars using Federal Reserve data  on foreign exchange rates. For 2018 data, we used the Federal Reserve  2018 annual rate. For 2019 data, we calculated a Federal Reserve 2019  annual rate.", "The primary criterion that we used to select foreign airports as case  studies was the ownership model of the airport. To ensure our selection  included a mix of ownership models, we selected airports that fit each of  the following ownership models:", "Government owned and operated", "Government owned and privately operated", "Partially privatized", "Not-for-profit, private corporation  As secondary criteria, we selected foreign airports with the highest  passenger traffic among international airports, airports which had service  by U.S. carriers, and airports located in regions where it would be feasible  to obtain information and interview officials. Because we used a  nonprobability sample of foreign airports to interview, our interviews are  not generalizable. While our case studies of foreign airports and their  experiences with funding and financing airport infrastructure are not  generalizable to all foreign airports, they provide a range of examples of  how foreign airports fund and finance airport infrastructure.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2018 to February  2020 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Jean Cook and Susan  Zimmerman (Assistant Directors); Maria Mercado (Analyst-in-Charge);  Pin-En Annie Chou; Jessica Du; Sharon Dyer; David Hooper; Delwen  Jones; Grant Mallie; Josh Ormond; Pam Snedden; Kelly Rubin; and  Rebecca Rygg made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": ["U.S. airports collectively received $14 billion annually (on average) for infrastructure projects between fiscal years 2013-2017.", "Their three largest funding sources are:", "Funding from federal Airport Improvement Program grants", "Revenue from passenger fees", "Airport-generated revenue\u2014e.g., concessions", "However, airport officials said that these combined funds may not be enough to cover the costs of their planned infrastructure projects.
