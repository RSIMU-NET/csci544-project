While the drafters of GATT 1947 accepted STEs as legitimate participants in trade, they recognized that STEs, especially those with a monopoly of imports or exports, could be operated to create serious obstacles to trade.", "GATT 1947 addressed STEs in article XVII (see app. I for the complete text). However, article XVII did not define the term \u201cstate trading enterprise,\u201d and as discussed later in this report, GATT members have had problems understanding which entities were subject to the provisions of article XVII. As a result of the Uruguay Round, GATT 1994 defined STEs in the Understanding on the Interpretation of Article XVII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (the \u201cUnderstanding\u201d\u2014see app. III for the complete text or page 11 of this report for the definition).

The notifications we reviewed provided much of the information requested in the questionnaire, including sectors in which STEs operate, their purposes and activities, and some statistics about their operations. However, compliance with the notification requirement was limited during 1980 to 1994, as 79 percent of GATT members did not submit STE notifications during 1981, the best year of reporting. The evidence we obtained suggested the lack of compliance could be attributed to (1) confusion over the definition of STEs, (2) the lack of systematic review of notifications received, (3) the apparent low priority some GATT members assigned to article XVII\u2019s reporting requirement, and (4) the overall burden associated with GATT reporting requirements. Under these circumstances, it is impossible to determine whether article XVII has yielded information on the full nature and extent of STE activity in GATT/WTO member countries.

For example, the majority of STEs described in these notifications operated in the agriculture sector, covering such products as grains and cereals, dairy products, beef and veal, and sugar (see fig. 1). Member countries also reported that they maintained state trading in alcoholic beverages and petroleum products. In addition to the products listed in figure 1, a few countries also provided notifications about state trading in salt, coal, inflammables, aircraft, and nuclear fuel.", "The notifications also provided information related to the purpose of STEs and how they operate.

Additionally, the STEs assessed levies on production and/or imports, issued export licenses, and received government guarantees on borrowed funds. Other state trading practices reported included government-guaranteed minimum prices and subsidized exports. The variety of state trading practices reported to GATT makes comparisons between countries difficult since the level of state involvement, and therefore impact on trade, may differ in each case.", "In general, most notifications have contained statistical information on STE operations, but the information has occasionally been less than requested in the questionnaire. For example, although the questionnaire asked that statistics be furnished on the value and quantity of imports, exports, and national production for the products notified where possible, several countries did not provide information covering national production.

However, our review of STE notifications confirmed what GATT/WTO and member country officials told us\u2014that some member countries continued to struggle with the definition of STEs. In one case, for example, a country decided not to report at all since \u201cthe meaning and coverage of the term \u2018state enterprise\u2019 in Article XVII:1(a) of the General Agreement are not clear.\u201d", "Inconsistent responses to the questionnaire further illustrate this possible lack of understanding of the definition of STEs. For example, two Central European countries submitted notifications in 1984 claiming that they had no state trading in the meaning of article XVII. However, two other Central European countries with similarly structured economies both reported extensive STE activity during this same period. Considering that all four countries operated command economies in which most aspects of trade involved the government, the inconsistent answers demonstrated a possible lack of agreement regarding the article XVII questionnaire.", "The lack of article XVII reporting by some member countries may also be attributed to the absence of a regular process within GATT for reviewing the notifications submitted. For example, one member country, in explaining its decision not to submit a notification, noted \u201cthe absence of any regular procedure for examining notifications so as to afford greater transparency.\u201d The member country went on to state that \u201cone may also note that because of the absence of such a procedure, many countries do not see themselves in some way as \u2018motivated\u2019 to notify.\u201d A U.S. official told us countries did not report STEs because there was no review of the notifications and thus no scrutiny over the notification process.", "Similar perceptions that article XVII reporting was not a priority may exist among other member countries. For example, an official of one country\u2019s permanent mission told us that some countries have been lax in meeting their reporting responsibilities because they felt the disciplines on article XVII were not as rigid as other GATT disciplines.", "Finally, a USTR official suggested that the low response rate among developing countries might also have been linked to the burden of reporting under GATT. The official said many of the developing and smaller GATT member countries may not have the administrative capacity in their governments to comply fully with the multiple reporting requirements under the various GATT articles.

The United States suggested transparency could be improved by creating a working party to clarify the definition of STEs, review and revise the questionnaire, and conduct periodic comprehensive reviews of STE notifications.

For example, the Understanding required member countries to review their policies on submitting notifications about STEs and consider the need to ensure transparency in order to permit a clear appreciation of STEs\u2019 operations and their effect on international trade. It also gave member countries the opportunity to question information provided by another member country. If a member country believes another member country has not adequately met its notification obligation, it can raise the matter for discussion among WTO members and can submit a counternotification to the WTO Council for Trade in Goods if its concerns are not resolved.", "The Understanding further addressed procedural weaknesses by establishing the WTO Working Party on State Trading Enterprises (the Working Party). The Working Party\u2019s responsibilities include (1) reviewing notifications and counternotifications; (2) in light of notifications received, reviewing the adequacy of the questionnaire and the coverage of STEs notified; and (3) developing an illustrative list of the kinds of relationships between governments and STEs and the kinds of activities engaged in by STEs. One U.S. official said the creation of a regular process in the Working Party to review STE notifications was an important step towards improving compliance with article XVII. The Working Party met for the first time on April 6, 1995, to discuss the timetable for its work program during the next year.

Officials from the United States, GATT/WTO, and other countries told us the questions in the questionnaire can be answered with very specific or very general information and, as a result, the information provided so far about STEs does not provide sufficient transparency about STE activities to ensure they are adhering to GATT disciplines. However, GATT/WTO members differed on the exact information necessary to achieve such transparency. For example, officials from the United States and some other countries told us they are interested in obtaining more detailed information about transaction prices. Other GATT/WTO members maintained that such information is confidential and related to an STE\u2019s commercial interest and that countries are not required by article XVII to disclose this type of information.", "The Understanding obligated the Working Party to study the adequacy of the questionnaire.

For example, a representative from one country, which views its own level of state intervention in trade as comparable to the EU\u2019s, told us his country would probably postpone its own notification of STEs until it saw how the EU interpreted the notification requirement. In addition, representatives from several countries\u2019 permanent missions to GATT/WTO told us they think the United States should provide an STE notification for USDA\u2019s Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). Representatives from other countries\u2019 missions told us they were not sure whether CCC would come under the Understanding\u2019s definition of an STE.

In the area of market access restrictions, countries are required to convert all nontariff barriers, such as quotas, to tariff equivalents and reduce the resulting tariff equivalents (as well as old tariffs) during the implementation period. In the area of export subsidies, countries are required to reduce their budgetary expenditures on export subsidies and their quantity of subsidized exports. Finally, countries are required to reduce an aggregate measurement of selected internal support policies. In addition, the agreement established a WTO Committee on Agriculture to monitor implementation of Uruguay Round commitments.", "The disciplines on market access restrictions contain two specific references to STEs. First, the definition of nontariff barriers subject to conversion to tariff equivalents includes nontariff measures maintained through STEs. Second, when providing information to the Committee on Agriculture regarding implementation, GATT/WTO members are asked to explain the administration of market access commitments. Where such commitments are administered by STEs, details about the STE and its relevant activities should be provided.", "The Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture told us it is premature to assess whether commitments on market access restrictions are being met.

The agreement defines the types of export subsidies subject to reduction. If any such subsidies were paid to or received by an STE, they would be subject to reduction. Moreover, export subsidies not targeted for reduction cannot be applied in a manner that allows member countries to circumvent their commitments to reduce export subsidies. This would include export subsidies provided to or by STEs.", "According to a GATT/WTO official, it should be relatively easy to determine whether countries are meeting their commitments to reduce export subsidies, because the relevant subsidies tend to be quantifiable and easily identified. The official suggested it may be more difficult to know whether countries are circumventing these commitments because other types of export subsidies, including some that could be provided through STEs, are not as easily identified.", "Officials from the United States, GATT/WTO, and other countries recalled that during the agriculture negotiations, obtaining disciplines on STEs was not considered to be as important as obtaining disciplines on market access restrictions, export subsidies, and internal support. GATT members focused on the latter group of policy tools because of their distortive effect on trade. U.S. officials told us the United States viewed the EU\u2019s agricultural policies as particularly problematic. During the negotiations, the United States relied on the support of countries in the Cairns Group to achieve meaningful concessions from the EU.
