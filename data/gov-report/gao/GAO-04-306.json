To implement the programs, federal agencies have, among other things, designated participating communities and overseen the provision of program benefits. Since 1994, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) have designated a total of 41 EZs and 115 ECs, and HUD has designated 40 RCs. Available data show that Round I and II EZs and ECs are continuing to access their grant funds and IRS data show that businesses are claiming some tax benefits. However, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does not collect data on other tax benefits and cannot always identify the communities in which they were used. Also, efforts by HUD to obtain these data by survey were limited to Round I designees, and EZ and RC officials have had difficulty obtaining such information directly from businesses. The lack of tax benefit data limits the ability of HUD and USDA to administer and evaluate the programs. The few evaluations that systematically collected and analyzed data on EZ/EC program effectiveness used a variety of research methods to study different aspects of the program. The most comprehensive of these studies--the HUD Interim Assessment--found that employment of Round I EZ residents had increased from 1995 to 2000, that larger businesses were more likely to use tax benefits than smaller businesses, and that resident participation in EZ or EC governance has been uneven, among other things."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For decades the nation has faced the challenge of revitalizing its distressed  urban and rural communities.

Senior IRS officials cited several reasons why amending its tax forms is  not a high priority for the agency. First, they said that IRS\u2019s role is to  administer tax laws, and that collecting more comprehensive data on the  use of these benefits does not help the agency to acheive this objective.  Second, the officials indicated that requesting taxpayers to provide more  information would add to taxpayer burden and IRS workload.

For  example, a HUD-sponsored report noted that in 2000 many businesses did  not know about the tax benefits available to them. In addition, one tax  expert noted that businesses must make several complicated calculations  about their business activities to determine whether they satisfy the  requirements for using the tax benefits.

Also, one tax expert noted that some businesses, such as farms with assets  greater than $500,000, do not qualify for the tax benefits.

In some cases, organizations or individuals  operating or residing in EZs, ECs, or RCs receive competitive priority for  federal grants, loans, or technical assistance based solely on their EZ, EC,  or RC designations. HUD and USDA officials said that during Round I of  the EZ/EC program the Community Empowerment Board encouraged  federal agencies to provide preferences to applicants from EZs or ECs in  competition for federal funds. For example, communities designated as  federal EZs, ECs, or RCs could receive a competitive preference for the  Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s 2003 National Brownfields  Assessment, Revolving Loan Fund, and Cleanup Grants. In addition, in  2003, the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Teacher Quality Enhancement  Grants program provided a competitive priority to applicants who  proposed to carry out activities in EZs or ECs.
