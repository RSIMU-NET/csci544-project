Another conduct code  limited the use of sole-sourcing to contracts meeting certain criteria, such  as approval for use by a 75-percent majority of the GPO\u2019s contracting  committee. The language of one of the remaining GPO\u2019s conduct codes  was vague with respect to sole-sourcing, stating that the GPO will provide  customers with choices for each product or service, without explicitly  mentioning the use of sole-source contracts.", "In their conduct codes, two GPOs had provisions prohibiting the practice  of bundling of unrelated products, two GPOs prohibited and two limited  bundling for clinical preference items, and three GPOs prohibited the  practice of bundling products from different manufacturers. One GPO\u2019s  conduct code stated that the GPO would not obligate its customers to  purchase bundles of unrelated products, allowing the possibility for  bundles to be available to customers on a voluntary basis.", "Exceptions and qualified language in the provisions have the potential to  weaken the codes of conduct. Table 2 shows examples of exceptions and  qualified language that can limit the potential of the individual GPOs\u2019  conduct codes to effect change."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Too Soon to Evaluate Impact of GPOs\u2019 Codes of Conduct", "paragraphs": ["Given the individual GPOs\u2019 relatively recent adoption of codes of  conduct\u2014since August 2002\u2014sufficient time has not yet elapsed for GPOs  to develop a history of compliance with certain conduct code provisions.  Two of the manufacturers and two distributors we interviewed reported  noticing improvements, stating that some GPOs are no longer using  certain contracting strategies. This observation is consistent with the  suggestion that the use of bundling may be declining. One manufacturer  that had difficulty in obtaining a contract with a large national GPO prior  to 2002 said it has since been awarded a contract for a clinical preference  item. The manufacturer also noted that, since September 2002, it has been  awarded several new contracts. However, two other manufacturers told us  they are skeptical that improvements have been made with regard to  business practices. Notwithstanding such anecdotal evidence, because of  the recency of GPOs\u2019 actions taken, the ability to assess the impact of the  conduct codes systematically remains limited. One year is not sufficient  time for the codes of conduct to produce measurable trends that could  demonstrate an impact on the industry."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Contact and Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["For more information regarding this statement, please contact Marjorie  Kanof at (202) 512-7101.
