As required by the directive, DOD has drafted a strategic plan to guide the activities of the Defense Forensic Enterprise, including expeditionary forensics. Although the plan includes a mission statement, and goals and objectives--two of the five key elements identified by GAO as integral to a well-developed strategic plan--it does not identify approaches for how goals and objectives will be achieved, milestones and metrics to gauge progress, and resources needed to achieve goals and objectives. GAO's prior work has shown that organizations need a well-developed strategic plan to identify and achieve their goals and objectives effectively and efficiently. Officials in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (OUSD(AT&L)) said that they decided to create a concise, high-level strategic plan and that they plan to issue guidance tasking the DOD components to develop individual implementation plans that include milestones. However, approaches, metrics, and resources needed to accomplish its goals and objectives were absent from the draft guidance. GAO discussed this omission with OUSD(AT&L), and in response, this office plans to revise its draft guidance. Also, the forensic strategic plan has been in draft for 2 years having undergone multiple revisions, and is still undergoing DOD internal review with no publication date set, and by extension, a publication date has not been set for the proposed DOD component implementation plans. The lack of an approved strategic plan and associated implementation plans limits DOD's ability to prioritize its efforts to develop an enduring expeditionary forensic capability by the end of 2014.", "Moreover, OUSD(AT&L) has not reviewed and evaluated the adequacy of DOD components' expeditionary forensic budget estimates for fiscal years 2013 through 2018, as required by DOD's directive. OUSD(AT&L) officials said that they were waiting for the DOD components to finalize their budget estimates for fiscal years 2013 through 2018, and waiting for the Joint Capabilities Integration Development System to validate their forensic requirements. Regardless, reviewing and evaluating the DOD components' proposed budget estimates allows OUSD(AT&L) to advise the DOD components on their resource allocation decisions with respect to expeditionary forensic capabilities. OUSD(AT&L) officials cited several factors that also affected their ability to review and evaluate the DOD components' forensic budget data, such as aggregation of components' forensic budget estimates with other costs. Moreover, these officials said the directive does not provide guidance to DOD components on how to collect and report forensic budget data. GAO's Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government notes that agencies should provide policy and guidance to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of operations.

DOD defines forensics as the application of multi-disciplinary  scientific processes to establish facts that may be used for the collection,  identification, and comparison of materials such as deoxyribonucleic acid  (DNA) and latent fingerprints. For the purposes of this report,  expeditionary forensics refers to the employment of forensic applications  by an armed force to accomplish a specific objective in a foreign country.  For example, in 2012 the Department of Defense (DOD) provided  forensic support to about 120 Afghan court cases linking latent  fingerprints and DNA evidence to enemy combatants, resulting in a 97  percent conviction rate. DOD has traditionally used forensics for law  enforcement and medical purposes, such as identifying and prosecuting  criminals and determining the identification of human remains. However,  DOD\u2019s concept of operations notes that the increased incidence of  improvised explosive devices and other asymmetric threats that U.S.  military forces have encountered has created an increased demand for  expeditionary forensic capabilities across the full range of military  operations.

These funds  covered such capabilities as the Army\u2019s Expeditionary Forensic  Laboratories, the Navy\u2019s Combined Explosives Exploitation Cells, and  Special Operations Command\u2019s expeditionary forensic activities.  However, as U.S. military operations are projected to draw down in  Afghanistan by the end of 2014, funding for expeditionary forensics is expected to decline substantially.  While DOD maintains base funding for traditional forensic applications  and Special Operations Command\u2019s sensitive site exploitation program,DOD officials said that base funding levels are not adequate to cover the  additional costs of current and emerging expeditionary forensic activities.  Moreover, Army officials noted that it would cost considerably more in  time and resources to recreate the Army\u2019s expeditionary forensic  capability to support any future mission if current capabilities are allowed  to expire.

In  2006, DOD further expanded its use of expeditionary forensics by  establishing the joint expeditionary forensic facilities to analyze materials,  such as ammunition and clothing items collected on the battlefield, to help  identify enemy combatants through latent prints and DNA analysis,  among other things. In 2011, DOD consolidated the Combined Explosives  Exploitation Cells and the joint expeditionary forensic facilities to form  Expeditionary Forensic Laboratories under the purview of the Army in  order to realize efficiencies and minimize redundancies.

DOD said that the Under  Secretary, Comptroller, the Joint Staff, and the military services will  coordinate to identify mechanisms to more efficiently and reliably review  DOD components\u2019 proposed forensic budget estimates against validated  requirements. While we are encouraged with DOD\u2019s decision, we believe  that it is important that DOD schedule its reviews at regular intervals, in  accordance with the Defense Forensic Enterprise directive.", "DOD concurred with our fourth recommendation to the Secretary of  Defense to direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology, and Logistics to issue guidance on how DOD components  are to collect and report their forensic budget data\u2014including  expeditionary forensic budget data. DOD stated that the Under Secretary,  Comptroller, and the military services will coordinate to develop and issue  guidance on reporting forensic budget data prior to the beginning of the  fiscal year 2016 budget planning cycle.", "We are sending copies of this report to appropriate congressional  committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Under Secretary of Defense  for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics; the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of  Staff; the Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force; the  Commandant of the Marine Corps; and the Director, Office of  Management and Budget.

In addition, we analyzed relevant Army, Marine  Corps, and combatant command plans, policies and guidance that  describe DOD\u2019s efforts to organize, train, and equip forces to carry out  expeditionary forensic activities. To understand DOD\u2019s current  expeditionary forensic capabilities, including those of the Expeditionary  Forensic Laboratories, we visited the Army\u2019s Criminal Investigation  Laboratory at Fort Gillem, Georgia, which is primarily responsible for  conducting both traditional and expeditionary forensic activities for the  department and is known as DOD\u2019s forensic science center of excellence.  We also met with officials from CNA\u2019s Center for Naval Analyses to  discuss their efforts to review DOD\u2019s overall defense forensic activities.  Further, we interviewed officials from the DOD organizations identified in  table 2 to discuss DOD\u2019s efforts to establish an enduring expeditionary  forensic capability.", "We also reviewed and analyzed the military services\u2019 and Special  Operations Command\u2019s current and projected forensic budget estimates  to determine if the data were sufficiently reliable and met the  department\u2019s requirements in the DOD forensic directive. We assessed  the reliability of this budget data by interviewing knowledgeable officials  and reviewing related documentation and written responses to our  questions on data reliability. We identified several issues concerning the  reliability of the budget data obtained from Office of the Under Secretary  of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (OUSD(AT&L)), the  military services and Special Operations Command, including the sources  from which the data were derived, the consistency in how the data were  compiled, and the manner in which the data were verified. As a result, we  determined that the data were not sufficiently reliable. Therefore, we are  making a recommendation that addresses OUSD(AT&L)\u2019s ability to  review and evaluate the DOD components\u2019 forensic budget data by  calling for the development of budget collecting and reporting guidance.", "We interviewed officials from the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau  of Investigation, and Department of Homeland Security to obtain their  perspective on DOD\u2019s efforts to develop an expeditionary forensic  capability. We also met with officials from the National Science and  Technology Council within the Executive Office of the President to gain  an understanding of national policy trends on forensics.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2012 through June 2013  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
