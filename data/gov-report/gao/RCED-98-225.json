Instead, it disburses the award funds to the extent that the bank provides adequate documentation and other assurances that it has completed the increased investments and/or activities for which it received the award. The Fund disburses award funds in increments when a bank completes its increased activities in increments. For example, if a bank increased its investment in a certified CDFI in two equal installments, it could seek and the Fund would disburse half of its award after the first installment; the Fund would retain the second half until the bank had completed the second installment.

For example, one awardee, a community development loan fund, included several activity measures (e.g., the number of loans made and the dollar volume of the loans) and accomplishment measures (e.g., the number of jobs created, stabilized, and upgraded) in its business plan. By contrast, the awardee included only activity measures (e.g., the number and dollar volume of loans made) in its assistance agreement. Another awardee, a microenterprise loan fund, included both activity measures (e.g., the number and dollar volume of loans disbursed) and accomplishment measures reflecting the potential effect of these loans (e.g., increases in business assets and in the number of new jobs) in its business plan. In its assistance agreement, however, the awardee included only activity measures (e.g., the number and dollar volume of loans disbursed). Only one of the six case study awardees included an accomplishment measure in its assistance agreement that did not appear in its business plan.", "According to most of the case study awardees and Fund officials who negotiated with the awardees, the 1996 awardees were reluctant to incorporate accomplishment measures into their assistance agreements for two major reasons. First, they were concerned about being able to demonstrate that their activities had produced specific effects in distressed communities. Second, they were concerned that the Fund might impose sanctions if they could not achieve results that were, to some extent, beyond their control.", "Both the case study awardees and Fund officials recognized that it is difficult to isolate the effects of a CDFI\u2019s community development activities from the effects of external factors, such as economic, social, and political conditions. Because they could not demonstrate a direct causal link between these activities and results in the community, they tended to negotiate measures of activities\u2014what the awardees were doing\u2014rather than measures of accomplishments\u2014how their activities were improving economic conditions in distressed communities. While this approach is understandable, it goes beyond the requirements of performance measurement. Specifically, performance measurement is intended to identify and track the changes associated with a program but does not require the establishment of an exclusive causal link between a program and an observed change. Establishing a direct causal link is a more complex task, often requiring controlled studies or statistical analyses, and is the purpose of impact analysis, discussed later in this chapter. Nevertheless, tracking changes associated with a program is important because it focuses attention on, and provides an indication of, the program\u2019s results.", "The 1996 awardees were also reluctant to incorporate accomplishment measures into their assistance agreements because they were concerned about the Fund\u2019s possible imposition of sanctions. As several awardees pointed out, accomplishments may be subject to outside factors and can, therefore, be harder to control than activities. Consequently, most of these awardees did not want to be held contractually accountable for meeting benchmarks for accomplishment measures over which they had limited control. As is clear from the array of assumptions set forth in the performance schedule illustrated in figure 2.1, an awardee\u2019s performance may be subject to many factors beyond the awardee\u2019s control\u2014including the continuation of funding from other sources, interest rates, economic conditions, property taxes, the reputation of the local public schools, and the rate of inflation.", "The application of sanctions is at the Fund\u2019s discretion, and the Fund has not yet demonstrated how it will apply sanctions for poor performance. The 1996 awardees were, therefore, uncertain about how the Fund would use sanctions. Even though the Fund stipulated in the 1996 assistance agreements that it would generally not impose the more severe sanctions\u2014that is, those requiring the repayment of assistance or reducing or terminating assistance\u2014for failure to meet the benchmarks, the perceived threat of sanctions limited the types of measures considered during the negotiation of performance measures and benchmarks, according to three of the six case study awardees.", "For the 1997 awardees, the Fund has revised both the performance schedule and the assistance agreement. As table 2.3 illustrates, the revised schedule reduces the duration of the benchmarks from 5 years to 1 year. The revised agreement reintroduces the potential use of all the sanctions for unacceptable performance. Thus, the Fund could require the 1997 awardees to repay the assistance they have received if they do not meet their benchmarks. According to a senior Fund official, the Fund changed the duration of the benchmarks to facilitate compliance with the statutory requirement that it submit an annual report on awardees\u2019 performance and to more effectively promote awardees\u2019 accomplishment of their business plans. He also indicated that the Fund reintroduced the potential use of all sanctions so that it would have a full range of options available to address instances of noncompliance. However, with less time to reach the benchmarks and potentially stiffer sanctions for not reaching them, the awardees may be further deterred from using accomplishment measures. Alternatively, limiting the application of sanctions to measures over which awardees have control could allow the Fund to address instances of noncompliance without discouraging the use of accomplishment measures.", "According to the Results Act and its guidance, performance measures should adequately indicate progress toward the performance goal. To determine, for the 1996 agreements, whether the 165 performance measures indicated progress towards meeting the 87 goals, we systematically assessed whether the measures had a clear, apparent, or commonly accepted relationship to the intended goals and whether the measures appropriately represented the goals without showing any biasin measuring progress toward them. We found that about 96 percent of the measures were related to the goals and about 84 percent were unbiased. For example, one community development credit union\u2019s goal was to significantly expand the availability of financial services to its members. The measures that accompanied this goal were the number of new checking accounts opened, the number of ATM cards issued, and the number of credit cards issued. These measures were related to and appropriately represented the goal because they were limited to financial services that the credit union currently offered to its members.", "The Results Act and its guidance also indicate that performance measures should address all key aspects of goals. Although we did not attempt to quantify the degree to which groups of measures addressed all key aspects of goals, we observed that there were differences in the extent to which goals were adequately addressed. In some instances, a group of two or three measures did not address certain key aspects of a stated goal:", "One awardee\u2019s goal was to \u201calleviate poverty by providing substantial loans and technical assistance to promote entrepreneurship and sustainable businesses.\u201d The awardee\u2019s assistance agreement included three measures for providing loans\u2014the dollar amount of loans disbursed to nonprofit organizations, the number of borrowers receiving loans from the awardee, and the number of borrowers remaining in operation since the loans were made to them. However, the assistance agreement included no measures pertaining to entrepreneurship or technical assistance.", "In other instances, the measures as a group seemed to address all key aspects of the goal:", "One awardee\u2019s goal was to \u201cincrease job opportunities by encouraging the start-up of new businesses and the expansion of existing businesses.\u201d The associated measures were \u201cthe net increase in the number of full-and part-time jobs in businesses financed by the awardee as of April 1997,\u201d and \u201cthe net increase in salaries and wage expenses of businesses financed by the awardee as of April 1997.\u201d If we assume that the awardee will be funding only business start-ups or expansions, then the measures address the key aspects of increasing job opportunities\u2014increasing the number of full- and part-time jobs and increasing wage expenses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Units and Terms Were Specific but Lacked Baseline Data and Did Not Refer to the Target Market", "paragraphs": ["Under the Results Act and its guidance, performance goals should be measurable and quantifiable.

Our analysis showed that the performance goals and measures in the 1996 assistance agreements had most of these features:", "All of the goals had at least one measure with a defined unit, such as a \u201cloan,\u201d and most (95 percent) of the units were at least minimally specific (e.g., \u201chousing loans\u201d). In nearly all (95 percent) of the goals and measures, the terms were generally known or, if not known, defined.", "Essentially all (99 percent) of the goals and measures had target values and dates that, together, comprise the benchmark (see fig. 2.1).", "While the performance measures in the 1996 performance schedules had several measurable or quantifiable features, they generally lacked baseline information. Specifically, 95 percent of the goals and measures lacked baseline values and 93 percent lacked baseline dates. Including such values and dates in the performance schedule is important because it establishes a context for understanding the significance of the benchmark ranges and ensures that the Fund and the awardee have an agreed-upon basis for measuring performance.", "Fund officials told us that they used specific baseline dates and values in negotiating the benchmarks for awardees\u2019 performance measures.

However, having to refer to other documents to obtain this information undermines the assistance agreement as a ready reference for understanding and assessing progress toward an awardee\u2019s stated goals.", "We also analyzed whether the goal statements identified the populations served by the awardees. The majority (83 percent) of the goals and measures identified the geographic areas or populations to be served; however, the level of detail varied widely. For instance, some specified \u201cthe investment area\u201d (e.g., a particular geographic area that can help define an awardee\u2019s target market), while others simply identified a particular city or portion of a state (e.g., southwest Pennsylvania). Still others provided no information about the geographic areas or populations to be served. Moreover, it was often unclear how the area or group identified in a measure was related to the target market defined in the awardee\u2019s certification documentation. If information about the target market does not appear in the performance schedule, the schedule creates no context for understanding why specific measures are targeted to particular groups or areas.

Providing this guidance would enable the Fund to leverage the expertise of the independent auditors in verifying both financial and performance information. To date, the Fund has provided the auditors only with verbal guidance, at their request.

For some of our case study banks, delays meant that a small number of the activities projected to close within the 6-month assessment period took longer than expected and closed after that period had ended. As a result, these banks increased their activities less than projected during the assessment period and will not receive the portions of their 1996 awards associated with the unaccomplished activities.

In some cases, the prospect of receiving a BEA award may encourage such investment, but in other cases, regulatory or economic incentives exert a strong influence. As a result, it is difficult to isolate the impact of the BEA award from the effects of other incentives. Furthermore, more complete data on some banks\u2019 investments are needed to ensure that the increases in investments in distressed areas rewarded by the BEA program are not being offset by decreases in other investments by the banks in the same areas. Finally, because the Fund did not require banks receiving 1996 awards to report any material changes in rewarded investments, it did not know whether rewarded investments remained long-term increases in the capital available to CDFIs or distressed communities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Regulatory and Economic Incentives Also Motivate Increased Investment in CDFIs and Distressed Areas", "paragraphs": ["Officials at our case study banks and Fund officials told us that the BEA program creates an incentive for or reduces the risk associated with a bank\u2019s initiating and/or increasing investments in CDFIs and/or distressed communities. For example, according to an official at one of our case study banks, the bank would not have invested $250,000 in a local nonprofit CDFI\u2019s predevelopment loan program if this activity had not been eligible for a 15-percent reward from the Fund. Typically, this official said, the bank does not support predevelopment loan programs, but the prospect of receiving an award mitigated some of the risk associated with this loan, enabling the bank to favorably consider and subsequently make this investment. As further evidence that the program is encouraging investment in CDFIs, a Fund official said that CDFIs have begun to market themselves to banks by noting that new or increased investments in them can result in awards from the Fund of up to 15 percent of the new or additional investment.", "Our case study banks indicated, and Fund officials agreed, that the prospect of receiving a BEA award was not always the primary incentive for banks to undertake award-eligible activities. Rather, regulatory or economic incentives were important or had already prompted the banks to undertake such activities before they considered applying for a BEA award. One of the reasons our case study banks cited most frequently for undertaking award-eligible activities was to comply with the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). CRA requires that federal bank regulatory agencies encourage the banks they regulate to help meet credit needs in all areas of the communities served (insofar as is consistent with safe and sound operations), assess the banks\u2019 performance in meeting those needs, and take this performance into account when considering a bank\u2019s request for regulatory approval of a regulated action, such as opening a new branch or acquiring or merging with another bank. Under CRA, banks do not receive direct financial or other rewards from the regulatory agencies for compliance. Also, the BEA program requires that banks not only invest in distressed areas but also increase their investments over and above what they have been doing.", "The bank regulatory agencies assess each bank\u2019s performance in meeting CRA\u2019s requirements every 2 to 3 years. During these reviews, the examiners check to see whether CRA compliance activities are an ongoing part of the bank\u2019s business. Because BEA-eligible activities, as a rule, count in terms of compliance with CRA, most banks are likely to be engaged in some activities that the BEA program rewards, and when the banks can show an increase in such activities over an assessment period, they can simultaneously demonstrate their compliance with CRA and their eligibility for a BEA award.", "This overlap between activities that meet CRA\u2019s requirements and are eligible for a BEA award held true at our case study banks. All of the activities that counted toward compliance also counted toward an award. Furthermore, two of the banks received BEA awards totaling over $324,000 for increases in investments they had made or agreed to make as part of ongoing working relationships with CDFIs that predated their applications for the awards. Another bank based its application for a $1.6 million award on those previously planned activities that bank officials judged most likely to reach closing during the bank\u2019s 6-month assessment period. The Fund itself acknowledges that compliance with CRA may be a major incentive for some banks to undertake award-eligible activities. In fact, the Fund advertises the link to compliance with CRA in the promotional materials it distributes to banks when it publicizes the BEA program.", "Economic incentives also motivated banks\u2019 investments in award-eligible activities. According to officials at our case study banks, they do the kinds of business that the BEA program rewards in the markets targeted by the BEA program because they benefit from such business and/or have made a corporate commitment to community lending. The banks benefit, the officials said, because their award-eligible investments help them to maintain market share in areas targeted by the BEA program, to compete with other banks in these areas, or to build up markets that they expect will be profitable in the future. In addition, one bank indicated that its award-eligible activities lay the groundwork for building new markets with community groups, and two other banks cited improved community relations as a further incentive for their activities.", "Although banks may derive future as well as current economic benefits from their award-eligible activities, these activities have to stand on their own without a subsidy from any of the banks\u2019 other lines of business, according to officials at all five case study banks. These officials cited the solid track records of the CDFIs with which their banks were already working and/or the successful performance of their banks in distressed or low- and moderate-income communities as important reasons for continuing to do business there. The case study banks had measured their performance and demonstrated their success in distressed communities through measures such as loan repayment rates; reports on occupancy rates and the financial performance of housing projects financed by the banks; and, in one case, the frequent presence of a bank official on CDFI investees\u2019 boards of directors.", "Because awards in the BEA program can be relatively small (especially for larger banks) and are made retrospectively (that is, after banks have begun or completed activities), the awards may be too small or may come too late to have much influence on banks\u2019 investment activities. To an extent that neither we nor the Fund can quantify, banks are receiving awards for activities that stem from ongoing relationships with CDFIs, nonprofit groups, or others in the community and/or for investments they would have made without the prospect of an award from the BEA program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Banks Do Not Maintain Data Needed to Demonstrate Net Increases in Award-Eligible Activities in Distressed Communities", "paragraphs": ["The Fund acknowledges that, in a few cases, some of the direct lending and other financial service activities it is rewarding\u2014particularly agricultural, consumer, and small business loans\u2014may come at the expense of similar eligible activities in the same distressed communities the awardees are serving. For this reason, the Fund was concerned that awardees could increase the loans and other services included in their applications while decreasing other eligible activities that are not included in their applications but are targeted to the same communities.", "To be certain that the overall volume of activity in a distressed community has increased, a bank must know the location of the entity that received the loan, that the location is distressed, and that the overall volume of activity in that location has increased. To readily link a loan\u2019s location with economic indicators of distress can require detailed information, such as data identifying the census tract in which the entity that received the loan is located. If a bank is not tracking the volume of its loan activity by census tract, the Fund cannot be sure that increases in some types of qualified activities have not been offset by decreases in other types of qualified activities in the same distressed community.", "In reviewing the 1996 applications, the Fund discovered that some banks that were applying for awards on the basis of increases in these activities had not collected detailed information, such as loan activity by census tract, on the location of these activities. Consequently, they could not demonstrate that they had not decreased other award-eligible activities in distressed communities to support the increased activities included in their applications. For the 1996 awards, the Fund allowed banks without the requisite information to sign an addendum to their award agreement in which they stated that, to the best of their knowledge, they had not decreased other eligible activities that were not included in their application. While most such banks signed the addendum and submitted an application, an official at one of our case study banks said that the bank sought an award on the basis of its investments in CDFIs but not on the basis of any of its lending in distressed communities because its data on loans did not include census tract information and it was not willing to risk the chance that its overall level of activity in distressed communities might have decreased.", "For the 1997 awards, the Fund hired a contractor to help banks determine if the areas they were seeking to target would be eligible under the BEA program\u2019s guidelines. The Fund requires the banks to use this contractor\u2019s services in the initial stages of applying to the program. The contractor determines which census tracts in a bank\u2019s service area meet the Fund\u2019s definition of a distressed community but does not identify which activities took place in those tracts. Many banks were not identifying the census tracts of their consumer, small business, or agricultural loans and could not have determined which ones took place in a distressed community identified by the Fund\u2019s contractor unless they hand-coded or geocoded their lending data. According to a Fund official, using the Fund\u2019s contractor means that each applicant has a better\u2014but not perfect\u2014idea of which loans in its service area took (or will take) place in distressed communities. Nonetheless, a bank that has not geocoded its loans would likely still find it very time consuming to assign a census tract to all of its consumer, small business, and agricultural loans because it would have to do so for all of these loans, not just those included in its application to the BEA program.", "According to Fund officials, more and more banks are collecting census data on their loans and fewer banks had to sign the addendum for the 1997 awards than for the 1996 awards. However, because the Fund does not require banks to collect census data on their loans, Fund officials acknowledged that, to some extent, the Fund may still be rewarding banks that increased some activities at the expense of others that were not included in their applications but also took place in the same distressed communities. As a result, for banks that receive awards for direct lending and financial services but do not collect census data on these activities, the Fund cannot say with certainty that, in all cases, the BEA program is meeting its objective of rewarding increases in distressed communities because it cannot say with certainty that, in all cases, the rewarded increases did not come at the expense of other award-eligible activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fund Was Not Systematically Informed of Material Changes in Banks\u2019 Rewarded Investments", "paragraphs": ["The 1996 BEA awardees were not obligated to report information, including any material changes in their rewarded investments, once they completed the tasks they had agreed to perform with their own funds to receive their awards. One of our case study banks received an award for increasing its investment in a CDFI that was later dissolved. Specifically, the bank received $37,500, or 15 percent of the $250,000 by which it increased its investment in a certified CDFI during its assessment period. However, several months after the bank received the award funds, the CDFI\u2019s board of directors voted to dissolve the institution because of a declining market for its loans and dissatisfaction with its performance. Upon dissolving the CDFI, the board returned its remaining capital pro rata to the banks that had invested in it, including the bank that had received the award for its increased investment. Thus, even though the bank received an award from the BEA program, the rewarded increase in activity did not last. After our visit and the CDFI\u2019s dissolution, the bank made a commitment to use all of the funds returned to it to capitalize a microloan fund at a different certified CDFI.", "The Fund was not aware of this material change in our case study bank\u2019s rewarded investment until we brought it to the Fund\u2019s attention.

In summary, for the 27 draft strategic plans, we found that (1) most did not adequately link required elements in the plans; (2) several contained goals that were not as results oriented as they could have been; (3) many agencies did not fully develop strategies explaining how their long-term strategic goals would be achieved; (4) most agencies did not identify or provide for coordinating activities and programs that cut across multiple agencies; (5) the limited capacity of many agencies to gather performance information has hampered their efforts to identify appropriate goals and confidently assess their performance; and (6) no agency\u2019s draft strategic plan provided adequately for program evaluations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Strategic Planning Initiatives Address Shortcomings in the Fund\u2019s Current Plan", "paragraphs": ["As is consistent with the Results Act\u2019s requirement that agencies continually refine their plans, the Fund is updating its strategic plan and expects to have a revised plan by August 1998. According to a key Fund official, the updated plan will address not only the shortcomings we identified in a May 1998 authorization hearing on the Fund, but also those cited in the Department of the Treasury\u2019s February 1998 review of the Fund\u2019s plan. The following are among the key changes the Fund plans to make: In revising its strategic goals, it plans to eliminate the two organizational goals (i.e., to improve program performance and management operations) included in table 4.1 because they are not directly related to the Fund\u2019s mission. It plans to change the format for presenting the goals and objectives by linking benchmarks and planned evaluations to each goal, as well as to the key external factors that could affect the Fund\u2019s ability to meet these goals. The Fund believes that this change will improve its ability to assess how well its strategies and approaches for meeting its strategic goals are working. For example, one of the goals proposed in the Fund\u2019s revised plan is to increase participation in the CDFI program. The Fund plans to hold workshops to increase participation in the program and to evaluate this strategy by collecting data to track the number of (1) participants in the workshops, (2) participants who apply for CDFI funding, and (3) applicants who receive CDFI awards. The Fund plans to use this information to evaluate the effectiveness of the workshops in increasing participation. It plans to revise its budget structure to better link program activities with funding sources. By presenting the budget this way, the Fund expects to improve its tracking of the resources used to implement the goals and objectives outlined in its strategic plan, as well as to develop annual plans that tie these goals and objectives to its budget. It plans to revise its performance goals to include a measure of its ability to leverage other resources. It plans to identify crosscutting organizations and programs and assess the extent to which its programs duplicate or complement these efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Fund is revising its strategic plan to address the major shortcomings we observed in the current plan. Through these revisions, the Fund will have better defined its goals and better identified its strategies for achieving them, including its strategy for allocating its resources, thereby laying the foundation for determining its success in reaching results-oriented as well as non-results-oriented goals and objectives. Because strategic planning is not static, the Fund will need to continuously revise and refine its strategic plan to reflect the dynamic nature of the CDFI industry. If this process is done well, the Fund\u2019s strategic planning efforts should facilitate informed communication between the Fund and its stakeholders\u2014that is, those organizations potentially affected by or interested in the Fund\u2019s activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["The Fund officials agreed with the information in this chapter and, as we noted earlier, are taking steps to refine the Fund\u2019s strategic plan. These steps appear to address the difficulties we observed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The legislation creating the Fund required that GAO report on the Fund\u2019s structure, governance, and performance 30 months after the appointment of an Administrator of the Fund. However, as noted in chapter 1 and as agreed with your offices, this report does not review the structure and governance of the Fund because the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Inspector General is conducting an audit addressing these issues. This report discusses (1) the progress of the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund in developing performance measures for awardees in the CDFI program and systems to monitor and evaluate their progress in meeting their performance goals, as well as the accomplishments they have reported to date; (2) the performance of banks under the Bank Enterprise Award (BEA) program, the impact of the program on banks\u2019 activities and on distressed communities, and the uses to which banks have put their award funds; and (3) the Fund\u2019s progress in meeting the Results Act\u2019s requirements for strategic planning and the steps the Fund could take to improve its management. Our report focuses on the first round of awards, which the Fund made in 1996, and draws on our interviews with Fund officials; our case studies of awardees, including six CDFIs in the CDFI program and five banks in the BEA program, which we conducted to explore our objectives in more depth; the results of our survey of the CDFI field on its use of performance measures; and our analysis and review of the CDFI program\u2019s assistance agreements.", "To meet our objectives in reviewing the CDFI program, we reviewed the Fund\u2019s process for setting goals and developing performance measures with the 31 1996 awardees and discussed the Fund\u2019s performance measurement system\u2014including its development, operation, and underlying assumptions\u2014with various Fund officials responsible for working with the awardees. In addition, to supplement the information about the CDFI program that we gathered at the Fund\u2019s headquarters in Washington, D.C., we randomly selected six awardees as case studies to gain these awardees\u2019 perspectives on the process of developing performance measures, as well as to gather data that the Fund does not collect, such as information on the reporting requirements that other funding sources impose on awardees and the performance measures that these sources require.", "We randomly selected these case studies from the universe of 24 awardees that the Fund told us had signed their assistance agreements by November 1, 1997. Because the CDFI program serves a wide variety of community development organizations, we stratified our random selection by the types of CDFI awardees described in chapter 1 to ensure that our case studies included at least one of each of the most common types of CDFIs. This stratification generally mirrored the categorization used by the CDFI Fund in its first annual report. If a CDFI category was represented by only one or two awardees, then that category was combined with the closest similar category. The six case study awardees were a community development bank holding company, a community development venture capital fund, a community development credit union, a microenterprise fund, a community development loan fund, and a multifaceted community development financial institution.", "We obtained information from the awardees on the negotiations that took place between each of them and the Fund to develop the performance goals, measures, and benchmarks outlined in their assistance agreements. We discussed this information with knowledgeable Fund staff and reviewed documentation pertinent to the activities for which awards were made, including the awardees\u2019 business plans, assistance agreements, and correspondence about the negotiation process.", "To describe the performance measurement and monitoring systems used in the CDFI field, we conducted a national survey of CDFI organizations. To identify these organizations, we began by obtaining from the CDFI Fund in October 1997 its most recent list of certified CDFIs, dated June 1997, as well as lists of applicants for awards in the first (1996) and second (1997) funding rounds. In addition, we obtained membership lists from the following national community development professional organizations: the CDFI Coalition, the National Association of Community Development Credit Unions, the National Community Capital Association, and the Community Development Venture Capital Alliance. We also obtained lists from the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation and the Aspen Institute that identified neighborhood housing services and microenterprise development organizations with loan funds. Our objective was to survey not only certified CDFIs but also other CDFIs that might be eligible for certification. Using these lists, we identified a total of 925 organizations that described themselves as CDFIs. We do not believe that our list includes all such organizations nationwide. We recognize that there are probably other community development organizations that could be certified by the Fund as a CDFI, but are currently unknown to either the Fund or one of the national CDFI associations.", "To encourage responses, we sent follow-up letters and a second survey to those organizations that did not return a survey after the first mailing. In total, 623 institutions responded to our questionnaire, for a 67-percent response rate. Respondents included 87 percent of the 1996 awardees and 77 percent of the 187 CDFIs certified by the Fund as of June 1997.", "To categorize the goals and measures used by the 26 awardees that had signed their assistance agreements with the Fund by February 1998, we conducted a content analysis of the performance goals and measures included in their agreements. The questionnaire used for the survey of all CDFIs provided the framework for this analysis. The questionnaire contains an extensive list of responses that are grouped by the categories of accomplishments and activities for goals and measures. For example, one question asks about measures of community development accomplishments and lists 12 measures that an institution might use. The assistance agreements contained 87 goals and 165 measures. Each goal and each measure was classified as a specific activity or accomplishment by two evaluators who worked independently. Differences were resolved with a third evaluator, so that the evaluators reached complete agreement on their classification of goals and measures.", "We also evaluated aspects of the quality of the goals and measures in the assistance agreements, using criteria for evaluation developed on the basis of the Results Act, supplemented by Circular A-11, the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) implementing guidance, and a GAO document entitled The Results Act: An Evaluator\u2019s Guide to Assessing Agency Annual Performance Plans (GAO/GGD-10.1.20, Apr. 1998). These three documents provide more explicit guidance for developing performance goals and measures than the CDFI legislation. We refer to these three documents as \u201cthe Results Act and its guidance\u201d throughout this appendix. These evaluation criteria included the specificity, objectivity, completeness, and appropriateness of the measures. An additional criterion was whether or not the goals and measures addressed the purpose of the CDFI program, that is, to promote economic revitalization or economic development.", "Using these criteria, we constructed the following set of questions:", "Does the goal promote economic revitalization and community development?", "Does each measure have a clearly apparent or commonly accepted relationship to the intended result?", "Are only certain observations in the measure?", "Is what is to be observed or measured specified? Is any description of what is being measured given?", "Do all the measures use terms that are generally known, or if not known, are they described? Is an evaluation date (target date) given? Is an evaluation value (target value) given? Is a baseline date given? Is a baseline value given? Is a target population or geographic area given?", "Each question could be answered with a yes or a no. For nine questions, the unit of analysis was an individual goal and its associated measure(s), referred to as a \u201cgoal statement.\u201d For the two remaining questions, the unit of analysis was an individual measure. Two teams of two GAO evaluators performed the assessments; each team assessed approximately half of the goal statements. The two members of each team independently assessed each goal statement and then compared their answers. Disagreements were discussed and resolved. After the members of each team reached agreement, we compared the assessments performed by the two teams, reviewing the ratings each had given to a subset of 8 goal units (11 measures) that both teams had assessed. Reliability (percentage of concurrence on ratings) between the teams was 96 percent.", "We finished categorizing the goals and measures in the 26 assistance agreements by reviewing all of the goals and measures to determine whether the measures in each goal statement addressed all key aspects of each goal. We drew on our knowledge of the CDFI program, community development and housing finance, and OMB\u2019s guidance on the Results Act to make this judgmental determination and to identify instances in which measures did or did not address all key aspects of the associated goals.", "Finally, we reviewed the Fund\u2019s statutory, regulatory, and other reporting and monitoring requirements, as well as an existing study of the Fund\u2019s monitoring system, and we held discussions with Fund officials and officials at selected CDFI case studies to assess the Fund\u2019s progress in developing systems to monitor and evaluate the progress of the CDFI awardees in meeting their performance goals. We also reviewed quarterly progress reports submitted by 19 of the 1996 awardees and held discussions with case studies officials to assess the awardees\u2019 progress.", "For the BEA program and its awardees, we performed work at Fund headquarters similar to that we performed for the CDFI program, reviewing the Fund\u2019s guidance, policies, procedures, and other materials on the awards process and discussing these issues and others related to the program with the Fund officials administering the program. For data on the banks\u2019 performance under the program, we relied on the Fund\u2019s status report on the activities completed by awardees as of January 1998. This report includes the status of disbursements made by the Fund for specific activities completed in accordance with the awardees\u2019 agreements with the Fund.", "We conducted case studies of selected BEA awardees to explore our objectives in more depth, obtaining awardees\u2019 perspectives on the process of applying for an award and gathering information from awardees that the Fund does not collect systematically, such as information on the incentives banks identify for participating in the program and the ways they monitor and measure the progress of their investments. We also verified with these awardees (1) the information we obtained from the Fund\u2019s January 1998 status report and (2) the information the banks voluntarily reported to the Fund on their uses of award funds. We judgmentally selected a sample of five awardees for our case studies, ensuring that collectively they represented the full range of activities for which banks can receive awards. The five awardees and the activities on which their awards were based were as follows:", "Fullerton Savings and Loan, Fullerton, California (increased lending for single-family and multifamily housing);", "Bank of America Community Development Bank, Walnut Creek, California (increased lending for commercial real estate, multifamily housing, and small businesses);", "First Union Bank, Washington, D.C. (increased lending for multifamily", "Citibank, N.A., New York, New York (increased investments in CDFIs); and,", "Wells Fargo Bank of Texas, N.A., Houston, Texas (increased investments in CDFIs).", "To identify opportunities for improving the Fund\u2019s management, we asked officials we had interviewed, both at Fund headquarters and at our CDFI and BEA case studies, to identify ways of improving the 1996 awards, monitoring, and performance measurement processes. We also reviewed studies of the Fund that outlined areas for improvement and determined the extent to which these areas had or had not been addressed in the 1997 process.", "Our overall assessment of the Fund\u2019s strategic plan was generally based on our knowledge of the Fund\u2019s operations and programs, as well as on other information available at the time of our assessment. Specifically, the criteria we used to determine whether the Fund\u2019s strategic plan complied with the requirements of the Results Act were the Results Act and OMB\u2019s guidance on developing strategic plans (OMB Circular A-11, Part 2). To make judgments about the overall quality of the plan, we used our May 1997 guidance for congressional review of strategic plans (GAO/GGD-10.1.16) as a tool. To determine whether the plan contained information on interagency coordination, we relied on the President\u2019s Community Empowerment Board\u2019s Federal Programs Guide. Finally, we reviewed the Fund\u2019s fiscal year 1997 annual report and consulted with knowledgeable staff in our Accounting and Financial Management Division as part of our efforts to assess whether the Fund had adequate systems in place to provide reliable information on performance.", "We conducted our work at Treasury headquarters and at the offices of selected CDFI and BEA awardees throughout the country. We performed our review between July 1997 and June 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We relied on data provided to us by the Fund, by awardees in both the CDFI and the BEA programs, and by CDFIs responding to our survey. We did not verify the data on award amounts, disbursements, or quarterly and annual reports for the CDFI awardees as a whole or for our case studies because our work focused on the process of developing performance goals and measures, which were themselves documented in the assistance agreements. Because our conclusions and recommendations are based on that process and the resulting goals and measures, and not on the financial or performance data, we consider them to be valid. We verified with the BEA awardees the data on award amounts, disbursements, and postaward uses of funds that we obtained from the Fund."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Resources, Community, and Economic Development Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": ["Leslie Black-Plumeau Carolyn Boyce Diane Brooks Stan Czerwinski Patricia Farrell Donahue Elizabeth R.
