However, GAO's preliminary findings showed that while the two programs have taken steps to coordinate their schedules, risks, and requirements, they lacked effective processes for managing their interdependencies. Specifically:", "Among tens of thousands of schedule activities, the two programs are expected to manually identify activities that are dependent on each other, and rather than establishing one integrated dependency schedule, the programs maintain two separate dependency schedules. This has contributed to misalignment in milestones between the programs.", "The programs do not have an integrated list of interdependent program risks, and thus they do not always recognize the same risks that impact both programs.", "Among other things, key requirements have not been defined for validating responses from individuals who respond to the census using an address instead of a Bureau-assigned identification number, because of the Bureau's limited knowledge and experience in this area. The lack of knowledge and specific requirements related to this critical function is concerning, given that there is less than a year and a half remaining before the Census end-to-end test begins in August 2017 (which is intended to test all key systems and operations to ensure readiness for the 2020 Census).", "Officials have acknowledged these weaknesses and reported that they are taking, or plan to take, steps to address the issues. However, until these interdependencies are managed more effectively, the Bureau will be limited in understanding the work needed by both programs to meet milestones, mitigate major risks, and ensure that requirements are appropriately identified.", "While the large-scale technological changes for the 2020 Decennial Census introduce great potential for efficiency and effectiveness gains, they also introduce many information security challenges. For example, the introduction of an option for households to respond using the Internet puts respondents more at risk for phishing attacks (requests for information from authentic-looking, but fake, e-mails and websites). In addition, because the Bureau plans to allow its enumerators to use mobile devices to collect information from households who did not self-respond to the survey, it is important that the Bureau ensures that these devices are adequately protected. The Bureau has begun efforts to address many of these challenges; as it begins implementing the 2020 Census design, continued focus on these considerable security challenges will be critical."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO's draft report includes several recommendations to help the Bureau better manage CEDCAP and 2020 Census program interdependencies related to schedule, risk, and requirements.

Specifically, the  Bureau is aiming to modernize and automate its outdated and inefficient  methods of conducting decennial censuses, and to save the government  approximately $5.2 billion. This includes plans to significantly change the  methods and technology it uses to count the population, such as offering  an option for households to respond to the survey via the Internet,  enabling a mobile data collection application for field enumerators to use  on mobile devices to collect survey data from households, and  automating the management of field operations.

This plan outlines 350 redesign decisions that the  Bureau has either made or is planning to make. The Bureau has  determined that about 51 percent of the design decisions are either IT- related or partially IT-related (84 IT-related and 94 partially IT-related) and  the Bureau reported that, as of April 2016, it had made about 58 percent  of these decisions (48 IT-related and 55 partially IT-related).", "Examples of decisions that have been made include the following:  Internet response\u2014For the first time on a nationwide scale, the  Bureau will allow individuals/households to respond to the census on  the Internet from a computer, mobile device, or other devices that  access the Internet.", "Non-ID processing with real-time address matching\u2014The Bureau  will provide each household with a unique ID by mail. However, users  may also respond to the online survey without the unique ID by  entering their address. This operation includes conducting real-time  matching of respondent-provided addresses.", "Non-response follow-up\u2014If a household does not respond to the  census by a certain date, the Bureau will send out employees to visit  the home. These enumerators will use a census application, on a  mobile device provided by the Bureau, to capture the information  given to them by the in-person interviews. The Bureau will also  manage the case workload of these enumerators using an operational  control system that automatically assigns, updates, and monitors  cases during non-response follow-up.", "Administrative records\u2014As we reported in October 2015, the  Bureau is working on obtaining and using administrative records from  other government agencies, state and local governments, and third- party organizations to reduce the workload of enumerators in their  non-response follow-up work. For example, the Bureau plans to use  administrative records to, among other things, identify vacant housing  units to remove from enumerators\u2019 workloads.", "Mobile devices\u2014The Bureau plans to award a contract that would  provide commercially available mobile phones and the accompanying  service contract on behalf of the Census Bureau to enumerators, who  will use these devices to collect census data. This approach is  referred to as the device-as-a-service strategy.", "Cloud computing\u2014The Bureau plans to use a hybrid cloud solution  where it is feasible, and has decided it will use cloud services for the  Internet response option as well as for non-ID processing with real- time address matching.", "Address canvassing\u2014The Bureau has decided to reengineer its  address canvassing process to reduce the need for employing field  staff to walk every street in the nation in order to update its address  list and maps. For example, the Bureau plans to first conduct in-office  address canvassing using aerial imagery, administrative records, and  commercial data before sending staff into the field.", "Figure 1 provides an overview of additional decisions and assumptions  for the 2020 Census, resulting from the October 2015 operational plan.", "The decisions made to date have been informed by several major field  tests, including  the 2014 Census test, which was conducted in the Maryland and  Washington, D.C., areas to test new methods for conducting self- response and non-response follow-up;  the 2015 Census Test in Arizona, which tested, among other things,  the use of a field operations management system to automate data  collection operations and provide real-time data and the ability to  reduce the non-response follow-up workload using data previously  provided to the government, as well as enabling enumerators to use  their personally owned mobile devices to collect census data; and  the 2015 Optimizing Self-Response test in Savannah, Georgia, and  the surrounding area, which was intended to explore methods of  encouraging households to respond using the Internet, such as using  advertising and outreach to motivate respondents, and enabling  households to respond without a Bureau-issued identification number.", "The following are examples of decisions that had not been finalized as of  April 2016:  Invalid return detection and non-ID response validation\u2014The  Bureau has not decided on its approach for identifying whether  fraudulent returns have been submitted for the 2020 Census or the  criteria and thresholds to decide whether further investigation may be  needed, such as field follow-up.", "Solutions architecture\u2014While the Bureau has established a notional  solutions architecture for the 2020 Census, it has not decided on the  final design.", "Internet response for island areas\u2014The Bureau has not decided on  the extent to which the Internet self-response option will be available  for island area respondents.", "Additional uses of cloud\u2014While Bureau officials have decided on  select uses of cloud-based solutions, decisions remain on additional  possible uses.

Thus CEDCAP is  integral to helping the 2020 Census program achieve its estimated $5.2  billion cost savings goal. Accordingly, as reported in the President\u2019s  Budget for Fiscal Year 2017, over 50 percent of CEDCAP\u2019s funding for  fiscal year 2017 ($57.5 million of the requested $104 million) is expected  to come from the 2020 Census program.", "The CEDCAP program, which began in October 2014, is intended to  provide data collection and processing solutions (including systems,  interfaces, platforms and environments) to support the Bureau\u2019s entire  survey life cycle (including survey design; instrument development;  sample design and implementation; data collection; and data editing,  imputation, and estimation).", "The program consists of 12 projects, which have the potential to offer  numerous benefits to the Bureau\u2019s survey programs, including the 2020  Census program, such as enabling an Internet response option;  automating the assignment, controlling, and tracking of enumerator  caseloads; and enabling a mobile data collection tool for field work.  Eleven of these projects are intended to deliver one or more IT solutions.  The twelfth project\u2014IT Infrastructure Scale-Up\u2014is not intended to deliver  IT capabilities, solutions, or infrastructure; rather, it is expected to provide  funding to the other relevant projects to acquire the necessary hardware  and infrastructure to enable 2020 Census systems to scale to  accommodate the volume of users.

The remaining 6 releases  support the other surveys such as the American Community Survey  (ACS) and Economic Census. Most recently, the CEDCAP program has  been working on delivering the functionality needed for the third product  release, which is to support a major census test, referred to as the 2016  Census Test\u2014conducted by the 2020 Census program to inform  additional decennial design decisions.", "The 2018 Census end-to-end test (mentioned previously) is critical to  testing all production-level systems and operations in a census-like  environment to ensure readiness for the 2020 Census.

Figure 2 identifies which  of the 13 CEDCAP product releases support the 2020 Census versus  other surveys, as of May 2016.", "The Bureau\u2019s past efforts to implement new approaches and systems  have not always gone as planned. As one example, during the 2010  Census, the Bureau planned to use handheld mobile devices to support  field data collection for the census, including following up with  nonrespondents. However, due to significant problems identified during  testing of the devices, cost overruns, and schedule slippages, the Bureau  decided not to use the handheld devices for non-response follow-up and  reverted to paper-based processing, which increased the cost of the 2010  Census by up to $3 billion and significantly increased its risk as it had to  switch its operations to paper-based operations as a backup. Due in  part to these technology issues the Bureau was facing, we designated the  2010 Census a high-risk area in March 2008.", "We have also identified and reported on numerous occasions concerns  about the Bureau\u2019s IT internal control, its IT preparations for the 2020  Census, and its looming deadline. Accordingly, we identified CEDCAP  as an IT investment in need of attention in our February 2015 High-Risk  report.", "Further, we testified in November 2015 that key IT decisions needed to  be made soon because the Bureau was less than 2 years away from end- to-end testing of all systems and operations to ensure readiness for the  2020 Census and there was limited time to implement it. We  emphasized that the Bureau had deferred key IT-related decisions, and  that it was running out of time to develop, acquire, and implement the  systems it will need to deliver the redesign and achieve its projected $5.2  billion in cost savings.", "In addition to the IT issues I am testifying on today, there are other risks  and uncertainties facing a successful headcount that we are monitoring at  the request of Congress. For example, in October 2015, we reported on  actions the Bureau needs to take in order to ensure it fully realizes  potential cost-savings associated with its planned use of administrative  records. Likewise, we are assessing the reliability of the Bureau\u2019s  estimate of the cost of the 2020 Census and anticipate issuing that report  to Congress later this month.

The 11 ongoing projects have efforts under way to  deliver 17 solutions, which are in different phases of planning and design.", "For 8 of the 17 solutions, the Bureau recently completed an analysis  of alternatives to determine whether it will acquire commercial-off-the- shelf (COTS) solutions or whether they will be built in-house in order  to deliver the needed capabilities. On May 25, 2016, the Bureau  issued a memorandum documenting its decision to acquire the  capabilities using a COTS product. The memorandum also described  the process used to select the commercial vendor.", "For the remaining 9 IT solutions, the Bureau has identified the  sourcing approach (e.g., buy, build, or use/modify existing system)  and has either identified the solution to be implemented or are in the  process of evaluating potential solutions.

This involves comparing  actual cost and schedule against the documented plan for the full  scope of the project and communicating the results. While the three  projects meet weekly to monitor the current status of each project and  produce monthly reports that document cost and schedule progress,  their plans did not include sufficient detail against which to monitor  progress. For example, project planning documents for the three  projects did not include key information, such as when build-or-buy  decisions were to be made or when final systems are to be released.  This is especially problematic when the production systems that these  projects are expected to produce need to be implemented in time for  the 2018 end-to-end system integration test, which begins in August  2017 (in less than a year and a half). Bureau officials agreed with our  concerns and in June 2016 they stated that they are in the process of  updating the project plans and expect to be done by August 2016. It  will be important that these plans include the full scope of these  projects to enable the project managers and the CEDCAP program  manager to determine progress relative to the full scope of the  projects.", "Document significant deviations in performance. Projects should  identify and document when deviations from planned cost and  schedule occur that, if left unresolved, would preclude the project from  meeting its objectives. The Bureau\u2019s monthly progress reports capture  schedule and cost variances and document when these variances  exceed the threshold for significant deviation, which is 8 percent. For  example, the Internet and Mobile data collection project had a cost  variance of 20 percent in September 2015 and the Survey (and  Listing) Interview Operational Control project had a cost variance of  25 percent in September 2015, which were flagged by the projects as  exceeding the significant deviation threshold. However, the projects  are measuring deviations against their budgeted amounts, which are  based on the 2013 CEDCAP program office cost estimate. This  estimate was developed based on very early assumptions and limited  details about the program and is thus out-of-date. In the absence of  an up-to-date cost estimate, the program lacks a basis for monitoring  true deviations in performance. Accordingly, our draft report includes  a recommendation that the Bureau update the CEDCAP program  office cost estimate to reflect the current status of the program as  soon as appropriate information becomes available.", "Taking corrective actions to address issues when necessary.", "Projects should take timely corrective actions, such as revising the  original plan, establishing new agreements, or including additional  mitigation activities in the current plan, to address issues when cost or  schedule deviates significantly from the plan. The CEDCAP program  has established a process for taking corrective actions to address  issues when needed and, as of April 2016, Bureau officials stated  they have not needed to take any corrective actions to address  CEDCAP program issues. For example, while we found several  significant deviations in cost and schedule for the three projects in the  monthly progress reports, these did not require corrective actions  because they were due to, for example, delays in contract payments,  contract awards, and other obligations for hardware and software  outside the control of the CEDCAP program office.", "Monitoring the status of risks periodically. This practice can result  in the discovery of new risks, revisions to existing risks, or the need to  implement a risk mitigation plan. The three projects monitor the status  of their risks in bi-weekly project status meetings and monthly risk  review board meetings, have established risk registers, and regularly  update the status of risks in their registers. However, while according  to Bureau officials the projects are to document updates on the status  of their risks in their respective risk registers, the Internet and Mobile  Data Collection and Survey (and Listing) Interview Operational  Control projects do not consistently document status updates. For  example, these programs had not updated the status of medium- probability, medium-impact risks for several months. Bureau officials  recognized the need to document updates in the risk registers more  consistently and stated that efforts are under way to address this, but  they did not have an estimated completion date. Until these efforts are  complete, the Bureau will not have comprehensive information on how  risks are being managed. Accordingly, our draft report includes a  recommendation that the Bureau ensure that updates to the status of  risks are consistently documented for CEDCAP\u2019s Internet and Mobile  Data Collection and Survey (and Listing) Interview Operational  Control projects.", "Implementing risk mitigation plans. Risk mitigation plans that  include sufficient detail\u2014such as start and completion dates and  trigger events and dates\u2014provide early warning that a risk is about to  occur or has just occurred and are valuable in assessing risk urgency.  As of October 2015, the three projects had developed basic risk  mitigation steps for each of the risks associated with the projects that  required a mitigation plan. However, these risk mitigation plans lacked  important details such as start or completion dates. Additionally, two  projects did not have any trigger events for their risks that exceed a  predefined exposure threshold. Bureau officials recognized that there  were issues with their risk management process and stated that they  were working on addressing them. Bureau officials told us they had  revised their risk management process to address these weaknesses,  but it was unclear to what extent this process has been implemented.  Without detailed risk mitigation plans and trigger events, officials will  be hindered in their ability to identify potential problems and mitigate  their impacts.

About half of  CEDCAP\u2019s major product releases (7 of 13 total), are to align with and  support the remaining 6 major 2020 Census tests, as well as the  operations of the 2020 Census. Accordingly, the CEDCAP and 2020  Census programs have both established master schedules that contain  thousands of milestones and tens of thousands of activities through 2020  Census production and have identified major milestones within each  program that are intended to align with each other. In addition, both  program management offices have established processes for managing  their respective master schedules.", "However, the CEDCAP and 2020 Census programs maintain their master  schedules using different software where dependencies between the two  programs are not automatically linked and are not dynamically responsive  to change, as called for by best practices identified in our Schedule  Assessment Guide. Consequently, the two programs have been  manually identifying activities within their master schedules that are  dependent on each other, and rather than establishing one dependency  schedule, as best practices dictate, the programs have developed two  separate dependency schedules for each program, and meet weekly with  the intent of coordinating these two schedules. Our schedule guide also  indicates that constantly updating a schedule manually defeats the  purpose of a dynamic schedule and can make the schedule particularly  prone to error.", "In addition, the programs\u2019 dependency schedules only include near-term  schedule dependencies, and not future milestones through 2020 Census  production. For example, as of February 2016, the dependency  schedules only included tasks associated with the CEDCAP product  release in support of the 2020 Census program\u2019s 2016 Census Test  through July 2016. According to Bureau officials, they are currently  working to incorporate activities for the next set of near-term milestones,  which are to support the 2016 Address Canvassing Test.", "This practice of maintaining separate dependency schedules which must  be manually reconciled has proven to be ineffective, as it has contributed  to the misalignment between the programs\u2019 schedules. For example:", "The CEDCAP program originally planned to complete build-or-buy  decisions for several capabilities by October 2016, while the 2020  Census timeline specified that these decisions would be ready by  June 2016. In November 2015, CEDCAP officials stated that they  recognized this misalignment and decided to accelerate certain build- or-buy decisions to align with 2020 Census needs.", "As of April 2016, while CEDCAP\u2019s major product releases need to be  developed and deployed to support the delivery of 2020 Census\u2019  major tests, CEDCAP\u2019s releases and 2020 Census\u2019 major tests  milestones were not always aligned to ensure CEDCAP releases  would be available in time. For example, development of the seventh  CEDCAP release, which is intended to support the 2017 Census Test,  is not scheduled to begin until almost a month after the 2017 Census  Test is expected to begin (December 2016), and is not planned to be  completed until about 2 months after the 2017 Census Test ends (July  2017). Bureau officials acknowledged that CEDCAP release dates  need to be revised to accurately reflect the program\u2019s current planned  time frames and to appropriately align with 2020 Census time frames.  Officials stated that these changes will be made by the end of May  2016.", "Adding to the complexity of coordinating the two programs\u2019 schedules,  several key decisions by the 2020 Census program are not planned to be  made until later in the decade, as we testified in November 2015. This  may impact CEDCAP\u2019s ability to deliver those future requirements and  have production-ready systems in place in time to conduct end-to-end  testing, which is to begin in August 2017. For example, the Bureau does  not plan to decide on the full complement of applications, data,  infrastructure, security, monitoring, and service management for the 2020  Census\u2014referred to as the solutions architecture\u2014until September 2016.

Program officials stated that they  aim to document this process by June 2016, but this would at best  document a process that has not been effective, likely leading to  additional misalignment in the future.", "We concluded in our draft report that without an effective process for  ensuring alignment between the two programs, the Bureau faces  increased risk that capabilities for carrying out the 2020 Census will not  be delivered as intended. Thus, our draft report (which is with Commerce  and the Bureau for comment) includes a recommendation that the Bureau  define, document, and implement a repeatable process to establish  complete alignment between CEDCAP and 2020 Census programs by,  for example, maintaining a single dependency schedule."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CEDCAP and 2020 Census Programs Do Not Have an Integrated List of Risks Facing Both Programs", "paragraphs": ["The CEDCAP and 2020 Census programs were also not effectively  managing risks common to the two programs. Both the CEDCAP and  2020 Census programs have taken steps to collaborate on identifying and  mitigating risks. For example, both programs have processes in place for  identifying and mitigating risks that affect their respective programs,  facilitate risk review boards, and have representatives attend each other\u2019s  risk review board meetings to help promote consistency.", "However, our preliminary findings indicate that these programs do not  have an integrated list of risks (referred to as a risk register) with agreed- upon roles and responsibilities for tracking them, as called for by best  practices identified by GAO for collaboration and leading practices in risk  management. This decentralized approach introduces two key  problems.", "First, there are inconsistencies in tracking and managing interdependent  risks. Specifically, selected risks were recognized by one program\u2019s risk  management process and not the other, including the following examples  as of March 2016:", "The CEDCAP program identified the lack of real-time schedule  linkages as a high probability, high-impact risk in its risk register,  which as of March 2016 had been realized and was considered an  issue for the program. However, the 2020 Census program had not  recognized this as a risk in its risk register.", "While CEDCAP had identified the ability to scale systems to meet the  needs of the Decennial Census as a medium-probability, high-impact  risk in its risk register, the 2020 Census program had not recognized  this as a risk in its risk register.", "The CEDCAP program had identified the need to define how the  Bureau will manage and use cloud services to ensure successful  integration of cloud services with existing infrastructure as a low  probability, high-impact risk in its risk register; however, the 2020  Census program had not recognized the adoption of cloud services as  a formal risk in its risk register. This is especially problematic as the  2020 Census program recently experienced a notable setback  regarding cloud implementation. Specifically, the 2020 Census  program was originally planning to use a commercial cloud  environment in the 2016 Census Test, which would have been the  first time the Bureau used a cloud service in a major census test to  collect census data from residents in parts of the country. However,  leading up to the 2016 Census Test, the program experienced stability  issues with the cloud environment. Accordingly, in March 2016, the  2020 Census program decided to cancel its plans to use the cloud  environment in the 2016 Census Test. Officials stated that they plan  to use the cloud in future census tests.", "According to 2020 Census program officials, they did not consider the  lack of real-time schedule linkages to be a risk because they were  conducting weekly integration meetings and coordinating with CEDCAP  on their schedules to ensure proper alignment. However, manually  resolving incompatible schedules in different software can be time- consuming, expensive, and prone to errors. And, as noted above, the  Bureau\u2019s process for managing schedule dependencies between the two  programs has not been effective. Regarding the lack of scalability and  cloud services risks in the 2020 Census risk log, 2020 Census program  officials acknowledged that it was an oversight and that they should have  been recognized by the program as formal risks.", "The second problem of not having an integrated risk register is that  tracking risks in two different registers can result in redundant efforts and  potentially conflicting mitigation efforts. For example, both programs have  identified in their separate risk registers several common risks, such as  risks related to late changes in requirements, integration of systems,  human resources, build or buy decisions, and cybersecurity. These  interdependent risks found in both risk registers can introduce the  potential for duplicative or inefficient risk mitigation efforts and the need  for additional reconciliation efforts.", "Thus we concluded in our draft report that until it establishes a  comprehensive list of risks facing both the CEDCAP and 2020 Census  programs, and agrees on their respective roles and responsibilities for  jointly managing this list, the Bureau is in danger of not fully addressing  risks facing the programs. Accordingly, in our draft report we include a  recommendation that the Bureau establish a comprehensive and  integrated list of all interdependent risks facing the CEDCAP and 2020  Census programs, and clearly identify roles and responsibilities for  managing this list."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Processes for Managing Requirements between CEDCAP and 2020 Census Have Not Been Finalized", "paragraphs": ["Lastly, despite their significant interdependencies, a process for  managing requirements for the two programs has not been finalized.

Additionally, for the 2020 Census program, the Bureau  established the 2020 Census Systems Engineering and Integration  program office, which is responsible for delivering 2020 Census business  requirements to the Office of Innovation and Implementation. CEDCAP  receives the requirements on an incremental basis and builds  functionality containing subsets of the requirements in the 40-day cycles.", "However, as of April 2016, the Office of Innovation and Implementation\u2019s  process for collecting and synthesizing requirements, obtaining  commitment to those requirements from stakeholders, and managing  changes to the requirements\u2014as recommended by best practices\u2014had  not been finalized. According to Bureau officials, they have drafted the  process and are working on incorporating feedback from customers.  Office officials stated that they plan to finalize this documentation by June  2016. Additionally, as of April 2016, the 2020 Census Systems  Engineering and Integration program had not yet finalized its program  management plan which outlines, among other things, how it is to  establish requirements to be delivered to the Office of Innovation and  Implementation, which are then to be delivered to CEDCAP. According to  program officials, they have been working on a draft of this plan and  expect it to be finalized by June 2016. As a result, the Bureau has  developed three CEDCAP releases without having a fully documented  and institutionalized process for collecting those requirements.", "In addition, the 2020 Census program identified about 2,500 capability  requirements needed for the 2020 Census; however, there are gaps in  these requirements. Specifically, we determined that of the 2,500  capability requirements, 86 should be assigned to a test prior to the 2020  Census, but were not. These included 64 requirements related to  redistricting data program, 10 requirements related to data products and  dissemination, and 12 requirements related to non-ID response  validation. Bureau officials stated that the 74 redistricting data program  and data products and dissemination requirements have not yet been  assigned to a Census test because they have not yet gone through the  Bureau\u2019s quality control process, which is planned for later this calendar  year.", "Regarding the 12 non-ID response validation requirements, Bureau  officials stated that once this area is better understood, a more complete  set of requirements will be established, and then they will assign the  requirements to particular tests, as appropriate. As of April 2016, the  Bureau was in the early stages of conducting research in this area. Thus,  it has not tested non-ID response validation in the 2013, 2014, or 2015  Census tests. These tests were intended to, among other things, help  define requirements around critical functions. With less than a year and a  half remaining before the 2018 Census end-to-end test begins, the lack of  experience and specific requirements related to non-ID response  validation is especially concerning, as incomplete and late definition of  requirements proved to be serious issues for the 2010 Census.", "Failure to fully define requirements has been a problem for the Bureau in  the past. Specifically, leading up to the 2010 Census, we reported in  October 2007 that not fully defining requirements had contributed to both  cost increases and schedule delays experienced by the failed program to  deliver handheld computers for field data collection\u2014contributing to an up  to $3 billion overrun. Increases in the number of requirements led to the  need for additional work and staffing. Moreover, we reported in 2009 and  2010 that the Bureau\u2019s late development of an operational control system  to manage its paper-based census collection operations resulted in  system outages and slow performance during the 2010 Census. The  Bureau attributed these issues, in part, to the compressed development  and testing schedule.", "As the 2020 Census continues to make future design decisions and  CEDCAP continues to deliver incremental functionality, it is critical to  have a fully documented and institutionalized process for managing  requirements. Additionally, we concluded in our draft report that until  measures are taken to identify when the 74 requirements related to the  redistricting data program and data products and dissemination will be  tested, and to make developing a better understanding of, and identifying  requirements related to, non-ID response validation a high and immediate  priority, or to consider alternatives to avoid late definition of such  requirements, the Bureau is at risk of experiencing similar issues that it  experienced during the 2010 Census. Thus, our draft report includes the  following recommendations:  finalize documentation of processes for managing requirements for  CEDCAP;  identify when the 74 requirements related to redistricting data program  and data products and dissemination will be tested; and make developing a better understanding of and identifying  requirements related to non-ID respondent validation a high and  immediate priority, or consider alternatives to avoid late definition of  such requirements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Census Bureau Faces Several Information Security Challenges in Implementing the 2020 Census", "paragraphs": ["While the Bureau plans to extensively use IT systems to support the 2020  Census redesign in an effort to realize potentially significant efficiency  gains and cost savings, this redesign introduces the following critical  information security challenges.", "Developing policies and procedures to minimize the threat of  phishing\u2014Phishing is a digital form of social engineering that uses  authentic-looking, but fake, e-mails, websites, or instant messages to  get users to download malware, open malicious attachments, or open  links that direct them to a website that requests information or  executes malicious code. Phishing attacks could target respondents,  as well as Census employees and contractors. The 2020 Census will  be the first one in which respondents will be heavily encouraged to  respond via the Internet. The Bureau plans to highly promote the use  of the Internet self-response option throughout the nation and  expects, based on preliminary research, that approximately 50  percent of U.S. households will use this option. This will likely  increase the risk that cyber criminals will use phishing in an attempt to  steal personal information. A report developed by a contractor for the  Bureau noted that criminals may pretend to be a census worker caller,  or website, to phish for personal information such as Social Security  numbers and bank information.", "Further, phishing attacks directed at Census employees, including  approximately 300,000 temporary employees, could have serious  effects. The U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT)  has recently reported on phishing campaigns targeting federal  government agencies that are intended to install malware on  government computer systems. These could act as an entry point for  attackers to spread throughout an organization\u2019s entire enterprise,  steal sensitive personal information, or disrupt business operations.", "To minimize the threat of phishing, organizations such as US-CERT  and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  recommend several actions for organizations, including  communicating with users. Additionally, as we previously reported,  in 2015 the White House and the Office of Management and Budget  identified anti-phishing as a key area for federal agencies to focus on  in enhancing their information security practices.", "Ensuring that individuals gain only limited and appropriate  access to 2020 Census data\u2014The Decennial Census plans to  enable a public-facing website and mobile devices to collect  personally identifiable information (PII) (e.g., name, address, and date  of birth) from the nation\u2019s entire population\u2014estimated to be over 300  million. In addition, the Bureau is planning to obtain and store  administrative records containing PII from other government agencies  to help augment information that enumerators did not collect.  Additionally, the 2020 Census will be highly promoted and visible  throughout the nation, which could increase its appeal to malicious  actors. Specifically, cyber criminals may attempt to steal personal  information collected during and for the 2020 Decennial Census,  through techniques such as social engineering, sniffing of unprotected  traffic, and malware installed on vulnerable machines.", "We have reported on challenges to the federal government and the  private sector in ensuring the privacy of personal information posed by  advances in technology. For example, in our 2015 High Risk List, we  expanded one of our high-risk areas\u2014ensuring the security of federal  information systems and cyber critical infrastructure\u2014to include  protecting the privacy of PII. Technological advances have allowed  both government and private sector entities to collect and process  extensive amounts of PII more effectively.", "However, the number of reported security incidents involving PII at  federal agencies has increased dramatically in recent years. Because  of these challenges, we have recommended, among other things, that  federal agencies improve their response to information security  incidents and data breaches involving PII, and consistently develop  and implement privacy policies and procedures. Accordingly, it will be  important for the Bureau ensure that only respondents and Bureau  officials are able to gain access to this information and that  enumerators and other employees only have access to the  information needed to perform their jobs.", "Adequately protecting mobile devices\u2014The 2020 Census will be  the first one in which the Census Bureau will provide mobile devices  to enumerators to collect personally identifiable information from  households who did not self-respond to the survey. The Bureau plans  to use a contractor to provide approximately 300,000 census-taking- ready mobile devices to enumerators. The contractor will be  responsible for, among other things, the provisioning, shipping,  storage, and decommissioning of the devices. The enumerators will  use the mobile devices to collect non-response follow-up activities.", "Many threats to mobile devices are similar to those for traditional  computing devices; however, the threats and attacks to mobile  devices are facilitated by vulnerabilities in the design and  configuration of mobile devices, as well as the ways consumers use  them. Common vulnerabilities include a failure to enable password  protection and operating systems that are not kept up to date with the  latest security patches. In addition, because of their small size and  use outside an office setting, mobile devices are easier to misplace or  steal, leaving their sensitive information at risk of unauthorized use or  theft.", "In 2012 we reported on key security controls and practices to reduce  vulnerabilities in mobile devices, protect proprietary and other  confidential business data that could be stolen from mobile devices,  and ensure that mobile devices connected to the organization\u2019s  network do not threaten the security of the network itself. For  example, we reported that organizations can require that devices  meet government specifications before they are deployed, limit  storage on mobile devices, and ensure that all data on the device are  cleared before the device is disposed of. Doing so can help protect  against inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information that is  collected on the mobile devices. Accordingly, we recommended,  among other things, that the Department of Homeland Security, in  collaboration with the Department of Commerce, establish measures  about consumer awareness of mobile security. In September 2013,  the Department of Homeland Security addressed this  recommendation by developing a public awareness campaign with  performance measures related to mobile security.", "Ensuring adequate control in a cloud environment\u2014The Bureau  has decided to use cloud solutions whenever possible for the 2020  Census; however, as stated previously, it has not yet determined all of  the needed cloud capabilities. In September 2014, we reported that  cloud computing has both positive and negative information security  implications for federal agencies. Potential information security  benefits include the use of automation to expedite the implementation  of secure configurations on devices; reduced need to carry data on  removable media because of broad network access; and low-cost  disaster recovery and data storage. However, the use of cloud  computing can also create numerous information security risks for  federal agencies, including that cloud service vendors may not be  familiar with security requirements that are unique to government  agencies, such as continuous monitoring and maintaining an  inventory of systems. Thus, we reported that, to reduce the risks, it is  important for federal agencies to examine the specific security  controls of the provider the agency is evaluating when considering the  use of cloud computing.", "In addition, in April 2016, we reported that agencies should develop  service-level agreements with cloud providers that specify, among  other things, the security performance requirements\u2014including data  reliability, preservation, privacy, and access rights\u2014that the service  provider is to meet. Without these safeguards, computer systems  and networks, as well as the critical operations and key infrastructures  they support, may be lost, and information\u2014including sensitive  personal information\u2014may be compromised, and the agency\u2019s  operations could be disrupted.", "Adequately considering information security when making  decisions about the IT solutions and infrastructure supporting  the 2020 Census\u2014Design decisions related to the 2020 Census will  have security implications to be considered when making decisions  about future 2020 Census design features. As described previously,  as of April, the Census Bureau still had yet to make 350 decisions  about the 2020 Census, and half of those have an IT component. For  example, the Bureau has not yet made decisions about key aspects of  its IT infrastructure to be used for the 2020 Census, including defining  all of the components of the solution architecture (applications, data,  infrastructure, security, monitoring, and service management),  deciding whether it will develop a mobile application to enable  respondents to submit their survey responses on their mobile devices,  and deciding how it plans to use cloud providers.", "We have previously reported on challenges that the Bureau has had  in making decisions in a timely manner. Specifically, in April 2014, and  again in April 2015, we noted that key decisions had yet to be made  about the 2020 Census, and noted that as momentum builds toward  Census Day 2020, the margin for schedule slippages is getting  increasingly slim. The Chief Information Security Officer echoed these  concerns, stating that any schedule slippage can affect the time  needed to conduct a comprehensive security assessment. As key  design decisions are deferred and the time to make such decisions  becomes more compressed, it is important that the Bureau ensures  that information security is adequately considered and assessed when  making design decisions about the IT solutions and infrastructure to  be used for the 2020 Census.", "Making certain key IT positions are filled and have appropriate  information security knowledge and expertise\u2014As our prior work  and leading guidance recognize, having the right knowledge and skills  is critical to the success of a program, and mission-critical skills gaps  in such occupations as cybersecurity pose a high risk to the nation.  Whether within specific federal agencies or across the federal  workforce, these skills gaps impede federal agencies in cost- effectively serving the public and achieving results. Because of this,  we added strategic human capital management, including  cybersecurity human capital, to our High Risk List in 2001, and it  remains on that list today. These skills gaps are also a key  contributing factor to our high-risk area of ensuring the security of  federal information systems. As we reported in February 2015,  although steps have been taken to close critical skills gaps in the  cybersecurity area, it remains an ongoing problem and additional  efforts are needed to address this issue government-wide.", "We also reported in February 2015, that the Bureau continues to have  critical skills gaps, such as in cloud computing, security integration  and engineering, enterprise/mission engineering life-cycle,  requirements development, and internet data collection. The Bureau  has made some progress in addressing its skills gaps and continues  to work toward ensuring that key information security skills are in  place. However, the Bureau has faced longstanding vacancies in key  IT positions, such as the Chief Information Officer (vacant from July  2015 to June 2016) and the CEDCAP Chief Security Engineer (vacant  since October 2015). Ensuring that key positions are filled with staff  who have the appropriate expertise will be important to ensure that  security controls are adequately designed in the systems used to  collect and store census data.", "Ensuring that contingency and incident response plans are in  place that encompass all of the IT systems to be used to support  the 2020 Census\u2014Because of the brief time frame for collecting data  during the Decennial Census, it is especially important that systems  are available for respondents to ensure a high response rate.  Contingency planning and incident response help ensure that if  normal operations are interrupted, network managers are able to  detect, mitigate, and recover from a service disruption while  preserving access to vital information. Implementing important  security controls including policies, procedures, and techniques for  contingency planning and incident response helps to ensure the  confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and systems,  even during disruptions of service.", "However, we have reported on weaknesses across the federal  government in these areas. Specifically, in April 2014 we estimated  that federal agencies (including the Department of Commerce) had  not completely documented actions taken in response to detected  incidents reported in fiscal year 2012 in about 65 percent of cases.  We made a number of recommendations to improve agencies\u2019 cyber  incident response practices, such as developing incident response  plans and procedures and testing them.", "Adequately training Bureau employees, including its massive  temporary workforce, in information security awareness\u2014The  Census Bureau plans to hire an enormous temporary workforce  during the 2020 Census activities, including about 300,000 temporary  employees to, among other things, use contractor-furnished mobile  devices to collect personal information from households that have not  yet responded to the Census. Because uninformed people can be one  of the weakest links when securing systems and networks,  information security awareness training is intended to inform agency  personnel of the information security risks associated with their  activities and their responsibilities in complying with agency policies  and procedures designed to reduce these risks. However, ensuring  that every one of the approximately 300,000 temporary enumerators  is sufficiently trained in information security will be challenging.  Providing training to agency personnel, such as this new and  temporary staff, will be critical to securing information and systems.", "Making certain security assessments are completed in a timely  manner and that risks are at an acceptable level\u2014According to  guidance from NIST, after testing an information system, authorizing  officials determine whether the risks (e.g., unaddressed  vulnerabilities) are acceptable and issue an authorization to operate.  Each of the systems that the 2020 Census IT architecture plans to  rely on will need to undergo a security assessment and obtain  authorization to operate before they can be used for the 2020 Census.", "Properly configuring and patching systems supporting the 2020  Census\u2014Configuration management controls ensure that only  authorized and fully tested software is placed in operation, software  and hardware are updated, information systems are monitored,  patches are applied to these systems to protect against known  vulnerabilities, and emergency changes are documented and  approved. We reported in September 2015 that for fiscal year 2014,  22 of the 24 agencies in our review (including the Department of  Commerce) had weaknesses in configuration management controls.  Moreover, in April 2015, US-CERT issued an alert stating that cyber  threat adversaries continue to exploit common, but unpatched,  software products from vendors such as Adobe, Microsoft, and  Oracle. Without strong configuration and patch management, an  attacker may exploit a vulnerability not yet mitigated, enabling  unauthorized access to information systems or enabling users to have  access to greater privileges than authorized.", "The Bureau\u2019s acting Chief Information Officer and its Chief Information  Security Officer have acknowledged these challenges and described the  Bureau\u2019s plans to address them. For example, the Bureau has developed  a risk management framework, which is intended to ensure that proper  security controls are in place and provide authorizing officials with details  on residual risk and progress to address those risks. In addition, the  Bureau has also embedded three security engineers in the 2020 Census  program to provide assistance and guidance to project teams. Bureau  officials also stated that they are in the process of filling\u2014or plan to fill\u2014 vacancies in key positions and intend to hire staff with expertise in key  areas, such as cloud computing. To minimize the risk of phishing, Bureau  officials note that they plan to contract with a company to monitor the  Internet for fraudulent sites pretending to be the Census Bureau.  Continued focus on these considerable challenges will be important as  the Bureau begins to develop and/or acquire systems and implement the  2020 design.", "We have previously reported on Census Bureau weaknesses that are  related to many of these information security challenges. Specifically, we  reported in January 2013 that the Bureau had a number of weaknesses in  its information security controls due in part to the fact that it had not fully  implemented a comprehensive information security program. Thus, we  made 13 public recommendations in areas such as security awareness  training, incident response, and security assessments. We also made 102  recommendations to address technical weaknesses we identified related  to access controls, configuration management, and contingency  planning.", "As of May 2016, the Bureau had made significant progress in addressing  these recommendations. Specifically, it had implemented all 13 public  recommendations and 88 of 102 technical recommendations. For  example, the Bureau developed and implemented a risk management  framework with a goal of better management visibility of information  security risks; this framework addressed a recommendation to document  acceptance of risks for management review.", "Of the remaining 14 open recommendations, we have determined that 3  require additional actions by the Bureau, and for the other 11 we have  work under way to evaluate if they have been fully addressed. These  recommendations pertain to access controls and configuration  management, and are related to two of the security challenges we  previously mentioned\u2014ensuring individuals gain only limited and  appropriate access, and properly configuring and patching systems. The  Bureau\u2019s progress toward addressing our recommendations is  encouraging; however, completing this effort is necessary to ensure that  sensitive information is adequately protected and that the challenges we  outline in this report are overcome.", "In conclusion, our ongoing audit work determined that the CEDCAP  program has the potential to offer numerous benefits to the Bureau\u2019s  survey programs, including the 2020 Census program. While the Bureau  has taken steps to implement these projects, considerable work remains  between now and when its production systems need to be in place to  support the 2020 Census end-to-end system integration test\u2014in less than  a year and a half. Moreover, although the three selected CEDCAP  projects had key project monitoring and controlling practices in place or  planned, the gaps we identified in our draft report are impacting the  Bureau\u2019s ability to effectively monitor and control these projects.", "Given the numerous and critical dependencies between the CEDCAP and  2020 Census programs, their parallel implementation tracks, and the  2020 Census\u2019 immovable deadline, it is imperative that the  interdependencies between these programs are effectively managed.  However, this has not always been the case, and additional actions would  help align the programs.", "Additionally, while the large-scale technological changes for the 2020  Decennial Census introduce great potential for efficiency and  effectiveness gains, it also introduces many information security  challenges, including educating the public to offset inevitable phishing  scams. Continued focus on these considerable security challenges and  remaining open recommendations will be important as the Bureau begins  to develop and/or acquire systems and implement the 2020 Census  design.", "Our draft report, which is currently with Commerce and the Bureau for  comment, includes several recommendations that, if implemented, will  help address the issues we identified and improve the management of the  interdependencies between the CEDCAP and 2020 Census programs.", "In addition, prior to today\u2019s hearing we discussed the preliminary findings  from our draft report with Bureau officials, including the Decennial Census  Programs\u2019 Associate Director, and incorporated their technical comments,  as appropriate. According to the officials, they have actions under way to  address some of the issues we identified, such as those related to  improving risk management for CEDCAP projects. Regarding our finding  that the CEDCAP and 2020 programs lack an effective process for  integrating schedule dependencies, Bureau officials stated that they  believe that they are in compliance with GAO\u2019s schedule guide. However,  we maintain that the Bureau is not in compliance with the GAO schedule  guide because it has not documented an effective process for managing  the dependencies. Regarding our finding that the two programs do not  have an integrated list of risks facing both programs, Bureau officials  stated that they have an enterprise-wide risk management program, in  which the Deputy Director has visibility into risks affecting both programs.  While we agree that the Deputy Director has visibility into the CEDCAP  and 2020 Census risks, documentation of joint management of key  program risks does not exist. Therefore, we maintain our position that it is  important that the programs establish a comprehensive list of risks facing  both programs and agree on their respective roles and responsibilities for  jointly managing the list.", "Chairman Chaffetz, Ranking Member Cummings, and Members of the  Committee, this completes my prepared statement.
