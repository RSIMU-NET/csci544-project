This is because DOD lacked a specific plan to frame the evaluations, which according to federal standards, should clearly define the evaluation questions and methodology and address the collective knowledge, skills, and experience needed by the entity conducting the evaluations. According to DOD's contract, evaluations were to assess school quality, but the 15 areas DOD provided the contractor for evaluation were often not clearly defined and it was not clear what the contractor was to evaluate. For example, one of the areas was the \u201cdegree of congruence\u201d among various entities involved in delivering educational services, which DOD provided the contractor without further specificity. Further, because DOD's contract did not specify all the skills needed by the contractor, DOD had to modify its contract to require such skills. However, still lacking information it needs, DOD recently decided not to renew the contract.

That increase, however, was driven  primarily by the Air Force, which added 48 advisors to its program.  According to one Air Force official, the increase was largely the result of  provisions in law requiring that service members separating from the  military be provided with transition assistance services (including  education advice). Conversely, the Navy reduced the number of its  advisors by 25. A Navy official said this decrease was due to budget cuts  resulting from sequestration. This official said that the decrease in the  number of advisors also reflects a shift within the Navy to reduce support  for off-duty education and direct it towards training that directly affects  military readiness\u2014such as training in operating and maintaining complex  radar and fire control systems for ballistic missile defense.

Further, according to DOD officials, the  drawdown of forces in 2013 accounted for some of this decrease. As the  forces continue to draw down, the demand for tuition assistance could  drop as service members leave active duty service and are no longer  eligible for the program.

Once a service  member decides to register for the Tuition Assistance Program, the  advisors said they are available to answer questions about the schools,  financing education, and transfer of credits if reassigned to another  location. In addition, they said that they might also explain the  differences in the types of programs schools offer and share information  such as graduation rates and other school statistics available from  Education websites. Further, the advisors we spoke with said they also  discuss a range of financing options available, including other military aid,  federal financial aid (grants and loans), and private student loans. With  respect to private student loans, which sometimes have significantly  higher interest rates than federal student loans, the advisors told us they  advise service members to exhaust all federal options to cover college  costs before pursuing private loans.", "Once a service member has completed a certain number of course hours,  as required by the program, advisors we interviewed told us they work  with that individual to develop, and then approve, an education plan for  completing a specific course of study.

They also told us that requests for  their services vary by service member, with some requiring little  assistance. Advisors added that other support staff at the education  center on the base are available to assist service members when an  advisor is not needed. For example, support staff may answer routine  questions about the program; mail or e-mail the service member  materials; and confirm that the service member has dropped or withdrawn  from a course, or that course grades have been entered into the system.  All of the services have similar staff to perform these functions.", "Further, as required by DOD, all participating schools have their own  counselors available to help service members, for example, by  recommending courses and explaining how to register for classes.

This is because DOD  lacked a specific plan to frame and guide the evaluations, and did not  require the contractor to develop one. According to federal standards,  an evaluation plan should clearly define the evaluation questions and  methodology and address the collective knowledge, skills, and  experience needed by the entity conducting the evaluations. According to  DOD\u2019s contract, evaluations were to assess school quality. However, our  review of the contract found that the 15 areas for evaluation that DOD  provided to the contractor were often broad, not clearly defined, and  lacked specificity (see app. IV for list of 15 areas). For example, one area  was simply stated as \u201cthe methods whereby academic institutions are  invited on the installation.\u201d Another simply stated \u201cthe degree of  congruence among various missions (the military, installation, and the  institutions), the education plan of the installation, the educational  programs provided by the institutions which have a MOU with the  installation and the distance learning providers.\u201d Based on our review of  these 15 areas, it was not always clear what DOD was asking the  contractor to evaluate and how the 15 areas would be measured. For  example, in asking the contractor to assess the \u201cdegree of congruence,\u201d it  was not clear what DOD meant and how the contractor would measure  this area. According to the contractor, DOD did not clearly define quality  and the 15 areas to be assessed were the only formal guidance provided  to them. Further, evaluation questions are critical because they frame the  scope of the assessment and drive the evaluation design, the selection of  data to collect, and the study results. For this reason, evaluation  questions must be clear and specific and use terms that can be readily  defined and measured.", "Had DOD developed a specific plan to frame and guide the evaluations,  such a plan could have better positioned DOD to fully assess the skills  needed by the contractor before awarding the evaluation contract.", "Specifically, DOD did not initially include requirements in its contract to  ensure that the contractor provided personnel with the requisite education  and experience needed to conduct the evaluations. Thus, DOD had to  modify its contract to obtain the needed skills (see app. V for contract  modifications). For example, in a 2013 modification, DOD required that  the contractor acquire staff with a working knowledge of measurement  methods and tools; sufficient experience in postsecondary education; and  expertise in education theories, principles, and practices; among other  skills. Although the contractor hired additional staff in time for the fiscal  year 2014 evaluations, we identified problems in some fiscal year 2013  evaluation reports that were also present in the more recent 2014  evaluation reports we reviewed, where data from student surveys were  misinterpreted and erroneously reported. Specifically, the contractor  made broad generalizations about student satisfaction with their school  based on survey responses from a non-representative sample of students  whose responses may not have been the prevailing view of the other  students who did not respond. In providing technical comments on a  draft of this report, the contractor said that they made no attempt to draw  general conclusions about the student body as a whole based on the  limited survey responses. We found, however, that several of the reports  did contain broad generalizations. For example, a recent evaluation report  stated that there was a \u201chigh overall degree of student satisfaction\u201d with  the institution based on responses from a non-representative sample of  students.", "Lastly, in some instances, we found that the contractor made  recommendations that only tangentially related to quality. For example, a  fiscal year 2012 report of the schools on one military base recommended  replacing the artwork in the classrooms with pictures of students in the  hallways to foster a positive climate. In addition, a fiscal year 2013  evaluation of one school included a recommendation that for clarity and  consistency, the school change the names of the academic terms to read  \u201cmid-Fall,\u201d \u201cmid-Winter,\u201d \u201cmid-Spring,\u201d and \u201cmid-Summer.\u201d In a fiscal year  2014 report, the contractor recommended that the school change the  term \u201cMilitary Assistance\u201d to \u201cTuition Assistance\u201d in the listing of funding  sources within the school\u2019s online application process. In providing  technical comments on a draft of this report, the contractor stated that  their contract with DOD required them to evaluate all aspects of the  course offerings provided by educational institutions under review. As a  result, the contractor said in total it made over 300 recommendations,  which were both tangential and more central to quality. For example, the  contractor cited several recommendations which they viewed as more  central to quality including recommendations that the close working  relationship between one education office and a school be maintained;  additional professional development opportunities be offered to adjunct  faculty members; and an advisor position that had recently been cut be  reinstated and filled with an experienced advisor. By not fully considering  the skills and expertise needed by the contractor before awarding the  contract, DOD risked receiving information provided from the contractor  that would not meet its needs. According to the American Evaluation  Association, agencies should ensure that contractors conducting  evaluations possess the education, skills, and experience necessary to  undertake the evaluations.", "After concluding that the evaluations are not providing the information  needed, DOD decided not to renew its school evaluation contract. The  agency is suspending the evaluations and plans to refocus its evaluations  in accordance with a recently issued Executive Order. Under that  Executive Order, DOD, along with Education and VA, are to ensure that  schools provide meaningful information to service members about the  cost and quality of programs to help them make informed choices about  how to use their tuition benefits; prevent abusive and deceptive recruiting  practices that target service members; and ensure that schools provide  high-quality academic and student support services to service members,  among other things. Further, the Order requires that DOD, Education, and  VA work collaboratively to develop a comprehensive strategy for  developing student outcome measures (e.g., graduation and retention  rates) and strengthen their oversight of schools to protect service  members participating in educational programs, such as the Tuition  Assistance Program.", "According to DOD officials, they are meeting with Education and VA to  discuss how they might coordinate efforts and leverage information from  these agencies. DOD officials have been discussing a process for  determining the number of school evaluations DOD will conduct each  year and how they will select the schools for evaluation. DOD officials are  also exploring whether these evaluations will be conducted under contract  or through an interagency agreement. Although DOD has several efforts  in place, it does not have a plan guiding these efforts. Fundamentally, the  agency has not yet developed a plan that includes specific questions to  frame the evaluations and the qualification requirements for those  conducting the evaluations.
