Because it was designed for military purposes, however, GPS does not satisfy civil air navigation requirements dictating, for example, that the system\u2019s signals be available in sufficient number virtually all of the time and be accurate enough to support aircraft landings in the worst weather conditions. When augmented by wide and local area systems that FAA intends to implement, GPS is expected to satisfy the above requirements.", "After FAA established its schedule in February 1992 for using GPS to support civil air navigation, governmental and aviation industry groups recommended that the agency accelerate some of the schedule\u2019s milestones to permit full use of the system by civil aviation as soon as possible. In January 1994\u2014following the recommendations of an industry task force on satellite navigation and The National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry\u2014the Secretary of Transportation charged the FAA Administrator with, among other things, accelerating the use of GPS by civil aviation.", "In response, FAA modified its schedule for using GPS by accelerating several milestones, in general, from 2000 to 1997.

GPS has space and ground components, as depicted in figure 1. The space component consists of a worldwide constellation of 24 satellites in six orbits at approximately 11,000 miles above the earth. These satellites are positioned so that a user will have at least four satellites in view at any given location. The satellites transmit radio signals that permit adequately equipped users to calculate the time as well as their speed and tridimensional position (latitude, longitude, and altitude) anywhere on or above the earth\u2019s surface and in any weather condition. The ground component includes a master control station, five monitoring stations, and three ground antennae located throughout the world. The master control station tracks and directs the GPS satellites through the monitoring stations and ground antennae, respectively.", "As mentioned earlier, because GPS was designed for military purposes, the system, by itself, cannot satisfy key safety-related civil air navigation requirements, such as those dictating that a sufficient number of the system\u2019s satellite signals be available virtually all of the time. Currently, GPS is used domestically as a supplemental means of navigation because on-board-the-aircraft augmentation systems\u2014which use altimeters, gyroscopes, and other equipment to augment GPS\u2014do not address all civil air navigation requirements, particularly those related to the system\u2019s availability.", "In accordance with the direction provided by the Department of Transportation (DOT), FAA is supporting the development of a wide area system and local area systems that will permit GPS to fulfill all civil air navigation requirements and become a primary means of navigation. This month, FAA plans to award a contract for developing the wide area system. The agency has not announced a date for awarding a contract to develop local area systems. (See app. I for a description of civil air navigation requirements and the wide and local area systems that FAA intends to implement.)", "FAA and the aviation industry expect that the augmented GPS will result in a navigation capability that will provide major benefits to the agency, civil aviation, and others because of its superiority over currently used navigation aids. For example, because FAA expects that the augmented GPS will be able to support runway approaches and landings in all weather conditions, the agency recently canceled its multibillion-dollar project to acquire microwave landing systems\u2014a key element of the program to modernize the air traffic control system. Also, FAA foresees that the augmented GPS will permit the agency, after a transition period, to start decommissioning its ground network of navigation and landing aids. Moreover, airlines expect that the augmented GPS and its applications will result in major operational and economic benefits by reducing flying times and fuel consumption. In addition, DOT and FAA anticipate that the augmented GPS will benefit not only aviation users but also other federal agencies and land and sea users having a need for navigation information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA May Not Achieve Future GPS Milestones", "paragraphs": ["Although FAA has met all milestones for GPS to date, the agency will face more complex and difficult tasks in achieving future milestones.

In addition, FAA will likely meet the other 1995 milestone when the agency completes assessing the feasibility of using local area systems to support all types of precision approaches. Agency officials responsible for GPS activities see little chance for delays in meeting this milestone.", "Although FAA has been confident for some time that local area systems will be able to support all types of precision approaches, the agency is sponsoring research by various institutions to confirm the feasibility of these systems. For example, in June 1994, FAA awarded contracts to Wilcox Electric Inc. and E-Systems to develop and test two different local area systems for supporting precision approaches.

The schedule for implementing the initial system is tight, and potential problems could affect the system\u2019s development. This commitment is challenging because the system\u2019s schedule may not provide enough time for FAA to complete all necessary steps. Over a 28-month period, from May 1995 to September 1997, the FAA contractor must develop and implement the system, and the agency must accept and commission it. However, FAA estimates that the system\u2019s software development alone may take from 24 to 28 months, thereby leaving little time for the agency to accept and commission the system.", "Also, potential difficulties may be encountered during the system\u2019s development.

FAA has noted its concerns about potential software problems since it decided to adopt the accelerated schedule for developing and implementing the system.", "Satellite-related problems. The space component of the wide area system requires that three commercial communication satellites be in place by late 1997\u2014an undertaking that is beyond FAA\u2019s control. However, enough satellites may not be in orbit on time because the International Maritime Satellite Organization (INMARSAT)\u2014the only commercial entity that has publicly announced its intention to launch satellites capable of supporting this space component\u2014could delay launches or could launch an insufficient number of satellites to fully support this component. INMARSAT recently delayed launching the first of these satellites from late 1995 to early 1996 because the rocket to launch the satellite would not be available on schedule.", "FAA recently estimated that its 1997 milestones may slip up to 18 months if potential problems are realized.

In November 1994, FAA consolidated the Service with units responsible for current ground-based navigation aids, such as instrument landing systems. This new organization, headed by the former Director of the GPS/CNS Service, is called the Integrated Product Team for GPS and Navigation and is under the jurisdiction of the Associate Administrator for Research and Acquisitions.
