In fiscal year 2000, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) collected $1.3 trillion in this manner. Most employers withhold and deposit these taxes as required; however, the amount of unpaid employment taxes, penalty, and interest has grown significantly. IRS data show that in 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000, delinquent employers owed about $3.2, $3.5, $4.4, and $5 billion, respectively, in unpaid employment taxes, penalties, and interest. The time IRS takes to notify employers of delinquent payment of employment taxes varies. On average, IRS takes about five weeks to initially notify employers regarding employment tax delinquencies after the Form 941 return is received. When employers fail to file Form 941 returns, IRS normally takes from 14 to 28 weeks to notify them of this delinquency. Aside from its usual efforts to educate and inform taxpayers of their responsibilities, IRS has four programs to prevent or reduce employers' tax delinquencies. Two of these programs were designed to achieve early contact with employers, and two were designed to identify employers with existing, multiple employment tax delinquencies and help them to return to compliance. To evaluate the effectiveness of these programs and to support informed judgments about whether to adopt new ones, IRS planned to compare compliance rates of test and control groups and to use customer surveys and focus groups. IRS' efforts to evaluate these programs are being adversely affected by, among other things, delays in obtaining reliable data. IRS officials did not identify any specific programs to improve employment tax intervention under IRS' ongoing effort to modernize its organizational structure, management processes, and information technology systems. However, certain aspects of its modernization effort have some future potential to improve intervention."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Employers are required to withhold amounts from their employees\u2019 salary to cover individual federal income tax, Social Security, and Medicare taxes; match the amounts for Social Security and Medicare taxes; and deposit these amounts with the U.S. Treasury.

Although the majority of employers withholds and deposits these taxes as required, for those who fail to do so, the amount of unpaid employment taxes, penalty and interest has grown significantly. As of September 30, 2001, IRS data show that in 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000, delinquent employers owed about $3.2, $3.5, $4.4, and $5.0 billion, respectively, in unpaid employment taxes, penalties, and interest.", "Although its data systems do not track what percentage of these unpaid employment taxes are attributable to small businesses, IRS considers employment tax compliance to be among the most challenging issues for small businesses. Small businesses may be challenged because their owners may not have sufficient capital or may lack experience or training in business tax obligations, making it difficult for these businesses to remain economically viable. According to Small Business Administration data, about 50 percent of new businesses fail to remain open for at least 4 years following their creation. When confronted with a choice between paying necessary operating expenses or depositing employment taxes, struggling businesses may opt to pay business expenses instead of taxes.", "Employers who do not deposit employment taxes may gain an unfair advantage over those employers who comply voluntarily. Furthermore, noncompliant employers can accumulate substantial unpaid taxes with associated interest and penalties. Over time, these unpaid balances may compound beyond the employers\u2019 ability to pay\u2014ultimately placing their  businesses in greater financial jeopardy.", "Because of your interest in IRS\u2019 timely intervention to help employers-\u00ad particularly those with a small business--avoid the pyramiding of taxes,  interest, and penalties, you asked us to review various aspects of IRS\u2019  efforts to notify and intervene with employers concerning delinquent  employment taxes. Accordingly, this report discusses (1) how long IRS  takes to notify employers of employment tax delinquencies; (2) what types  of intervention programs and initiatives IRS uses for employers with  delinquent employment taxes and how IRS evaluates the effectiveness of  these efforts; and (3) what new intervention programs or initiatives IRS is  developing as part of its modernization efforts.", "As described further in this report, the employment tax deposit  requirements vary by the amount of employment taxes an employer owes.  Employers with the smallest employment tax liabilities pay on a quarterly  basis; those with the largest liabilities pay the next banking day; and those  with intermediate-sized liabilities pay on a monthly or more frequent basis.  Generally, small businesses would tend to be heavily concentrated in the  employment tax deposit categories calling for less frequent payments.  Although employment taxes for many employers must be paid throughout  a calendar quarter, IRS\u2019 ability to determine whether employers have paid  as frequently as required and in the amounts required is dependent on  employers filing the Employer\u2019s Quarterly Federal Tax Return (Form 941  return)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["All employers must file their Form 941 returns quarterly, although some  are to make employment tax deposit on differing schedules during a  quarter.

Until IRS receives and processes the Form 941 returns, it  cannot match tax deposits reported on the returns with its records of  deposits received. Once it matches this information, IRS notifies  employers of any delinquencies using a written notice. This is the  employers\u2019 first statutory notice of the delinquency. If the employer fails to  respond to this first notice, IRS sends follow-up notices and may later  contact the employer by phone or, eventually, make a personal visit.  Although this entire process can take years for those employers who do  not respond, under IRS\u2019 processing procedures, initial notices are sent  within several weeks after IRS receives the Form 941 return.", "IRS provides a variety of outreach efforts to help employers understand  how to meet their tax obligations, many of which are designed to explain  requirements and to meet other needs of small business taxpayers. For  example, IRS makes tax forms with instructions and publications that  explain requirements available to taxpayers in a variety of formats  including hard copy, CD-ROM, and electronic form on the Internet. In  addition to conducting various workshops and seminars, many of which  are tailored to the needs of small businesses, IRS also recently established  a Web site specifically designed to address the needs of small business  taxpayers. Beginning in September 2001, IRS\u2019 Web site allows employers  nationwide to use the Internet to deposit employment taxes via the  Electronic Federal Tax Payment System On-Line.", "Current IRS strategies and program plans call for providing more services  to taxpayers, including employers, to prevent noncompliance. To that end,  IRS has shifted its focus from addressing compliance issues after returns  are filed to addressing them as early as possible, often through efforts to  better educate taxpayers about their tax responsibilities and to improve  forms, guidance, and other information available to taxpayers. This is  consistent with IRS\u2019 strategic objectives to reduce taxpayer burden,  uncertainty, and errors by clarifying tax law responsibilities and resolving  issues early in the process. IRS believes that its efforts to reduce taxpayer  burden will show significant progress over the next 2 years and will be  further enhanced by its plans for long-term business systems  modernization."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine how long IRS takes to contact employers after an  employment tax delinquency occurs, we analyzed the time between (1) the  receipt of a quarterly Form 941 return and IRS\u2019 mailing of an initial  delinquency notice, (2) when a Form 941 was due and IRS\u2019 mailing of a  delinquency notice when the employer fails to file a Form 941, and (3)  when the employers should have deposited employment taxes during a  quarter and IRS\u2019 mailing of an initial delinquency notice. For all three  situations, we interviewed cognizant officials from IRS\u2019 Small Business  and Self-Employed Division (SB/SE), IRS\u2019 National Office, and various  field offices, and we obtained related documentation.", "To determine the time between when a Form 941 return was due but not  filed and IRS\u2019 mailing of initial delinquency notices and the time between  when an employer fails to make a deposit during a quarter and IRS\u2019  mailing of a notice, we relied on the flowchart of IRS\u2019 processes and  associated timeframes that we developed. We confirmed our summaries of  IRS\u2019 processes and related timeframes necessary to notify employers of  delinquencies with appropriate IRS officials at the National Office, Atlanta  Service Center and the Martinsburg Computer Center. IRS did not have  data in its BMF One Percent Sample File that we could use to estimate  these timeframes.", "To determine the length of time between when IRS receives the Form 941  return and the issuance of the initial notice to the employer, we analyzed data extracted from IRS\u2019 Business Master File (BMF). The  data we used in this time analysis was extracted from an IRS data file  entitled the BMF One Percent Sample File. IRS uses this data file to  perform its own analysis of BMF information and to verify system  performance and output. IRS considers the results of analysis from the  BMF One Percent Sample data to be valid and uses the data file to  perform comparable analyses, however it does not use the data file to  make estimates projectable to the entire BMF. In addition, because we  did not have access to taxpayer data, we were not able to  independently verify taxpayer information contained in the data file.  IRS officials did not have programming resources available to extract a  random sample of employment tax-related delinquencies from the  BMF, thus IRS\u2019 BMF One Percent Sample File provided the best  alternative for obtaining the data for the time analysis. In providing  delinquent employment tax information for the time analysis, IRS  extracted Form 941 return records and associated transaction date  information from the BMF One Percent Sample File. After removing  the employee identification numbers (EIN) from the file, IRS provided  us with a file containing transaction date information for the delinquent  Form 941 returns selected. The data used in the time analysis reflects  taxpayer account information from the BMF as of September 2001. For  tax years 1999 and 2000, over 66,000 account records were used in the  analysis. About 25,000 records were eliminated from the time analysis  because they were not posted to the BMF as normal Form 941 quarterly  returns. We also developed flowcharts to describe IRS\u2019 processes and  associated timeframes for initially contacting delinquent employers to  further validate the BMF sample timeframe analysis; and verified the  accuracy of the flowchart with IRS officials. we reviewed and analyzed statistical information related to  employment taxes\u2014including the number of Form 941 returns filed  based on amounts paid to determine the frequency of deposits. We also  reviewed and analyzed IRS employment tax-related collection policies  and procedures, obtained relevant publications and instructions, and  reviewed relevant IRS web pages and related reports.", "To identify IRS\u2019 current employment tax intervention programs and  program evaluation efforts, we interviewed appropriate IRS officials within SB/SE and other  operational groups who identified the following four intervention  programs: Mentoring and Monitoring, Federal Tax Deposit (FTD) Soft  Letter, ABC\u2019s of FTDs, and FTD Alert Program; and obtained and discussed pertinent program documentation including  plans, progress reports, and schedules with IRS officials.", "To determine IRS\u2019 plans under modernization as they related to  employment tax intervention and evaluation efforts, we interviewed and discussed with cognizant IRS officials IRS\u2019 business  system modernization efforts; and obtained and reviewed relevant documentation including IRS\u2019 Strategic  Plan (Fiscal Year 2000-2005), and 2000 Progress Report-IRS Business  Systems Modernization Program .", "You expressed interest in the level of resources IRS uses to contact  taxpayers with employment tax delinquencies. We researched this by  interviewing IRS officials and reviewing past reports by IRS and us. On the  basis of this work, we advised you that IRS\u2019 financial and data systems do  not collect or produce such specific information. Currently, IRS cannot  isolate the resources it uses to notify employers having employment tax  delinquencies for specific form types such as the Form 941 return. As a  result, you suggested that we not pursue the resource issue at this time.", "You also expressed interest in whether there are intervention programs  and initiatives in use at other federal agencies or relevant nonfederal  organizations that could serve as best practice models for IRS. We are not  reporting on this topic because during our review of eight federal agencies  and five state tax authorities we did not find any intervention programs or  initiatives that could serve as best practice models. The primary reason for  this is that many of the organizations under review had significantly  different procedures than IRS for formally identifying a delinquency. For  example, these organizations often have shorter collection cycles than IRS  which enables them to notify delinquent parties in less time than IRS. IRS\u2019  collection cannot begin until after it receives the quarterly Form 941  returns.", "This review primarily focuses on IRS\u2019 intervention efforts as they relate to  the initial notification of employment tax delinquencies.

The periodic deposits made throughout the quarter are  subsequently reported on the Form 941 returns. Filing these returns is  crucial because IRS determines compliance by matching its accounting  records of deposits made throughout the quarter with the deposit  information reported on the return. Consequently, failure to file Form 941  returns necessitates additional IRS processing and can further delay  employer notification of delinquencies thus increasing employers\u2019 interest  and penalty charges. Based on IRS data and our discussions with IRS  officials, we found the following:  Our analysis of IRS\u2019 data containing delinquent employment tax accounts  shows that IRS took an average of about 5 weeks from the date the Form  941 returns were filed to notify employers of a missed, late, or underpaid  deposit.", "Based on our analysis of the steps IRS follows to detect and notify  employers of a failure to file a 941 return, which we confirmed with IRS  officials, we found that IRS normally takes from 14 to 28 weeks.

Employers generally have until the end  of the month after the quarter closes to file their returns. During calendar  years 1999 and 2000, IRS received and processed about 5.7 million Form  941 returns per quarter. Using the 4th quarter of calendar year 2000 as an  example, IRS service centers began receiving and processing Form 941  returns in mid-January 2001, although most were received in the surge of  returns arriving at IRS service centers following the due date of January  31.

IRS officials concurred with that timeframe for  IRS to notify employers of these delinquencies. IRS officials added that the  time variance is due to differences of tax quarter workloads with the  heaviest workload falling in the first two quarters of the calendar year.

Before  their quarterly Form 941 return was due, IRS sent these employers a letter  advising them of the potential discrepancy.

As part of its strategic plan, IRS will emphasize  providing assistance to taxpayers before tax returns are filed and  providing earlier intervention with taxpayers when problems arise.", "One of IRS\u2019 four new operating divisions is dedicated to serving the needs  of small business and self- employed taxpayers, while another serves large  and mid-sized businesses. According to IRS\u2019 plans, taxpayers in each of  these divisions should benefit from IRS\u2019 handling of all their respective tax  issues within a single organization. IRS management and staff are  expected to provide more tailored products and services to help their  respective taxpayer segments comply with applicable tax laws. Although  the new divisions officially began operations on October 1, 2000, they are  still developing processes and operating procedures. The SB/SE Division,  in particular, is not yet fully staffed.", "In addition, IRS is shifting its workload to allow certain locations to  specialize in processing business returns. For example, instead of all 10  IRS service centers processing Form 941 returns, IRS plans to have only  two service centers doing this work. IRS does not expect this change to be  completed until at least 2002. Furthermore, according to an IRS  modernization official, the specialized services centers are not expected to  initially impact the current IRS processing time for Form 941 returns,  although the processing time could be reduced as IRS gains experience in  these two service centers.", "Under the new structure, IRS also plans to place an increased emphasis on  prefiling activities, such as taxpayer education, outreach, and earlier  intervention with taxpayers. This new emphasis on preventing problems  instead of fixing them after the fact is one of modernization\u2019s key changes  intended to help employers avoid, or at least minimize, tax delinquencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Information System Improvements for Business Taxpayers Will Not Be Available Until at Least 2005", "paragraphs": ["Central to IRS\u2019 achieving its modernization vision is replacing the multiple,  antiquated information systems it currently uses to maintain taxpayer  accounts and to provide customer service with a single, integrated system  known as the Customer Account Data Engine (CADE). IRS expects CADE  to greatly improve its customer service capabilities by providing  immediate updates of taxpayer accounts and expediting its processing of  returns and payments. For example, CADE is to replace the current once- a-week processing schedule that adds to the time IRS takes to notify  employers of employment tax delinquencies, with daily processing that  could reduce the time for this notification. These changes, however, are  not expected to be available for business processes for many years. IRS  plans to incrementally phase CADE in, beginning with the simplest  individual tax accounts. Accordingly, IRS will begin by processing the  form 1040EZ using the CADE system and progress eventually to using the  system for more complex forms, such as business returns. As a result, IRS\u2019  plans do not call for CADE to begin processing Form 941 returns until at  least 2005."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Early notification can help businesses that have failed to pay in a timely  manner their full employment tax liability or to timely file a Form 941  quarterly return by minimizing the penalty and interest charges associated  with delinquent deposits and tax returns. Until IRS improves its computer  systems, there does not appear to be much that can be done to further  decrease the time that IRS\u2019 processes require for routinely notifying all  businesses of their employment tax delinquencies.", "In the interim, IRS has developed three new programs designed to prevent  or reduce employment tax delinquencies by speeding up or enhancing the  notification to certain groups of businesses. However, IRS has not  successfully followed through on its plans to evaluate these programs. It  has also experienced delays in evaluating its efforts to improve its long- standing FTD Alert program. We believe IRS needs to properly evaluate  whether the benefits to be derived from expansion of the pilot programs  and retention of the FTD Alert program justify the program costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the IRS Commissioner require the SB/SE  Commissioner to develop and execute a plan for evaluating the  effectiveness of the employment tax early intervention programs.

The Commissioner  also said that the intervention programs we identified have already  provided valuable insight into the needs of small business taxpayers.  He  agreed with our recommendation and said that the Commissioner, SB/SE,  will review each of the programs in our report and determine the extent of  evaluation required.  Further, when the review is completed, each SB/SE  office responsible for a program will evaluate the specific intervention  effort and make recommendations for implementation.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from the  date of this letter.
