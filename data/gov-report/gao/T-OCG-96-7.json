With a staff of 64,000, SSA administers the nation\u2019s largest federal program\u2014Social Security\u2014as well as the largest cash welfare program, Supplemental Security Income (SSI). SSA\u2019s expenditures totaled $363 billion in fiscal year 1995, nearly one-fourth of this nation\u2019s $1.5 trillion federal budget.", "SSA\u2019s programs touch the lives of nearly every individual in this country. Social Security provides benefits to retired and disabled workers and their dependents and survivors; SSI provides assistance to the needy aged, blind, and disabled. In 1995, 50 million beneficiaries\u2014nearly one out of every five individuals in this country\u2014received benefits from SSA each month. In addition to administering benefits, SSA records the wages of nearly every U.S. worker and issued almost 17 million Social Security cards in 1995. Moreover, SSA maintains a large and visible presence in communities nationwide. In 1995 alone, an estimated 24 million people visited SSA\u2019s 1,300 field offices, and SSA received 62 million calls on the agency\u2019s nationwide toll-free 800 number.", "SSA recognizes that the American public depends on SSA to quickly and accurately provide benefits, properly record workers\u2019 earnings, and effectively safeguard benefit programs from fraud and abuse. Any failure to do so seriously undermines the public\u2019s confidence in government and its ability to efficiently and cost-effectively administer programs and protect taxpayer dollars. Yet as SSA acknowledges, public confidence in its programs is low and has been low for some time. Although much of this lack of confidence stems from concerns about the future solvency of the Social Security system, public confidence is also eroded by reports of fraud and abuse. Media accounts of prisoners erroneously receiving disability checks and allegations that immigrants and children are feigning mental illness to obtain SSI undermine the public\u2019s trust in SSA and in the federal government.", "March 31, 1995. In establishing SSA\u2019s independence, the Congress recognized the importance of strong and stable leadership for the agency. As we noted in our February 1995 report on SSA\u2019s transition to independence, independence heightens the importance of SSA\u2019s playing a strong leadership role in addressing long-standing problems and preparing for future challenges.", "In that report, we highlighted the challenges that SSA would face as an independent agency: the shortfall in funds to pay future Social Security benefits, growing and changing disability caseloads, and public concerns about SSI program growth. Today, I will describe these policy and program challenges and assess SSA\u2019s progress in addressing them and in preparing to manage its future challenges. I will also assess what additional actions are needed to help SSA meet these challenges. These observations are drawn from completed and ongoing GAO work on Social Security issues. We also spoke with SSA officials, selected officials of the Social Security Advisory Council and Advisory Board, and other experts to determine SSA\u2019s progress so far, what problems remain, and what else is needed to make SSA a premier agency.", "In summary, SSA is ahead of many federal agencies in managing for results and improving financial accountability. This gives the agency a sound base from which to manage its current and future challenges, which are significant. SSA, however, has not performed the research, analysis, and evaluation needed to inform the public debate on the future financing of Social Security\u2014the most critical long-term issue facing SSA. The aging of the baby boom generation, coupled with increasing life expectancy and the declining ratio of contributing workers to beneficiaries, will place unprecedented strains on the Social Security program in the next century. Unless the Congress acts, the Social Security trust funds are expected to be exhausted by 2029. More than a year after gaining independence, SSA is just now strengthening its research, policy analysis, and evaluation capabilities to more actively participate in the financing debate. has not sufficiently promoted return-to-work efforts in the administration and design of its disability programs. If even an additional 1 percent of the 6.6 million working-age people receiving disability benefits were to leave SSA\u2019s disability rolls by returning to work, lifetime cash benefits would be reduced by an estimated $3 billion. In addition, SSA has not done enough to combat fraud and abuse in the SSI program and address program weaknesses.", "SSA faces increasing responsibilities in the future and must manage its growing workloads with reduced resources. SSA estimates that it would need over 76,000 workers to handle its growing workloads if it conducts business as usual. Instead, SSA expects to do this work with about 62,000 workers\u2014fewer than it has today. To successfully meet its workload challenges, SSA knows that it must increasingly rely on technology and build a workforce with the flexibility and skills to operate in a changing environment. SSA faces significant challenges, however, in modernizing its information systems\u2014a complex, multiyear effort that could easily cost billions of dollars. Compounding this challenge will be the possible loss of many senior managers and executives\u2014over the next 5 years, nearly half of SSA\u2019s senior executives will be eligible to retire. Moreover, SSA faces difficult decisions on how best to deliver services in the future.", "At this critical juncture, effective leadership is needed so the agency can take the following actions to better ensure its success in the 21st century: inform the national debate on Social Security financing issues, complete its redesign of the disability claims process and promote return to work in its disability programs, enhance efforts to ensure program integrity, and make the technology enhancements and workforce decisions needed to meet increasing workloads with fewer resources."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SSA Steps Ahead With Results-Oriented Management and Improved Financial Accountability", "paragraphs": ["At this time of heightened attention to the costs and effectiveness of all federal programs, the Congress and the Administration have acted to promote a more efficient federal government that stresses managing for results and accountability. These efforts include the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act), the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), and the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (GMRA). In addition, the Administration has undertaken, under the Vice President\u2019s direction, the National Performance Review (NPR) aimed at making government work better and cost less. We strongly support these efforts as important and necessary steps to improving federal management.", "SSA has surpassed many other federal agencies in these areas. For example, as a pilot agency under GPRA, SSA has worked to strengthen its strategic management process and to identify and develop performance measures that help its managers, the Congress, and the public assess its performance. In addition, for several years now, it has measured satisfaction levels among some of its customers and used focus groups to understand its customers\u2019 and employees\u2019 views, reflecting the customer service focus promoted by NPR. SSA is also a leader among federal agencies in producing complete, accurate, and timely financial statements as required by the CFO Act and GMRA. For example, for fiscal year 1995, SSA issued audited financial statements 3 months before its legal mandate. Moreover, SSA was among the first federal agencies to produce an accountability report, which is designed to consolidate current reporting requirements under various laws and provide a comprehensive picture of an agency\u2019s program performance and its financial condition.", "To be most effective, SSA\u2019s ongoing efforts in strategic management, performance measurement, and accountability reporting will need to be continually improved and integrated into the agency\u2019s daily operations and management.

A 65-year-old male who began receiving Social Security benefits in 1940\u2014the first year SSA began paying monthly benefits\u2014was expected to live, on average, about an additional 12 years. By 2015, a 65-year-old male will have a life expectancy of 16 years\u2014a 35-percent increase. During that same time period, the life expectancy for women aged 65 will increase by almost 50 percent\u2014from an average of over 13 years to an average of nearly 20 years. Meanwhile, the ratio of contributing workers to beneficiaries will decline. By 2015, an estimated 2.6 workers will be paying taxes into the Social Security system per beneficiary; in 1950, 16.5 workers were paying Social Security taxes per beneficiary.", "This retirement explosion threatens the long-term solvency of the Social Security system. Beginning in 2012\u201416 years from now\u2014the program is projected to start running a deficit.

Two of these approaches, however, call for allowing individuals to invest some portion of their payroll taxes in individual retirement accounts. This would be a significant departure from the original program design, in which all trust fund monies are invested and managed centrally. Given the magnitude of the financial problems facing the Social Security system and the nature of the proposals for changing the system, we can expect the debate over the financing and structure of the Social Security system to continue and intensify in the coming years."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SSA Is Now Taking Steps to Be More Active", "paragraphs": ["In our report on SSA\u2019s transition to independence, we noted that the agency\u2019s independence would heighten the need for it to work with the Congress in developing options for ensuring that revenues are adequate to make future Social Security benefit payments. More than a year after gaining independence, however, SSA is not yet ready to fully support policymakers in the current public debate on financing issues.", "SSA has been involved in financing issues through its Office of the Actuary, which has provided data and analyses to the Advisory Council and policymakers developing financing options. The Office of the Actuary plays a unique role within the agency because it serves both the Congress and the Administration. SSA will also be providing assistance to the Social Security Advisory Board, which was established by the independence legislation to advise the Commissioner and make recommendations to the Congress and the President on SSA program policy. responsible for coordinating all policy planning activities was only partially staffed. Although SSA did not have a specific time frame for when the reorganized policy office would be fully staffed and operational, it did expect to be better prepared to join the public debate over the next year.", "SSA is in a unique position to inform policymakers and the public about the critical nature of long-term financing issues. Focus groups conducted by SSA have demonstrated that the public\u2019s knowledge of Social Security programs is generally low and the public\u2019s confidence in the Social Security system is undermined by its future financing problems. To address these issues, SSA is conducting a public education campaign that discusses what the current system offers in disability, retirement, and survivors benefits. It also emphasizes that the Social Security system can pay benefits for many more years and that the Congress has time to act before the trust funds are depleted. SSA, however, is not discussing options for maintaining or changing the current system. Feedback SSA has received from its focus groups indicates that addressing the public\u2019s lack of knowledge without also discussing possible options for ensuring the system\u2019s future solvency does not instill confidence and weakens the agency\u2019s credibility with the public.", "We are concerned that SSA has not seized the opportunity as an independent agency to speak out on the importance of addressing the long-term financing issues sooner rather than later.

DI, enacted in 1956 and funded through payroll taxes, provides monthly cash benefits to severely disabled workers and their families; SSI was enacted in 1972 and provides assistance to needy individuals with insufficient work histories to qualify for DI. Unlike DI, SSI is funded through general revenues. DI and SSI caseloads and expenditures increased dramatically between 1986 and 1995, and the pace of this growth accelerated in the early 1990s. In 1986, 4.4 million blind and disabled persons under age 65 received DI or SSI benefits; by 1995, this number had soared to 7.5 million\u2014a 69-percent increase. As the number of DI and SSI beneficiaries increased, so did the amount paid in cash benefits. The combined DI and SSI cash benefits increased from $25 billion to $57 billion in 10 years. Adjusted for inflation, the increase in the value of these cash benefits was 66 percent.", "As these programs have grown, the characteristics of new beneficiaries have changed in ways that pose additional challenges for SSA. Beneficiaries are, on average, younger and more likely to have longer lasting impairments. Increases in beneficiaries with mental illness or mental retardation, especially, have driven this trend. Between 1982 and 1992, for example, mental impairment awards to younger workers increased by about 500 percent. This growing proportion of younger beneficiaries with longer lasting impairments means that the beneficiary population, on average, is likely to spend more time on the disability rolls. In 1992, for example, new DI awardees were, on average, 48 years old. Depending on the type of impairment that qualified them for benefits, these beneficiaries could spend nearly one-third of their adult lives on disability before reaching age 65."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation of Redesigned Claims Process Faces Problems", "paragraphs": ["As more and more people have filed for disability benefits, SSA has been slow to process initial claims, and appeals and backlogs have grown. To manage the disability caseload growth, increase efficiency, and improve service to its customers, SSA has started a massive effort to fundamentally change how disability decisions are made. Making disability decisions is one of the agency\u2019s most important tasks; it accounted for more than half of SSA\u2019s total administrative budget\u2014about $3 billion\u2014in fiscal year 1995.", "Even so, claimants face long waits for disability decisions. As of June 1996, the wait for initial decisions averaged 78 days for DI claims and 94 days for SSI claims, with an additional 373-day wait for appealed decisions. Overall, the current disability claims process is not meeting the needs of claimants, the agency, or taxpayers.", "To deal with these problems, in 1993 SSA formed a team to fundamentally rethink and develop a proposal to redesign the disability claims process. This labor-intensive and paper-reliant process has changed little since the DI program began in the 1950s. Efforts like SSA\u2019s\u2014business process reengineering\u2014have been used successfully by leading private-sector organizations to dramatically improve their operations. In April 1994, we informed the Congress that the agency\u2019s redesign proposal was its first valid attempt to address the fundamental changes needed to cope with disability workloads. At that time, however, we also acknowledged that implementing this needed change would be difficult and that we would be monitoring SSA\u2019s progress.", "During this past year, we have been reviewing various aspects of SSA\u2019s redesign effort for this Subcommittee and have identified several implementation problems. SSA\u2019s redesign plan includes 83 initiatives to be started during a 6-year period (1995-2000), with 40 of these to be completed or under way in the first 2 years. On the basis of our ongoing work, we have found that the scope and complexity of many initiatives have limited SSA\u2019s progress toward its redesign goals. Although SSA has begun many of its planned initiatives, none is far enough along for SSA to know whether specific proposed process changes will achieve the desired results. Moreover, we are concerned that SSA has undertaken too many complex tasks and has not given sufficient priority to those redesign initiatives most likely to reduce processing times and administrative costs. disagreements among representatives of federal and state employees about how to proceed with testing this new position. SSA must also develop training plans, conduct tests at pilot sites, post vacancy announcements for positions, and select and train DCMs.", "Developing software designed to allow SSA to move from its current manual, labor-intensive process to an automated process is critical to the success of SSA\u2019s disability redesign. The scheduled implementation of this new software, however, has been delayed by more than 2 years. Moreover, although SSA has separate implementation schedules for its various redesign initiatives and for its systems development activities, these two schedules are not linked. In addition, although SSA has developed individual plans for its redesign initiatives and for its system development activities, it has not developed a comprehensive detailed plan that integrates these two efforts. Such a plan should reflect priorities, resource allocations needed, key milestones, and decision points and identify relationships among ongoing and planned process and systems changes. For example, SSA cannot effectively develop software to support its key DCM position until it has completed a pilot for this position and determined in more detail what its duties will be and what information will be needed by the new claims manager. Although SSA officials recognize the need to develop such a plan, in June 1996 they noted that the testing of process redesign features involved too many uncertainties for SSA to develop an integrated plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weak Return-to-Work Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Although SSA has focused on improving its processes for moving eligible claimants onto the disability rolls, it has placed little priority on helping them move off the rolls by obtaining employment.

At one time, the common business practice was to encourage someone with a disability to leave the workforce. Today, however, a growing number of private companies have been focusing on enabling people with disabilities to return to work. to use rehabilitation services. A greater emphasis on beneficiaries\u2019 returning to work is needed to identify and encourage the productive capacities of those who might benefit from rehabilitation and employment assistance. Although the main reason for emphasizing returning to work is so that people maximize their productive potential, it is also true that an estimated $3 billion could be saved in subsequent years if only an additional 1 percent of the 6.6 million working-age people receiving disability benefits in 1995 were to leave the rolls by returning to work.", "SSA needs to develop a comprehensive return-to-work strategy that includes providing return-to-work assistance to applicants and beneficiaries and changing the structure of cash and medical benefits. As part of an effort to place greater priority on beneficiaries\u2019 returning to work, we recommended that SSA identify legislative changes required to implement such a strategy. Although evaluating any SSA response to our recommendations would be premature, we will be assessing SSA\u2019s efforts to help beneficiaries return to work.", "SSA has also missed opportunities to promote work among disabled beneficiaries where it has the legislative authority to do so. In 1972, the Congress created the plan for achieving self-support (PASS) program as part of SSI to help low-income individuals with disabilities return to work. However, SSA has not translated the Congress\u2019 broad goals for the PASS work incentive into a coherent program design.

These benefits can total almost $5,500 per year for each disabled child. Our review of SSI for children with disabilities found that part of the process for determining eligibility is overly subjective and susceptible to manipulation. The Congress may want to consider legislation to improve eligibility determinations for children with disabilities. Current legislative proposals incorporate changes addressing this problem.", "In addition, in our review of the fraudulent use of translators to help individuals become eligible for SSI, we reported that SSA could reduce this type of fraud if it had a more comprehensive, programwide strategy for keeping ineligible applicants from ever receiving benefits. Moreover, we have several reviews under way of other program weaknesses. For example, in our ongoing work for the Subcommittees on Human Resources and Oversight of the House Committee on Ways and Means, we have found that even though prisoners are ineligible for SSI if they have been in jail for 1 calendar month or longer, prisoners in many large county and local jail systems have received millions of dollars in cash benefits. This means that taxpayers have been paying twice to support these individuals\u2014both for SSI benefits and the cost of imprisonment. SSA has taken steps to review information on current prisoners to stop inappropriate payments; however, it is not taking action to develop information that would allow it to recover benefits paid to those who may have been incarcerated and received benefits in prior years, although this information is available.", "SSA acknowledges that it needs to do more to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse.

We continue to support the need for a fixed term. The legislation also calls for a fixed 6-year term for a Deputy Commissioner, also to be appointed by the President with the Senate\u2019s advice and consent.", "The Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner head the leadership team needed to address the agency\u2019s existing problems and manage its future challenges. SSA\u2019s efforts to maintain an effective cadre of leaders are complicated by the impending retirement of many of its executives and managers and by the absence of a Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner with the stability of fixed terms. This leadership must be in place for SSA to progress on the four fronts we have highlighted.", "First, SSA must step up to its role as the nation\u2019s expert on Social Security issues; it is uniquely positioned to inform the public policy debate on the future financing and structure of Social Security.", "Second, SSA must redesign the disability claims process and place greater emphasis on return to work in its disability programs. To increase the redesign project\u2019s likelihood of success, SSA needs to ensure that those initiatives most likely to save significant costs and time are implemented. Because of the scope and duration of SSA\u2019s redesign, it should report on an annual basis the extent to which it is meeting its processing time reduction goals. It must also sustain its efforts to build and maintain stakeholder support. In addition, SSA must develop a comprehensive detailed plan that integrates its redesign initiatives and systems development activities. The Commissioner also needs to act immediately to place greater emphasis on return to work by changing both the design and the administration of the disability programs.", "Third, SSA must better protect taxpayer dollars. As the administrator of the nation\u2019s largest cash welfare program, SSA must ensure program integrity in SSI. Reports of fraud and abuse trigger public perceptions that SSA is not making cost-effective and efficient use of taxpayer dollars.", "Finally, SSA must manage technology investments and its workforce, and\u2014when needed\u2014make difficult decisions about handling increasing workloads with reduced resources. It must also continue to focus on and closely manage its year-2000 conversion to help ensure that SSA will move into the 21st century with systems that function correctly. Moreover, as SSA prepares to meet greater demands and changes in its employee and client base, it may have to make difficult workforce decisions to better respond to customer needs. For example, SSA may need to close offices and move its workers to different locations to better meet growing demand. In an environment of shrinking budgets and increased expectations for government agency performance, ensuring that agency decisions are based on comprehensive planning and sound analyses will be even more essential.", "SSA\u2019s success in meeting these challenges is critical. The agency is all important, accounting for one-fourth of federal spending and touching the lives of almost all Americans. How it meets its challenges as it moves into the next century can make a significant difference in the well-being of America\u2019s vulnerable populations\u2014the aged, disabled, and poor\u2014and in how the public feels about its government.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my formal remarks.
