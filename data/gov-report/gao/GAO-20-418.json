These organizations sell groceries and retail goods to servicemembers, their families, and retirees. The task force recommended consolidating the four resale organizations into a single organization, estimating \u201cnet savings\u201d (i.e., savings minus costs) of about $690 million to $1.3 billion during the first 5 years. However, the task force may have overestimated savings and underestimated costs.", "Savings from reducing the cost of goods sold. The task force estimated that DOD would save several hundred million dollars annually by reducing the cost of purchasing goods that are resold in stores. Specifically, the task force multiplied the fiscal year 2017 total cost of goods sold for all four resale organizations by industry benchmarks, reasoning that mergers lead to more savings when merging organizations sell a high amount of identical products. However, task force data show that DeCA and the exchange organizations have limited identical products; the overlap between DeCA products and those of at least one exchange organization amounts to less than one-third of the total cost of goods sold. Thus, multiplying the benchmarks by the total cost of goods sold for all four organizations may not have been appropriate.", "Information technology (IT) costs. The task force estimated the costs of developing new, common IT systems to operate a consolidated resale organization to be between $326 million and $401 million, about 50 percent of estimated consolidation costs. The task force stated that it based IT cost estimates on data resale organizations provided for major upgrades or system replacements. But GAO found that about 40 percent of the IT cost estimate was based on minor upgrades or partial replacements, not major upgrades or system replacements. Thus, the estimate may be understated.", "Headquarters relocation costs. According to the task force, there will be costs if DOD decides to relocate the four defense resale organizations to a new headquarters location. However, the task force did not include cost estimates for relocation in its business case analysis.", "According to federal law, the operation of the commissary and exchange systems may not be consolidated unless authorized by Congress. Until the task force reassesses and updates, as necessary, its savings and costs estimates, DOD and Congress will not have reliable information to consider resale consolidation.", "The military departments officially concurred with the business case analysis, but provided written comments detailing fundamental concerns with the analysis, such as the use of proprietary industry benchmarks and the estimated savings and costs. In April 2019, DOD reported to Congress that the military departments agreed with consolidation, but did not disclose the accompanying comments.

To pay for operating costs that exceed the commissaries\u2019  sales revenue, Congress directed that approximately $1.3 billion annually  from fiscal years 2015 through 2019 be made available from amounts  appropriated to the Defense Working Capital Fund for commissary use.  Exchanges provide goods and services similar to department or retail  stores and also operate other stores, such as gas stations and convenience stores. In fiscal year 2018, the exchanges generated about  $12 billion in sales revenue. Unlike commissaries, exchanges rely on  non-appropriated funding, including sales and other revenue, to cover  operating expenses. Revenue generated by the exchanges also helps  fund certain morale, welfare, and recreation activities.", "Commissaries and exchanges are operated by four separate  organizations, referred to in this report as the defense resale  organizations. The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) has operated all  DOD commissaries since 1991; prior to that, the military services  operated their own commissaries. The Army and Air Force Exchange  Service (AAFES), the Navy Exchange Service Command (NEXCOM),  and Marine Corps Community Services (MCCS) operate their own  service-specific exchanges. Each of these four defense resale  organizations has its own headquarters, chief executive officer or  equivalent, and board of directors. According to federal law, the defense  commissary system (DeCA) and the exchange stores system (AAFES,  NEXCOM, and MCCS) currently must be operated as separate systems  of DOD, and the operation and administration of these defense retail  systems may not be consolidated or otherwise merged unless specifically  authorized by Congress.", "Prior studies have recommended consolidating the existing defense  resale organizations, citing the potential to eliminate redundancies and  achieve cost savings. For example, in 1990, a DOD study group  recommended that the three exchange organizations be consolidated into  a single exchange organization, similar to DeCA. In 2015, the Military  Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission went further  and recommended that all four resale organizations be consolidated into  a single organization.", "No consolidation has taken place since DeCA was created in 1991, and  DOD stated in a 2016 report that it did not recommend creating a single  resale organization at that time due to the differences in how DeCA and  the exchange organizations fulfill their specific missions and deliver their  respective benefits (we assessed this report in November 2016; see app.  I for information on our prior work related to commissaries and  exchanges).

We used our  Assessment Methodology for Economic Analysis to assess the business  case analysis against five key methodological elements that are  necessary for an economic analysis: objective and scope, methodology,  analysis of effects, transparency, and documentation. Each key element  consists of economic concepts that represent best practices. These key  methodological elements are not intended to be exhaustive or to  supersede or alter relevant federal and agency requirements for  economic analysis.

In  November 2018, the military departments were given an opportunity to  review the business case analysis, provide comments, and indicate  whether they concurred with the analysis.", "In its business case analysis, the task force recommended consolidating  the four defense resale organizations into a single organization. The  task force stated that consolidation would eliminate duplication that  currently exists across the resale organizations and increase the  competitiveness, or financial viability, of defense resale, which has seen  sales declines in recent years. Specifically, the task force recommended  that a single chief executive officer or director be responsible for leading  the organization and report to a single board of directors. The task force  also recommended that separate leadership positions for commissary  operations and exchange operations be established, and that a chief  administrative officer manage the business functions that are common to  the current resale organizations, such as information technology (IT),  human resources, marketing, and finances. Figure 1 shows the task  force\u2019s recommended organizational chart for the consolidated resale  organizations.", "The task force estimated that the time frame for consolidating the four  defense resale organizations would be 5 years for implementation, and  that consolidation would result in \u201cnet savings\u201d (i.e., estimated savings  minus estimated costs) ranging from about $690 million to $1.3 billion  during the first 5 years, followed by annual net savings of approximately  $390 million to $670 million every year thereafter. Specifically:", "Estimated savings: The task force estimated that consolidating the  four defense resale organizations would result in savings in three  areas: (1) reduction of the cost of goods sold in the commissaries and  the exchanges; (2) reduction of the cost of goods and services that  are not sold but are necessary for operating stores (e.g., plastic  shopping bags and custodial services); and (3) reduction of payroll  costs by eliminating redundant personnel. According to the task  force, consolidation would result in estimated savings of $1.4 billion to  $2.1 billion over the first 5 years, followed by annual savings of $470  million to $750 million.", "Estimated costs: The task force estimated that consolidating the  defense resale organizations would result in costs from four areas: (1)  development of new, common IT systems; (2) severance pay for  separating employees and retention bonuses to incentivize  employees to remain; (3) operation of a transformation management  office, supported by private contractors, to implement the  consolidation; and (4) costs to convert DeCA to a non-appropriated  fund organization.

According to the task force\u2019s business case analysis, retailers often pay  different costs for identical products, and mergers are an opportunity for  retailers to compare costs across a larger combined organization and  make decisions that maximize savings. In the case of a consolidated  defense resale organization, the task force stated in its business case  analysis that savings could be achieved by implementing what the task  force called category management reforms and by obtaining the lowest  cost for identical products sold by both commissaries and exchanges.  Task force officials added that one board of directors and one chief  executive officer overseeing the consolidated resale organization would  be more likely to achieve savings than the current, individual boards of  directors and chief executive officers of the resale organizations.", "GAO-18-151SP.", "DeCA and one or more exchange organization, or", "Two or more of the exchange organizations (and not DeCA).", "In addition to overlap in identical products sold, task force officials told us  that savings from category management reforms are dependent, in part,  on the amount of overlap in vendors that sell products to the resale  organizations. Specifically, task force officials stated that there are  opportunities to reduce cost of goods sold through negotiations with  vendors that sell items to both DeCA and the exchange organizations.  For example, task force officials stated that the consolidated organization  could negotiate better prices with a vendor that sells family-size items to  DeCA and single-size items to the exchange organizations, even though  those items are not identical.", "Industry Benchmarks  The industry benchmarks used by the task  force are based on proprietary data gathered  and owned by Boston Consulting Group  based on its experience working with mergers  and category management reforms in the  private sector retail industry. These  benchmarks were presented as a percentage  of cost of goods sold; specifically, the task  force estimated that savings from obtaining  the lowest cost for identical items were from 1  to 1.5 percent of the cost of goods sold, and  savings from category management efforts  were from 2.5 to 4 percent of the cost of  goods sold. We did not review and evaluate  the underlying data that were used to develop  the proprietary benchmarks.", "Based on this information, the task force calculated the estimated savings  that would result from reducing the cost of goods sold by multiplying the  total cost of goods sold for all four resale organizations in fiscal year 2017  ($9.5 billion) by industry benchmarks developed by Boston Consulting  Group (see sidebar for more information on these benchmarks). This  calculation showed an estimated annual savings of $329 million to $517  million from reducing the cost of goods sold.", "However, additional information from the task force suggests this savings  estimate may be overstated because there is limited overlap in the  products DeCA sells (i.e., groceries and household goods) and the  products the exchange organizations sell (i.e., goods and services similar  to retail stores). According to the task force, about $2.2 billion of DeCA\u2019s  cost of goods sold in fiscal year 2017 were for products also sold by at  least one of the exchange organizations, which is equivalent to about 23  percent of the total cost of goods sold for the four resale  organizations. This differs from the data provided in the business case  analysis, which stated that 62 percent of the total cost of goods sold was  for identical products sold by two or more resale organizations; however,  that figure also includes products sold by two or more exchange  organizations and not DeCA (we further discuss product overlap among  the exchange organizations below). Given the more limited product  overlap between DeCA and the exchange organizations, it is unclear  whether using the total cost of goods sold for all four resale organizations  as the basis for estimating savings was appropriate.", "Additionally, the business case analysis did not fully identify the amount  of vendor overlap that exists between DeCA and the three exchange  organizations, but the data that were provided in the business case  analysis suggest that limited vendor overlap exists. Specifically, the  business case analysis provided data for 10 vendors that sell to the  defense resale organizations, but those vendors represent less than 20  percent of the cost of goods sold to DeCA and the exchange  organizations in fiscal year 2017. Further, only 5 of the 10 vendors  identified in the business case analysis sold goods to both DeCA and the  exchange organizations, and their cost of goods sold accounted for about  10 percent ($972 million) of the total cost of goods sold for the four resale  organizations ($9.5 billion). Based on these data, the extent of vendor  overlap between DeCA and the exchange organizations\u2014and, as a  result, how much can be saved through category management reforms by  consolidating DeCA and the exchange organizations\u2014is unclear.", "Although the task force stressed the importance of a conservative  estimate in both its business case analysis and in meetings with us, our  assessment of the assumptions and methodology for estimating savings  from the cost of goods sold found that a more conservative approach  could have been used to better ensure estimated savings were not  overstated. For example, one method could have been to multiply the  benchmarks by the cost of goods sold for just the three exchange  organizations (about $5.5 billion in fiscal year 2017, per the task force), as  data provided by the task force indicate that about 67 percent of the cost  of goods sold for the exchange organizations in fiscal year 2017 were for  identical products sold by at least two exchange organizations. Another  method, which task force officials suggested after we shared our  concerns about their methodology, could have been to multiply the benchmarks by the cost of goods sold for the exchange organizations,  plus the portion of DeCA\u2019s cost of goods sold that overlaps with at least  one exchange organization (about $2.2 billion in fiscal year 2017, per the  task force). Either method would be more conservative than the one  adopted in the business case analysis and would yield a savings estimate  that is about 20 to 40 percent lower, but would be more consistent with  the task force\u2019s assertion that consolidation savings are dependent on the  amount of overlap among the merging organizations.", "DOD policy states that an economic analysis should base its analysis of  benefits on facts and data whenever possible. Additionally, our  Assessment Methodology for Economic Analysis states that an economic  analysis should examine the effects of an action by considering relevant  alternatives and justifying what the world would be like under each  alternative; describe and justify the analytical choices, assumptions, and  data used; and assess how plausible adjustments to each important  analytical choice and assumption affect the estimates of savings.", "Ensuring that the estimates for cost of goods savings are accurate is  particularly important, as they account for approximately 70 percent of the  task force\u2019s overall savings estimate from consolidation. However, the  task force did not fully identify and analyze in its business case analysis  how many identical products are sold by both DeCA and the exchange  organizations or how many vendors sell products to both DeCA and the  exchange organizations. According to task force officials, they did not  provide data on product overlap between DeCA and the exchange  organizations because it would not change their savings methodology or  estimate, and they did not provide more information on vendor overlap  because of the proprietary nature of that data. However, the amount of  product and vendor overlap that exists across the four resale  organizations will have a direct effect on the amount of savings to be  achieved from consolidation, as acknowledged by the task force.", "Without the task force reassessing the approach it used to estimate  savings from the cost of goods sold and, if necessary, making  adjustments to those estimates, decision makers in DOD and Congress  may lack confidence in the reliability of the task force\u2019s savings estimates  in the business case analysis and will not have complete information as  they consider defense resale consolidation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Task Force May Have Underestimated the Expected Costs of Consolidating the Four Defense Resale Organizations", "paragraphs": ["Based on our analysis of the business case analysis, we found that  DOD\u2019s task force may have underestimated the expected costs of  consolidating the four defense resale organizations in two areas: (1) the  development of new, common IT systems and (2) the location of a new  headquarters for the consolidated organization."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Task Force May Have Underestimated the Cost of Consolidating Defense Resale Organizations\u2019 IT Systems", "paragraphs": ["The task force estimated in its business case analysis that most of the  costs (i.e., about 50 percent annually) of consolidating the four defense  resale organizations will result from developing new, common IT systems  to support the consolidated organization.

For example, the task  force\u2019s estimate for the merchandising system was approximately $115  million, which the business case analysis stated is based on a $35 million  estimate provided by AAFES, a $23.5 million estimate provided by  NEXCOM, a $15 million estimate provided by MCCS, and a $41 million  estimate provided by DeCA.", "However, the task force\u2019s cost estimate for IT consolidation may be  understated because it is based, in part, on less expensive minor IT  system upgrades and partial replacements, according to the resale  organizations. Based on our analysis of information provided to us by the  resale organizations, about $140 million (about 40 percent) of the overall  IT cost estimate was based on what the resale organizations described  as minor upgrades or partial replacements.", "Specifically, while MCCS confirmed the cost estimates attributed to them  in the business case analysis were for total IT system replacement costs,  the other three resale organizations\u2014AAFES, NEXCOM, and DeCA\u2014 disagreed with the task force\u2019s characterization that all the data used to  calculate IT system estimates represented costs for replacements or  major upgrades. AAFES told us that the cost estimates cited in the  business case analysis for its merchandising, financial management and  general ledger, and transportation and logistics systems reflected minor  upgrades of specific modules within the overall systems, and the cost to  replace or upgrade the entire system would be significantly higher.  NEXCOM stated that the cost estimates for upgrading its merchandising,  store inventory management, and financial management and general  ledger systems were for minor upgrades, not replacements or major  upgrades, as stated by the task force. DeCA told us that the estimate for  replacing its store inventory management system only represented 1 year  of costs, even though DeCA plans to incur replacement costs through at  least 2022.", "According to the task force, the task force and the resale organizations  agreed on the methodology for estimating IT costs, and the subject matter  experts from the resale organizations provided the cost data used in the  business case analysis. However, based on information provided by the  resale organizations, it appears that the task force may not have always  based its cost estimate on replacement or major upgrade costs\u2014 consistent with the key assumption that new IT systems would be  developed for the consolidated resale organization\u2014but, rather, used  minor upgrade or partial replacement costs in some cases. Specifically,  task force officials told us they believed the estimates provided by the  resale organizations were too high to be minor upgrades or partial  replacements, based on their understanding of IT requirements for resale  operations.", "Further, task force officials stated that their overall IT cost estimate was  likely overstated, not understated. For example, they stated that their  estimate is higher than what is typically spent for a private sector  consolidation of similar size. However, the task force stated that it did  not use private sector IT cost estimates in its business case analysis  because it determined that public sector IT costs would likely be higher  than private sector IT costs. Additionally, task force officials told us that  some planned spending on existing IT systems by the four resale  organizations would not be necessary as a result of consolidation.  However, the business case analysis does not quantify how much future  spending could be reduced or factor those reductions into the IT cost  estimate.", "According to the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, cost  estimates are developed based on assumptions that are defined to  establish the baseline conditions the estimate will be built from.  Additionally, our Assessment Methodology for Economic Analysis states  that an economic analysis should define an appropriate baseline that  represents the best assessment of what the world would be like under  that alternative. Thus, estimating costs that reflect the baseline  conditions is a key step in developing a sound cost estimate.", "Additionally, we have previously reported that federal IT investments  frequently fail or incur cost overruns and schedule slippages. As such, high-quality data are imperative for ensuring proper management and  oversight of IT investments.

One option cited by the task force would be to create a new  headquarters in the Washington, DC, area, which would be the most  expensive option, as it would likely involve acquiring new real estate and  hiring personnel in a high-cost region. Another option cited by the task  force would be to locate all exchange operations and staff at the existing  AAFES headquarters in Dallas, TX, and maintain commissary operations  and staff at the existing DeCA headquarters at Fort Lee, VA. This option  would likely be less expensive, as personnel and available real estate are  already present at both locations.

In addition, MCCS expressed concern that  consolidation could result in unexpected costs from separating  exchange operations from the rest of MCCS operations, which also  include the Marine Corps\u2019 morale, welfare, and recreation and family  programs. In January 2019, the Navy changed its position to concur  subject to several significant comments and clarifications, and  attached a letter detailing comments and concerns similar to those it  submitted with its original non-concurrence in December 2018.", "Officials from the resale organizations further articulated their concerns  about the business case analysis when they met with us. For example,  resale officials told us they are concerned that savings are overstated,  that costs are understated, and that the proprietary benchmarks used by  the task force are unverifiable or may not be applicable to the public  sector. Exchange officials also stated that they are worried about the  effect of consolidation on morale, welfare, and recreation funding  generated by the exchanges. Specifically, exchange officials are  concerned that exchange revenue currently used for morale, welfare, and  recreation programs could be used to pay for consolidation expenses or  to reduce the amount of appropriated funds allocated to the  commissaries.", "Despite the concerns detailed in the comments from the military  departments and resale organizations, DOD did not include them in its  April 2019 report to Congress summarizing the results of the business  case analysis. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2019 required DOD to include in its report the recommendations of the  Secretaries of the military departments regarding the plan to consolidate  the defense resale organizations. When we asked the task force why  DOD did not provide Congress with the comments and concerns cited by  the military departments and the resale organizations, officials stated that  they were advised by DOD\u2019s Office of General Counsel not to include the  comments because they contained information that may have disclosed  DOD\u2019s deliberative process.", "Task force officials also stated that the savings, cost, and timeline  estimates in the business case analysis were conservative, and that the  proprietary industry benchmarks are based on years of experience by  Boston Consulting Group and similar to those cited by prior studies.  Regarding the purchasing alliance formed by the resale organizations to  reduce their cost of goods sold, task force officials stated they do not  believe such efforts to reduce costs will be sustained without a single  chief executive officer and board of directors to ensure those efforts  continued, as recommended in the business case analysis. Finally, the  task force stated in the business case analysis that any savings achieved  from consolidation could be used to increase morale, welfare, and  recreation funding or reduce appropriations used to fund DeCA, and that decisions on how to allocate savings will be made by the proposed board  of directors.", "According to task force officials, some of the concerns articulated by the  military departments and the exchanges could be motivated by a general  opposition to consolidation. However, without a more complete reporting  of the military departments\u2019 perspectives on consolidation and the task  force\u2019s response to those comments, Congress may be unaware of the  views various organizations within DOD have regarding the business  case analysis, which is relevant information as Congress considers  defense resale consolidation. Moreover, fully reporting the comments and  concerns could strengthen trust and collaboration among the task force,  military departments, and resale organizations on any future resale  reforms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Four defense resale organizations currently operate about 240  commissaries (operated by DeCA) and 2,500 exchange facilities  (operated by AAFES, NEXCOM, and MCCS) worldwide to provide  reduced-priced groceries and retail goods and services to DOD  servicemembers, their families, and retirees. DeCA operations are funded  in part by appropriations, which have totaled approximately $1.3 billion in  recent years. By law the commissary and exchange organizations must  be operated separately. In November 2018, a DOD task force completed  a business case analysis and concluded that consolidating the four  defense resale organizations into a single organization would result in  several hundred million dollars in annual cost savings. However, we  found that the task force\u2019s projected savings from reducing the cost of  goods sold may be overestimated, and that projected costs for IT  development and headquarters relocation may be underestimated.  Further, while the military departments concurred with the task force\u2019s  recommendation to consolidate, DOD did not fully share their comments  and concerns about the business case analysis with Congress. DOD\u2019s  proposed consolidation will cost several hundred million dollars, take  years to implement, and involve multiple DOD organizations.

DOD also  requested that we consider the first three recommendations as  implemented, based on information provided in the letter and as detailed  below.", "Regarding the first recommendation for the task force to reassess  its approach to estimating savings from cost of goods sold\u2014to  include reassessing its use of cost of goods sold by all four  defense resale organizations rather than, for example, just the  three exchange organizations\u2014and make any necessary  adjustments to its savings estimates for consolidation and provide  that updated information to Congress, DOD stated that it had  reassessed its approach and found that there is significant overlap  and, therefore, savings opportunity in products sold by DeCA and  the exchanges. DOD also provided revised savings estimates that  exclude DeCA\u2019s cost of goods sold from its methodology that  show net savings ranging from $309 million to $739 million in the  first 5 years of consolidation, followed by $255 million to $457  million per year thereafter. These figures are about 44 percent to  55 percent lower than the business case analysis\u2019s estimate for  the first 5 years and about 32 to 35 percent lower per year  thereafter. By providing these revised savings estimates, we  believe that DOD has addressed the intent of the  recommendation.", "With regard to the second recommendation for the task force to  reassess its methodology for estimating IT costs of consolidation,  and make any necessary adjustments to its range of IT cost  estimates and provide that updated information to Congress, DOD  stated that the task force followed up with AAFES, NEXCOM, and  DeCA to get an update on the cost estimates these entities  expressed concern about to us. However, according to DOD,  those resale organizations were unable to provide alternate data  to use in place of the numbers in the business case analysis. DOD  further stated in its letter that because no alternative data were  provided, the department will continue to use the estimate in the  business case analysis and will reengage with the resale  organizations to develop more detailed IT design plans and make  any necessary updates to the IT cost estimates as integration  planning moves forward. As DOD develops its more detailed IT  design plans and associated cost estimates, we will follow up with  the department, including the resale organizations, to determine  whether this recommendation has been addressed.", "In commenting on the third recommendation for the task force to  develop a range of cost estimates for relocating the defense  resale organizations, and adjust its range of cost estimates for  consolidation and provide that updated information to Congress,  DOD provided three possible courses of action, along with  corresponding cost estimates. These possible courses of action,  from least expensive to most expensive, are: (1) maintain  operations at all four existing locations (no cost); (2) maintain  commissary operations at DeCA headquarters, perform all  exchange functions at AAFES headquarters, and close the  NEXCOM and MCCS headquarters (one-time costs of $5.5 million  and recurring annual costs of $1.3 million); and (3) create a new  headquarters to perform all commissary and exchange operations  near Washington, D.C. (one-time costs of $19.6 million and  recurring annual costs of $19.7 million). DOD stated that  consolidation would still result in financial benefits, even if the  department chooses the most costly of these courses of action. By  providing these cost estimates, we believe that DOD has  addressed the intent of the recommendation.", "While we have determined that DOD has met the intent of the first and  third recommendations, we also note that, in its comment letter, the  department questioned some aspects of our analysis and conclusions  regarding the first three recommendations. We stand by our analysis and  conclusions and offer the following response:", "DOD stated in its comment letter that modifying the business case  analysis\u2019s approach to cost of goods savings would result in an  incorrect use of benchmarks and go against industry best practice.  For example, DOD stated that estimating savings by using the  cost of goods sold for just the three exchange organizations, or for  the three exchange organizations plus a portion of DeCA, would  be flawed. However, as noted in our report, the latter method was  recommended to us by task force officials when we raised  concerns about the accuracy of the task force\u2019s savings estimates  in the business case analysis. In addition, multiplying the  benchmarks by the cost of goods sold for the exchange  organizations, as opposed to for all four resale organizations,  would be more consistent with the assertion in the business case  analysis that consolidation savings are dependent on the overlap  among the merging organizations.", "DOD questioned the accuracy of some of our figures in the report  by providing different data on product and vendor overlap between  DeCA and the exchange organizations. However, this information  was not included in the task force\u2019s business case analysis or  offered to us during the course of our audit. In addition, when we  asked for supporting documentation that would allow us to  validate the new figures, DOD did not provide any.", "DOD stated in its comments that excluding all or including only a  portion of DeCA\u2019s cost of goods sold implies that there is no  opportunity to achieve savings between DeCA and the  exchanges. Our report does not make this assertion, but rather  offers a methodology that would result in a more conservative  savings estimate, consistent with the data presented in the  business case analysis and provided by task force officials, to  better ensure that estimated savings were not overstated.", "As noted above, DOD did not concur with the fourth recommendation for  the department\u2019s Chief Management Officer to provide additional written  information to Congress on the comments and concerns from the military  departments and resale organizations on the task force\u2019s November 2018  business case analysis, as well as on the task force\u2019s response to those  comments and concerns. DOD stated in its written response to our report  that the department considered all the comments submitted in its  decision-making process and that all of the military department  secretariats agreed with above-store consolidation, despite their  comments on the business case analysis. DOD further stated that the  military department comments regarding the business case analysis were  shared with congressional committee professional staff, and DOD  suggested in its letter that this recommendation be closed.", "However, DOD\u2019s written response did not provide information on which  comments were shared, whether those comments were communicated in  writing or orally, or which committee or committees received information  on the comments. In their written comments on the business case  analysis, the military departments detailed concerns with fundamental  aspects of the analysis, to include: the use of proprietary industry  benchmarks; estimated savings, costs, and timeline of consolidation; and  the proposed governance structure for the new resale organization. We  continue to believe that implementing this recommendation would help  ensure that Congress has the full information it needs as it considers  defense resale consolidation and would also help strengthen trust and  collaboration among the various DOD stakeholders involved in defense  resale, particularly given their role in any consolidation, should one occur.

In November 2016, we found  that DOD\u2019s May 2016 report did not provide a plan for achieving budget  neutrality. DOD reported that it would not be able to eliminate fully the  use of appropriated funds for defense resale, but the department did not  provide detailed information supporting that conclusion. Instead, the  report stated that DOD expected to achieve $2 billion in cost savings over  a 5-year period from fiscal year 2017 through fiscal year 2021. However,  we found that the report did not include any assumptions, methodology,  or specific time frames related to initiatives that would lead to these  savings.

We found that  DeCA lacked reasonable assurance that it was maintaining its desired  savings rate for commissary customers because of weaknesses in its  methodology for calculating the savings rate. For example, the  methodology did not use a random sample of overseas commissaries or  account for seasonal and geographic variations in item prices. We also  found that DeCA\u2019s business model departed from practices generally  employed by commercial grocery stores. For example, DeCA did not  assess the contribution of the sale of each product to a given store\u2019s total  sales in determining which products to sell, and it had not conducted cost- benefit analyses for its use of stocking and custodial service contracts or  product distribution options across all commissaries. We recommended  that DOD (1) address limitations identified in its savings rate  methodology; (2) develop a plan with objectives, goals, and time frames  to improve efficiency in product management; and (3) conduct  comprehensive cost-benefit analyses for service contracts and  distribution options.
