GAO recommended that DOD assess the extent to which each Military Service is developing services plans for each family with special needs and is providing sufficient resources to staff an appropriate number of family support providers, as required. DOD concurred.", "Services plans are important because they describe the necessary services and support for a family with special needs enrolled in the EFMP as well as during the relocation process, such as when a servicemember is assigned to a new location. In April 2019, DOD reported that the Military Services had adopted a standardized form to use when developing services plans; however, DOD has not yet assessed the extent to which each Military Service is developing these plans. In January 2020, a senior DOD official said that the Department began collecting data related to services plans in the last quarter of 2019.", "In April 2019 (the most recent update), DOD officials said they were planning to pilot a staffing tool to help the Military Services determine the number of family support providers needed at each installation. However, the pilot is expected to last 2 years before it can be implemented across the Military Services.", "GAO also found that DOD lacked common performance measures for the EFMP and was unable to compare the program's performance across the Military Services. GAO recommended that DOD develop common performance metrics for the program. DOD concurred, and in April 2019 said that it was still in the process of developing performance metrics for assignment coordination and family support. In January 2020, DOD noted that it had not yet developed guidance regarding use of forms that would help improve its ability to collect common performance measures across the Military Services.", "Further, GAO found that DOD does not have a process to systemically evaluate the results of each Military Service's monitoring activities. GAO also reported that DOD did not systematically review the results of monitoring activities because it relies on each Military Service to self-monitor. DOD officials said efforts to standardize certification of EFMPs have been unsuccessful because the Military Services cannot agree on a set of standards that can be used across installations. GAO recommended that DOD implement a systematic process for evaluating the results of the Military Services' monitoring activities. DOD concurred with the recommendation, but has not yet fully implemented it."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In the May 2018 report, GAO made three recommendations to DOD.

These programs include family support services, such as  referrals to military or community resources for families with special  needs; and a process for considering the medical or educational needs of  these families before they are relocated to a different installation (known  as assignment coordination).", "My statement today is based on our May 2018 report on DOD\u2019s EFMP.  Specifically, this statement focuses on (1) the extent to which each  Military Service has provided family support in the continental United  States (CONUS) and (2) the extent to which the Military Services monitor  and DOD evaluates assignment coordination and family support. In the  2018 report, we made three recommendations to DOD regarding ways to  improve its oversight of the EFMP; this statement includes updated  information on DOD\u2019s progress addressing our recommendations.", "In our May 2018 report, we obtained and reviewed documents to assess  how the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps, and Navy provided family support  services. We also obtained Military Service-level data about family  support for fiscal year 2016. In addition, we visited seven installations in  five states to learn more about how Military Service-specific guidance for  the EFMP is implemented. At each of the seven installations, we  interviewed a self-selected group of military family members and  caregivers enrolled in the EFMP who have used family support services.  We also reviewed each Military Service\u2019s procedures for monitoring  assignment coordination and family support, and we reviewed DOD\u2019s  efforts to monitor these procedures across the Military Services. More  detailed information about our scope and methodology can be found in  appendix I of the issued report. DOD provided information in April 2019  and January 2020 regarding the status of each recommendation, which  we have summarized as appropriate.", "We conducted the work on which this testimony is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Among other things, this policy must (1)  address assignment coordination and family support services for families  with special needs; (2) incorporate requirements for resources and  staffing to ensure appropriate numbers of case managers are available to  develop and maintain services plans that support these families; and (3)  include requirements regarding the development and continuous updating  of a services plan for each military family with special needs.", "OSN is also responsible for monitoring the Military Services\u2019 EFMPs and  collaborating with the Military Services to standardize EFMP components  as appropriate. For example, as part of its guidance for monitoring the  Military Services\u2019 EFMPs, DOD requires each Military Service to certify or  accredit its family support services provided through the EFMP. In  addition, DOD states that each Military Service must balance the need for  overarching consistency across EFMPs with the need for each Military  Service to provide family support that is consistent with their specific  mission. Table 1 provides an overview of the procedures each Military  Service must establish for the assignment coordination and family support  components of the EFMP that we identified in our May 2018 report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Aspects of Assistance for Families with Special Needs Vary Widely Across DOD Which Leads to Potential Gaps in Support", "paragraphs": ["In May 2018, DOD reported that each Military Service provides family  support services in accordance with DOD guidance, as well as Military  Service-specific guidance. However, we found that, the type, amount, and  frequency of assistance families with special needs receive varied by  Military Service, which could lead to gaps in assistance (see table 2).", "For example, in our May 2018 report, we found that the Marine Corps is  the only Military Service that specifies a minimum frequency (quarterly)  with which families with special needs should be contacted by their family  support providers. The other Military Services either do not have  requirements for regular contact with these families (Air Force and Army)  or require contact only for selected families (Navy). In addition, we  reported that unlike the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Army, and Navy  choose not to employ special education attorneys. For example, Marine  Corps attorneys may represent families with special needs who fail to  receive special education services from local school districts, as specified  in their children\u2019s individualized education programs (IEP). Officials from  the Air Force, Army, and Navy told us that they find other ways to help  families with special needs resolve special education issues. For  example, Army officials said EFMP managers could refer families with  special needs to other organizations that provide legal support."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Services Plans", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in May 2018, services plans are an important part of  providing family support during the relocation process because they  describe the necessary services and support for a family with special  needs and provide a record for the gaining installation. However, we  found that every Military Service had created relatively few services plans  compared to the number of servicemembers or the number of family  members enrolled in the EFMP (see table 3).", "The Military Services and OSN provided a number of reasons as to why  they do not develop and maintain a services plan for each family with  special needs. For example, Air Force officials said they first consider  whether a services plan will help each family receive the required  services. In addition, Army and Marine Corps officials said they may not  develop a services plan if a family does not request it. According to a  Navy official, some families also lack the required services plans because  installations may not have the staff needed to develop them. Finally, OSN  officials said the Military Services may not have developed many services  plans during fiscal year 2016 because DOD had not yet approved a  standardized form that all of the Military Services could use, and because  some families\u2019 circumstances did not require a services plan.", "In our May 2018 report, we recommended that DOD assess the extent to  which each Military Service is developing a services plan for each family  with special needs. DOD concurred with our recommendation, but as of  January 2020, we determined that DOD has not fully implemented the  recommendation because it has not yet assessed the extent to which  each Military Service is developing services plans for each family with  special needs. In its annual report to the congressional defense  committees in April 2019, DOD stated that it was exploring legislative  changes to the law that would require a services plan to be developed  and updated only for those families who request services. A senior official  from DOD stated that although this proposal received Office of  Management and Budget approval, it was not included in the NDAA for  fiscal year 2020. Also, in April 2019, in response to our recommendation,  DOD reported to us that the Military Services had begun using a  standardized form to develop services plans. In January 2020, a senior  DOD official said its standardized form provides an option for a family to  decline a services plan, and that the Department began collecting data  related to services plans in the last quarter of 2019."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Resources", "paragraphs": ["To meet requirements of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2010, in April 2017,  DOD stated that it issued to the Military Services guidance that directed  them to \u201crogram, budget, and allocate sufficient funds and other  resources, including staffing,\u201d to meet DOD\u2019s policy objectives for the  EFMP. We reported in May 2018 that DOD relies on each Military  Service to determine what level of funds and resources are sufficient and  what constitutes an appropriate number of family support personnel. To  determine the appropriate number of family support providers and staffing  levels, the Military Service officials with whom we spoke said they  consider a number of factors, including the number of families with  special needs enrolled in the EFMP at any given installation. See Table 4  for a summary of EFMP family support providers and other key personnel  at CONUS installations.", "In May 2018, based on our analysis of EFMP family support providers  and other key personnel at CONUS installations, we found that DOD had  not developed a standard for determining the sufficiency of funding and  resources each Military Service allocates for family support. As a result,  the Military Services may not know the extent to which their funding and  resources for family support comply with DOD\u2019s policy. Federal internal  control standards require that agencies establish control activities, such  as developing clear policies, in order to accomplish agency objectives,  such as those of the Military Services\u2019 EFMPs.", "Because DOD had not identified and addressed potential gaps in family  support across the Military Services\u2019 EFMPs, such as those we identified  in types of assistance, services plans, and resources, we concluded that  some families with special needs may not get the assistance they require,  particularly when they relocate. We recommended in our May 2018 report  that DOD assess the extent to which each Military Service is providing  sufficient resources to staff an appropriate number of family support  providers.

For example, to help provide a more  consistent EFMP screening process across the Military Services and  improve the collection of comparable assignment coordination data, OSN  had planned for each Military Service to use standard screening forms for  family members with special medical or educational needs prior to making  new assignments. In January 2020, DOD told us that the forms were  approved, but related guidance had not yet been developed for  implementation across all of the Military Services. In addition, OSN  planned to centralize the management of EFMP data across the Military  Services. In April 2019, DOD reported that 82 percent of the EFMP  related data terms were collectable across the Military Services which can  improve OSN\u2019s monitoring and reporting capabilities of the EFMP.", "Despite OSN\u2019s initial efforts, we found that DOD lacked common  performance measures for assignment coordination and family support,  and therefore is unable to fully assess EFMP performance across the  Military Services. In our May 2018 report, we recommended that DOD  direct OSN to develop common performance metrics for assignment  coordination and family support, in accordance with leading practices for  performance measurement. DOD concurred with our recommendation. In  April 2019, the most recent update DOD provided on this  recommendation, DOD officials told us that each Military Service submits  data on assignment coordination and family support to the EFMP data  repository on a quarterly basis, and that OSN was currently developing  additional performance metrics for assignment coordination and family  support. Until these metrics are fully developed and implemented, DOD  will remain unable to fully assess the effectiveness of its efforts related to  assignment coordination and family support at each of its installations.", "We also found in May 2018 that OSN did not have a process to  systematically evaluate the results of the Military Services\u2019 monitoring  activities. Instead, DOD requires each Military Service to monitor its own  assignment coordination and family support provided through the EFMP  and requires each Military Service to assess performance at least once  every 4 years using standards developed by a national accrediting  body. In addition, DOD requires personnel from each of the Military  Service\u2019s headquarters to periodically visit installations as part of their  monitoring activities. We also reported that the Military Services\u2019 family  support programs were not accredited by a national accrediting body  because, according to Military Service officials, they were unable to  obtain funding for engaging in that process. Instead, each Military Service  has a self-certification process based on standards that meet those of a  national accrediting body, Military Service-specific standards, and best  practices. We also reported in May 2018 that OSN officials did not  systematically review the results of monitoring activities, such as the  certification process, because they rely on each Military Service to self- monitor. In addition, officials said efforts to standardize certification of  EFMPs have been unsuccessful because the Military Services cannot  agree on a set of standards that can be used across installations.", "We recommended in our May 2018 report that DOD implement a  systematic process for evaluating the results of the Military Services\u2019  monitoring activities. DOD concurred with our recommendation but has  not yet fully implemented it. DOD last commented on this  recommendation in April 2019 and said the family support component is  monitored and evaluated through each Military Service\u2019s certification  process, which includes specific standards for the EFMP. In addition,  OSN participated in a monitoring site visit to Marine Corps Base Quantico  in December 2018 and plans to participate in additional site visits that are  coordinated by each Military Service\u2019s certification team. We will consider  this recommendation implemented only when DOD provides evidence  that it has implemented a systematic process to evaluate the results of  each Military Service\u2019s monitoring activities.", "In conclusion, DOD relies on each Military Service to implement its policy  on support for families with special needs. In doing so, they also rely on  each Military Service to determine the extent to which its assistance to  families with special needs complies with this policy. As it plans for the  future, DOD will need to balance the flexibility it provides each Military  Service to implement its policy with the need to assess the adequacy of  the Military Services\u2019 EFMPs in serving families with special needs,  including any gaps in services these families receive.", "Chairwoman Speier, Ranking Member Kelly, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
