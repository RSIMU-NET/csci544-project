The 2012 act created FirstNet to establish a nationwide, interoperable, wireless broadband network for public safety use. In doing so, the act established numerous responsibilities for FirstNet, provided $7 billion from spectrum auctions proceeds for the network's construction, and required FirstNet to be self-funding beyond this initial allocation. As part of the effort, FirstNet is working with five \u201cearly builder projects\u201d that have permission to build local and regional interoperable public-safety broadband networks.", "This statement is based on preliminary information from GAO's ongoing review of FirstNet. This statement addresses (1) FirstNet's progress carrying out its responsibilities and establishing internal controls, (2) how much the network is estimated to cost and how FirstNet plans to become self-funding, and (3) what lessons can be learned from the early builder projects. GAO reviewed relevant FirstNet documentation and public-safety network cost estimates recommended by agency officials and experts; surveyed the state-designated FirstNet contact in 50 states, 5 territories, and the District of Columbia; and interviewed FirstNet officials and public safety and wireless industry stakeholders selected for their telecommunications and public safety experience, among other things."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's ongoing work has found that the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) has made progress carrying out the responsibilities established in the 2012 Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act (the 2012 act) but lacks certain elements of effective internal controls. FirstNet has made progress establishing an organizational structure, planning the nationwide public-safety broadband network, and consulting with stakeholders. Nevertheless, stakeholders GAO contacted cited upcoming issues, such as deciding the level of network coverage, which will be difficult for FirstNet to address as it continues to carry out its responsibilities. With respect to internal controls, FirstNet has begun establishing policies and practices consistent with federal standards, but it has not fully assessed its risks or established Standards of Conduct . Given that FirstNet faces a multitude of risks to achieve its complex objectives, fully assessing risks would help FirstNet respond to risks in a proactive way. Developing standards of conduct would help FirstNet address conduct and performance issues in a timely manner.", "A nationwide public-safety broadband network is estimated to cost billions of dollars, and FirstNet faces difficult decisions determining how to fund the network's construction and ongoing operations. Various entities have estimated the cost to construct and operate such a network from $12 to $47 billion over the first 10 years. The actual cost of FirstNet's network will be influenced by FirstNet's (1) business model, especially the extent of commercial partnerships; (2) use of existing infrastructure; (3) efforts to ensure network reliability; and (4) network coverage. For example, the cost of the network will likely increase if FirstNet does not utilize commercial partnerships and at least some existing infrastructure. The 2012 act provides FirstNet $7 billion to establish the network. To become self-funding, FirstNet is authorized to generate revenue through user fees and commercial partnerships, the latter of which can involve secondary use of the network for non-public safety services. However, GAO's ongoing work suggests that FirstNet faces difficult decisions in determining how to best utilize these revenue sources. For instance, widespread network coverage can attract more users, and thus user fee revenue, but is expensive to construct and maintain, especially in rural areas.", "FirstNet has taken steps to collect and evaluate information and lessons from the five \u201cearly builder projects\u201d that are developing local and regional public-safety networks, but could do more to ensure that it properly evaluates and incorporates these lessons. For example, FirstNet has asked the projects to report on the experiences of their networks' users and has assigned contractors to collect and log lessons. However, preliminary results indicate that FirstNet does not have a plan that clearly articulates how it will evaluate those experiences and lessons. GAO has previously found that a well-developed evaluation plan for projects like these can help ensure that agencies obtain the information necessary to make effective program and policy decisions. Given that the early builder projects are doing on a local and regional level what FirstNet must eventually do nationally, an evaluation plan can play a key role in FirstNet's strategic planning and program management, providing feedback on both program design and execution and ensuring FirstNet has not missed opportunities to incorporate lessons the projects have identified."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our ongoing work on the First  Responder Network Authority (FirstNet).

To supplement these LMR systems, many first responders  also use commercial wireless networks for data transmissions. While  FirstNet\u2019s public safety network will not initially improve the  interoperability of voice communications among first responders, the  network is expected to support important data transmission (such as  security-camera video feeds).

The 2012 act  established that FirstNet\u2019s primary customers will be entities that  provide \u201cpublic safety services.\u201d How FirstNet interprets \u201cpublic  safety services,\u201d as established in the 2012 act, will expand or  contract the potential sources of revenue. As one public safety  official we spoke with noted, the network has more value to public  safety entities when there are more users on it, because entities will  all be able to communicate with each other. A large user base,  however, can require priority and preemption rules, if certain users are  to have privileged access to the network. According to some public  safety officials we spoke with, such rules can be difficult to establish  among public safety entities.", "Coverage. Widespread network coverage can attract more users, and  thus user fee revenue, but is expensive to construct and maintain.  Some of the public safety entities we spoke with said that the  network\u2019s coverage would play a role in whether they adopt the public  safety network, noting in particular that the coverage should be at  least as good as existing commercial services. One public safety  entity we spoke with said that existing commercial coverage is  inadequate, while two other entities said that commercial service can  become unusable during large events because of the number of users  on the network. However, as noted above, providing extensive  coverage can be very costly. Indeed, a few SPOCs noted in survey  responses that providing rural coverage in their states will be  challenging, with one commenting that \u201cit is inconceivable that  FirstNet will be able to deploy a terrestrial network in the vast areas  that are unpopulated or sparsely populated.\u201d", "Reliability. Although FirstNet is required to construct a resilient  network, practices to ensure this can be costly. Some public safety  officials we spoke with said that the network\u2019s reliability would play a  role in whether they adopt the public safety network. A few officials  specifically said that if the network did not reliably work when first  utilized by public safety, adoption would suffer, since public safety has  a low tolerance for unreliable technology. However, as noted above,  ensuring reliability requires significant capital expenses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Commercial Partnerships", "paragraphs": ["Our ongoing work also found that FirstNet can generate revenue through  commercial partnerships, but the extent of commercial interest in these  partnerships, and thus the value of this authority for FirstNet, is  unknown. Under the 2012 act, FirstNet can receive payment for the use  of the public safety network\u2019s capacity by non-public safety users as well  as use of the network\u2019s infrastructure. The value of secondary access to  the network\u2019s capacity depends in part on the availability of the spectrum,  which itself will be determined by the capacity available given the  network\u2019s design. According to one major carrier we spoke with, no  business is likely to enter into a partnership with FirstNet because its  public-safety user base has not been defined, and thus the network  capacity available to secondary (commercial) users is unknown.  According to this carrier, the risk would be too high for a commercial  entity to enter into an agreement without knowing exactly how the entity  will be able to use FirstNet\u2019s network. If public safety preempts all  commercial traffic, then the commercial entity will struggle to generate  income from this venture and may lose favor with its customers. However,  another major carrier we spoke with maintained that FirstNet will have to  partner with at least one commercial carrier to be financially sustainable  and that given the significant investments in Long Term Evolution (LTE)  infrastructure made by commercial carriers, FirstNet would do well to  utilize some of this infrastructure through commercial partnerships.  Although the historic Advanced Wireless Services spectrum auction FCC  concluded in late January 2015 could indicate significant demand for  spectrum capacity among commercial carriers, the extent of carriers\u2019  interest in partnering with FirstNet is not fully known. While there may be  some benefits in partnering with FirstNet, companies may also prefer to  compete directly with FirstNet with their own public safety products."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Although Early Builder Projects Are Providing Lessons, FirstNet Has Not Developed a Plan to Evaluate Them", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Early Builder Projects Have Learned Lessons As They Develop Public Safety Networks", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Governance", "paragraphs": ["Early builder project officials described governance challenges that  FirstNet may face as the governing entity for the nationwide network.

Officials from an ongoing project told us their project initially identified  network build-out sites but learned that environmental assessments  would need to be completed for each site, which would threaten the  project\u2019s planned schedule. To address the challenge, the project  narrowed its build-out site pool to exclude marsh lands and other areas  with obstructive tree lines and include publicly-owned sites such as police  and fire stations. With the publicly-owned sites identified, project officials  worked with their state\u2019s legislature to pass an exemption to state  environmental reviews.

Specifically, FirstNet has taken steps to identify the  data and information it will collect from the early builder projects. As noted  above, FirstNet entered into agreements with the projects that permit their  use of FirstNet\u2019s spectrum. Under these agreements, in exchange for  spectrum use, the early builders agree to conduct specific activities on  their networks, also known as key learning conditions; develop a Key  Learning Conditions Plan with FirstNet; and provide FirstNet with  quarterly reporting on their project\u2019s use of FirstNet\u2019s spectrum, progress  achieving project milestones, and in some cases, the experiences of their  network users. In October 2014, FirstNet provided the projects with  quarterly report templates, instructions, and timing for completing the  reports. Additionally, FirstNet intends to gain knowledge from the projects  through contractors who have been assigned to each project to collect  and log formal and informal lessons, and through weekly meetings  FirstNet officials told us they hold. Finally, in April 2014 FirstNet  authorized the PSAC to establish an Early Builder Working Group.", "Although FirstNet has taken these steps, we are concerned that it lacks a  detailed data-analysis plan to track the performance and results of the  early builder projects. For the early builder projects, their performance  and results are captured in the observations and lessons learned reported  to FirstNet and identified by consultants. We have previously found that a  well-developed evaluation plan for projects like the early builder projects  can help ensure that agencies obtain the information necessary to make  effective program and policy decisions. Such a plan should include,  among other things, a detailed data-analysis plan to track performance  and evaluate the project\u2019s final results. Even though FirstNet staff and  contractors remain in close contact with the projects, without a plan to  track those projects, it is unclear how FirstNet intends to evaluate the  projects\u2019 observations and lessons and determine whether or how the  lessons are addressed. As a result, we believe that FirstNet could miss  opportunities to leverage key lessons related to governance, finance,  outreach, and network deployment. Given that the early builder projects  are doing on a regional and local level what FirstNet must eventually do  on a national level, a complete evaluation plan that includes a detailed  data-analysis plan could play a key role in FirstNet\u2019s strategic planning  and program management, providing feedback on both program design  and execution. Furthermore, such a plan could provide FirstNet officials  the opportunity to make informed midcourse changes as it plans for the  public safety network, and facilitate transparency and accountability for  FirstNet\u2019s decision-making.", "Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Nelson, and Members of the  Committee, this concludes my prepared remarks.
