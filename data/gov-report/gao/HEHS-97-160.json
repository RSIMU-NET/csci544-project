Whether increased HMO use will save Medicare money depends, in part, on whether HMOs can attract and retain beneficiaries now in traditional, fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare, particularly those with expensive chronic conditions.", "Research conducted on data from the 1980s and 1990s has shown that Medicare HMOs have benefited from favorable selection\u2014they serve healthier-than-average beneficiaries\u2014relative to FFS. To explore whether HMO enrollment and disenrollment patterns of those with and without chronic conditions might explain the favorable selection that has occurred, we examined a mature managed care market to determine the extent to which Medicare beneficiaries with chronic conditions enroll in HMOs, whether beneficiaries with chronic conditions who enroll in HMOs are as costly as those remaining in FFS, and whether beneficiaries with chronic conditions rapidly disenroll from HMOs to FFS at rates different from other newly enrolled beneficiaries.", "To address these questions, we used data on Medicare beneficiaries in California, one of the most heavily Medicare HMO-penetrated states, to determine the HMO enrollment and disenrollment decisions of beneficiaries belonging to three health status groups. The state\u2019s Medicare risk HMO enrollment experienced rapid growth, increasing nearly five-fold between 1987 and 1995. By 1995, California accounted for over one-third of all Medicare HMO enrollment, and five California plans were among the seven largest in the nation. Medicare HMO penetration rates averaged 27 percent in California compared with the national average rate of about 7 percent.", "We obtained 1991 through mid-1995 enrollment and FFS claims data for approximately 1.3 million elderly Medicare beneficiaries in California. To determine the health status of the beneficiaries in our FFS cohort, we screened claims records for a diagnosis of any of five chronic conditions: diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Beneficiaries were then categorized as having either zero, one, or several of the selected conditions. For each health status category, we determined the proportion and relative costs (using 1992 average monthly FFS costs) of those who enrolled in an HMO in 1993 and 1994, and those who disenrolled within 6 months. Appendix I provides a detailed description of our scope and methodology.

In addition to covering all Medicare part A and part B benefits, advantages of Medicare HMOs typically include low or no monthly premiums, expanded benefit coverage, and reduced out-of-pocket expenses. In effect, the HMO often acts much like a Medicare supplemental policy (Medigap insurance) by covering deductibles, coinsurance, and additional services.", "On the other hand, beneficiaries may be reluctant to enroll in HMOs because they give up their freedom to choose any provider. If a beneficiary enrolled in an HMO seeks nonemergency care from providers other than those designated by the HMO or seeks care without following the HMO\u2019s referral policy, the beneficiary is liable for the full cost of that care. In addition, beneficiaries may be reluctant to drop Medigap coverage and enroll in an HMO because it may be difficult to obtain supplemental insurance later at a reasonable price if they return to FFS. Because the elderly face a higher risk of serious illness, they may prefer to remain in the FFS program to take advantage of the ability to visit any provider or maintain their relationships with current providers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicare Beneficiaries Have Freedom to Switch Between HMOs and FFS", "paragraphs": ["Medicare HMOs have enrollment procedures that reflect beneficiaries\u2019 freedom to move between the FFS program and HMO plans.

Beneficiaries who otherwise would be reluctant to try an HMO know they can easily leave if a plan does not meet their expectations. Because of this freedom to change plans every 30 days, disenrollments can indicate enrollee dissatisfaction with an HMO. Beneficiaries can also shift to HMOs to get specific benefits when needed and then disenroll with ease to return to FFS.", "Because enrolling more beneficiaries enables HMOs to spread their risk and better ensure profitability, recruiting or retaining beneficiaries in a plan is important. HMOs\u2019 marketing strategies often call attention to the size and geographic scope of the provider network and the quality of physicians in the network.

HMOs have the potential to provide a range of integrated services required by such people. Ideally, HMO providers should have the flexibility to treat patients with chronic conditions or refer them to an appropriate mix of medical and nonmedical services. They have a financial incentive for keeping people healthy and as fully functioning as possible. To avoid use of emergency room and costly acute-care services, HMOs often emphasize prevention services that address the development or progression of disease complications.", "The combination of more extensive benefits and lower costs was evident in the benefit packages offered by the five largest California Medicare HMOs (accounting for 83 percent of the state\u2019s enrollment). In 1994, these plans offered zero to $30 monthly premiums; hospital coverage in full with unlimited days; physician and specialist visits with a copayment of $5 or less; emergency room care, in or out of the area, with a copayment of $5 to $50 (waived if admitted to the hospital); coverage for preventive health services, including an annual exam, eye glasses, routine eye and hearing tests, and health education; outpatient pharmacy coverage in three of the five plans, with copayments of $5 to $7 per prescription and an annual cap from $700 to $1,200; and outpatient mental health services with a copayment of $10 to $20 per visit, in most cases.", "Despite these extra benefits of HMOs, California Medicare beneficiaries with chronic conditions were less likely to enroll in an HMO than beneficiaries without any of the selected conditions.

In addition, because HMOs require that a primary care physician or \u201cgatekeeper\u201d decide when a patient needs a specialist or hospitalization, these beneficiaries may be particularly concerned about their access to specialty providers. Beneficiaries diagnosed with chronic conditions may prefer to remain in the FFS program to take advantage of the ability to visit any provider or to maintain relationships with current providers.", "Within each health status group, HMO enrollment rates declined with age. This may indicate that younger seniors are more familiar with HMOs and thus less reluctant to try them or that they have less severe medical problems and are more willing to switch physicians, if necessary.

Even when the age of the beneficiary was taken into account, those with more than one chronic condition had substantially higher costs.

High early disenrollment rates may reflect beneficiaries\u2019 lack of familiarity with the HMO concept.
