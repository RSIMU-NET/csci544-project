The Balanced Budget Act's payment rules resulted in no Medicare payment to DOD in 1999.

This \u201cspace-available\u201d care is not provided on a regular and continuous basis, which older retirees often consider important. Enrollment in Senior Prime gave enrollees higher priority for MTF care than nonenrolled older military retirees. Subvention was also expected to be beneficial for Medicare because, under the BBA, Medicare would pay DOD a discounted capitation rate\uf8e7a fixed monthly payment for enrollees that would be less than that paid to private plans serving other Medicare beneficiaries.

The GME and capital costs exclusions took into account the fact that GME and capital costs in the military health system are funded by DOD appropriations, and the DSH exclusion recognizes that DOD medical facilities do not treat the low- income patients for whom DSH payments compensate hospitals.

DOD said that the report adequately described the financial complexities it faced in implementing, administering, and managing the Medicare subvention demonstration. However, DOD found that the report addressed neither the details of the agreement with CMS concerning LOE nor the annual reconciliation process that determined the amount of Medicare\u2019s final payment for Senior Prime care. According to DOD, these features resulted in an extremely complicated payment mechanism that was difficult for DOD managers to understand and execute. In response to our reference to the high cost of DOD\u2019s care, DOD stated that a contributing factor to the high cost of care was the design of the health care benefit provided by Senior Prime. The agency cited an estimate by an actuarial consulting firm that the Senior Prime benefit was worth $105 more per member per month than the typical Medicare+Choice plan. It stated that the burden of providing this benefit and the requirement to maintain fiscal year 1996 Indirect Medical Education (IME) rules made it difficult for DOD to attain its LOE target. In response to our discussion of the effect of risk adjustment on the final Medicare payment, DOD noted that the latest risk adjustment calculation shows that the Senior Prime enrollee population is healthier than the fee-for-service Medicare populations in the demonstration areas. As a result, DOD received no payment from CMS for Senior Prime care provided in 1999. Regarding our concluding observation that DOD incurred greater costs to support Senior Prime and had to cover the shortfall, the agency observed that the report does not state whether the federal government as a whole spent more or less as a result of the demonstration. Finally, DOD suggested that the Hierarchical Coexisting Conditions (HCC) method for determining beneficiaries\u2019 costliness may have resulted in risk scores that overstated the health of the enrollees, due to the HCC method\u2019s use of ambulatory data, which in DOD\u2019s case may be incomplete and may also contain data coding errors.", "In an earlier report, we described in detail the LOE mechanism and the annual reconciliation process that determines Medicare\u2019s final payment. We also noted in that report that the payment mechanism created uncertainty for DOD managers. Concerning the burden placed on DOD in meeting the LOE requirement, we observe that the Senior Prime benefit included both Medicare-covered services and non-Medicare-covered services. The LOE requirement applied only to Medicare-covered services, for which DOD incurred high costs. We agree that maintaining the fiscal year 1996 IME rules made it more difficult for DOD to meet its LOE requirement, but the effect was very small. Regarding the 1999 final payment by Medicare to DOD, the estimate in our draft report was based on preliminary information from CMS and DOD. We have incorporated into the published report information from the final accounting recently completed by the agencies that shows that there was no payment by Medicare for DOD\u2019s 1999 Senior Prime care. Although the issue of whether the federal government as a whole spent more or less as a result of the demonstration is outside of the scope of this report, our analyses indicate that the demonstration\u2019s impact on total federal costs for the demonstration population was negligible. We share DOD\u2019s concern about the completeness and reliability of ambulatory care data, but doubt that these data weaknesses had any substantial effect on the risk adjustment calculation. We performed the risk adjustment calculation using a method based only on inpatient data and obtained a result comparable to that obtained using the HCC method.", "CMS found the conclusions of the report to be appropriate.

We also included data on (1) older military retirees at the eight control sites used in the RAND evaluation of the demonstration and (2) a sample of nondual eligibles\u2014Medicare beneficiaries not eligible for military health care\u2014at both the demonstration and RAND control sites.", "Constructing the database involved four major steps: 1.  Identifying the Populations. To identify the population of Medicare- eligible military retirees, we obtained quarterly files from DOD for the period 1994 through 1999 that included all military retirees and their dependents aged 65 or older who were eligible for military health care. We matched a master list of these individuals to Medicare\u2019s Enrollment Data Base to produce a national file of all Medicare-eligible military retirees. This file was used to create separate lists for the demonstration and RAND control sites using Medicare data on beneficiaries\u2019 current and previous residences.", "To select comparison samples of Medicare beneficiaries not eligible for military health care, we created a master list of all nondual eligibles for each site. To do this, we matched a list of zip codes for the demonstration and RAND control sites to Medicare\u2019s annual master lists of beneficiary characteristics and excluded the dual eligibles. Finally, we selected a random sample of 30,000 beneficiaries for each site.2.  Determining Monthly Medicare Payments for Several Populations. We used the list of older retirees and the sample of nondual eligibles at both the demonstration and RAND control sites to extract all Medicare fee-for-service claims for these individuals in the years spanning 1993 through 1999. The payment amount of each claim was prorated among the months spanning the beginning and end dates of the period during which the service was provided. The prorated claims were then summed by month for each beneficiary.", "From the same lists of beneficiaries we also identified all former Medicare HMO enrollees. For each year spanning 1994 through 1999, we used HCFA\u2019s HMO rate calculation methodology to calculate the capitation rate for every month during which a beneficiary was enrolled in a Medicare HMO. These data were then merged with the monthly fee-for-service payments to create a file of all Medicare payments by month. 3.  Creating Variables That Describe Beneficiaries\u2019 Characteristics.", "We created a separate file of monthly beneficiary characteristics from Medicare and DOD data. These included age, sex, Medicare part A and part B enrollment status, eligibility for DOD health care, and residence at a demonstration or RAND control site. For Senior Prime enrollees we also added variables indicating their monthly enrollment status, their Senior Prime capitation rate, and the final Medicare payments to DOD per enrollee for 1998 and 1999. 4.  Creating the Master File and Time-Series Variables. We created the master file by merging the monthly beneficiary characteristics file with the monthly Medicare payments file. We used the master file to create two time-series variables\u2014average real monthly Medicare payments and the number of beneficiaries. For demonstration sites, these segments included all enrollees, enrollees who were fee-for- service beneficiaries before the demonstration, nonenrollees, and nondual eligibles. For the RAND control sites, these segments included all older retirees and nondual eligibles."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Modeling Methodology", "paragraphs": ["We used a standard statistical method (ordinary least-squares regression) to estimate forecasting equations of average monthly real Medicare spending for the population segments included in the database.

We therefore used a standard correction in our estimates to counteract the forecasting error that would otherwise be introduced.", "We assessed the forecasting accuracy of several alternative forecasting equations. To do this, we estimated an equation for a shortened version of the average spending series that omitted the 12 months preceding the demonstration. This equation was then used to forecast the spending variable for the omitted months. Finally, the actual spending during those months was compared to the forecast. The equation with the best forecasting accuracy has two independent variables\u2014a time trend and average monthly real Medicare payments for nondual eligibles."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Forecasting Accuracy", "paragraphs": ["We used this equation to estimate spending during the predemonstration period for 1999 Senior Prime enrollees and nonenrollees.

That is, DOD must spend as much on care for older retirees as it did historically before it could receive any payment from Medicare. This provision ensured that the government would not pay for the same care twice\u2014through both the DOD appropriations and Medicare.", "In establishing the LOE requirement, DOD and HCFA defined LOE as the amount DOD spent on space-available care for retirees 65 and over in 1996\u2014the most recent year for which complete data were available. To receive Medicare payments, DOD must exceed the 1996 LOE, which was approximately $172 million for all the demonstration sites combined. The LOE threshold remained constant throughout the demonstration with no adjustment for inflation.", "In measuring DOD\u2019s spending for the LOE test, care provided to Senior Prime enrollees and to nonenrolled retirees are valued differently. According to rules that DOD and HCFA agreed to, for each month a retiree is enrolled, DOD is credited with the Senior Prime capitation rate regardless of the services the retiree received. In 1999 this rule magnified the effect of the LOE requirement because the Senior Prime rate was much less than what enrollees\u2019 care cost DOD. The capitation rates are adjusted if there is \u201ccompelling\u201d evidence that enrollees are healthier or sicker than their fee-for-service Medicare counterparts. Nonenrollees\u2019 care is credited at DOD\u2019s estimated cost of the actual Medicare-covered services they receive. In each year Senior Prime enrollees\u2019 care must account for a minimum percentage of LOE\u201430 percent in 1998, 35 percent in 1999, and 47.5 percent in 2000. In principle, the entire LOE could be met by care provided to enrollees; there is no required minimum amount for space- available care provided to nonenrollees.", "If DOD meets its LOE and enrolled care requirements it receives a Medicare payment equal to the difference between the amount credited for care provided to all older retirees and the LOE requirement. If this amount is less than the spending cap specified in the BBA\u2014$60 million for 1999\u2014 then DOD gets the full amount; otherwise it gets the cap.", "The payment rules resulted in Medicare owing DOD nothing for care provided in 1999. Table 4 shows how this amount was calculated. DOD was credited $98 million for care provided to enrollees. This included an adjustment for the health status of enrollees, who were found to be significantly healthier than Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with the same demographic characteristics. DOD was also credited $72 million for care provided to nonenrollees, so the total credited amount of care provided to older retirees was $170 million. This amount was then compared to the LOE requirement of $172 million.
