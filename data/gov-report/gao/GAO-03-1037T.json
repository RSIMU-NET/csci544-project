Further, we have identified information security as a  governmentwide high-risk issue in reports to the Congress since 1997\u2014 most recently in January 2003. Concerned that significant weaknesses in  federal computer systems make them vulnerable to attack, in October  2000 the Congress passed and the President signed into law Government  Information Security Reform provisions (commonly known as GISRA) to  establish information security program, evaluation, and reporting  requirements for federal agencies\u2014requirements that are now  permanently authorized and strengthened through the recently enacted  Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA).", "In my testimony today, I will first provide an overview of the increasing  nature of cyber security threats and vulnerabilities and of the continuing  pervasive weaknesses across the federal government that led GAO to  initially begin reporting information security as a high-risk issue. I will  then discuss the status of DOD\u2019s efforts to ensure the security of its  information systems and to implement the statutory information security  requirements, focusing on the performance data that DOD reported to the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Finally, I will discuss some of  the challenges for the department in establishing an effective information  security management program.", "In preparing this testimony, we relied on prior reports and testimony on  information security both governmentwide and for DOD. We also analyzed  reports prepared by the DOD chief information officer and the DOD  inspector general (IG) for fiscal year 2002 GISRA reporting, as well as  recent DOD policy and guidance documents related to information  security. Further, we analyzed OMB\u2019s May 2003 report to the Congress on  fiscal year 2002 GISRA implementation. We did not validate the accuracy  of the data reported by DOD or OMB. We performed our work in July  2003, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Dramatic increases in computer interconnectivity, especially in the use of  the Internet, continue to revolutionize the way our government, our  nation, and much of the world communicate and conduct business. The  benefits have been enormous. Vast amounts of information are now  literally at our fingertips, facilitating research on virtually every topic  imaginable; financial and other business transactions can be executed  almost instantaneously, often 24 hours a day; and electronic mail, Internet  Web sites, and computer bulletin boards allow us to communicate quickly  and easily with a virtually unlimited number of individuals and groups.", "However, in addition to such benefits, this widespread interconnectivity  poses significant risks to the government\u2019s and our nation\u2019s computer  systems and, more important, to the critical operations and infrastructures  they support. For example, telecommunications, power distribution, water  supply, public health services, national defense (including the military\u2019s  warfighting capability), law enforcement, government services, and  emergency services all depend on the security of their computer  operations. The speed and accessibility that create the enormous benefits  of the computer age on the other hand, if not properly controlled, allow  individuals and organizations to inexpensively eavesdrop on or interfere  with these operations from remote locations for mischievous or malicious  purposes, including fraud or sabotage. Table 1 summarizes the key threats  to our nation\u2019s infrastructures, as observed by the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI).", "Government officials remain concerned about attacks from individuals  and groups with malicious intent, such as crime, terrorism, foreign  intelligence gathering, and acts of war. According to the FBI, terrorists,  transnational criminals, and intelligence services are quickly becoming  aware of and using information exploitation tools such as computer  viruses, Trojan horses, worms, logic bombs, and eavesdropping sniffers  that can destroy, intercept, degrade the integrity of, or deny access to  data. In addition, the disgruntled organization insider is a significant  threat, since these individuals often have knowledge that allows them to  gain unrestricted access and inflict damage or steal assets without  possessing a great deal of knowledge about computer intrusions. As  greater amounts of money are transferred through computer systems, as  more sensitive economic and commercial information is exchanged  electronically, and as the nation\u2019s defense and intelligence communities  increasingly rely on commercially available information technology (IT),  the likelihood increases that information attacks will threaten vital  national interests.", "As the number of individuals with computer skills has increased, more  intrusion or \u201chacking\u201d tools have become readily available and relatively  easy to use. A hacker can literally download tools from the Internet and  \u201cpoint and click\u201d to start an attack. Experts also agree that there has been  a steady advance in the sophistication and effectiveness of attack  technology. Intruders quickly develop attacks to exploit vulnerabilities  discovered in products, use these attacks to compromise computers, and  share them with other attackers. In addition, they can combine these  attacks with other forms of technology to develop programs that  automatically scan the network for vulnerable systems, attack them,  compromise them, and use them to spread the attack even further.", "Along with these increasing threats, the number of computer security  incidents reported to the CERT\u00ae Coordination Center has also risen  dramatically from 9,859 in 1999 to 82,094 in 2002 and 76,404 for just the  first half of 2003. And these are only the reported attacks. The Director of  CERT Centers stated that he estimates that as much as 80 percent of  actual security incidents goes unreported, in most cases because (1) the  organization was unable to recognize that its systems had been penetrated  or there were no indications of penetration or attack or (2) the  organization was reluctant to report. Figure 1 shows the number of  incidents reported to the CERT Coordination Center from 1995 through  the first half of 2003.", "According to the National Security Agency, foreign governments already  have or are developing computer attack capabilities, and potential  adversaries are developing a body of knowledge about U.S. systems and  methods to attack these systems. Since the terrorist attacks of September  11, 2001, warnings of the potential for terrorist cyber attacks against our  critical infrastructures have also increased. For example, in February 2002,  the threat to these infrastructures was highlighted by the Special Advisor  to the President for Cyberspace Security in a Senate briefing when he  stated that although to date none of the traditional terrorists groups, such  as al Qaeda, have used the Internet to launch a known assault on the  United States\u2019 infrastructure, information on water systems was  discovered on computers found in al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan. Also, in  his February 2002 statement for the Senate Select Committee on  Intelligence, the director of central intelligence discussed the possibility of  cyber warfare attack by terrorists. He stated that the September 11  attacks demonstrated the nation\u2019s dependence on critical infrastructure  systems that rely on electronic and computer networks. Further, he noted  that attacks of this nature would become an increasingly viable option for  terrorists as they and other foreign adversaries become more familiar with  these targets and the technologies required to attack them.", "Since September 11, 2001, the critical link between cyberspace and  physical space has been increasingly recognized. In his November 2002  congressional testimony, the Director of the CERT Centers at Carnegie- Mellon University noted that supervisory control and data acquisition  (SCADA) systems and other forms of networked computer systems have  been used for years to control power grids, gas and oil distribution  pipelines, water treatment and distribution systems, hydroelectric and  flood control dams, oil and chemical refineries, and other physical  systems, and that these control systems are increasingly being connected  to communications links and networks to reduce operational costs by  supporting remote maintenance, remote control, and remote update  functions. These computer-controlled and network-connected systems  are potential targets for individuals bent on causing massive disruption  and physical damage, and the use of commercial, off-the-shelf  technologies for these systems without adequate security enhancements  can significantly limit available approaches to protection and may increase  the number of potential attackers.", "The risks posed by this increasing and evolving threat are demonstrated in  reports of actual and potential attacks and disruptions. For example:    On February 11, 2003, the National Infrastructure Protection Center  (NIPC) issued an advisory to heighten the awareness of an increase in  global hacking activities as a result of the increasing tensions between the  United States and Iraq. This advisory noted that during a time of  increased international tension, illegal cyber activity often escalates, such  as spamming, Web page defacements, and denial-of-service attacks.  Further, this activity can originate within another country that is party to  the tension, can be state sponsored or encouraged, or can come from  domestic organizations or individuals independently. The advisory also  stated that attacks may have one of several objectives, including political  activism targeting Iraq or those sympathetic to Iraq by self-described  \u201cpatriot\u201d hackers, political activism or disruptive attacks targeting U.S.  systems by those opposed to any potential conflict with Iraq, or even  criminal activity masquerading or using the current crisis to further  personal goals.", "According to a preliminary study coordinated by the Cooperative  Association for Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA), on January 25, 2003, the  SQL Slammer worm (also known as \u201cSapphire\u201d) infected more than 90  percent of vulnerable computers worldwide within 10 minutes of its  release on the Internet, making it the fastest computer worm in history. As  the study reports, exploiting a known vulnerability for which a patch has  been available since July 2002, Slammer doubled in size every 8.5 seconds  and achieved its full scanning rate (55 million scans per second) after  about 3 minutes. It caused considerable harm through network outages  and such unforeseen consequences as canceled airline flights and  automated teller machine (ATM) failures. Further, the study emphasizes  that the effects would likely have been more severe had Slammer carried a  malicious payload, attacked a more widespread vulnerability, or targeted a  more popular service.", "In November 2002, news reports indicated that a British computer  administrator was indicted on charges that he broke into 92 U.S. computer  networks in 14 states; these networks belonged to the Pentagon, private  companies, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration during  the past year, causing some $900,000 in damage to computers. According  to a Justice Department official, these attacks were one of the biggest  hacks ever against the U.S. military. This official also said that the attacker  used his home computer and automated software available on the Internet  to scan tens of thousands of computers on U.S. military networks looking  for ones that might suffer from flaws in Microsoft Corporation\u2019s Windows  NT operating system software.", "On October 21, 2002, NIPC reported that all the 13 root-name servers that  provide the primary roadmap for almost all Internet communications were  targeted in a massive \u201cdistributed denial of service\u201d attack. Seven of the  servers failed to respond to legitimate network traffic, and two others  failed intermittently during the attack. Because of safeguards, most  Internet users experienced no slowdowns or outages.", "In July 2002, NIPC reported that the potential for compound cyber and  physical attacks, referred to as \u201cswarming attacks,\u201d is an emerging threat  to the U.S. critical infrastructure. As NIPC reports, the effects of a  swarming attack include slowing or complicating the response to a  physical attack. For example, cyber attacks can be used to delay the  notification of emergency services and to deny the resources needed to  manage the consequences of a physical attack. In addition, a swarming  attack could be used to worsen the effects of a physical attack. For  instance, a cyber attack on a natural gas distribution pipeline that opens  safety valves and releases fuels or gas in the area of a planned physical  attack could enhance the force of the physical attack. Consistent with this  threat, NIPC also released an information bulletin in April 2002 warning  against possible physical attacks on U.S. financial institutions by  unspecified terrorists.", "In August 2001, we reported to a subcommittee of the House Government  Reform Committee that the attacks referred to as Code Red, Code Red II,  and SirCam had affected millions of computer users, shut down Web sites,  slowed Internet service, and disrupted business and government  operations. Then in September 2001, the Nimda worm appeared using  some of the most significant attack profile aspects of Code Red II and  1999\u2019s infamous Melissa virus that allowed it to spread widely in a short  amount of time. Security experts estimate that Code Red, Sircam, and  Nimda have caused billions of dollars in damage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Significant Weaknesses Persist in Federal Information Security", "paragraphs": ["To better understand the risks facing DOD systems, it is useful to consider  the overall status of information security for the federal government. Our  analyses of information security at major federal agencies have shown that  federal systems were not being adequately protected from computer-based  threats, even though these systems process, store, and transmit enormous  amounts of sensitive data and are indispensable to many federal agency  operations. For the past several years, we have analyzed audit results for  24 of the largest federal agencies and found that all 24 had significant  information security weaknesses.", "As reported in November 2002, our latest analyses of reports issued from  October 2001 through October 2002, continued to show significant  weaknesses in federal computer systems that put critical operations and  assets at risk. Weaknesses continued to be reported in each of the 24  agencies included in our review, and they covered all six major areas of  general controls\u2014the policies, procedures, and technical controls that  apply to all or a large segment of an entity\u2019s information systems and help  ensure their proper operation. These six areas are (1) security program  management, which provides the framework for ensuring that risks are  understood and that effective controls are selected and properly  implemented; (2) access controls, which ensure that only authorized  individuals can read, alter, or delete data; (3) software development and  change controls, which ensure that only authorized software programs are  implemented; (4) segregation of duties, which reduces the risk that one  individual can independently perform inappropriate actions without  detection; (5) operating systems controls, which protect sensitive  programs that support multiple applications from tampering and misuse;  and (6) service continuity, which ensures that computer-dependent  operations experience no significant disruptions. Figure 2 illustrates the  distribution of weaknesses for the six general control areas across the 24  agencies.", "Although our analyses showed that most agencies had significant  weaknesses in these six control areas, as in past years\u2019 analyses,  weaknesses were most often identified for security program management  and access controls.", "For security program management, we identified weaknesses for all 24  agencies in 2002\u2014the same as reported for 2001, and compared to 21 of  the 24 agencies (88 percent) in 2000. Security program management, which  is fundamental to the appropriate selection and effectiveness of the other  categories of controls, covers a range of activities related to understanding  information security risks; selecting and implementing controls  commensurate with risk; and ensuring that controls, once implemented,  continue to operate effectively.", "For access controls, we found weaknesses for 22 of 24 agencies (92  percent) in 2002 (no significant weaknesses were found for one agency,  and access controls were not reviewed for another). This compares to  access control weaknesses found in all 24 agencies for both 2000 and 2001.  Weak access controls for sensitive data and systems make it possible for  an individual or group to inappropriately modify, destroy, or disclose  sensitive data or computer programs for purposes such as personal gain or  sabotage. In today\u2019s increasingly interconnected computing environment,  poor access controls can expose an agency\u2019s information and operations  to attacks from remote locations all over the world by individuals with  only minimal computer and telecommunications resources and expertise.", "Our analyses also showed service-continuity-related weaknesses at 20 of  the 24 agencies (83 percent) with no significant weaknesses found for 3  agencies (service continuity controls were not reviewed for another). This  compares to 19 agencies with service continuity weaknesses found in 2001  and 20 agencies found in 2000. Service continuity controls are important in  that they help ensure that when unexpected events occur, critical  operations will continue without undue interruption and that crucial,  sensitive data are protected. If service continuity controls are inadequate,  an agency can lose the capability to process, retrieve, and protect  electronically maintained information, which can significantly affect an  agency\u2019s ability to accomplish its mission. Further, such controls are  particularly important in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11,  2001.", "These analyses of information security at federal agencies also showed  that the scope of audit work performed has continued to expand to more  fully cover all six major areas of general controls at each agency. Not  surprisingly, this has led to the identification of additional areas of  weakness at some agencies. These increases in reported weaknesses do  not necessarily mean that information security at federal agencies is  getting worse. They more likely indicate that information security  weaknesses are becoming more fully understood\u2014an important step  toward addressing the overall problem. Nevertheless, the results leave no  doubt that serious, pervasive weaknesses persist. As auditors increase  their proficiency and the body of audit evidence expands, it is probable  that additional significant deficiencies will be identified.", "Most of the audits represented in figure 2 were performed as part of  financial statement audits. At some agencies with primarily financial  missions, such as the Department of the Treasury and the Social Security  Administration, these audits covered the bulk of mission-related  operations. However, at agencies whose missions are primarily  nonfinancial, such as DOD and the Department of Justice, the audits may  provide a less complete picture of the agency\u2019s overall security posture  because the audit objectives focused on the financial statements and did  not include evaluations of individual systems supporting nonfinancial  operations. However, in response to congressional interest, beginning in  fiscal year 1999, we expanded our audit focus to cover a wider range of  nonfinancial operations\u2014a trend we expect to continue. Audit coverage  for nonfinancial systems has also increased as agencies and their IGs  reviewed and evaluated their information security programs as required by  GISRA.", "To fully understand the significance of the weaknesses we identified, it is  necessary to link them to the risks they present to federal operations and  assets. Virtually all federal operations are supported by automated systems  and electronic data, and agencies would find it difficult, if not impossible,  to carry out their missions and account for their resources without these  information assets. Hence, the degree of risk caused by security  weaknesses is extremely high.", "The weaknesses identified place a broad array of federal operations and  assets at risk. For example,  resources, such as federal payments and collections, could be lost or  stolen;   computer resources could be used for unauthorized purposes or to launch    sensitive information, such as taxpayer data, social security records,  medical records, and proprietary business information, could be  inappropriately disclosed, browsed, or copied for purposes of espionage  or other types of crime;   critical operations, such as those supporting national defense and  emergency services, could be disrupted;   data could be modified or destroyed for purposes of fraud or disruption;    agency missions could be undermined by embarrassing incidents that  result in diminished confidence in their ability to conduct operations and  fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congress Consolidates and Strengthens Federal Information Security Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Concerned with accounts of attacks on commercial systems via the  Internet and reports of significant weaknesses in federal computer  systems that make them vulnerable to attack, on October 30, 2000,  Congress enacted GISRA, which was signed into law and became effective  November 29, 2000, for a period of 2 years. GISRA supplemented  information security requirements established in the Computer Security  Act of 1987, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, and the Clinger-Cohen  Act of 1996 and was consistent with existing information security guidance  issued by OMB and the National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST), as well as audit and best practice guidance issued by GAO.", "Most importantly, however, GISRA consolidated these separate  requirements and guidance into an overall framework for managing  information security and established new annual review, independent  evaluation, and reporting requirements to help ensure agency  implementation and both OMB and congressional oversight. GISRA  assigned specific responsibilities to OMB, agency heads and CIOs, and IGs.  OMB was responsible for establishing and overseeing policies, standards,  and guidelines for information security. This included the authority to  approve agency information security programs, but delegated OMB\u2019s  responsibilities regarding national security systems to national security  agencies. OMB was also required to submit an annual report to the  Congress summarizing results of agencies\u2019 independent evaluations of  their information security programs. OMB released its fiscal year 2001  report in February 2002 and its fiscal year 2002 report in May 2003.", "GISRA required each agency, including national security agencies, to  establish an agencywide risk-based information security program to be  overseen by the agency CIO and ensure that information security is  practiced throughout the life cycle of each agency system. Specifically,  this program was to include    periodic risk assessments that consider internal and external threats to the  integrity, confidentiality, and availability of systems, and to data  supporting critical operations and assets; the development and implementation of risk-based, cost-effective policies  and procedures to provide security protections for information collected  or maintained by or for the agency;  training on security responsibilities for information security personnel and  on security awareness for agency personnel;   periodic management testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of  policies, procedures, controls, and techniques;   a process for identifying and remediating any significant deficiencies;    procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents;    an annual program review by agency program officials.", "In addition to the responsibilities listed above, GISRA required each  agency to have an annual independent evaluation of its information  security program and practices, including control testing and compliance  assessment. The evaluations of non-national-security systems were to be  performed by the agency IG or an independent evaluator, and the results  of these evaluations were to be reported to OMB. For the evaluation of  national security systems, special provisions included having national  security agencies designate evaluators, restricting the reporting of  evaluation results, and having the IG or an independent evaluator perform  an audit of the independent evaluation. For national security systems, only  the results of each audit of an evaluation are to be reported to OMB.", "With GISRA expiring on November 29, 2002, on December 17, 2002, FISMA  was enacted as title III of the E-Government Act of 2002 to permanently  authorize and strengthen the information security program, evaluation,  and reporting requirements established by GISRA. Among other things,  FISMA also requires NIST to develop, for systems other than national  security systems, (1) standards to be used by all agencies to categorize all  their information and information systems based on the objectives of  providing appropriate levels of information security according to a range  of risk levels; (2) guidelines recommending the types of information and  information systems to be included in each category; and (3) minimum  information security requirements for information and information  systems in each category. In addition, FISMA requires each agency to  develop, maintain, and annually update an inventory of major information  systems (including major national security systems) operated by the  agency or under its control.

The program\u2019s  progress was limited by weaknesses in its management framework and  unmet staffing expectations. DOD had not established a performance- based management framework for IA improvement at the department  level. As a result, DOD was unable to accurately determine the status of IA  across the department, the progress of its improvement efforts, or the  effectiveness of its initiatives. Also, understaffing kept the program from  fulfilling its central role in planning, monitoring, coordinating, and  integrating Defense-wide IA activities, and changes in the composition and  authority of other key organizations interacting with DIAP left it without a  consistent and fully supportive environment for its operations. We  concluded that achieving this program\u2019s vision for information superiority  would require the commitment of DOD to proven IA management  practices. To improve progress toward the department\u2019s goals, we made  recommendations to the Secretary of Defense in the areas of component  commitments to DIAP and executive-level monitoring of the program. We  also recommended that the DOD CIO institute performance-based  management of DIAP through a defined budget and performance  objectives, and that the program manager take steps to address the  program\u2019s unmet goals.", "DOD has made some progress in addressing our previous  recommendations and, as discussed previously, during fiscal year 2003,  DOD issued guidance to establish policy and assign responsibility for IA  management and to prescribe a framework for implementing the  department\u2019s IA program and establish baseline levels of assurance for  information systems.
