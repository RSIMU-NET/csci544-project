IRS also generated efficiencies from increased electronic filing and benefits for taxpayers through systems modernization. IRS's processing of individual tax returns and refunds improved by most measures, but the growth rate of electronic filing continued to slow in part because of changes to the Free File Program, which reduced the number of taxpayers eligible to use it and the elimination of a program that allowed taxpayers to file via the telephone. Access to IRS's telephone assistors was comparable to last year. The accuracy of responses to telephone inquiries was 90 percent or over in 2006. Use of IRS's Web site increased substantially and IRS reconfigured the site to improve service. Continuing past trends, fewer taxpayers used IRS walk-in sites and more used less-costly volunteer sites. Also, IRS completed Phase I of the TAB, which identified strategic themes for improving taxpayer service; TAB Phase II is expected to be completed by early 2007. With the slowing growth rate in electronic filing, IRS is missing an opportunity to generate additional savings. Federal and state mandates for electronic filing have demonstrated success in increasing electronic filing; however, IRS currently lacks the authority to mandate electronic filing for certain income tax returns such as individual returns filed by paid tax preparers. Using IRS estimates, savings from such a mandate could be on the order of $60 million per year. IRS has another opportunity to generate savings because of excess space at its call sites. However, IRS lacks a strategy for eliminating that space by consolidating call sites. To replace its aging legacy computer system, IRS continues to implement a modernized system for processing tax returns and refunds. However, IRS does not report information on the chief benefit realized to date, faster refund issuance. Such information could be useful for the Congress when making decisions about funding the completion of the individual tax return processing part of the system, estimated by IRS to require at least another $500 million."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2006, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) spent  approximately $4.1 billion or 38 percent of its $10.8 billion budget on  processing income tax returns and providing taxpayer assistance, with  most of this occurring during the annual tax filing season. During the 2006  filing season, taxpayers filed an estimated 131 million individual income  tax returns and received almost $218 billion in refunds. IRS\u2019s filing season  performance is a key indicator of how well IRS is serving taxpayers and  helping them fulfill their tax responsibilities.", "In past reports and testimonies we said that IRS has made significant  progress improving taxpayer service since passage of the IRS  Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (RRA 98). However, we also  described challenges to continued progress. For example, the President\u2019s  proposed fiscal year 2007 budget for IRS would cut staffing by over 2  percent. At the same time, IRS has ambitious goals of maintaining or  improving filing season services, while also maintaining or increasing  enforcement activities in order to improve voluntary compliance by 2009.  Another challenge is continuing progress on the Business Systems  Modernization (BSM) program, IRS\u2019s ongoing effort to replace its aged  computer systems. Earlier this year we testified that proposed reduced  funding levels could affect the pace of modernization and ultimately of  improving service and enforcement.", "In light of these challenges and the tax filing season\u2019s cost and importance  to taxpayers, you asked us to assess IRS\u2019s 2006 filing season performance.

To the extent possible, we corroborated  information from interviews with documentation and data and where not  possible, we report the information as attributable to IRS officials. We  reviewed IRS documentation, interviewed IRS officials about computer  systems and data limitations, and compared those results to GAO  standards of data reliability.

In fiscal year 2005, about 59 percent of individual tax returns  were prepared by paid tax preparers. We have noted in previous testimony  that the rate of preparer usage is higher among taxpayers with more  complicated returns.", "Once returns are prepared, taxpayers can file their returns by mailing  paper returns to one of IRS\u2019s submission processing centers or submitting  the returns electronically. Both taxpayers and paid tax preparers can  submit paper returns directly to IRS. However, taxpayers cannot submit  electronic returns directly to IRS. Instead, only paid tax preparers and tax  preparation software companies that IRS has designated as electronic  return originators can transmit tax returns electronically to IRS which may  involve a fee to the taxpayer. In addition, the Free File program is offered  by 20 companies that make up the Free File Alliance, a consortium of tax  preparation companies that agreed to offer free return preparation and  electronic filing for taxpayers that meet certain criteria. Taxpayers can  access the Free File program via IRS\u2019s Web site (see app. I for further  detail on the Free File program).", "For 7 years, IRS has been modernizing its aging tax processing and  business systems. The BSM program is a high-risk, highly complex effort  critical to supporting IRS\u2019s taxpayer service goals. For example, the  program includes projects to allow taxpayers to file and retrieve  information electronically. To date, IRS has deployed releases of  modernized systems that have delivered benefits to taxpayers and the  agency, including e-Services (a new Web portal and electronic services for  paid tax preparers), Modernized e-File (a new electronic filing system),  and the Customer Account Data Engine (CADE), which is the new  taxpayer information database. CADE is intended to eventually replace  IRS\u2019s antiquated Master File legacy processing system that contains the  agency\u2019s repository of taxpayer account information and, therefore, is the  BSM program\u2019s cornerstone and highest priority project. CADE facilitates  faster refund processing and more timely response to taxpayer inquiries  (see app. II for more details on CADE).", "In addition to processing tax returns, IRS provides a variety of taxpayer  services, including providing tax law assistance, account resolution,  limited return preparation, tax forms and publications distribution,  outreach, and education. IRS provides these services mainly via telephone,  its Web site, and face-to-face assistance. IRS automatically routes  taxpayers\u2019 calls from one of three toll-free lines\u2014tax law, accounts, or  refunds. Depending on how taxpayers respond to menu choices, questions  are answered by a recorded message or taxpayers are directed to CSRs  located at 25 call sites around the country. Calls are centrally routed to the  site with the shortest wait times among CSRs assigned to answer  particular tax law, account, or refund status questions.", "For face-to-face assistance, IRS has 400 walk-in sites where taxpayers can  ask basic tax law questions, get account information, receive assistance  with their accounts, and have returns prepared if annual income is $38,000  or less. Also, low-income, elderly, and qualifying military taxpayers can  get returns prepared at over 12,000 volunteer sites run by community- based coalitions that partner with IRS. In addition, IRS identifies and  selects community partners, such as AARP, that meet taxpayer needs,  such as assistance for the elderly, and helps train, provides resource  materials, and oversees operations at these partners\u2019 facilities. In some  cases, IRS awards grants, trains and certifies volunteers, and provides  reference materials, computer software, and computers.", "IRS provides many Web services that have become popular, such as  \u201cWhere\u2019s My Refund\u201d which enables taxpayers to use IRS\u2019s Web site to  determine whether the agency received their tax returns and processed  their refunds. Taxpayers can also download forms, instructions, and  publications; research their own tax law issues through Frequently Asked  Questions or Tax Topics; and receive help with specific tax law questions  and procedural questions via e-mail using Electronic Tax Law Assistance  (ETLA). One benefit of the Web site is that it reduces the number of phone  calls received.", "IRS\u2019s 2006 filing season activities and associated workload volumes are  depicted in figure 1.", "IRS evaluates taxpayer service against performance measures such as  timeliness and quality of telephone responses. IRS\u2019s definitions for some  of those measures vary. For example, IRS measures accuracy for  telephone and face-to-face assistance, but because of differences in the  methodologies used to collect the data, comparisons between the two  types of assistance are not possible. IRS also considers volume important  when assessing service delivery and recognizes that volume does not  necessarily reflect actual demand for services, but can reflect changes in  taxpayer behavior, such as more willingness to use IRS\u2019s Web site to  receive services. Finally, IRS uses other means to collect information, such  as surveys on taxpayer satisfaction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opportunities Exist to Generate Savings by Encouraging Electronic Filing; Processing Performance Continued to Improve", "paragraphs": ["The growth rate of electronic filing is important because electronic filing  eliminates costs associated with processing paper returns.

Of those returns, 72 million or 55.1 percent were filed  electronically and the remaining 59 million returns were filed on paper.  The number of returns filed electronically increased by 6.3 percent over  the last year, which was less than the 9 percent increase forecasted by IRS  and less than last year\u2019s 11 percent increase, the 12 percent increase in  2004, and the nearly 17 percent increase in 2003.", "The growth rate has slowed and, according to IRS officials, it is getting  harder to convert additional taxpayers to electronic filing because those  who might convert most readily have already done so. Slower growth  limits IRS\u2019s progress toward achieving the goal set by the Congress in RRA  98, which was for IRS to have 80 percent of all federal tax and information  returns filed electronically by 2007. We and IRS have previously reported  that IRS likely will not meet the 80 percent goal, but that the agency did  not want to abandon it because it serves as a symbol of IRS\u2019s  determination to increase electronic filing.", "Growth of electronic filing is important because it generates savings from  reductions in staff needed for labor-intensive paper processing and  associated space. As shown in figure 2, as electronic filing increased  between fiscal years 1999 and 2006, IRS has greatly reduced the number of  staff years devoted to paper and electronic processing by 1,586, or 34  percent.", "In addition to generating savings by reducing FTEs, IRS can and has  achieved ancillary space cost savings from the closing of submission  processing centers. IRS estimates that the elimination of the Brookhaven  Submission Processing Center in 2003 resulted in savings of $5.5 million in  annualized rent and related savings. In addition, IRS closed the Memphis  Submission Processing Center in 2005, and IRS is projecting annualized  rent and related savings equal to $1.3 million beginning in fiscal year 2007.  IRS plans to close the Philadelphia Submission Processing Center in 2007,  although IRS will not realize space savings until late 2011 because the  Service cannot close the entire facility or move other operations into the  space vacated by paper processing operations.", "Two other factors that contributed to this year\u2019s slower growth in  electronic filing were (1) changes in the Free File program, which reduced  the number of taxpayers eligible to file electronically for free this year, and  (2) termination of the TeleFile program, which had allowed taxpayers to  file their returns electronically via telephone. Through August, IRS  processed about 4 million returns filed through the Free File program,  which is a decrease of about 23 percent from the same period last year.  This decline is inconsistent with IRS\u2019s projection that it would receive 6  million tax returns filed through the Free File program, or almost a million  more than received last year, when some members of the Free File  program provided free electronic filing to all taxpayers. In 2005, IRS  renegotiated and amended the agreement with the tax preparation  companies participating in the Free File program. Among the important  changes was a new income limitation of $50,000 or less that resulted in 30  percent of the nation\u2019s taxpayers not being eligible for the Free File  Program. This change left 92 million taxpayers eligible for the program  and 39 million taxpayers ineligible.", "IRS also terminated the TeleFile program. IRS expected that eliminating  TeleFile would reduce electronic filing, but justified the decision because  of declining usage and relatively high costs. The number of taxpayers  using the TeleFile program had been decreasing\u2014from approximately 5.7  million in 1999 to 3.3 million in 2005. IRS estimated the cost per tax return  submitted through TeleFile, typically Form 1040EZ, to be about 74 percent  more than it costs IRS to process a return filed on paper, largely due to  telecommunications and other costs. IRS officials stated that the reason  for this year\u2019s increase in the number of 1040EZ returns filed on paper is,  in part, the elimination of TeleFile. According to IRS officials,  approximately 1.3 million or 40 percent of taxpayers who formerly used  Telefile in 2005 filed on paper in 2006.", "Over the years, IRS has taken numerous actions to encourage electronic  filing by taxpayers and tax practitioners. In addition, IRS has responded to  many of our recommendations to increase the use of electronic filing.  Despite these actions, and as we have already noted, growth in electronic  filing has slowed as IRS\u2019s recent efforts have not resulted in converting a  large portion of tax filers from paper to electronic filing.", "Nevertheless, IRS continues to look at options for increasing electronic  filing. A recent proposal is aimed at converting taxpayers and paid tax  preparers who prepare individual income returns on computer, print them  out, and then send them to IRS\u2014a process known as V-coding\u2014to  electronic filing. According to IRS officials, converting these taxpayers  could be an important step to reduce the number of paper returns filed.  Between January and May 2006, IRS estimates that nearly 39 million, or 72  percent of all paper returns filed were V-coded returns. To help convert   V-coders, IRS officials stated that the agency is considering creating a  secured electronic mailbox where tax preparers could send in a return, the  taxpayer could review and sign it, then submit it to IRS electronically, or  return it to the preparer for additional work and subsequent electronic  filing to IRS. According to IRS officials, this initiative would be part of   e-Services. Further, this and other proposals to expand electronic filing  and capitalize on new technologies will be contained in an update to its   E-Strategy for Growth, which is a long-term vision for providing ways for  taxpayers to interact electronically with IRS. While the proposal may be an  important tool for paid tax preparers and taxpayers, participation remains  on a voluntary basis as part of e-Services, IRS officials did not have  estimates as to its effect on reducing V-coding, and it covers only  practitioners and not taxpayers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mandates Have Demonstrated Success in Increasing Electronic Filing, but IRS Lacks the Authority to Impose Mandates for Individual Taxpayers", "paragraphs": ["For the first time, in the 2006 filing season IRS mandated that corporations  with assets over $50 million file their corporate tax returns electronically.  As of September 15, 2006, over 12,000 large corporations electronically  filed their returns, up from 131 in 2005. Next year, corporations with over  $10 million in assets will be required to file their returns electronically.  Perhaps in anticipation of the mandate, over 16,000 of those corporations  filed electronically, compared to just over 1,100 in 2005. According to the  IRS Commissioner, electronic filing by large corporations will cut many  months off the audit process and will allow IRS to develop analytical tools  to better select areas of audit inquiry. Consequently, those corporations  will benefit by having uncertainties on their tax returns resolved sooner,  and the government will benefit by more promptly identifying and  responding to areas of noncompliance.", "Last year we reported that state mandates for electronic filing of state tax  returns also encourage electronic filing of both state and federal tax  returns. Of the 50 states, 12 had electronic filing mandates for paid tax  preparers in effect for the 2006 filing season. These mandates require  preparers who meet certain criteria, such as filing 100 individual state tax  returns or more, to file individual state returns electronically (see app. III  for more information on state mandates).", "State mandates have increased the electronic filing of federal individual  income tax returns. According to IRS officials, this increased growth is  because paid tax preparers converted their entire practice to electronic  filing. Nine states had electronic filing mandates in effect in 2005 or earlier.  In eight of these nine states, the growth rate of electronically filed federal  returns increased the year the mandate was implemented. For one state,  Virginia, the growth rate declined by 11 percent. Four states had  increases of between 7 and 48 percent in their growth rates. Four other  states had their growth rates more than double including California, which  nearly tripled.", "An alternative comparison of state growth rates to the nationwide growth  rate also shows the benefits of state mandates. For eight of the nine states  that have imposed a mandate, the growth rate of federal returns  electronically filed from that state was greater than the national growth  rate for the year the mandate took effect.", "In the past, some tax preparers have voiced concern regarding the costs  and burdens associated with converting their businesses to electronic  filing. As a result, last year we recommended to IRS that it develop better  information about the costs to preparers and taxpayers of mandatory  electronic filing of tax returns for certain categories of preparers.  According to an IRS survey, cost was not the primary factor cited by  preparers for not converting their businesses to electronic filing; instead,  the major factor was that their clients did not ask for or want electronic  filing. However, once over the initial barrier of having converted to  electronic filing, several state tax officials we consulted with, including  New York and Minnesota, reported receiving very little negative feedback  from preparers. In fact, one state official noted that a substantial number  paid tax preparers have reported how easy electronic filing is compared to  filing returns on paper. Given the current rate of growth in electronic filing  of federal returns, mandates represent an important option for realizing  further growth.", "Because mandates drive significant electronic filing increases, the  Electronic Tax Administration Advisory Council (ETAAC) recently  recommended a federal mandate for paid tax preparers that prepare  individual tax returns. ETAAC estimated that if preparers filed all  individual returns electronically, IRS would be only 5 percentage points  below the 80 percent goal set by the Congress, instead of being 25  percentage points below the goal as it is currently.", "IRS, however, is prohibited by law from requiring electronic filing of  income tax returns for individuals, estates, and trusts. Because IRS lacks  the statutory authority to mandate electronic filing of individual tax  returns, it has not developed any plans or proposals for doing so. Any  proposal would likely have to consider such factors as to whom the  mandate should apply, thresholds for such mandates, if penalties should  be assessed for noncompliance, and the length of time needed to develop  the capacity to receive additional electronically filed returns.", "State and federal experiences with mandates demonstrate that mandated  electronic filing can generate savings. By not requiring electronic filing by  paid preparers, IRS is missing an opportunity for generating savings and  efficiencies. IRS estimates that it saves $2.38 on every return that is  processed electronically. Using IRS\u2019s estimates, if 90 percent of returns  submitted by preparers that are currently filed on paper were filed  electronically, IRS would have saved an estimated $68.5 million per year.", "Senate bill S. 1321 shows Congressional interest in increasing use of  electronic filing for preparers.

Over 56.4 million or more than  half of the refunds were directly deposited, up nearly 8 percent over the  same period last year. This increase is important, because direct deposit is  faster, more convenient for taxpayers, and less expensive for IRS than  mailing paper checks.", "Of the nine processing performance measures listed in table 1 used by IRS  to assess performance, the agency met or exceeded eight out of its nine of  its 2006 goals, and equaled or exceeded its 2005 performance for seven of  the nine measures (see app. IV for further details). For one measure, the  letter error rate, IRS\u2019s performance declined and the 2006 goal was not  met. IRS officials said that computer system errors were partially to blame  for the higher letter error rate, along with some errors as a result of the  lack of training of new employees at one submission processing center.  More importantly, however, IRS\u2019s processing performance has  significantly improved for all nine measures compared to 2001 or for  measures not in existence in 2001, compared to their first year in  existence.", "In addition to the processing measures results, representatives of the tax  preparer industry reported that returns processing went well. Groups and  organizations that we talked to included the National Association of  Enrolled Agents and the American Institute of Certified Public  Accountants. In addition, TIGTA testified and later reported no significant  problems during the filing season. IRS officials corroborated the view  that returns processing went smoothly.", "CADE, the cornerstone of IRS\u2019s investment in systems modernization, also  performed well. For the 2006 filing season, CADE processed about 7.4  million, or 5.6 percent, of the 131 million income tax returns filed  electronically or on paper, and disbursed about 6.6 million refunds totaling  over $3.4 billion. While the percentage of returns CADE processed is  modest, CADE is important because it is ultimately expected to replace  IRS\u2019s antiquated Master File legacy system, which contains the agency\u2019s  repository of taxpayer account information.", "A major benefit of CADE is that it is much faster compared to the Master  File legacy system, partly due to CADE\u2019s daily processing cycle, compared  to the Master File\u2019s weekly processing cycle. For example, according to  IRS officials, direct deposit refunds are issued by CADE 1\u20135 business days  faster than the current system, and paper check refunds are issued 4\u20138  business days faster. The benefits of CADE, in terms of faster processing,  are likely to expand to more taxpayers because the next release of CADE  is expected to process an estimated 33 million returns in 2007, over four  times more than the number processed through CADE in 2006. Because  CADE processes returns and refunds more quickly, it can help minimize  the need for Refund Anticipation Loans (RAL). Reducing the need for  RALs matters because of the high interest rates that taxpayers are often  charged for these short-term loans, making them controversial.", "Systems modernization has been a key part of IRS\u2019s efforts to improve  taxpayer services. CADE is a major investment, with almost $200 million  spent on development and implementation through fiscal year 2006, and  the cornerstone of IRS\u2019s systems modernization program. CADE is only  partially completed, and IRS estimates that over $500 million more is  required to fully implement the individual tax return processing part of the  system.", "In its proposed fiscal year 2007 budget request to the Congress, IRS did not  report the benefits from CADE to date in terms of faster refund timeliness.  IRS had not established separate processing performance measures for  CADE that report the total time it takes CADE to process a return and  issue a refund. According to IRS officials, this was due to the newness of  CADE\u2019s implementation, the difficulty in separating CADE and Master File  processing information, and IRS\u2019s desire to keep performance measures to  a vital few. The refund timeliness measure included in table 1 covers only  returns filed on paper, not electronically, and combines refund timeliness  information for all paper returns together.", "Because of the substantial costs associated with fully implementing CADE,  the Congress could find information about the benefits useful. We have  previously reported the value in knowing estimates of benefits when  making decisions about whether to fund large investment programs. The  actual benefits received from CADE may be useful as an indication of both  the magnitude and likelihood of the future benefits from full  implementation.

The percentage  of taxpayers who wanted to talk with a CSR and actually got through and  received service\u2014referred to as the CSR level of service or telephone  access\u2014was 81 percent through mid-July as compared to 82 percent over  the same period last year\u2014and slightly less than its 2006 goal of 82  percent. This translated into 22.3 million calls being answered by CSRs.  Taxpayers gain access to a CSR depending on their responses to telephone  prompts. Some go through an automated system to determine if a CSR is  needed, while other taxpayers, such as those seeking tax law assistance,  are screened and transferred to a CSR who is trained to respond to their  questions.", "Other access measures showed improvement, such as the average speed  of answer and the abandon rate, also shown in table 2. IRS reported that,  through mid-July, the average speed of answer, the time taxpayers wait to  get their calls answered, was nearly 4 minutes, which is an 11.4 percent  decrease from last year. The abandon rate, or the percentage of callers  who hang-up after reaching the queue to wait for an assistor, was 10.5  percent, down from 12.2 percent from last year. The table below indicates  that as the average speed of answer decreases from 2005 to 2006, so does  the number of taxpayers who abandon their calls to IRS. However, this  relationship may be influenced by other factors as well, such as call  volume, staffing, or efficiencies, as well as an increased number of what  IRS refers to as courtesy disconnects. According to IRS, the Agency  disconnects some callers when wait times become excessive for particular  types of questions in order to improve taxpayers\u2019 experiences overall.

According to New York, California, and Minnesota officials,  given tight budget constraints, the opportunity to generate savings was the  main reason behind their decisions to implement mandates. For example,  in 2001 Minnesota estimated it saved $2.45 per return by mandating  electronic filing for paid tax preparers. Other states also reported savings  from electronic filing mandates.", "While Minnesota was the first state to implement a mandate for individual  income tax returns, more states have adopted mandates and some have  used different methods to encourage electronic filing of state returns.  Some notable examples include the following:    Filing thresholds: States with mandates often differ in the minimum  number of returns a paid tax preparer must file before having to  comply with an electronic filing mandate. In most states, the threshold  is often lowered gradually over time, increasing the base of preparers  that fall under the mandate. For example, in New Jersey in 2005,  preparers who prepared more than 200 individual state income returns  in the prior year had to electronically file all returns they prepared in  the current year. The threshold will drop to 100 returns in 2007 and 50  returns in 2008.", "Penalties: Some states do not impose penalties on noncompliant paid  tax preparers; however, those states that do levy penalties for  noncompliance often differ in amount and level of enforcement. For  example, some states waive the penalty if a taxpayer chooses to opt- out of having their return electronically filed. In fact, most states  include \u201copt-out\u201d clauses in the legislation that allows a preparer to file  a customer\u2019s return on paper at the customer\u2019s request. In contrast, if a  preparer files a return on paper, absent of the customer\u2019s request, they  could be subject to upwards of a $100 fine.

Utah,  Alabama, and Virginia consider a paper return with a 2-D barcode  produced by tax preparation software as an electronically filed return.  New York also considered paper returns with 2-D barcodes as  electronically filed returns for the 2006 filing season.", "In its June 2005 report, the Federation of Tax Administrators noted that  many states reviewed existing state mandate legislation for guidance and  ideas, or best practices, prior to implementing their own mandates. For  example, New York officials said they used the experiences reported by  California when deciding what provisions their mandate should or should  not include. The Federation of Tax Administrators reported several  lessons learned about implementing mandates, including,    having a phased-in approach over a period of several years,    providing the ability for a taxpayer to opt out of electronic filing if he or  she chooses instead to file a paper return, and    having penalties for failure to file electronically.", "Finally, the states\u2019 experience with mandates has shown the following    Communication and taxpayer education are vital. For example,  California scheduled presentations and panels on mandatory electronic  filing for tax professional organizations in order to achieve buy-in from  the paid tax preparer community.", "Lead time for implementation and the definition for the scope of the  mandate are important. Most states currently use the federal Employer  Identification Number (EIN) to define \u201cpaid tax preparer\u201d and treat any  office or branch of an entity operating under a single EIN as a \u201cpaid tax  preparer\u201d subject to the mandate.", "Coordination between IRS and Electronic Return Originators is  essential."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: IRS\u2019s Processing Performance Relative to 2001\u20132005 Performance and 2006 Goals", "paragraphs": ["IRS met or exceeded eight of the nine processing performance goals for  2006 as table 5 shows. For seven measures (i.e., deposit error rate, deposit  timeliness, notice error rate, refund interest paid, refund timeliness,  productivity, and efficiency), IRS exceeded its goal. For one measure  (refund error rate), IRS met its goal.", "For one measure, the letter error rate, IRS\u2019s performance declined and the  2006 goal was not met. The letter error rate is calculated as the percentage  of letters issued to taxpayers with errors. IRS officials said that computer  system errors were partially to blame for the higher letter error rate this  filing season; however, most of those errors were caused by one  programming error that was corrected in the beginning of March. In  addition, according to IRS officials, most errors caused by employees were  attributed to one submission processing center, which had many new  employees.", "Comparing actual 2006 performance to 2005 shows that IRS\u2019s performance  improved or remained about the same for eight of the nine measures in  effect in 2005.

For example,  from January 1 through April 22 the level of service was 82 percent, but  was 75 percent from April 23 through June 10. Fewer taxpayers called  after the filing season deadline and those taxpayers who did received a  lower level of service compared to those who called during the filing  season. According to IRS officials, their work plans are built to maximize  IRS\u2019s telephone performance during the filing season when most taxpayers  call.", "The average speed of answer varies between questions. IRS groups each  type of call into different applications, so that they can be answered by a  properly trained customer service representative (CSR). Taxpayers\u2019  experiences may differ depending upon the availability of CSRs and the  number of calls received in the category. For example, according to IRS  data as of April 22, taxpayers wanting answers about capital gains and  losses on average waited 4 minutes longer than those wanting answers  about tax credits.", "According to IRS, however, there may be opportunities to address these  variances with the implementation of a new workforce management  system and full deployment of a single queue for telephone service. The  new system should allow IRS to make staffing decisions at the corporate  level, rather than relying on the individual sites, and in turn, create  benefits from better staffing decisions and more flexible work plans. IRS  expects to have the new workforce management system fully implemented  in fiscal year 2008. According to IRS officials, implementing a single queue  for each application across all call sites, rather than separate queues at  each site, will create a consistent average answer time within an  application. Currently, two taxpayers with the same question may have  different wait times because one waited for a CSR in the Jacksonville call  site, for example, while another waited for a CSR in Austin. With a single  queue, those taxpayers would wait the same amount of time irrespective  of their location. However, the single queue will not improve the variations  in wait time between the different applications. IRS officials said that there  will still be fluctuations but the new workforce management solution and  a single queue should help to better manage variances."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the Internal Revenue Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
