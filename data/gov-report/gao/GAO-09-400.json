The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) conducts most of DOD's clearance investigations, which DOD adjudicators use to make clearance decisions. The Deputy Director for Management at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) chairs a Performance Accountability Council that is responsible for reforming the clearance process. Conducted under the authority of the Comptroller General, GAO's report addresses the (1) reporting on timeliness for DOD clearances, (2) documentation completeness for making initial top-secret clearance decisions for DOD personnel, and (3) reporting on the quality of the clearance process. To assess these issues, GAO analyzed data on most DOD clearances granted in fiscal year 2008, randomly sampled and analyzed 100 OPM investigative reports and DOD adjudicative files for clearances granted in July 2008, and analyzed 2006-09 executive branch annual clearance reports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD and OPM met statutory timeliness requirements for personnel security clearances in fiscal year 2008, but the executive branch's 2009 required report to Congress did not reflect the full range of time to make all initial clearance decisions. Currently, 80 percent of initial clearance decisions are to be made within 120 days, on average, and by December 2009, a plan is to be implemented in which, to the extent practical, 90 percent of initial clearance decisions are made within 60 days, on average. Under both requirements, the executive branch can exclude the slowest percent, and then report on an average of the remaining clearances. The most recent report stated that the average time to complete the fastest 90 percent of initial clearances for military and DOD civilians in fiscal year 2008 was 124 days, on average. However, without taking averages or excluding the slowest clearances, GAO analyzed 100 percent of initial clearances granted in 2008 and found that 39 percent still took more than 120 days. The absence of comprehensive reporting limits full visibility over the timeliness of initial clearance decisions. With respect to initial top secret clearances adjudicated in July 2008, documentation was incomplete for most OPM investigative reports and some DOD adjudicative files. GAO independently estimated that 87 percent of about 3,500 investigative reports that adjudicators used to make clearance decisions were missing required documentation, and the documentation most often missing was employment verification. Although DOD leadership asserted that adjudicators follow a risk-managed approach, DOD has not issued formal guidance clarifying if and under what circumstances adjudicators can adjudicate incomplete investigative reports. For DOD adjudicative files, GAO estimated that 22 percent were missing required documentation of the rationale for granting clearances to applicants with security concerns, and the documentation most often missing was related to foreign influence. Neither OPM nor DOD measures the completeness of its investigative reports or adjudicative files. As a result, both are limited in their ability to explain the extent or the reasons why some documents are incomplete. Incomplete documentation may lead to increases in both the time needed to complete the clearance process and in overall process costs and may reduce the assurance that appropriate safeguards are in place to prevent DOD from granting clearances to untrustworthy individuals. The executive branch's annual reports to Congress on the personnel security clearance process have provided decision makers with limited data on quality. The 2009 report did not provide any data on quality but, unlike previous reports, identified quality metrics that the executive branch proposes to collect. GAO has stated that timeliness alone does not provide a complete picture of the clearance process and emphasized that attention to quality could increase reciprocity--accepting another federal entity's clearances. The executive branch, though not required to include information on quality in its annual reports, has latitude to report appropriate information and has missed opportunities to make the clearance process transparent to Congress."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2008, the Department of Defense (DOD) granted eligibility  for initial or renewal security clearances to more than 630,000 applicants  who were military, DOD civilian, or private industry personnel working on  DOD contracts. Clearances potentially give these applicants access to  information that, if improperly disclosed, could, in some cases, cause  exceptionally grave damage to national security. Long-standing delays in  the clearance process led us to designate DOD\u2019s personnel security  clearance process as a high-risk area in 2005. That designation continued  in 2007 and 2009, when we identified continued delays in the clearance  process and additional concerns with clearance documentation.", "The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA)  established, among other things, milestones for reducing the time to  complete initial clearances. IRTPA currently requires that DOD and other  agencies that adjudicate security clearances make a decision on at least 80  percent of initial clearance applications within 120 days, on average,  measured from the receipt date of an individual\u2019s completed application to  the date when an agency makes the adjudication decision. Further, IRTPA  calls for the executive branch to implement a plan by December 17, 2009,  under which, to the extent practical, at least 90 percent of decisions are  made on applications for an initial personnel security clearance within 60  days, on average. IRTPA also requires the executive branch to provide a  report to Congress, by February 15 of each year, on the progress made  during the preceding year toward meeting IRTPA\u2019s requirements for  security clearances, including the length of time agencies take to complete  investigations and adjudications, a discussion of impediments to the  functioning of IRTPA\u2019s requirements, and any other information or  recommendations the executive branch considers appropriate.", "Multiple executive branch agencies are responsible for different phases in  the federal government\u2019s personnel security clearance process. With  respect to DOD\u2019s personnel security clearance process, DOD is  responsible for determining which military, DOD civilian, and private  industry personnel working on DOD contracts require access to classified  information and must apply for a security clearance and undergo an  investigation. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in turn,  conducts these investigations for DOD. OPM investigators\u2014often  contractors\u2014use federal investigative standards and OPM internal  guidance as criteria for collecting background information on applicants.  Federal guidelines require that DOD adjudicators use the information  contained in the resulting investigative reports to determine whether an  applicant is eligible for a personnel security clearance, and DOD  regulation also requires that DOD adjudicators document their rationale  for determining clearance eligibility. In June 2007, a Joint Reform Team\u2014 currently consisting of DOD, the Office of the Director of National  Intelligence (ODNI), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and  OPM\u2014was established, in part, to enable DOD and other agencies to  achieve IRTPA timeliness goals and improve the processes related to the  granting of security clearances. OMB officials have expressed concerns  about the ability of the government to meet the 2009 IRTPA timeliness  requirements. In June 2008, Executive Order 13467 established a  governmentwide governance structure, including a Performance  Accountability Council chaired by the Deputy Director for Management at  OMB that is responsible for driving the implementation and oversight of  these reform efforts.", "Under the authority of the Comptroller General to conduct evaluations on  his own initiative, and in the context of the Joint Reform Team\u2019s clearance  reform efforts and the issues we identified in our High-Risk Series, we  evaluated the security clearance process at DOD. Specifically, we  addressed the following questions regarding security clearances for  military, DOD civilian personnel, and private industry personnel working  on DOD contracts: (1) How complete are the timeliness data that the  executive branch reported for clearances granted in fiscal year 2008?   (2) How complete is the documentation of investigations and  adjudications for initial top secret security clearances favorably  adjudicated within DOD? (3) To what extent did executive branch  reporting to Congress from 2006 through 2009 on DOD and other federal  agencies include information on quality in the security clearance process?", "To determine the completeness of the timeliness data that the executive  branch reported for DOD clearances granted in fiscal year 2008, we  reviewed the requirements specified in IRTPA, conducted an independent  analysis of the timeliness of DOD personnel security clearances in fiscal  year 2008, and analyzed the timeliness data contained in the executive  branch\u2019s 2009 report to Congress on clearances granted in fiscal year 2008.  In our independent analysis, we measured the timeliness of nearly 450,000  initial clearances and more than 180,000 clearance renewals at the  confidential, secret, and top secret levels that were adjudicated in fiscal  year 2008. These nearly 630,000 clearances account for more than 93  percent of DOD personnel security clearances adjudicated in fiscal year  2008. We conducted electronic testing on the data we used in our  independent analysis and compared values in DOD\u2019s and OPM\u2019s electronic  databases with the data contained in the original clearance files. We found  that the data we used were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. To determine the completeness of both investigation and  adjudication documentation for initial top secret security clearances  favorably adjudicated within DOD, we independently and randomly  selected and reviewed a generalizable sample of 100 OPM-provided  investigative reports and associated DOD adjudicative files for clearances  granted to military, DOD civilian, and private industry personnel working  on DOD contracts in July 2008 by the central adjudication facilities of the  U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Air Force. We limited our focus to initial  top secret clearances because (1) we have identified documentation  problems with this clearance level in previous work; (2) investigators  gather the most information for investigations for top secret clearances;  and (3) individuals granted top secret clearances have access to  information that, if improperly disclosed, could cause exceptionally grave  damage to national security. Using a standardized instrument, we  compared the documentation in the OPM-provided investigative reports  with the requirements outlined in federal investigative standards and OPM  internal guidance. Similarly, we used a standardized instrument to  compare the documentation in the DOD adjudicative files with federal  adjudicative guidelines and DOD regulation. Based on the results of this  review, we developed statistical estimates for about 3,500 clearances  granted in July 2008 by these central adjudication facilities. We also  interviewed key OPM officials at the Federal Investigative Services  Division and spoke separately with a random sample of OPM federal and  contract investigators. In addition, we interviewed key leadership officials  and DOD adjudicators at DOD\u2019s three central adjudication facilities. To  assess the extent to which the executive branch\u2019s reporting to Congress on  DOD and other federal agencies included information on quality in the  security clearance process, we analyzed annual reports to Congress on  personnel security clearances submitted between 2006 and 2009.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2008 through May 2009  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

DOD\u2019s Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Intelligence has responsibility for developing and overseeing  DOD\u2019s process for determining eligibility for clearances for military and  DOD civilian personnel and private industry personnel working on DOD  contracts. That process includes obtaining background investigations,  primarily through OPM\u2019s Federal Investigative Services Division. Figure 1  shows the progression of the six phases involved in determining whether  to grant an applicant a clearance.", "If, during the requirements setting phase, DOD determines that a position  requires a clearance, in the application submission phase a security officer  (1) requests an investigation of the individual filling that position;   (2) forwards a personnel security questionnaire (standard form 86) using  OPM\u2019s Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP)  system or a paper copy of the standard form 86 to the individual to  complete; (3) reviews the completed questionnaire; and (4) sends the  questionnaire and supporting documentation, such as fingerprints, to  OPM. After the application is submitted, DOD security officers often grant  interim clearances to the applicants to enable them to access classified  information while awaiting the completion of the clearance process. DOD  grants interim clearances on a more limited evaluation on the basis of  electronic checks of national records, credit checks, and checks of current  personnel and security records at applicants\u2019 current duty stations.", "In the investigation phase, OPM or one of its contractors uses federal  investigative standards and OPM\u2019s internal guidance to conduct and  document the investigation of the applicant. The scope of information  gathered in an investigation depends on the level of clearance needed and  whether an investigation for an initial clearance or a reinvestigation for a  clearance renewal is being conducted. For example, the federal standards  require that investigators collect information from national agencies such  as the Federal Bureau of Investigation for all initial and renewal  clearances. However, the federal standards require investigators to  corroborate education and interview educational sources, as appropriate,  only in investigations supporting top secret initial clearances. In appendix  II, we list the information required for each clearance level and for initial  and renewal clearances. OPM\u2019s internal guidance includes both OPM\u2019s  product table and the July 2007 investigator\u2019s handbook. The product table  lists the investigative items OPM will include based on the type of  clearance investigation to be conducted, and the handbook outlines the  policies, procedures, and guidance to which all persons performing  investigative work under the authority of OPM must adhere.", "For an investigation for a confidential or secret clearance, investigators  gather much of the information electronically. For an investigation for a  top secret clearance, investigators gather additional information through  more time-consuming efforts such as traveling to conduct in-person  interviews to corroborate information about an applicant\u2019s employment  and education. In 2009, OPM estimated that approximately 6-10 labor  hours were needed for each investigation for a secret or confidential  clearance and 50-60 labor hours were needed for the investigation for an  initial top secret clearance. After the investigation is complete, OPM  provides the resulting investigative report to the appropriate DOD  adjudication facility.", "In the adjudication phase, DOD adjudicators at one of DOD\u2019s central  adjudication facilities use the information from the investigative report to  determine whether an applicant is eligible for a security clearance. To  make clearance eligibility decisions, federal requirements specify that  adjudicators consider guidelines in 13 specific areas that elicit information  about (1) conduct that could raise security concerns and (2) factors that  could allay those security concerns, even when serious, and permit  granting a clearance. For example, under the foreign influence guideline,  a connection to a foreign person or government is a condition that could  raise a security concern. One factor that could allay this security concern  is if the connection to a foreign person or government is established while  the applicant conducted business on behalf of the U.S. government. These  guidelines are listed in appendix III. Once adjudicators render the decision  to approve, deny, or revoke eligibility for a security clearance,  adjudicators are required by DOD regulation to document the rationale  behind the decision in DOD\u2019s Joint Personnel Adjudication System.  Typically, adjudicators notify the applicant\u2019s employer of the decision.", "The final clearance renewal phase takes place for individuals who have  been previously granted and already hold a clearance. Renewals for  holders of confidential and secret clearances take place every 15 and 10  years, respectively, and renewals for top secret clearances take place  every 5 years. To grant a renewal clearance, OPM or one of its contractors  conducts and documents a reinvestigation of the clearance holder, which  also is based on federal investigative standards and OPM\u2019s internal  guidance. DOD adjudicators then use the same decision-making processes  to determine whether a clearance holder is eligible for a clearance renewal  using the adjudicative guidelines.", "DOD adjudication facilities and their appeal boards are authorized to  grant, deny, or revoke security clearance eligibility. Individuals who are  denied a clearance or have their clearance eligibility revoked may appeal  these decisions to the relevant Personnel Security Appeals Board. The  appeals process may involve any individual or organization that could  provide information relevant to an applicant\u2019s security clearance decision  (e.g., adjudication facilities, employer, and investigative agency).

In addition, we examined the percentage of initial clearances  that took more than 300 days and 120 days to complete, respectively.

When an applicant\u2019s investigation has a potential security concern, the  regulation requires that a record of the rationale underlying the decision  be kept in the adjudicative file. According to DOD officials, this record of  rationale should include identification of the applicable adjudicative  guidelines\u2014criteria covering 13 areas of security concerns used to  determine an applicant\u2019s clearance eligibility\u2014and the associated  mitigating factors. In our analysis, we did not evaluate the merit of the  DOD adjudicators\u2019 decisions to grant clearances. Instead, we assessed  only whether the documentation for each required rationale was complete.  DOD adjudicative files were most often missing documentation for  adjudicative guidelines in instances in which the applicants had foreign  influence, financial considerations, and criminal conduct security  concerns, as shown in figure 4.", "The following examples from our analysis illustrate our findings.  Adjudicators must take into account 13 federal adjudicative guidelines  when assessing whether investigative reports contain evidence of potential  security concerns.

However, these three individuals provided  differing information regarding the woman\u2019s nationality. Although the  adjudicative file documented foreign influence as a security concern, the  documentation in the file erroneously cited information not present in the  investigative report as the mitigating factor for the security concern.  Additionally, while the investigation documentation indicated that half of  the applicant\u2019s accounts were in collection status, the required  consideration of the financial guideline was not documented.", "Consideration of the personal conduct guideline was missing.

We also obtained investigators\u2019 viewpoints about the investigative process  by surveying them about the manageability of their workload, adequacy of  their training, the clarity of policy guidance, the manner of conducting  investigations, and the frequency with which their investigations were  returned for additional work.

OPM\u2019s comments on this topic and our responses follow.", "OPM stated that the executive branch report to Congress was tailored to  address the timeliness requirements of IRTPA. IRTPA currently requires  that 80 percent of initial clearance decisions are to be made within 120  days, on average. We agree that it is important to report statistics that aid  congressional decision makers in assessing whether DOD and OPM are  meeting the current requirements of IRTPA. However, in its 2009 report,  the executive branch did not provide data to address IRTPA\u2019s current  requirement. Instead, it reported an average of the time to complete the  fastest 90 percent of initial clearances.", "OPM stated that the goal for national performance of clearance timeliness  was established for the average timeliness of the fastest 80 percent of  clearances. However, IRTPA does not specify that the fastest 80 percent of  clearances be completed within an average of 120 days, only that 80  percent be completed under such time requirements. In its 2009 report, the  executive branch chose to report an average of the fastest clearances in its  reports, excluding the slowest percentage of clearances and averaging  what remained. While this may be a reasonable approach, we continue to  believe that by not including additional data on the full range of time to  make clearance decisions, the executive branch\u2019s report was not fully  transparent about the extent of any remaining delays in the process.", "OPM commented that the framers of IRTPA specified that up to 20 percent  of clearances, until December 2009, and up to 10 percent of clearances  thereafter would not be subject to the statute\u2019s timeliness and reporting  requirements. While we agree that OPM\u2019s comment correctly summarizes  IRTPA\u2019s timeliness requirements, we disagree with OPM\u2019s characterization  of IRTPA\u2019s reporting requirements. In fact, IRTPA does not specify that 20  or 10 percent of clearances are not subject to the act\u2019s reporting  requirements. Instead, IRTPA requires that each report the executive  branch provides to Congress include the periods of time required by the  authorized investigative agencies and authorized adjudicative agencies for  conducting investigations, adjudicating cases, and granting clearances.", "OPM also stated that delays for the 10 to 20 percent of cases that are not  reported are typically due to the presence of serious issues that require  further, extensive investigation or the absence of a required third party  record. While this may be the case, it is not possible to assess this  assertion based on the information contained in the annual IRTPA- required report to Congress. The report does not contain information  about the reasons for the delays in the clearances that were excluded from  the statistics presented in the report because the report did not present  information on the full range of time to complete all initial clearances in  the annual IRTPA-required report.", "OPM also stated that it periodically collects additional data on the  clearance process that it reports to Congress. We are aware that OPM  periodically collects and reports data on the clearance process. However,  the reports that OPM has shared with us contain the same limitation in the  presentation of clearance timeliness information that are found in the  executive branch\u2019s annual IRTPA-required report. For example, in its  National Oversight Report, OPM includes an average of the end-to-end  time to complete 100 percent of DOD clearances. However, by relying on  an average and not including additional, more comprehensive analysis that  describes the full range of the time required to complete all initial  clearances such as the analysis we included in our finding on this topic,  this report also does not provide full visibility over clearance timeliness.  In addition, OPM commented that it would not be accurate to assert that it  has limited visibility over the security clearance and investigation process  because it periodically collects data on the clearance process that it  reports to Congress. We did not comment on OPM\u2019s visibility over the  clearance or investigation process in this, or any other, finding. Instead,  we indicated that the executive branch\u2019s 2009 IRTPA-required report to  Congress did not provide congressional decision makers with full visibility  of clearance timeliness because the report did not include additional data  on the full range of time to make all initial clearance decisions. As we  state, the result of this approach is that the report limits congressional  decision makers\u2019 ability to thoroughly evaluate, and identify with  precision, where and why delays continue to exist within DOD\u2019s personnel  security clearance process. As a result, we continue to believe that our  recommendation that OMB include appropriate statistics that describe the  full range of the time required to complete all initial clearances in the  executive branch\u2019s IRTPA-required annual reports has merit.", "Our second finding addressed the lack of complete documentation in  OPM\u2019s investigative reports and DOD\u2019s adjudicative files. We  recommended that OPM measure the frequency with which its  investigative reports meet federal investigative standards and that DOD  measure the frequency with which its adjudicative files meet DOD  regulation. As we previously stated, DOD concurred with our  recommendations to it based on this finding. OPM, while not stating  whether it agreed with our recommendation to it, did raise several  concerns. Specifically, OPM\u2019s response focused on the methodology we  used to assess the completeness of documentation in its investigative  reports. OPM\u2019s comments on our methodology and resulting findings and  our responses follow.", "OPM stated that, under established procedures, investigators often make  decisions on the appropriate sources of information needed to attest to an  applicant\u2019s activities, character, and conduct when sources of information  specified in the federal investigative standards are uncooperative or  otherwise unavailable. Further, OPM asserted that our methodology did  not appear to take into account the judgment OPM\u2019s investigators exercise  or the availability of sources of information and cited, as an example, that  in three of the investigative reports we shared with OPM, the applicants  were unavailable because they were on a military deployment. We  disagree with OPM\u2019s assertion. As we explain in our report, we categorized  an investigative item as incomplete if the investigative report did not  contain the required documentation as prescribed in the federal  investigative standards and OPM\u2019s internal guidance. We also explained  that, to the extent possible, we counted an item as complete if the report  included documentation of an investigator\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to  gather the required information. Further, we stated in our report that the  most notable exception to this approach related to documentation of  interviews of the applicant because as OPM officials told us the applicant  is a key source of information. Also, the interview with the applicant  cannot be replaced by another information source. Therefore, as we  describe in our report, we counted the interview investigative item as  incomplete even though unsuccessful attempts to interview the applicant  may have been documented. However, we included in our report an  explanation that the missing interviews in the investigative reports we  reviewed were the result of the applicants\u2019 deployment.", "OPM stated that we did not make evaluative judgments about the  importance of one missing investigative item over another even though  investigators and adjudicators routinely make such judgments. We agree  that, as we disclosed in our report, we did not make evaluative judgments  during our review because the federal investigative standards do not  assign a level of importance to each investigative requirement.", "OPM stated that in its review of our analysis of eight of the investigative  reports we shared with its staff, it did not fully agree with our assessment  of what we identified as missing documentation. OPM also stated its  ability to respond to our assessment on documentation completeness was  greatly limited since we did not provide all of the investigative reports  where we found incomplete documentation to OPM officials so that they  could review our work and provide an accompanying explanation. Finally,  OPM asserted that its review of the limited sample provided casts doubt  on our findings. It is true that OPM officials did not fully agree with our  assessment of documentation completeness, but OPM officials did  acknowledge that some required documentation was in fact missing in  each of the eight reports we voluntarily shared in order to strengthen our  methodology, as we explained in our report. After the OPM officials\u2019  review, we incorporated their feedback into our methodology and  adjusted some of our findings, which were reflected in the results we  presented in our draft report. We intentionally shared a subset of the  investigative reports, and the results of our analysis of those reports with  OPM to validate our findings. We also internally conducted a separate and  independent second review of a subset of the 100 investigative reports we  analyzed by comparing information in the investigative reports against the  federal investigative standards. To be as transparent as possible, we  shared our methodology with OPM throughout its development and while  implementing our data collection. Specifically, when we developed an  instrument to measure documentation of the completeness of OPM\u2019s  investigative reports, we shared this instrument with OPM officials, among  others, and refined it by integrating their feedback. Additionally, we  received and incorporated clarification from OPM on our instrument on an  ongoing basis while we used the instrument to collect data. We believe our  collaboration with OPM during our data collection, combined with the fact  that OPM officials did agree that some documentation was missing in all of  the reports we shared with them, should negate any doubts OPM has  about our findings.", "OPM stated the current federal investigative standards recognize that  information about an applicant may be obtained through alternative  information sources and provides for departing from the standards when  necessary. We disagree with OPM\u2019s characterization of the investigative  standards. When we reviewed the current federal investigative standards,  we found no provision for such deviations from the requirements. Rather,  the standards permit agencies to use lawful investigative procedures in  addition to the requirements to expand investigations and resolve issues,  as necessary.", "OPM stated that, on the one hand, it is possible to meet all of the  documentation requirements specified by federal investigative standards  and guidelines yet still have an investigation that is not sufficiently  thorough, while on the other hand, have a thorough investigation in which  required documentation of a single neighborhood or employment  reference could be incomplete. OPM officials made a similar point to us  during the course of our work, and we included this statement in our  report. However, we also reported that DOD adjudicators told us that at  times they perform limited investigative work to fill the gaps in  information they have received in OPM-provided investigative reports to  comply with investigative standards. This investigative work then  increased the amount of time and labor costs required to make an  adjudicative determination. As we explained in our report, basing  clearance decisions on incomplete documentation that has not fully  adhered to federal investigative standards may reduce the assurance that  appropriate safeguards are in place to prevent DOD from granting  clearances to untrustworthy individuals.", "OPM stated that procedures are being developed to better focus  investigative resources on the most productive sources of information for  each applicant and that the end result of this work will be a more effective  and efficient investigative process that ensures quality and promotes  reciprocity. While we are encouraged by OPM\u2019s planned actions, we were  unable to assess these efforts as they are still under development.", "Our third finding addressed the lack of discussion of quality in the  clearance process in IRTPA-required annual reports to Congress, and  OMB, to whom our recommendation was addressed, concurred with our  recommendation and emphasized the importance of providing Congress  with more transparency about quality in the process. OPM also provided  comments on this finding, stating that the quality of the investigative and  adjudicative processes is the most critical performance expectation for  OPM and the clearance-granting agencies. OPM further stated that,  because much of the information used in the clearance process is  subjective, it is challenging to measure quality, although it also identified  five quality metrics that it stated are a focus of the agency. However, none  of the metrics OPM cited were included in any of the IRTPA-required  reports the executive branch has provided to Congress since 2006. As we  stated in our report, the executive branch\u2019s previous IRTPA-required  reports have contained limited information on quality. As a result, the  executive branch has missed opportunities to provide congressional  decision makers with full transparency over the clearance process. OPM  indicated in its comments that additional quality metrics are being  developed and that it is testing a quality review form that gives agencies  the ability to report problems with an investigation to OPM. OPM further  stated that information collected from this form will be included in quality  information reported to Congress. We believe these are positive steps and,  if implemented, would help address concerns we described in this finding.  OPM\u2019s comments on our findings on executive branch reporting of  clearance quality and our responses follow.", "OPM cited, as an example of its attention to quality, a metric it referred to  as the content sufficiency to support suitability actions. In its description  of this metric, OPM stated that the metric indicates whether the  information collected supports an unfavorable federal employment  suitability determination that is formally appealed. Suitability  investigations are used to determine whether individuals are eligible for  federal employment. OPM did not specify how this metric would pertain to  the quality of investigations to support granting personnel security  clearances.  In discussing plans for future quality metrics that the executive branch  proposed in its 2009 IRTPA-required report to Congress, OPM stated that  we expressed concerns about these new metrics before they were tested  and implemented. We expressed no concerns about new metrics proposed  in the executive branch\u2019s report. However, we did express concerns about  an existing metric discussed in the executive branch\u2019s report. This metric  refers to the frequency with which adjudicating agencies returned OPM\u2019s  investigative reports due to quality deficiencies. As we noted, we have  repeatedly reported since the late 1990s that this measure, by itself, is an  unreliable quality indicator because, in our previous work, adjudication  officials told us that they were reluctant to return incomplete investigative  reports because of their perception that returning the reports would result  in delays in the clearance process. While we conducted the work for this  report, both DOD adjudication leadership and adjudicators told us that  they continue to be reluctant to return incomplete investigative reports for  the same reason.", "OPM further stated that we based our concerns about the frequency with  which adjudicating agencies returned OPM\u2019s investigative reports due to  quality deficiencies on anecdotal information that agencies may not want  to return investigations to OPM because of their perception that this will  delay case processing. OPM further stated that it may be a mistake to  credit our concerns because OPM had improved clearance investigation  timeliness. OPM\u2019s characterization of the information in our report as  anecdotal is not accurate because we systematically collected key  testimonial evidence from knowledgeable officials at each of the central  adjudication facilities. These knowledgeable officials included leadership  and adjudicators in positions of knowledge about the clearance process.  As we reported, these key officials told us that they continue to be  reluctant to return incomplete investigative reports to OPM because they  anticipate delays in the process.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Director of the Office of  Management and Budget, the Secretary of Defense, and the Director of the  Office of Personnel Management.

We then linked the records from the DOD and OPM databases using the  unique case identification numbers assigned to each DOD clearance  record to develop the universe of clearances. We measured the timeliness  (from the date of the receipt of the completed application to the final  adjudication date) for nearly 450,000 initial and more than 180,000 renewal  confidential, secret, and top secret clearances adjudicated by the central  adjudication facilities of the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, and the  Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office. We assessed the reliability of  the data from DOD\u2019s and OPM\u2019s databases by comparing values in the  electronic databases to 100 randomly selected original clearance  investigative files we obtained from the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Air  Force central adjudication facilities for July 2008, reviewing existing  information about the data and the system that produced them, and  interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We  determined these data were sufficiently reliable for purposes of our audit.  We then used our timeliness analyses to assess the timeliness data in the  executive branch\u2019s 2009 IRTPA-required report.", "To determine the completeness of clearance documentation for initial top  secret security clearances adjudicated favorably within DOD, we  evaluated investigation and adjudication documentation for initial top  secret clearances for military, DOD civilian, and private industry personnel  working on DOD contracts. We focused on initial top secret clearances for  three reasons: (1) we have identified documentation problems with this  clearance level in previous work; (2) investigators gather the most  information for investigations for top secret clearances; and (3)  individuals with top secret clearances have access to information that, if  improperly disclosed, could cause exceptionally grave damage to national  security. We independently selected a stratified random probability sample  of 100 OPM investigative reports and associated DOD adjudicative files  from the population of 3,993 applications that were identified as  clearances that were favorably adjudicated in July 2008 by the central  adjudication facilities of the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Air Force.  With this sample, each clearance in the population had a known  probability of being selected. We stratified the population of clearances  into three groups by the adjudication facilities. Each clearance selected  was subsequently weighted in the analysis to account statistically for all  the clearances in the population. We estimated that the total number of  clearances DOD granted in July 2008 was 3,500 (+/-300). For this  population, we produced statistical estimates that have a margin of error  of plus or minus 10 percent or less at the 95 percent confidence level.", "For our analysis of investigative reports, we reviewed the criteria for  conducting and documenting investigations outlined in federal  investigative standards, OPM\u2019s product table, OPM\u2019s July 2007  investigator\u2019s handbook, and an analytical tool developed by DOD\u2019s  Defense Personnel Security Research Center. Based on this criteria  review, we developed an instrument to measure the completeness of  OPM\u2019s investigative reports, refined this instrument by integrating  feedback from staff at OPM\u2019s Federal Investigative Services Division and  DOD\u2019s Defense Personnel Security Research Center, and pretested this  instrument for 2 weeks at a DOD adjudication facility by having  adjudicators use this instrument to assess investigative reports they  reviewed during the course of their work. On an ongoing basis, we  received and incorporated clarification from OPM. For each investigative  report, we compared information in the report against OPM criteria. We  then conducted a separate and independent review of a subset of the  sample. Voluntarily and to strengthen our methodological approach, we  shared the results of the completed reviews for eight investigative reports  with experts from OPM\u2019s Federal Investigative Services Division\u2019s Quality  Management and Training Group, which conducts quality reviews of  investigative reports, and we incorporated their feedback into our  methodology and adjusted some of our findings.", "For our analysis of adjudication documentation, we reviewed the criteria  for conducting and documenting adjudications outlined in federal  adjudicative guidelines, DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, DOD Personnel  Security Program, and an analytical tool developed by DOD\u2019s Defense  Personnel Security Research Center. Based on this review, we developed a  separate instrument to measure the completeness of DOD\u2019s adjudicative  files and refined this instrument by integrating feedback from staff at  DOD\u2019s Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and  Defense Personnel Security Research Center. For each adjudicative file,  two experienced and trained adjudicators, who adjudicate GAO  clearances, compared the information in the file against DOD criteria. The  GAO adjudicators then conducted an independent review of a subset of  the adjudicative file sample. We also shared our observations for eight  adjudicative files with DOD adjudication facility leadership and 10 DOD  adjudicators with varying levels of professional experience and made  necessary adjustments based on their feedback.", "To assess the extent to which the executive branch included information  on quality in the security clearance process in its 2006-09 reports on  security clearances for DOD and other federal agencies, we analyzed the  reporting requirements contained in IRTPA. Additionally, we reviewed  previously issued GAO clearance-related reports and testimonies that  identified quality measures and their potential utility. Finally, we evaluated  the information presented in the executive branch\u2019s annual IRTPA- required reports issued to Congress in 2006 through 2009.", "Throughout this review, we interviewed executive branch officials and  contractors about the clearance process, evaluated additional policies and  reports they provided to us, and discussed with them factors that  contributed to incomplete clearance documentation. The executive branch  organizations and groups are listed in table 2.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2008 through May 2009  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The scope of information gathered in an investigation depends  on what level of clearance is needed and whether an investigation for an  initial clearance or a reinvestigation for a clearance renewal is being  conducted. For example, the federal investigative standards require that  investigators collect information from national agencies such as the  Federal Bureau of Investigation for all initial and renewal clearances.  However, the standards require investigators to corroborate education by  interviewing sources, as appropriate, only in investigations supporting top  secret initial clearances.

To make clearance eligibility decisions, federal and  DOD requirements specify that adjudicators consider federal adjudicative  guidelines in 13 specific areas that elicit information about (1) conduct  that could raise security concerns and (2) factors that could allay those  security concerns, even when serious, and permit granting a clearance.  For example, under the foreign influence guideline, a connection to a  foreign person or government is a condition that could raise a security  concern. One factor that could allay this security concern is if the  connection to a foreign person or government is established while the  applicant conducted business on behalf of the U.S. government. Following  are the 13 specific areas of the federal adjudicative guidelines:  (1) allegiance to the United States;  (2) foreign influence, such as having a family member who is a citizen of a  foreign country;  (3) foreign preference, such as performing military service for a foreign  country;  (4) sexual behavior;  (5) personal conduct, such as deliberately concealing or falsifying relevant  facts when completing a security questionnaire;  (6) financial considerations;  (7) alcohol consumption;  (8) drug involvement;  (9) psychological conditions, such as emotional, mental, and personality  disorders;  (10) criminal conduct;  (11) security violations, such as deliberate or negligent disclosure of  classified information;  (12) outside activities, such as providing service to or being employed by a  foreign country; and  (13) misuse of information technology systems, such as unauthorized use  of an information technology system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Office of Personnel Management", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Key contributors to this report were David E.
