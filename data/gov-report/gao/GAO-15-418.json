Research shows that the power dynamic between coaches and athletes aiming for high performance makes those athletes uniquely vulnerable to abuse. Although states are primarily responsible for addressing abuse, federal laws may apply, such as those that prohibit sex discrimination, including sexual abuse, in federally-funded education programs, require reports of campus crimes, and set minimum standards for state child abuse reporting laws. GAO was asked to review efforts to prevent and respond to the sexual abuse of youth athletes under age 18.", "GAO examined (1) the role of federal agencies in preventing and responding to sexual abuse of youth athletes, and (2) steps selected athletic programs aimed at high performance take to prevent and respond to such abuse. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, guidance, and literature; visited a nongeneralizable sample of 11 athletic programs in three states selected on factors including sport popularity, gender participation, and geographic diversity; and interviewed federal agencies, relevant associations, and experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Several federal agencies have roles in preventing and responding to the sexual abuse of a broad population of youth under age 18, which may include youth athletes. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a nonprofit organization that receives Department of Justice (Justice) funding, published suggested practices for preventing child sexual abuse in youth-serving organizations. These suggested practices include defining and prohibiting misconduct; screening staff using fingerprint-based criminal background checks and other tools; and training staff on how to recognize, report, and respond to abuse. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children also makes available information on child protection policies in youth sports settings, such as defining appropriate coach-athlete relationships. In addition, Justice may investigate alleged youth athlete abuse if there is a possibility the case constitutes a federal crime. These efforts may apply to youth in a range of settings. In addition, the Departments of Education (Education) and Justice oversee compliance with a civil rights law that protects individuals from sex discrimination, including sexual abuse, at schools that receive federal funding, which would generally include youth participating in sports camps on university campuses. Education also oversees postsecondary school compliance with a federal law requiring reporting of crimes, including sex offenses, that occur on or near campus. To ensure schools are meeting their obligations under these laws, Education and Justice conduct compliance reviews and investigations, and Justice participates in federal litigation involving claims of sex discrimination. Education also provides guidance and training to schools in areas such as developing codes of conduct, offering prevention and awareness training, and establishing reporting procedures.", "The 11 athletic programs GAO reviewed all reported using methods, such as screening and training staff, to help prevent and respond to the sexual abuse of youth athletes. For example, the selected athletic programs, which included 8 private athletic clubs and 3 universities operating youth sports camps, all reported using name-based background checks to screen staff members for a criminal history. Two universities that operated sports camps reported they sometimes used fingerprint-based checks, while officials from other athletic programs cited the high cost of fingerprint checks as a barrier. Training for athletic staff in the programs GAO visited included how to identify signs of, respond to, and report suspected incidents of sexual abuse. Policies for all of these athletic programs also require staff to report suspected abuse to law enforcement. Further, the selected programs had response policies that generally included removing the suspected offender from the program and conducting their own investigations, which could result in lifetime bans from the program. Athletic programs' policies also included a variety of possible disciplinary actions, such as warning letters or required leave, for addressing inappropriate behavior that falls short of sexual abuse. Some of these policies have been created or revised in recent years, including the policies that private athletic clubs are implementing based on the United States Olympic Committee's athlete safety program, SafeSport, which prohibits various forms of misconduct, including child sexual abuse. GAO did not assess the effectiveness of any of the selected athletic programs' policies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes no recommendations in this report.

In many cases, youth athletes have  positive interactions with their coaches and gain important leadership  skills and self-confidence through their participation in sports. However,  reports of sexual abuse, misconduct, and inappropriate relationships  between coaches and athletes have occurred across a variety of sports,  gender interactions, and settings, with some resulting in convictions of  coaches of one or more sexual offenses. As research has shown, child  sexual abuse often has significant detrimental consequences to children\u2019s  physical, psychological, academic, and behavioral development.", "Little is known about the prevalence of sexual abuse of youth athletes in  the United States However, research has highlighted the specific ways in  which athletes have been \u201cgroomed\u201d by coaches\u2014a set of behaviors that  perpetrators carry out to establish trust and later facilitate sexual activity  with a child. Research also indicates that the power dynamics between  coaches and athletes aiming for high performance make those athletes  uniquely vulnerable to abuse due, in part, to the high risk, high reward  environment in which they compete and the position of power held by  coaches who play critical roles in ensuring their success. Among the  different settings where such incidents can occur are youth sports camps  held on college and university campuses and private athletic clubs  targeting high athletic performance, such as Olympic-level training clubs  for athletes who display competitive excellence in their sport.", "States have the primary role in ensuring the safety of their citizens;  however, federal law establishes minimum standards for state mandatory  reporting laws regarding suspected child abuse and neglect, including  sexual abuse. Athletic programs must comply with any applicable state  requirements regarding mandatory reporting, which can vary from state to  state, and programs may be subject to other requirements, depending on  their setting. For example, postsecondary schools are required to comply  with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX), which  prohibits sex discrimination, including sexual harassment and abuse, in  federally-funded education programs and activities, and the Jeanne  Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics  Act (Clery Act), which requires postsecondary schools that receive federal  student aid funding to report certain crimes that occur on and around their  campuses.

What steps do selected athletic programs take to prevent and respond  to the sexual abuse of youth athletes?", "To perform this work, we used a variety of approaches. To understand  what role federal agencies play in preventing and responding to the  sexual abuse of youth athletes under age 18, we reviewed relevant  federal laws and regulations as well as relevant agency documents, such  as guidance and procedures for conducting compliance reviews. We  interviewed officials from the Departments of Education (Education),  Health and Human Services (HHS), and Justice (Justice).

We also  reviewed relevant literature from these groups. To gather information on  how selected athletic programs address the sexual abuse of youth  athletes, we conducted site visits to a nongeneralizable sample of athletic  programs in three states\u2014California, Florida, and Texas. We  interviewed representatives of and reviewed documentation for a total of  11 athletic programs, which included 3 universities that operate youth  sports camps and 8 local private athletic clubs. States and athletic  programs were selected based on criteria including popularity of sport  among youth, college rankings in selected sports, gender participation,  and geographic diversity. We gathered information about the relevant  policies and procedures selected athletic programs have designed for  screening staff and volunteers, education and awareness training,  monitoring and supervision, reporting of complaints, responding to  complaints, and imposing sanctions. We also reviewed training  materials on the subject of youth protection.

Currently, the USOC recognizes 47 NGBs. The act  sets forth a number of purposes for the USOC, including to exercise  jurisdiction over U.S. participation in the Olympic Games and the  organization of the Olympic Games when held in the United States. Other  purposes include to provide swift resolution of conflicts and disputes  involving athletes and NGBs; to coordinate and provide information on  training, coaching, and performance; and to encourage and support  research, development, and dissemination of information in the areas of  sports medicine and sports safety.

The program was born out of a working group convened by  the USOC in 2010 to develop a set of recommendations for promoting  safe training environments in sports. To deliver its recommendations, the  working group sought input from a range of stakeholders. The  subsequent creation of the SafeSport program included one-on-one  discussions and a review of relevant research and best practice  documents, including a resource document on child sexual abuse  prevention from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  within HHS.

For example, NCMEC\u2019s resource provides references to sexual  abuse prevention and response programs, online training available  through selected athletic organizations, and an article on developing  appropriate relationships between coaches and athletes. NCMEC\u2019s  resource also offers youth-serving organizations some considerations  regarding background checks to screen applicants. NCMEC suggests  organizations use name-based and fingerprint-based criminal history  checks in addition to other screening tools, such as interviews and  reference checks. According to NCMEC, name-based checks typically  offer greater accessibility and more timely results. However, based on a  federal pilot program through which NCMEC assisted certain youth- serving organizations in conducting nationwide fingerprint-based criminal  history checks, NCMEC officials concluded fingerprint-based checks were  the most reliable way to identify those with disqualifying criminal histories  in other states, under a different name, or under a different date of birth.", "Further, they concluded that fingerprint checks provide the greatest  potential in confirming an individual\u2019s identity.", "HHS and Justice also provide funding for sexual violence awareness and  prevention programs. Although these efforts do not focus on athletic  programs, funding has been used in some instances to address sexual  abuse in athletics. For example, an official from the Pennsylvania  Coalition against Rape told us that the organization, in part using funding  from the CDC\u2019s Rape Prevention and Education Program, has  partnered with Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) to help the  university strengthen its sexual abuse prevention and response activities  in response to high-profile incidents of sexual abuse involving youth  athletes on campus.

For example, if a youth athlete is transported across state  lines and sexually abused by a coach or other athletic personnel, the FBI  may investigate the incident for possible violations of federal law. As  researchers and experts on athlete abuse have noted, travel can be an  area of significant risk for sexual abuse and misconduct, particularly if  coaches travel alone with or share hotel rooms with athletes. FBI officials  told us they are alerted to these crimes through various means, including  direct reports from victims and families, witnesses, state and local law  enforcement agencies, university and youth group officials, mandatory  reporters, such as medical professionals and legal practitioners, and  other federal law enforcement partner agencies. The FBI relies on a  network of 71 Child Exploitation Task Forces that partner with 400 state  and local law enforcement entities to help bridge federal, state, and local  resources to address the challenges of child exploitation investigations,  which may include those involving youth athletes.

Officials from  each of the eight private clubs explained that in response to the recent  creation of SafeSport policies by the USOC and their NGB, clubs either  defer to their NGB\u2019s policies or look to their NGB or regional affiliates for  implementation guidance. For example, NGB SafeSport guidelines detail  a variety of behavioral boundaries, prohibitions, and expectations for  coach-athlete relationships, covering topics such as physical contact and  social media use, among others. The SafeSport policies of all three NGBs  whose officials we met with also provide guidelines local clubs may want  to consider to ensure their SafeSport policies reflect and account for the  particular setting of the club and facility. For example:", "One NGB\u2019s social media guidance prohibits coaches from connecting  to any athletes through a personal social media page or application,  and suggests that any contact via social media should only take place  through an official team page that parents are able to join.", "An official at one local hockey club we met with told us their policy is  to lock all locker room doors when youth players are on the ice. In  addition, this official explained that youth and adult hockey players  sometimes use the locker rooms simultaneously at the club\u2019s facility,  and when this occurs, the club has two individuals serve as monitors  in the locker room, one more than their NGB recommends.", "Policies of the three selected universities that operate sports camps also  addressed issues of child protection, with some reflecting changes made  to enhance youth safety in light of sexual abuse incidents at Penn State  University. They covered practices to prevent sexual misconduct and  monitoring and supervision of campers, among other topics. For example:", "One university swim camp developed a code of conduct for its staff  that states any inappropriate interaction or relationship with a camper  will result in immediate termination and, depending on the  circumstance, notification of law enforcement authorities.", "Officials at all three universities we visited stressed the importance of  preventing one-on-one interactions between staff and campers  through a practice known as two-deep leadership, as a way to limit  opportunities for misconduct. For example, in one camp\u2019s counselor  handbook, private one-on-one interactions were listed as a violation.", "One university recently changed its policies on access to campus  facilities following a report evaluating another university\u2019s response to  a high profile case of sexual abuse of youth athletes on its campus.  Using the report\u2019s recommendations as a benchmark against its own  policies, the university we visited changed access to its facilities so  that electronic keycards previously used to enter a building would be  deactivated once an individual no longer needed access.", "Over the last 2 years, another university created an office focused on  youth on campus. This office developed a central registration system  to maintain information about all university camps. In addition, they  created a system of spot checks in which staff from this office conduct  in-person visits to camps to ensure staff-to-camper ratios are followed  and those present at the camp are on the central registration list,  among other safety measures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Training", "paragraphs": ["All 11 of the youth athletic programs included in our study had policies  requiring training of staff on youth athlete safety.

Child sexual abuse prevention was a topic included in the required  training for the selected athletic programs, and training generally covered  topics such as how to identify the warning signs of, respond to, and report  suspected abuse, including sexual abuse involving an athlete and athletic  personnel. (See table 3.) All of the athletic programs we reviewed offered  online training, and one program also offered training led by an instructor.  Training is generally required at least every other year, and participants  must complete one or more quizzes before receiving credit for completing  the course.", "Some athletic programs we visited offer child sexual abuse prevention  training and education resources to parents and athletes, though none  require training of these groups. Further, officials from both types of  athletic programs cited some challenges in implementing mandatory  parent and athlete training. For example, officials from the eight private  athletic clubs said they cannot require parents to take the training unless  they are members of the NGB of their sport.", "One NGB official noted that some Canadian provinces require parents  to take child abuse prevention training before their child can  participate in athletic programs, but he believed that policy would be  unlikely to be accepted in American sports. An official from the  organization that spearheaded the effort to require training explained  that it took the Canadian sports community years to embrace child  sexual abuse prevention training. He told us that while organizations  had background checks and other policies in place, education on the  need for such policies and a greater understanding of the issue of  abuse was also necessary. He explained that, in his view,  perpetrators of sexual abuse are able to operate, in part, because of  ignorance and indifference in the community. Eventually, through a  survey, the organization found that the Canadian sports community  supported the training and considered it a good recruitment and  retention tool.", "Another NGB official told us that in its commissioned report to assess  its SafeSport program against abuse prevention and response  standards, parent training was cited as a weak area that needed  improvement. Specifically, the author of the report recommended  the NGB require parents to take SafeSport training, noting that few  parents discuss sexual abuse prevention with their children and those  who do often give inaccurate information. In response, the task force  charged with addressing the report\u2019s recommendations suggested the  NGB strongly recommend parents take the training and encourage  participation through an incentive program that would tie parent  training on SafeSport with clubs\u2019 SafeSport recognition status and  funding. Regarding athlete training, this NGB\u2019s task force  recommended that its SafeSport committee and staff work with the  training vendor to develop material appropriate for parents to use to  discuss abuse prevention with children under age 12.", "At one university we visited, officials cited the short duration of camp  programs, which generally last between 4 days and 1 week, as a barrier  to expanding training to both parents and campers. Officials told us that  camps do provide parents with general safety information such as  emergency contact numbers and, in the case of one university camp, an  overview of hiring practices. However, as one campus official explained,  information on the Clery Act, sexual abuse prevention, or requirements to  report is not currently provided to camp parents, although the university\u2019s  Clery statistics are available online."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Monitoring for Compliance with Policies", "paragraphs": ["Athletic programs we visited developed some internal practices and  policies to monitor compliance with athlete safety policies.

In addition, one official explained that  the NGB she represents is considering a recommendation made in the  report that assessed its SafeSport program to conduct a baseline study to  determine the extent of child abuse and the effectiveness of various  prevention and response policies.", "University staff responsible for overseeing youth on campus also help  monitor camp operations, according to officials from the universities we  visited. For example, officials at one university we visited told us they  developed a central registration system that tracked all of its camps, and  included information on the program name, schedules, and the staff and  athletes to assist with monitoring. This tracking system allows campus  officials to identify who works with each camper, making it easier to  investigate allegations of inappropriate interactions between staff and  campers, according to one campus security official at the university.  University officials also explained that staff overseeing youth programs on  campus will periodically observe athlete interactions with camp staff to  ensure that child protection policies, such as never having a camper  alone with one adult, are being followed. An official from another  university told us that while the coaches are in charge of day-to-day  operations of the camps, the administrative oversight duties are primarily  handled centrally by the university\u2019s camp coordinator and human  resources. For the more heavily enrolled sports, coaches have the  support of the university\u2019s director of operations who assists with the  administration of the camp.", "An official from one private athletic club also explained how the wider  sports community can help alert them to potential problems with  interactions between athletic personnel or other adults and youth athletes.  For example, the official told us a parent notified the head coach that a  registered sex offender, who had inadvertently been let into the building,  was observing youth hockey practice.

According to athletic program officials we spoke with, their programs\u2019  policies reflected their state\u2019s requirements for reporting child sexual  abuse, including how to report, which child welfare or law enforcement  agencies are designated to receive reports, and who is responsible for  reporting. In some cases, officials at universities we visited told us they  changed policies to reflect recent changes in state law that address child  abuse, including sexual abuse. Additionally, athletic programs may  choose to designate additional staff as mandatory reporters beyond those  persons designated by state child abuse and neglect reporting laws. For  example, officials from one university we visited told us the university  decided to designate all staff on campus as mandatory reporters of child  abuse and neglect after their state identified university administrators as  mandatory reporters. University officials explained that while designating  all staff as mandatory reporters could lead to over-reporting of the same  issues, it would be better than incidents not being reported.", "In addition to contacting the appropriate law enforcement authorities, the  policies for each of the programs we visited included reporting observed  or suspected abuse to internal officials. The policies of local private  athletic clubs we visited provided options for reporting incidents to the  club or regional affiliate\u2019s SafeSport staff or NGB by phone, email, or  letter, or anonymously through an online reporting system.

Policies also include conducting an internal  investigation that could result in a range of sanctions, including bans from  the athletic program if there are findings of wrongdoing. Under these  policies, the accused is provided the right to receive a written notice of the  complaint, present information during the investigation, and appeal the  final decision. However, these reporting and response policies have not  been put into action and tested because officials from each of the 11  athletic programs told us they were not aware of cases of alleged sexual  abuse involving athletes and athletic personnel affiliated with their  program.", "In addition to criminal investigations handled by law enforcement, any  allegations of sexual abuse or misconduct occurring at the private athletic  clubs we visited would generally be handled by their respective NGB,  which would also be responsible for determining any violations of policy  and resulting sanctions for cases in which violations are found. In some  cases, NGB officials lead investigations of abuse complaints at private  athletic clubs and, in the case of two NGBs, contract with private  investigators to carry out the investigation once the NGBs have  completed initial work to ascertain basic information about the complaint  and seek cooperation from the alleged victim. At the university sports  camps we visited, after making reports to law enforcement, multiple  departments and offices, including the Title IX compliance and the Clery  Act compliance offices, the university police, the general counsel\u2019s office,  and others may be involved in responding to such allegations internally.  At one school we visited, an official explained that the Title IX coordinator  and the human resources department would work together to either  conduct an investigation of any incident involving a youth athlete  participating in campus programs, or engage an outside investigator to  conduct the investigation.", "According to the response policies of athletic programs we visited, athletic  personnel found to have committed sexual abuse against a youth athlete  can face penalties including bans from the sport or campus.", "Officials at all three NGBs we spoke with told us they can recommend  imposing a lifetime ban from their sport on those found to have  sexually abused youth athletes.", "Two of the three NGBs we reviewed also publish a list of banned  coaches and other athletic personnel. However, officials from one  NGB told us that they knew of multiple coaches that were banned  from their sport only to find them moving on to coach in other sports.", "At the university sports camps we visited, if there are findings of  wrongdoing the universities can terminate the university employee  involved. One school told us they would ban perpetrators of sexual  violence from campus for three years and if the perpetrator is an  employee, the human resources department can impose a variety of  sanctions, from mandatory counseling to suspension or termination.", "As with allegations of sexual abuse, in cases of inappropriate behavior  that falls short of abuse, the policies of selected athletic programs we  visited included a variety of disciplinary actions. For example, officials  from one NGB explained that although sharing a hotel room with an  athlete while traveling for competition was formerly a common cost-saving  measure, SafeSport policies now strictly forbid it. However, they said  some coaches have continued to share rooms, and in response the NGB  issued formal warning letters to coaches who violated the policy. In  addition, according to this official, more severe measures would be taken  in the event of subsequent violations or if the shared room violation is  combined with other violations. Officials from university camps told us  they also have a variety of disciplinary actions to choose from when staff  members are found to have acted inappropriately with campers, such as  verbal or written reprimands or requiring staff to take leave.", "According to one USOC official, responding to allegations of sexual  misconduct requires significant expertise. To address this, the official told  us the USOC is working to create a United States Center for SafeSport  that will establish an administrative proceeding for handling allegations of  sexual misconduct as defined in a standardized safe sport code. This  centralized approach to investigating and resolving allegations at the  center would aim to deliver expert and consistent results across sports  and sports organizations, as well as provide the ability to effectively share  information about individuals who have been suspended or banned for  policy violations. This official explained that all NGBs have adopted  definitions for sexual misconduct established by the SafeSport program.  According to this official, plans for the center, once created, include  developing a national code to help individuals further distinguish between  appropriate and inappropriate behavior, which can enhance people\u2019s  ability and willingness to report misconduct, and the ability of the center to  ensure fair and equitable responses to incidents.
