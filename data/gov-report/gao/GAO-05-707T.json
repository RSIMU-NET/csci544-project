Since passage of the IRS Restructuring  and Reform Act of 1998 (RRA 98), IRS has faced the challenge of managing  its resources to simultaneously improve service to taxpayers, assure  taxpayers\u2019 compliance with the tax laws, and modernize its antiquated  information systems. As you are well aware, making these improvements  is important. IRS is responsible for collecting the roughly $2 trillion in tax  revenue used to fund the government and annually touches more  Americans than any other federal agency. IRS\u2019s service and enforcement  efforts influence Americans\u2019 confidence in the fairness of the tax system  and their perception of the effectiveness of their government.", "As requested, this statement provides our assessment of IRS\u2019s current  performance in all three areas. We then look ahead, describing the  challenges that IRS faces in addressing resource constraints as well as  realizing efficiency and information systems improvements.", "Our discussion of both recent progress and challenges facing IRS is based  primarily on recently issued GAO products. We used our recent reports  and testimony on IRS\u2019s budget, the tax gap, filing season reviews, financial  audits, systems modernization activities, Business Systems Modernization  (BSM) expenditure plans, and information security. Our work was  performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.", "In summary, IRS has made progress in improving service and modernizing  operations, but the gains have not been uniform. The most noticeable  progress has been in IRS\u2019s taxpayer service, an area that has been of  special concern to the Congress. Access to IRS by telephone, the accuracy  of answers given to taxpayer inquiries, and the growth of IRS\u2019s Web site,  which now provides a variety of services, including forms and  instructions, information on the status of refunds, and answers to  frequently asked questions, have been noteworthy accomplishments in the  years since passage of RRA 98. With respect to tax law enforcement, IRS  experienced declines in enforcement staffing after 1998 but has recently  stopped the declines and begun to show increases. However, tax law  enforcement remains a high-risk area because of the need to improve  enforcement and make progress towards reducing the tax gap\u2014the  difference between taxes owed and taxes paid on time. As for systems  modernization, IRS has made significant progress in establishing long- overdue management controls and in acquiring foundational system  infrastructure and applications as part of the BSM project, as well as  significant progress in addressing financial management issues. However,  BSM remains at risk because of the scope and complexity of  modernization activities and the need for better management capacity to  avoid repeating the program\u2019s history of schedule delays and cost  overruns.", "Looking ahead, continued progress depends on IRS addressing resource  constraints and realizing efficiency and systems improvements. Long-term  goals would help stakeholders, including the Congress, evaluate the  adequacy of IRS\u2019s budget. Further, additional resources might be brought  to bear by, perhaps, additional user fees or the leveraging of nonfederal  partners beyond what is now done with states and volunteers. Efficiency  gains may be possible by, for example, prioritizing taxpayer services in  order to focus on those that provide greater benefit, targeting enforcement  by using better data on noncompliance, collecting more accurate cost  information to improve day-to-day and long-term decision making, and  realizing productivity improvements. Finally, IRS needs to bring planned  new systems on line in a timely and cost-effective manner while also  assuring systems security. GAO has outstanding recommendations related  to taxpayer service, tax law enforcement, BSM, and systems security.

In fiscal year  2005 and in its proposed 2006 budget, IRS is shifting priorities by reducing  taxpayer service and increasing resources for enforcement.", "As shown in table 1, electronic filing has increased while paper filing has  dropped. The increase in electronic filing has allowed IRS to reduce the  resources devoted to processing. As shown in figure 1, IRS reduced the  staff devoted to processing paper returns between 1999 and 2004 by just  over 1,100 staff years. The figure also shows that as the number of e-filed  returns has increased, the number of staff years used to process those  returns has not increased. The decline in paper processing staff allowed  IRS to close its Brookhaven processing center in 2003. In addition, IRS is  in the process of closing its paper processing operation in Memphis.", "In addition to saving IRS resources, electronic filing offers benefits to  taxpayers in that it allows taxpayers to receive refunds faster and is less  error prone.

An independent weekly study ranked it in the top 4  out of 40 federal government web sites in terms of accessibility.", "The site is used extensively. In the early weeks of the 2005 filing season  the IRS Web site was visited about 83 million times by users who viewed  about 628 million pages and downloaded about 70.3 million forms and  publications. IRS\u2019s Web site continues to provide two very important tax  service features: (1) \u201cWhere\u2019s My Refund,\u201d which enables taxpayers to  check on the status of their refund and (2) Free File, which provides  taxpayers the ability to file their tax return electronically for free. This  filing season IRS provided new functionality for \u201cWhere\u2019s My Refund\u201d  whereby taxpayers whose refunds could not be delivered by the Postal  Service (i.e., returned as undeliverable mail), could change their addresses  on the Web site."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS and Volunteer Walk-in Sites", "paragraphs": ["Taxpayer use of IRS\u2019s walk-in sites has decreased while use of volunteer  sites has increased.

Over the same period, IRS  expects taxpayer visits to volunteer sites to increase to just over 2 million  visits in 2005; a substantial increase over about 1.6 million visits in 2004  and fewer than 1 million in 2001. IRS continues to encourage taxpayers to  use volunteer sites for return preparation.", "This shift is important because it transfers time-consuming services,  particularly return preparation, to volunteers and allows IRS to  concentrate on services that only it can provide, such as account  assistance or compliance work. While it reduces the demand on IRS  resources, the shift from IRS to volunteer sites has raised concerns about  the quality of service provided. We and the Treasury Inspector General for  Tax Administration (TIGTA) have called attention to the quality of service  at both IRS walk-in and volunteer sites.

An example of this is the  release of federal tax liens against taxpayers\u2019 property. IRS is required to  release a federal tax lien within 30 days after the date the tax liability is  satisfied or has become legally unenforceable or the Secretary of the  Treasury has accepted a bond for the assessed tax but, as have we  reported for several years as part of our financial audits, most recently in  November 2004, IRS has not always met this standard."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "IRS Has Stopped Declines In Enforcement Staffing, but Enforcement Remains High Risk", "paragraphs": ["We have long been concerned about tax noncompliance and IRS efforts to  address it. Collection of unpaid taxes was included in our first high-risk  series report in 1990, with a focus on the backlog of uncollected debts  owed by taxpayers. In 1995, we added Filing Fraud as a separate high-risk  area, narrowing the focus of that high-risk area in 2001 to Earned Income  Credit Noncompliance because of the particularly high incidence of fraud  and other forms of noncompliance in that program. We expanded our  concern about the Collection of Unpaid Taxes in our 2001 high-risk report  to include not only unpaid taxes (including tax evasion and unintentional  noncompliance) known to IRS, but also the broader enforcement issue of  unpaid taxes that IRS has not detected. In our high-risk update that we  issued in January, we consolidated these areas into a single high-risk  area\u2014Enforcement of Tax Laws\u2014because we believe the focus of  concern on the enforcement of tax laws is not confined to any one  segment of the taxpaying population or any single tax provision.", "Tax law enforcement is a high-risk area in part because of the size of the  tax gap. IRS\u2019s recent estimate of the difference between what taxpayers  timely and accurately paid in taxes and what they owed ranged from  $312 billion to $353 billion for tax year 2001. IRS estimates it will  eventually recover some of this tax gap, resulting in a net tax gap from  $257 billion to $298 billion. The tax gap arises when taxpayers fail to  comply with the tax laws by underreporting tax liabilities on tax returns;  underpaying taxes due from filed returns; or \u201cnonfiling,\u201d which refers to  the failure to file a required tax return altogether or in a timely manner.", "Tax law enforcement is also high risk because past declines in IRS\u2019s  enforcement activities threatened to erode taxpayer compliance. In recent  years, the resources IRS has been able to dedicate to enforcing the tax  laws have declined. For example, the number of revenue agents (those  who examine complex returns), revenue officers (those who perform field  collection work), and special agents (those who perform criminal  investigations) decreased over 21 percent from 1998 through 2003.  However, IRS achieved some staffing gains in 2004 and expects modest  gains in 2005. IRS\u2019s proposal for fiscal year 2006, if funded and  implemented as planned, would return enforcement staffing in these  occupations to their highest levels since 1999.", "Concurrently, IRS\u2019s enforcement workload\u2014measured by the number of  taxpayer returns filed\u2014has continually increased. For example, from 1997  through 2003, the number of individual income tax returns filed increased  by about 8 percent. Over the same period, returns for high-income  individuals grew by about 81 percent. Due to their income levels, IRS  believes that these individuals present a particular compliance risk. In  light of declines in enforcement staffing and the increasing number of  returns filed, nearly every indicator of IRS\u2019s coverage of its enforcement  workload has declined in recent years. Although in some cases workload  coverage has begun to increase, overall IRS\u2019s coverage of known workload  is considerably lower than it was just a few years ago. Figure 3 shows the  trend in examination rates\u2014the proportion of tax returns that IRS  examines each year\u2014for field, correspondence, and total examinations  since 1995. Field examinations involve face-to-face examinations and  correspondence examinations are typically less comprehensive and  complex, involving communication through written notices. IRS  experienced steep declines in examination rates from 1995 to 1999, but the  examination rate has slowly increased since 2000. However, as the figure  shows, the increase in total examination rates of individual filers has been  driven mostly by correspondence examinations, while more complex field  examinations continue to decline.", "Further, IRS\u2019s workload has grown ever more complex as the tax code has  grown more complex. IRS is challenged to administer and explain each  new provision, thus absorbing resources that otherwise might be used to  enforce the tax laws. Concurrently, other areas of particularly serious  noncompliance have gained the attention of IRS and the Congress, such as  abusive tax shelters and schemes employed by businesses and wealthy  individuals that often involve complex transactions that may span national  boundaries. Given the broad declines in IRS\u2019s enforcement workforce,  IRS\u2019s decreased ability to follow up on suspected noncompliance, and the  emergence of sophisticated evasion concerns, IRS is challenged in  attempting to ensure that taxpayers fulfill their obligations.", "On the collection front, IRS\u2019s use of enforcement sanctions, such as liens,  levies, and seizures, dropped precipitously during the mid and late 1990s.  In fiscal year 2000, IRS\u2019s use of these three sanctions was at 38 percent,  7 percent, and 1 percent, respectively, of fiscal year 1996 levels. However,  beginning in fiscal year 2001, IRS\u2019s use of liens and levies began to  increase. By fiscal year 2004, IRS\u2019s use of liens, levies, and seizures  reached 71 percent, 65 percent, and 4 percent of 1996 levels, respectively.", "IRS is working to further improve its enforcement efforts. In addition to  recent favorable trends in enforcement staffing, correspondence  examinations, and the use of some enforcement sanctions, IRS has  recently made progress with respect to abusive tax shelters through a  number of initiatives and recent settlement offers that have resulted  in billions of dollars in collected taxes, interest, and penalties. In addition,  IRS is developing a centralized cost accounting system, in part to obtain  better cost and benefit information on compliance activities, and is  modernizing the technology that underpins many core business processes.  It has also redesigned some compliance and collections processes and  plans additional redesigns as technology improves.

BSM is critical to supporting IRS\u2019s taxpayer service and  enforcement goals. For example, BSM includes projects to allow taxpayers  to file and retrieve information electronically and to provide technology  solutions to help reduce the backlog of collections cases. BSM is also  important to allow IRS to provide the reliable and timely financial  management information needed to account for the nation\u2019s largest  revenue stream and better enable the agency both to determine and to  justify its resource allocation decisions and congressional budgetary  requests.", "Over the past year, IRS has deployed initial phases of several modernized  systems under its BSM program. The following provides examples of the  systems and functionality that IRS implemented in 2004 and the beginning  of 2005.", "Modernized e-File (MeF). This project is intended to provide electronic  filing for large corporations, small businesses, and tax-exempt  organizations. The initial releases of this project were implemented in  June and December 2004, and allowed for the electronic filing of forms  and schedules for the form 1120 (corporate tax return) and form 990  (tax-exempt organizations\u2019 tax return). IRS reported that, during the 2004  filing season, it accepted over 53,000 of these forms and schedules using  MeF.    e-Services. This project created a Web portal and provided other  electronic services to promote the goal of conducting most IRS  transactions with taxpayers and tax practitioners electronically. IRS  implemented e-Services in May 2004. According to IRS, as of late  March 2005, over 84,000 users have registered with this Web portal.", "Customer Account Data Engine (CADE). CADE is intended to replace  IRS\u2019s antiquated system that contains the agency\u2019s repository of taxpayer  information and, therefore, is the BSM program\u2019s linchpin and highest  priority project. In July 2004 and January 2005, IRS implemented the initial  releases of CADE, which have been used to process filing year 2004 and  2005 1040EZ returns, respectively, for single taxpayers with refund or  even-balance returns. According to IRS, as of March 16, 2005, CADE had  processed over 842,000 tax returns so far this filing season.  Integrated Financial System (IFS). This system replaced aspects of IRS\u2019s  core financial systems and is ultimately intended to operate as its new  accounting system of record. The first release of this system became fully  operational in January 2005.", "In prior years, IRS deployed several systems, including (1) Customer  Communications 2001, to improve telephone call management, call  routing, and customer self-service applications; (2) Customer Relationship  Management Examination, to provide off-the-shelf software to IRS  revenue agents to allow them to accurately compute complex corporate  transactions; and (3) Internet Refund/Fact of Filing, to improve taxpayer  self-service by providing to taxpayers via the Internet instant refund status  information and instructions for resolving refund problems.", "Although IRS is to be applauded for delivering important BSM  functionality, the BSM program is far from complete. Future deliveries of  additional functionality of deployed systems and the implementation of  other BSM projects are expected to have a significant impact on IRS\u2019s  taxpayer services and enforcement capability as well as its efforts to  continue to improve its financial management. For example, IRS has  projected that CADE will process about 2 million returns in the 2005 filing  season. However, the returns being processed in CADE are the most basic  and constitute less than 1 percent of the total tax returns expected to be  processed during the current filing season.

Another BSM  project\u2014the Filing and Payment Compliance (F&PC) project\u2014is expected  to increase (1) IRS\u2019s capacity to treat and resolve the backlog of  delinquent taxpayer cases, (2) the closure of collection cases by 10 million  annually by 2014, and (3) voluntary taxpayer compliance. As part of this  project, IRS plans to deliver an initial limited private debt collection  capability in January 2006, with full implementation of this aspect of the  F&PC project to be delivered by January 2008 and additional functionality  to follow in later years. Finally, full implementation of CADE, as well as  the successful implementation of future releases of IFS and efforts to  address the impact of IRS\u2019s decision to discontinue the Custodial  Accounting Project (CAP) will be critical to addressing many of IRS\u2019s  remaining and long-standing financial management issues."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Continued Progress Depends on IRS Addressing Resource Constraints and Realizing Efficiency and Systems Improvements", "paragraphs": ["For IRS to build on the gains made since passage of RRA 98, the agency  must address numerous challenges related to resource management.

As a  part of this comprehensive framework, long-term goals that are linked to  annual performance measures can help guide agencies when considering  organizational changes and making resource decisions. For example, long- term goals would provide IRS with a framework for assessing budgetary  tradeoffs between taxpayer service and enforcement and whether IRS is  making satisfactory progress towards achieving those goals. Similarly,  long-term goals could help identify priorities within the taxpayer service  functions (e.g., if the budget for taxpayer service were to be cut and  efficiency gains did not offset the cut, long-term goals could help guide  decisions about whether to make service cuts across a broad or target  selected services).", "Perhaps most important, long-term compliance goals coupled with  periodic measurement of compliance levels would provide IRS with a  better basis for determining to what extent its various day-to-day service  and enforcement efforts contribute to compliance in the long run.  Furthermore, long-term, quantitative goals may help IRS consider new  strategies to improve compliance, especially since these strategies could  take several years to implement. For example, IRS\u2019s progress toward the  goal of having 80 percent of all individual tax returns electronically filed  by 2007 has required enhancement of its technology, development of  software to support electronic filing, education of taxpayers and  practitioners, and other steps that could not be completed in a short time  frame.

User fees are collected from  identifiable recipients of special benefits beyond those accruing to the  general public.

PCAs will not replace IRS\u2019s own  collection resources, but will handle cases that do not require enforcement  action or discretion in resolving tax liabilities. According to IRS, the  private debt collection program will help reduce the significant and  growing amount of uncollectable cases that are not currently collected,  and enable IRS to focus existing resources to address more difficult cases.  IRS will begin a limited implementation phase of the private debt  collection in 2005, and full implementation is planned for 2007.

IRS has benefited from this partnership because it encourages  electronic filing of tax returns. For example, as of March 16, 2005,  3.6 million tax returns had been filed via Free File, which represents a  44 percent increase over the same time period last year.", "IRS has also established partnerships with states and several cities to  assist in combating abusive tax schemes. In September 2003, IRS  announced the establishment of a nationwide partnership to combat  abusive tax avoidance. Under agreements with individual states, IRS  shares information on abusive tax avoidance transactions and those  taxpayers who participate in them. The agreements creating this  partnership were designed to enable States and IRS to move more  aggressively in addressing this tax compliance problem. The partnership  also includes joint public outreach activities to more effectively counter  the claims of those marketing tax schemes.", "Another example of IRS\u2019s effort to leverage nonfederal resources is the  over 13,500 volunteer sites run by community-based coalitions. IRS awards  grants, trains and certifies volunteers, and provides reference materials,  computer software and, in some cases, computers to these volunteer  organizations to assist primarily low-income and elderly taxpayers prepare  their returns. Since 2001, the number of taxpayers seeking return  preparation assistance at volunteer sites has increased an average of  19 percent per year. During the 2004 filing season, taxpayers had over five  times more returns prepared at volunteer sites than at IRS walk-in sites.  This trend reflects IRS\u2019s strategy to shift return preparation to sites staffed  by volunteer and community-based coalitions that are overseen by IRS.  IRS has encouraged the shift by advertising the locations of these sites.", "As we noted earlier, the shift of taxpayers from walk-in to volunteer sites  is important because it has transferred time-consuming services,  particularly return preparation, from IRS to volunteer sites and allowed  IRS to concentrate on services that only it can provide, such as account  assistance or compliance work. However, as we also noted earlier, there  have been concerns raised about the quality of service at both walk-in and  volunteer sites. In addition, in her January 2005 report, the Taxpayer  Advocate expressed concern about the reduction of face-to-face services,  such as those offered at walk-in sites. She stated that IRS\u2019s plan does not  adequately provide for the segment of the population that continues to rely  on the interaction provided by walk-in sites. Better data about the quality  of service at volunteer sites would provide a baseline for making decisions  about how to better manage quality."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prioritizing Taxpayer Service Could Minimize Impacts of Budget Cuts", "paragraphs": ["For at least two reasons, this is an opportune time to review the menu of  taxpayer services that IRS provides. First, IRS\u2019s budget for taxpayer  services was reduced in 2005 and an additional reduction is proposed for  2006. These reductions have forced IRS to propose scaling back some  services, including the hours of telephone contact availability. Second, as  we have reported, IRS has made significant progress in improving the  quality of its taxpayer services. For example, IRS now provides many  Internet services that did not exist a few years ago, and has noticeably  improved the quality of telephone services. This opens up the possibility of  maintaining the overall level of taxpayer service but with a different menu  of service choices. Cuts in selected services could be offset by the new and  improved services.", "Generally, as indicated in the budget, the menu of taxpayer services that  IRS provides covers assistance, outreach, and processing. Assistance  includes answering taxpayer questions via telephone, correspondence, and  face to face at its walk-in sites. Outreach includes educational programs  and the development of partnerships. Processing includes issuing millions  of tax refunds.", "When considering program reductions, we support a targeted approach  rather than across-the-board cuts. A targeted approach helps reduce the  risk that effective programs are reduced or eliminated while ineffective or  lower priority programs are maintained.", "With the above reasons in mind for reconsidering IRS\u2019s menu of services,  we have compiled a list of options for targeted reductions in taxpayer  service. The options on this list are not recommendations, but are  intended to contribute to a dialogue about the tradeoffs faced when setting  IRS\u2019s budget. The options presented meet at least one of the following  criteria that we generally use to evaluate programs or budget requests.  These criteria include that the activity:    duplicates other efforts that may be more effective and/or efficient;    historically does not meet performance goals or provide intended results  as reported by GAO, TIGTA, IRS, or others;    experiences a continued decrease in demand;  lacks adequate oversight, implementation and management plans, or  structures and systems to be implemented effectively;    has been the subject of actual or requested funding increases that cannot  be adequately justified; or    has the potential to make an agency more self-sustaining by charging user  fees for services provided.", "We recognize that the options listed below involve tradeoffs. In each case,  some taxpayers would lose a service they use. However, the savings could  be used to help maintain the quality of other services. We also want to give  IRS credit for identifying savings, including some on this list. The options  include the following:    Closing walk-in sites. As discussed previously, taxpayer demand for walk- in services has continued to decrease and staff answer a more limited  number of tax law questions in person than staff answer via telephone.", "Limiting the type of telephone questions answered by IRS assistors. IRS  assistors still answer some refund status questions even though IRS  provides automated answers via telephone and its Web site.", "Mandating electronic filing for some filers such as paid preparers or  businesses. As noted, efficiency gains from electronic filing have enabled  IRS to consolidate paper processing operations.", "Charging for services. For example, IRS provides paid preparers with  information on federal debts owed by taxpayers seeking refund  anticipation loans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Targeting Enforcement Could Make More Efficient Use of Resources", "paragraphs": ["Multiple enforcement strategies could help IRS reduce the tax gap. Given  its size, even small or moderate reductions in the net tax gap could yield  substantial returns. For example, based on IRS\u2019s most recent estimate, a  1 percent reduction in the net tax gap would likely yield more than  $2.5 billion annually.", "Although reducing the tax gap may be an attractive means to improve the  nation\u2019s fiscal position, achieving this end will be a challenging task given  persistent levels of noncompliance. IRS has made efforts to reduce the tax  gap since the early 1980s; yet the tax gap is still large\u2014although without  these efforts it could be even larger. Also, IRS is challenged in reducing the  tax gap because the tax gap is spread across the five different types of  taxes that IRS administers, and a substantial portion of the tax gap is  attributed to taxpayers who are not subject to withholding or information  reporting requirements. Moreover, as we have reported in the past,  closing the entire tax gap may not be feasible or desirable, as it could  entail more intrusive recordkeeping or reporting than the public is willing  to accept or more resources than IRS is able to commit.", "Although much of the tax gap that IRS currently recovers is through  enforcement actions, a sole focus on enforcement will not likely be  sufficient to further reduce the net tax gap. Rather, the tax gap must be  attacked on multiple fronts and with multiple strategies on a sustained  basis. For example, efforts to simplify the tax code and otherwise alter  current tax policies may help reduce the tax gap by making it easier for  individuals and business to understand and voluntarily comply with their  tax obligations. For instance, reducing the multiple tax preferences for  retirement savings or education assistance might ease taxpayers\u2019 burden  in understanding and complying with the rules associated with these  options. Also, simplification may reduce opportunities for tax evasion  through vehicles such as abusive tax shelters. For any given set of tax  policies, IRS\u2019s efforts to reduce the tax gap and ensure appropriate levels  of compliance will need to be based on a balanced approach of providing  service to taxpayers and enforcing the tax laws.", "Furthermore, providing quality services to taxpayers is an important part  of any overall strategy to improve compliance and thereby reduce the tax  gap. As we have reported in the past, one method of improving  compliance through service is to educate taxpayers about confusing or  commonly misunderstood tax requirements. For example, if the forms and  instructions taxpayers use to prepare their taxes are not clear, taxpayers  may be confused and make unintentional errors. One method to ensure  that forms and instructions are sufficiently clear is to test them before use.  However, we reported in 2003 that IRS had tested revisions to only five  individual forms and instructions from July 1997 through June 2002,  although hundreds of forms and instructions had been revised in  2001 alone.", "Finally, in terms of enforcement, IRS will need to use multiple strategies  and techniques to find noncompliant taxpayers and bring them into  compliance. One pair of tools has been shown to lead to high levels of  compliance: withholding tax from payments to taxpayers and having third  parties report information to IRS and the taxpayers on income paid to  taxpayers. For example, banks and other financial institutions provide  information returns (Forms 1099) to account holders and IRS showing the  taxpayers\u2019 annual income from some types of investments. Similarly, most  wages, salaries, and tip compensation are reported by employers to  employees and IRS through Form W-2. Preliminary findings from NRP  indicate that more than 98.5 percent of these types of income are  accurately reported on individual returns.", "Regularly measuring compliance can offer many benefits, including  helping IRS identify new or major types of noncompliance, identify  changes in tax laws and regulations that may improve compliance, more  effectively target examinations of tax returns or other enforcement  programs, understand the effectiveness of its programs to promote and  enforce compliance, and determine its resource needs and allocations. For  example, by analyzing 1979 and 1982 compliance research data, IRS  identified significant noncompliance with the number of dependents  claimed on tax returns and justified a legislative change to address the  noncompliance. As a result, for tax year 1987, taxpayers claimed about  5 million fewer dependents on their returns than would have been  expected without the change in law. In addition, tax compliance data are  useful outside of IRS for tax policy analysis, revenue estimating,  and research.", "IRS research officials have proposed a compliance measurement  study that will allow IRS to update underreporting estimates involving  flow-through entities. This study, which IRS intends to begin in fiscal  year 2006, would take 2 to 3 years to complete. Because either individual  taxpayers or corporations may be recipients of income (or losses) from  flow-through entities, this study could affect IRS\u2019s estimates for the  underreporting gap for individual and corporate income taxes.", "While these data and methodology updates could improve the tax gap  estimates, IRS has no documented plans to periodically collect more or  better compliance data over the long term. Other than the proposed study  of flow-through entities, IRS does not have plans to collect compliance  data for other segments of the tax gap. Also, IRS has indicated that given  its current research priorities, it would not begin another NRP study of  individual income tax returns before 2008, if at all, and would not  complete such a study until at least 2010. When IRS initially proposed the  NRP study, it had planned to study individual income tax underreporting  on a 3-year cycle.", "According to IRS officials, IRS has not committed to regularly collecting  compliance data because of the associated costs and burdens. Taxpayers  whose returns are examined through compliance studies such as NRP  bear costs in terms of time and money. Also, IRS incurs costs, including  direct costs and opportunity costs\u2014revenue that IRS potentially forgoes  by using its resources to examine randomly selected returns, which may  include returns from compliant taxpayers, as opposed to traditional  examinations that focus on taxpayer returns that likely contain  noncompliance and may more consistently produce additional tax  assessments.", "Although the costs and burdens of compliance measurement are legitimate  concerns, as we have reported in the past, we believe compliance studies  to be good investments. Without current compliance data, IRS is less able  to determine key areas of noncompliance to address and actions to take to  maximize the use of its limited resources. The lack of firm plans to  continually obtain fresh compliance data is troubling because the  frequency of data collection can have a large impact on the quality and  utility of compliance data. As we have reported in the past, the longer the  time between compliance measurement surveys, the less useful they  become given changes in the economy and tax law.", "In designing its recently completed NRP study, IRS balanced the costs,  burdens, and compliance risk of studying that area of the tax gap. Any  plans for obtaining and maintaining reasonably current information on  compliance levels for all portions of the tax gap would similarly need to  take into account costs, burdens, and compliance risks in determining  which areas of compliance to measure and the scope and frequency of  such measurement.", "The NRP survey had an added benefit of including the use of casebuilding  to aid examiners in determining whether IRS needs to have any contact  with taxpayers to verify the accuracy of information reported on their tax  returns. The casebuilding tools consisted of data from both IRS and third- party sources. IRS\u2019s NRP casebuilding included return information from  the prior 3 years, audit history, payment and filing history, information  return data reported by third parties (banks, lending institutions, and  others), and bank reports on large cash transactions. NRP casebuilding  tools also included data from third-party sources, such as external public  database containing real estate and other asset ownership information  (e.g., motor vehicle registrations and ownership of luxury items like  watercraft and aircraft). Another third-party data source was the  Dependent Data Base, which is a combination of Department of Health  and Human Services and Social Security Administration data. These data  were used to provide custody information that can be used to help  determine the validity of dependent and Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)  claims. Use of these data helped IRS enforcement staff to rule out  compliance issues that could be verified without contacting taxpayers.", "As IRS moves to further strengthen enforcement and introduce  enforcement initiatives, one management challenge will be coordinating  across IRS programs and offices. An initiative that identifies  noncompliance has resource implications for downstream activities such  as collections, criminal investigations, and appeals. Without appropriate,  coordinated follow-up, compliance initiatives run the risk of becoming  toothless. IRS has experienced this sort of imbalance in the past. For  example, in 2002 we reported on the growing backlog of collections cases  generated by the upstream exam and assessment functions that the  downstream collections function lacked the capacity to pursue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accurate Cost Information Would Help IRS Make Resource Allocation Decisions", "paragraphs": ["Managing a federal agency as large and complex as IRS requires managers  to constantly weigh the relative costs and benefits of different approaches  to achieving the goals mandated by the Congress.

As constraints on available resources  increase, these decisions become correspondingly more challenging and  important. In order to rise to this challenge, management needs to have at  its disposal current and accurate information upon which to base its  decisions, and to enable it to monitor the effectiveness of actions taken  over time so that appropriate adjustments can be made as conditions  change.", "However, in its ongoing effort to make such increasingly difficult resource  allocation decisions and defend those decisions before the Congress, IRS  management has long been hampered by a lack of current and accurate  information concerning the costs of the various options being considered.  This has impaired management\u2019s ability to properly decide which, if any,  of the options at hand are worth the cost relative to the expected benefits.  For example, accurate and timely cost information may help IRS consider  changes in the menu of taxpayer services that it provides by identifying  and assessing the relative costs, benefits, and risks of specific projects.  Without reliable cost information, IRS\u2019s ability to make such difficult  choices in an informed, reasoned manner is seriously impaired. Similarly,  IRS should periodically reassess the prices it charges taxpayers in user  fees for various services, such as entering into installment agreements and  making determinations about the tax exemption status of certain  organizations. The cost of providing such services is supposed to be a  major factor in setting the related fees. However, without timely and  reliable cost information, the basis for the fees becomes problematic.  The lack of reliable cost information also means that IRS cannot prepare  cost-based performance measures to assist in measuring the effectiveness  of its programs over time.", "IRS lacks reliable and timely cost information because prior to fiscal year  2005, it did not have a cost accounting system to accumulate and report  the reliable cost information that managers needed to support informed  decision making. Instead, management often relied on a combination of  the limited existing cost information; the results of special analysis  initiated to establish the full cost of a specific, narrowly defined task or  item; and estimates based on the best judgment of experienced staff. In  fiscal year 2005, IRS implemented a cost accounting module as part of the  first release of its IFS. However, while this module has much potential and  has begun accumulating cost information, management has not yet  determined what the full range of its cost information needs are or how  best to tailor the capabilities of this module to serve those needs. IRS has  also not yet implemented a related workload management system  intended to provide the cost module with detailed personnel cost  information. In addition, because it generally takes several years of  historical cost information to support meaningful estimates and  projections, IRS cannot yet rely on this system as a significant planning  tool. It will likely require several years and implementation of additional  components of IFS before the full potential of IRS\u2019s cost accounting  module will be realized.

Consequently, information  about productivity can inform budget debates as a factor that explains the  level or changes in the cost of carrying out different types of activities.

In particular, IRS claimed that it  reduced the variance between estimated and actual costs from 33 percent  in fiscal year 2002 to 4 percent in fiscal year 2004. However, we do not  agree with the methodology used in the analysis supporting this claim.  Specifically, (1) the analysis did not reflect actual costs, but instead  reflected changes in cost estimates (i.e., budget allocations) for various  BSM projects; (2) IRS aggregated all of the changes in the estimates  associated with the major activities for some projects, such as CADE,  which masked that monies were shifted from future activities to cover  increased costs of current activities; and (3) the calculations were based  on a percentage of specific fiscal year appropriations, which does not  reflect that these are multiyear projects.", "In February 2002 we expressed concern over IRS\u2019s cost and schedule  estimating and made a recommendation for improvement.

According to the Senate report for the  fiscal year 2005 Transportation, Treasury, and General Government  appropriations bill, in making its recommendation to reduce BSM funding,  the Senate appropriations committee was concerned about the program\u2019s  cost overruns and schedule delays. In addition, the committee emphasized  that in providing fewer funds, it wanted IRS to focus on its highest priority  projects, particularly CADE.

However, the significant adjustments that IRS is  making to the program to address these reductions are not without risk,  could potentially impact future budget requests, and will delay the  implementation of certain functionality that was intended to provide  benefit to IRS operations and the taxpayer. For example,    Reductions in management reserve/project risk adjustments. In response  to the fiscal year 2005 budget reduction, IRS reduced the amount that it  had allotted to program management reserve and project risk adjustments  by about 62 percent (from about $49.1 million to about $18.6 million).  If BSM projects have future cost overruns that cannot be covered by the  depleted reserve, this reduction could result in (1) increased budget  requests in future years or (2) delays in planned future activities  (e.g., delays in delivering promised functionality) to use those allocated  funds to cover the overruns.", "Shifts of BSM management responsibility from the PRIME contractor to  IRS. Due to budget reductions and IRS\u2019s assessment of the PRIME  contractor\u2019s performance, IRS decided to shift significant BSM  responsibilities for program management, systems engineering, and  business integration from the PRIME contractor to IRS staff. For example,  IRS staff are assuming responsibility for cost and schedule estimation and  measurement, risk management, integration test and deployment, and  transition management. There are risks associated with this decision. To  successfully accomplish this transfer, IRS must have the management  capability to perform this role. Although the BSM program office has been  attempting to improve this capability through, for example,  implementation of a new governance structure and hiring staff with  specific technical and management expertise, IRS has had significant  problems in the past managing this and other large development projects,  and acknowledges that it has major challenges to overcome in this area.", "Suspension of the Custodial Accounting Project (CAP).

Among the functionalities that the initial releases of CAP were  expected to provide were (1) critical control and reporting capabilities  mandated by federal financial management laws; (2) a traceable audit trail  to support financial reporting; and (3) a subsidiary ledger to accurately  and promptly identify, classify, track, and report custodial revenue  transactions and unpaid assessments.
