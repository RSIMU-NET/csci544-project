GAO interviewed Air Force officials and reviewed Air Force documentation to obtain an understanding of the Air Force's system initiatives and strategy for achieving total asset visibility and to identify areas for improvement."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force has identified the Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS) and the Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) as key technology enablers of the Air Force's efforts to transform its logistics and financial management operations and achieve total asset visibility--a key DOD priority. ECSS is expected to provide a single, integrated logistics system, including transportation, supply, maintenance and repair, and other key business functions directly related to logistics such as engineering and acquisition. Additionally, ECSS will perform financial management and accounting for the Air Force working capital fund operations. ECSS is expected to be fully operational in fiscal year 2013, and replace about 250 legacy logistics and procurement systems. DEAMS is expected to provide the entire spectrum of core financial management capabilities, including collections, commitments/obligations, cost accounting, general ledger, funds control, receipts and acceptance, accounts payable and disbursement, billing, and financial reporting for the Air Force general fund operations. DEAMS is expected to replace seven legacy systems and be fully operational in fiscal year 2014. GAO identified several areas in which the Air Force had not fully implemented best practices related to risk management and system testing. These findings increase the risk that these business system initiatives will not meet their stated functionality, cost, and milestone goals, thereby limiting the Air Force's efforts to achieve total asset visibility and other DOD business transformation priorities. Further, key Air Force business transformation strategic plans and documents were not aligned within the Air Force nor with DOD's broader business transformation priorities. While each individual Air Force plan was intended to support the Air Force's business transformation efforts, the plans did not reflect a coordinated effort toward achieving a stated Air Force or DOD goal. For example, neither the Air Force's Military Equipment Accountability Improvement Plan for supporting DOD's military equipment valuation effort, nor the Air Force Logistics Enterprise Architecture Concept of Operations, its key strategic transformation plan for logistics, identified a shared relationship, including metrics, in supporting Air Force and DOD logistics and financial management transformation goals. As a result, neither the Air Force nor DOD will have the performance data needed to oversee efforts intended to improve the Air Force's ability to locate, manage, and account for assets throughout their life cycle."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over 30 years ago, the Department of Defense (DOD) established a goal to  achieve total asset visibility in recognition of its importance to successful  operations. To date, DOD\u2019s efforts have been unsuccessful. DOD defines  total asset visibility as the capability to provide timely, accurate  information on the location, movement, status or condition, and identity of  units, personnel, equipment, and supplies DOD-wide, and having the  capability to act on that information. If the information contained in the  asset accountability systems is not accurate, complete, and timely, DOD\u2019s  day-to-day operations could be adversely affected by, for example,  investing in inventory that is not needed to meet current needs.", "Asset visibility is one of three focus areas identified by the department as  critical to effective and efficient supply chain management operations.  The other two focus areas are inventory management and distribution.  Collectively, these three areas are integral to department logistical  operations and improvements are needed in each to address the problems  associated with DOD\u2019s supply chain management, which has been on our  high-risk list since 1990. Of the 27 areas on our high-risk list, DOD          has 8 high-risk areas of its own, and shares responsibility for 7  governmentwide high-risk areas. The nature and severity of DOD\u2019s  deficiencies in these high-risk areas impedes the ability of DOD managers  to receive the full range of information needed to effectively manage day- to-day operations. DOD\u2019s efforts to achieve total asset visibility should  assist the department in addressing several of its high-risk areas, including  supply-chain management, business system modernizations, and financial  management by providing DOD management and the Congress with more  accurate and reliable information for decision making purposes.", "Similar to the department as a whole, the Air Force continues to struggle  to achieve and maintain efficient and effective management control over  the hundreds of billions of dollars in inventory and other assets with  which it is entrusted. For example, in 1996, we reported that information  systems do not always provide Air Force managers and employees with  accurate, real-time data on the cost, amount, location, condition, and  usage of inventory\u2014elements that are required to successfully plan,  control, and measure inventory management. Furthermore, in April 2007  we reported that more than half of the Air Force\u2019s spare parts inventory  worth an average of $31.4 billion was not needed. Our report further  noted that the Air Force has continued to purchase unneeded inventory  because its policies do not provide incentives to manage the amount of  inventory on order that may not be needed to support its logistics  operations. The Air Force has acknowledged that its logistics operations  have largely been reactionary, rather than anticipatory, because  stovepiped business processes and systems impede visibility. Importantly,  Air Force logisticians have historically met the challenge of fulfilling their  mission within the constraints of archaic business processes and  nonintegrated systems, through increased personnel and financial  resources.", "The Air Force\u2019s vision for transforming its logistics operations to meet  both the current and future threat environment is broad in scope and  touches on all logistics functions, including transportation, maintenance,  procurement, inventory management, and product life-cycle management,  and crosses all commodity lines (such as fuel, munitions, aircraft, and  vehicles) and organizational boundaries. The Air Force has determined  that logistics must operate with an enterprise (Air Force-wide) view,  across integrated processes, while optimizing resources and leveraging  integrated technology \u201cto deliver the right support, to the right place, at  the right time, every time.\u201d The Air Force has a number of ongoing  technology, policy, organization, and process engineering initiatives to  enhance asset visibility. Among these are asset marking and tracking  initiatives, which are intended to enable more accurate and timely  recording of asset information such as location, condition, and status  through the use of unique item identification and radio frequency  identification of individual or groups of assets. In addition, the Air Force  has undertaken two business system initiatives, the Expeditionary Combat  Support System (ECSS) and the Defense Enterprise Accounting and  Management System (DEAMS) that it has identified as key to its efforts to  transform its logistics and financial management operations, and achieve  total asset visibility. ECSS will primarily be responsible for performing the  logistical functions for both the Air Force\u2019s general and working capital  funds and the financial management functions for the Air Force\u2019s working  capital funds. DEAMS will perform the financial management functions for  the Air Force\u2019s general funds. Although ECSS and DEAMS are important  technology enablers, their ability to provide the information intended by  Air Force to support total asset visibility, including asset accountability  and decision making support, is largely dependent upon the Air Force\u2019s  success in integrating, managing, and completing other transformation  initiatives outlined in a variety of Air Force strategic plans and documents.", "This report provides information in support of your continuing oversight  of DOD\u2019s progress towards resolving the department\u2019s long-standing  problems in achieving total asset visibility. In July 2007, we reported on  the Army\u2019s efforts to achieve total asset visibility. Our objectives were to  determine (1) the implementation status of the Air Force\u2019s current  business system initiatives to achieve total asset visibility, and whether the  Air Force has implemented related best practices, and (2) whether the Air  Force\u2019s business transformation efforts to achieve total asset visibility are  aligned within the Air Force and with DOD\u2019s broader business  transformation priorities.", "To address the first objective, we analyzed documentation and met with  Air Force and DOD Business Transformation Agency officials to identify  and determine the implementation status of key Air Force business system  initiatives intended to support the Air Force\u2019s goal of achieving total asset  visibility. Further, we interviewed and obtained briefings from Air Force  logistics and financial management officials and others on ECSS and  DEAMS program management and oversight. Specifically, we obtained  and reviewed documentation related to each system initiative, including  costs, implementation schedules, and risk management programs, to  assess their acquisition status and to determine whether improvements  were needed in the Air Force\u2019s approach for acquiring and implementing  these systems. We did not review ECSS and DEAMS compliance with the  Air Force\u2019s enterprise architecture because our related work focused on  ascertaining the status of the military services\u2019 efforts to develop and use  an enterprise architecture. The results of this work are discussed in our  May 2008 report, which noted that while the Air Force\u2019s efforts to develop  an enterprise architecture were ahead of the Army\u2019s and the Navy\u2019s efforts,  the Air Force\u2019s architecture was not sufficiently developed to guide and  constrain its business systems modernization investments. To address  the second objective, we obtained and analyzed key Air Force business  transformation strategic plans to assess integration and utilization of  metrics in supporting and managing the Air Force\u2019s efforts to transform its  business operations and achieve total asset visibility. Additionally, we  compared key Air Force business transformation plans with DOD\u2019s  Enterprise Transition Plan to determine if DOD\u2019s business enterprise  transformation priorities were incorporated into the Air Force\u2019s plans.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2007 through August 2008  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. Details on our scope and  methodology are included in appendix I.

Further,  when DOD released its first Enterprise Transition Plan in 2005, these  objectives, including the importance of financial information visibility for  use in decision making, were embodied into the department\u2019s six strategic  business enterprise transformation priorities. Both DOD and the Air  Force have initiatives under way to improve their ability to link financial  resources to associated assets, programs, and activities or missions. For  example, both the department and the Air Force have efforts underway,  such as the Unique Item Identification and Radio Frequency Identification  initiatives and the Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS)  initiative, to improve their ability to identify and track assets, including  costs, throughout their life cycle.", "The Air Force, as a DOD component, is confronted with similar  management challenges that must be effectively resolved if it is to improve  its business operations and in turn provide better support to the  warfighter.

We have previously reported that more than half of the  Air Force\u2019s secondary inventory (spare parts), worth an average of       $31.4 billion, was not needed to support required on-hand and on-order  inventory levels from fiscal years 2002 through 2005. The Air Force has  continued to purchase unneeded on-order inventory because its policies  do not provide incentives to reduce the amount of inventory on order that  is not needed to support requirements.", "Financial management and reporting. The DOD Inspector General  reported in November 2007, and the Air Force acknowledged, that the Air  Force continues to have significant internal control deficiencies that  impede the ability of its general and working capital funds to produce  accurate and reliable information on the results of their operations.   Deficiencies were found in the following areas: (1) financial management  systems, (2) government furnished and contractor-acquired materiel  (general fund), (3) environmental liabilities, (4) operating materials and  supplies, (5) accounting entries, (6) property, plant, and equipment, and  (7) in-transit inventory (working capital fund).", "Deployed assets. In January 2007, the Air Force Audit Agency reported  that the Air Force had lost control and accountability over 5,800 assets,  valued at approximately $108 million, in part because its logistical systems  did not provide Air Force personnel with the capability to effectively  manage, track, and monitor deployed assets. For example, the system  incorrectly reported that assets were deployed to closed bases.  Additionally, the systems did not provide reliable asset information, such  as asset quantities and location. As a result of these weaknesses, Air Force  management did not have total asset visibility and was not able to  determine if the right assets were at the right location to meet mission  requirements.", "Government furnished material. In January 2007, the Air Force Audit  Agency also reported that the Air Force did not effectively manage  government furnished material. More specifically, the Air Force Audit  Agency reported that the Air Force logistics personnel inappropriately  provided government furnished material to contractors that were not  authorized by contract documentation to receive this material. This  problem could adversely affect mission support if the Air Force loses  assets that should be in inventory.

In January 2008, Air  Force ECSS program management officials informed us that ECSS would  assume financial management control and accountability, including  invoice processing and financial reporting responsibility, for the Air  Force\u2019s working capital fund operations. Prior to this decision, the Air  Force had designated DEAMS as the business system initiative it intended  to use to improve the financial management capabilities of both the Air  Force\u2019s working capital and general funds. The Air Force is currently in  the process of determining the cost of this decision and how much it will  add to its already recognized funding shortfall for ECSS of approximately    $697 million. According to ECSS program management office officials,  ECSS\u2019s funding shortfall resulted from contract order award protests that  caused stop-work actions. As a result of the stop-work actions, the ECSS  program management office was not able to spend money for work as  planned, which caused the Air Force to reallocate the money to other Air  Force requirements, ultimately resulting in unfunded ECSS requirements.", "The DEAMS program was initiated in August 2003 and is expected to  provide general fund accounting for the entire Air Force at a total           life-cycle cost of over $1 billion. In the past, lack of integration between  business systems, including logistics and financial management, have  adversely affected the ability of DOD and the Air Force to control costs,  ensure basic accountability, anticipate future costs and claims on the  budget, measure performance, maintain funds control, and prevent fraud.  If the information contained in asset and financial accountability systems  is not accurate, complete, and timely, the Air Force\u2019s day-to-day  operations could be adversely affected by, for example, investment in  inventory that is not needed to meet current needs or for which the Air  Force had not allocated sufficient resources or authority to purchase. Both  physical and financial accountability are essential to achieving total asset  visibility and DOD\u2019s objective of providing information to support decision  making.", "According to Air Force officials, DEAMS will replace seven legacy  accounting systems. As depicted in figure 2, Air Force program  management officials expect DEAMS to reach initial operational  capability during fiscal year 2011 and full operational capability by fiscal  year 2014 with a total life-cycle cost of about $1.1 billion.

The  objective of a well-managed risk management program is to provide a  repeatable process for balancing cost, schedule, and performance goals  within program funding. According to DOD\u2019s Risk Management Guide for  DOD Acquisition, risk management is most effective if it is fully  integrated within a program. Our analysis of the ECSS and DEAMS risk  management programs found that neither program used a comprehensive  and fully integrated risk management process. Program risk was  monitored, overseen, and managed independently by various groups or  activities within the program without adequate visibility, at the program  management level. Without adequate visibility of risk management  activities programwide, the program management office has little  assurance of the sufficiency of actions taken by its subordinate groups or  activities to identify, analyze, and mitigate risk that may affect other  groups or the program itself. A single risk management process for each  program with clear linkages to subordinate risk management activities  throughout the program would provide greater visibility and assurance  that appropriate actions are taken to identify and address risks. Acquiring  software is a risky endeavor and risk management processes are intended  to help the program manager and senior leadership ensure that actions are  taken to mitigate the adverse effects of each determined program risk. If  program risks are not effectively communicated and managed, then the  risks will manage the program, potentially leading to increased costs to  ultimately address the impact of a realized risk or implement a program  that does not provide the intended capabilities.

Our analysis of ECSS and DEAMS risk management processes  found that even when risks were identified at lower levels within a  program, the level of detail at the program level was not always sufficient  to provide program managers with the visibility needed to effectively  assess and manage certain risks at those levels. Although the ECSS and  DEAMS program management offices identified interfaces as potential  areas of risk at lower levels within the program, we found that neither  program management office consistently identified interfaces as a risk at  the program level. In the case of DEAMS, the information in the program  level risk management system did not disclose that 70 key interfaces must  be dealt with in order to implement the system, even though this level of  detail was maintained at a lower level by the DEAMS Interface and  Conversion Group. Without visibility of risks identified at all levels of a  program, it is difficult, if not impossible, for the program manager or other  senior-level officials to ascertain if the various risks that are associated  with a program of this magnitude are effectively identified and managed.", "We have previously reported that interfaces are critical elements  necessary to successfully implement a new system and failure to properly  address risk in interface areas has contributed to the system failures of  previous agency efforts.", "Data conversion. In implementing ECSS and DEAMS, the Air Force will  have to expend considerable resources to clean-up and transfer the data in  the existing legacy systems to ECSS or DEAMS. However, we found that  only the ECSS risk management program identified data quality as an issue  in its discussion of data conversion. Much like system interfaces, each  effort to convert data needs to be separately identified and managed so  that (1) the risks associated with a given effort can be identified,   (2) adequate mitigating actions can be developed for those risks, and   (3) the effectiveness of the mitigating actions can be monitored. For  example, in June 2005, we reported that data conversion problems  seriously affected the Army\u2019s ability to implement its Logistics  Modernization Program at the Tobyhanna Army Depot, Tobyhanna,  Pennsylvania. These problems affected reporting of revenue earned,  accountability over orders received from customers, and prepared billings.  As discussed in our July 2007 report, the Army and its contractor still had  not resolved the issues of customers being improperly billed.", "Change management. The DEAMS program management office did not  identify change management as a risk in its risk management system;  however, it was included as a risk by the ECSS program management  office. Change management is the process of preparing users for the  changes that should occur with the implementation of a new system. It  involves engaging users and communicating the nature of anticipated  changes to system users through training on how jobs will change. This is  necessary because commercial products are created with the developers\u2019  expectations of how they will be used, and the products\u2019 functionality may  require the organization implementing the system to change existing  business processes. However, neither the ECSS or DEAMS program had  identified training as a potential change management risk at the program  level. As discussed previously, the lack of sufficient transparency of risks  identified by the lower levels at the program level may impede the ability  of ECSS and DEAMS program managers and senior-level officials to  ensure that risks are effectively mitigated. Further, the lack of centralized  visibility may also minimize program efficiencies that could be gained  through shared knowledge of risks identified by other groups within the  program and actions planned or taken to mitigate them. As we have  previously reported, having staff with the appropriate skills is a key  element for achieving financial management improvement. The  implementation of a new system is intended to bring about improvements  in the way an entity performs its day-to-day business operations. We have  issued several reports that associated the lack of effective change  management to program schedule slippages.
