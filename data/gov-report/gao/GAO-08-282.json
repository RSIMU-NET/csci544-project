Aliens unable to obtain a visa, and with a compelling humanitarian need, may apply to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to be granted humanitarian parole. This permits an alien to enter the United States on a temporary basis. Parole responsibility rests with DHS's Humanitarian Assistance Branch (HAB), which was transferred to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in August 2007. In response to congressional requesters, GAO examined (1) the characteristics of those who applied for humanitarian parole since October 1, 2001, and (2) internal controls HAB designed to adjudicate applications along with the extent to which HAB adhered to them. To conduct this work, GAO analyzed HAB documents and data, such as its protocols and database of all parole applications since October 1, 2001; interviewed HAB officials about adjudication processes; and interviewed attorneys who had helped individuals file for parole."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The 8,748 humanitarian parole applications that HAB adjudicated from October 1, 2001, through June 30, 2007, displayed various characteristics--54 percent of the applicants were female and 46 percent, male; 45 percent of the applicants came from 11 countries, with the largest number from Mexico. Sixty-four percent of the requests for humanitarian parole were for family reunification or medical emergency. Persons under age 18 had a 35 percent grant rate--higher than the rate for applicants over 18 and consistent with the stated purposes of humanitarian parole. Seventy-six percent of applications were denied; 24 percent were granted. Among multiple reasons cited for denial by adjudicators in a projectible sample of cases we analyzed, an estimated 57 percent of applicants had not exhausted other avenues of immigration available to them before applying for humanitarian parole, as generally is required. Data analysis revealed few differences in parole denial rates with regard to gender or, with two exceptions, country of residence. While denial recommendation rates for individual adjudicators varied, HAB officials stated that this is expected because the facts and circumstances of cases vary and adjudicators have different backgrounds and experiences that might affect their reviews of an application. HAB has designed internal controls to help ensure that requests for humanitarian parole are decided in accordance with applicable guidelines; these controls have been functioning as intended. Specifically, HAB has, among other controls, clear and detailed written policies and procedures, including a requirement that every application be reviewed by two adjudicators and that if they disagree, a third is to make a \"tie-breaking\" recommendation. A final decision is then made by the HAB Branch Chief or a designee, but if the Branch Chief decides to override the adjudicators' recommendations, the case is first discussed with higher-level officials. A computerized data system also records key information in every case. While HAB's controls are generally effective, three areas can be strengthened. First, following a transfer of HAB to USCIS, HAB may no longer have a sufficient number of permanent staff to ensure it continues to follow policies and procedures, since two adjudicators are insufficient to provide independent reviews of requests for reconsideration--HAB guidance recommends that such requests be reviewed by two additional adjudicators not previously involved. Second, HAB does not have a formal training program for new staff who may be detailed to help process applications. Such training is essential to ensure that criteria for granting and denying parole are applied consistently and fairly by the adjudicators. Third, USCIS's Web site has limited information about the circumstances under which a person may apply for humanitarian parole. More information and clearer instructions could reduce the number of applications from those who had not taken the steps generally required before applying for humanitarian parole, such as exhausting other available avenues for entry into the United States."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) generally requires that most  aliens wishing to visit or immigrate to the United States obtain a  Department of State-issued visa.

(2) What internal controls has HAB designed to adjudicate humanitarian  parole applications and to what extent did HAB adhere to these internal  controls when processing humanitarian parole applications?", "To determine the characteristics of those who applied for and were either  granted or denied humanitarian parole, we analyzed data on 8,748  humanitarian parole applications adjudicated from October 1, 2001,  through June 30, 2007, contained in DHS\u2019s automated Parole Case  Tracking System (PCTS). The system contains various applicant  demographic characteristics such as age; gender; and country of  residence; the reason why the applicant requested humanitarian parole  (e.g., medical emergency or family reunification); the recommendations by  individual adjudicators involved in adjudicating the application; and the  adjudication decision. To determine whether approval and denial rates  differed according to applicants\u2019 demographic characteristics (e.g., gender,  country of residence, age) and whether these rates differed by adjudicator,  we analyzed PCTS data on the outcomes of adjudication decisions by  these characteristics and by the recommendations made by adjudicators.

We determined that the PCTS data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our review.", "Each adjudication case in PCTS has two text boxes into which two  different adjudicators each enter information about the reason for the  request, and their explanation for their recommendation for or against  granting humanitarian parole. To examine the reasons for requests for  humanitarian parole, we selected a stratified probability sample of 462  cases from fiscal year 2002 through June 30, 2007, and performed a  content analysis of the reasons for the requests contained in the text  boxes. We categorized the explanations in the text boxes for requesting  humanitarian parole into the four major categories defined by HAB: (1)  life-threatening medical emergencies; (2) family reunification for  compelling humanitarian reasons; (3) emergent, defined by the HAB as  including the need to visit an ill family member or to resolve matters  associated with the death of a relative or to attend a funeral; and (4)  \u201cother,\u201d such as a caregiver needed to care for someone in the United  States. To determine the reasons for which applicants were denied  humanitarian parole, we reviewed the cases in our sample in which the  applicant was denied humanitarian parole and performed a content  analysis of the reasons for the denials of parole contained in the text  boxes. We then categorized the explanations for denials into 10 categories;  HAB officials confirmed these categories. These included, for example,  that the applicant had not first exhausted alternative immigration  processes that might have been available, such as obtaining a visa, absent  urgent circumstances that made it impractical to do so, or had not  provided sufficient evidence of a claimed medical emergency, or that the  applicant had committed a prior immigration violation or crime.", "To determine what internal controls HAB designed to adjudicate  humanitarian parole applications and the extent to which HAB adhered to  these internal controls, we obtained HAB policies and procedures and  compared them with standards for internal control in the federal  government and other internal control guidance related to control  activities, staffing levels, training, and communication with external  clients. We also interviewed HAB officials regarding how HAB internal  controls are interpreted and followed. To determine the extent to which  internal controls were adhered to, we reviewed our sample of cases  selected to assess the reliability of the PCTS data to determine whether  the case files contained documentation that a required control, (e.g.,  supervisory review), had been followed.

This includes aliens required to have a visa to visit or  immigrate to the United States who are unable to obtain one, either due to  ineligibility or urgent circumstances that make it impractical to apply for  one. Specifically, the Immigration and Nationality Act grants the Secretary  of Homeland Security discretionary authority to parole an alien into the  United States temporarily on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian  reasons, such as to obtain medical treatment not available in his or her  home country, visit a dying relative, or reunify young children with  relatives. Granted for a maximum of 1 year, humanitarian parole does not  constitute permanent admission of the alien into the country. Once the  purpose of the parole is fulfilled, the alien is to leave the United States.  According to the associated HAB protocols for adjudicating humanitarian  parole applications, humanitarian parole is an extraordinary measure, to  be used sparingly and not to circumvent normal visa-issuing procedures.", "The humanitarian parole application process begins when HAB receives  an application and supporting evidence (e.g., a doctor\u2019s statement  regarding a physical ailment or a death certificate for a family member)  from the requester, who may be the applicant, the applicant\u2019s attorney, or  someone applying on the applicant\u2019s behalf. Upon receiving an  application, a HAB staff member checks to ensure that the applicant is  seeking humanitarian parole, the required information is entered on the  application form (Form I-131), and the package includes the $305  application processing fee. If the application is complete, the HAB staff  member enters the information from the Form I-131 into the PCTS  database. In turn, the PCTS generates a letter to confirm receipt of the  application and assigns a case number. The adjudicator then runs a  security check on both the applicant (called the beneficiary) and the  person requesting humanitarian parole, if different from the applicant,  against two federally operated security databases.", "If there is no match with immigration or national security databases  indicating a security issue with the person(s) applying for humanitarian  parole, the HAB Chief (or designee) signs the confirmation-of-receipt  letter, which is sent to the applicant or the person applying on his or her  behalf. The HAB staff then create a working case file. Urgent cases, such  as those related to medical treatment, are placed in red folders and given  higher priority over less urgent cases, which are placed in green folders.

The exercise of discretion requires  that an adjudicator take into account applicable immigration law,  regulations, policy and a consideration of the totality of the circumstances  of the case including any significant mitigating factors.

The denial rate for Haitian applicants was 92 percent; in  contrast, applicants from Lebanon had the lowest denial rate\u201445 percent.  According to HAB officials, the higher denial rate for Haitians may be in  part a result of a high number of applications made by Haitians applying  for humanitarian parole on behalf of relatives who did not qualify as  derivative beneficiaries (spouses and dependent children) under the  Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act (HRIFA) of 1998. For example,  an applicant might have applied on behalf of a sibling or extended relative  who did not meet the requirements of the Act or those of the humanitarian  parole program. With respect to applicants from Lebanon, HAB officials  told us that the July 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah had  generated applications for humanitarian parole under special urgent  circumstances that probably produced a high grant rate.

First, the facts and circumstances of  each application varied, and it is not expected that the grant/denial  recommendation rate would be the same for all adjudicators because they  do not all review the same applications. Second, each adjudicator brings a  different background and work experience to the position. Thus, the  adjudicators might judge the facts and circumstances of the same  application somewhat differently. Third, no individual adjudicator has sole  authority to make the final adjudication decision.

HAB has two documents\u2014the Protocol for Humanitarian  Parole Requests and the Standard Operating Procedures for  Humanitarian Paroles\u2014that provide detailed instructions on how to  adjudicate and process humanitarian parole applications. The protocols  list the major reasons for humanitarian parole and the factors adjudicators  are to consider given the type of humanitarian parole request. For  example, in considering medical requests, HAB adjudicators are to  consider, among other things, the nature and severity of the medical  condition for which treatment is sought and whether or not the requested  treatment is available in the applicant\u2019s home or neighboring country.  Regarding family reunification, HAB adjudicators are to consider, among  other things, whether the request is designed to circumvent the normal  visa issuance procedures. Appendix II contains more information on  factors HAB adjudicators are to consider when adjudicating humanitarian  parole applications. The procedures call for two adjudicators to review  each application and make a recommendation regarding whether the  application should be approved or denied. Adjudicators are to provide a  short summary explaining their reasoning behind their recommendation in  a text box in PCTS.  Should the two adjudicators disagree, a third  adjudicator, or \u201ctie-breaker,\u201d is asked to review the application and make a  recommendation.

For example, in all cases the PCTS database  showed that at least two adjudicators reviewed each application and had  written an explanation in the designated text box explaining the reasoning  behind their adjudication recommendation. Our direct observation of  PCTS in use confirmed that the edit checks built into PCTS to ensure that  all required steps are taken before an applicant grant or denial letter could  be printed were working. In addition, all hard copy files we reviewed  contained a letter notifying the applicants or their representative of HAB\u2019s  decision and signed by a HAB official. The letters in the files were signed  by the HAB Branch Chief or a designee, indicating that supervisory review  was performed.

Processing some applications took longer than these times, for various  reasons. For example, HAB officials cited delays in obtaining the results of  DNA testing to confirm a family relationship. For fiscal year 2007 through  June 30, 2007, the median time to adjudicate cases increased to 53 days for  grants and 36 days for denials.

For example, as noted above and according to HAB  policies and procedures, two adjudicators are to review each application.  Should the two adjudicators disagree, a third adjudicator, a tie-breaker, is  needed to review the application and make a recommendation. The HAB  Branch Chief or a designee is to review each application and make a final  decision. With only two adjudicators, there is no one to act as a \u201ctie- breaker\u201d because the Branch Chief normally does not assume this role. In  addition, if an applicant\u2019s request for humanitarian parole is denied, he or  she has the opportunity to provide additional information and have HAB  reconsider the application.

The 2006 guidelines state that Web sites should  be designed to facilitate effective human-computer interaction and that if  the content of the Web site does not provide the information needed by  users, it will provide little value no matter how easy it is to use. The  instructions included on the USCIS Web site for how and under what  circumstances to apply for humanitarian parole were limited. For  example, the Web site does not state that to be eligible for humanitarian  parole, applicants must generally have first exhausted other available  avenues of relief, other than in circumstances of compelling humanitarian  emergency or when urgency makes it impractical to do so. The  instructions state that the applicant is to submit a statement on \u201cwhy a  U.S. visa cannot be obtained instead of having to apply for humanitarian  parole\u201d but does not state that an application for a visa generally should  have been made and rejected, again absent urgent circumstances that  make it impractical to do so.", "Further, the written instructions may be confusing to some applicants. For  example, the instructions state that \u201canyone can file an application for  humanitarian parole,\u201d including \u201cthe prospective parolee, a sponsoring  relative, an attorney, or any other interested individual or organization.\u201d  While technically true, the language could lead persons to file and pay the  $305 application fee when they first should have exhausted other  immigration alternatives (such as filing for a visa), except when there are  circumstances that constitute an emergency. This potential lack of  information about the need for most applicants to first exhaust other  immigration alternatives, absent an emergency, leaves open the possibility  that some applicants might not realize that they generally have to have  been denied a visa to request humanitarian parole.

Two attorneys stated that  the brief letters gave them the impression that the applications had not  received sufficient or serious consideration. HAB officials, however,  expressed concern that providing detailed explanations of denials would  lead to reapplications of denials tailored to overcome the original grounds  for the denial, even when the underlying facts of the case had not changed.  This, in their view, would increase the number of potentially frivolous  applications and add to the agency\u2019s overall workload from persons who  were ineligible for humanitarian parole\u2014and slow down the processing  times for genuinely urgent cases. Finally, two attorneys who received  approvals for their clients stated they would have appreciated clearer  instructions about how to obtain the necessary travel documents from an  embassy or consulate.
