This report (1) describes Guam's public infrastructure; (2) describes the types of assistance DOD generally provides and other funding sources that have been used to fund Guam projects; (3) assesses DOD's efforts to revalidate Guam projects under the revised realignment plan; and (4) assesses the cost estimate for Guam's public water and wastewater infrastructure improvements used to support DOD budget requests. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed policies, technical studies, and budget requests. GAO also interviewed DOD and other relevant federal officials as well as visited Guam and met with Guam officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Some investments have been made to improve Guam's public infrastructure in recent years, but many deficiencies and regulatory compliance issues continue to exist. The reliability, capacity, and age of much of the public infrastructure--especially the island's utilities--indicate a need for additional upgrades to be able to meet current and future demands related to the realignment. Further, some infrastructure sectors, such as water and wastewater, face issues complying with federal regulations. Other sectors, such as the fire and police departments, are experiencing staffing and other shortages that affect their ability to serve Guam's current population.", "The majority of the Department of Defense's (DOD) support to defense-affected communities has been historically to provide technical assistance and support community planning and coordination efforts. However, in a few instances DOD has provided public infrastructure funding to communities where proposed basing decisions would generate significant public infrastructure needs that the communities could not support. Generally, DOD's position is that communities should be largely responsible for obtaining funding for public infrastructure requirements related to DOD basing decisions. This funding can come from other federal programs or communities can raise the funds on their own. In the case of Guam, however, some challenges related to limited government revenues and debt capacity has been identified as affecting its ability to do so.", "Despite the reduction of Marines and dependents relocating to Guam, DOD has not yet revalidated the public infrastructure requirements based on the revised realignment plan or differentiated between requirements needed to address long-standing conditions and those related to the realignment. This revalidation is not expected to be completed until 2015. Even so, DOD has requested over $400 million for Guam public infrastructure projects in its budget requests since fiscal year 2012. It is unclear if all of these projects are necessary to the same extent given the reduction in forces. For example, if DOD decides to locate the Marines on the naval base that handles all of its own water/wastewater needs, public water/wastewater improvements would not be needed to support the Marines. Congress has placed limitations on the use of funding, in part until certain information is provided related to the realignment. Without revalidating and differentiating between requirements, DOD cannot clearly identify what Guam public infrastructure requirements are needed to directly support the realignment.", "The $1.3 billion cost estimate for improvements to Guam's water and wastewater systems that DOD has used to support budget requests for fiscal years 2013 and 2014 is not reliable. GAO assessed that the estimate minimally met the best practice criteria for three of the four key characteristics--comprehensive, well documented, and accurate--for a reliable cost estimate as identified in the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide and did not satisfy best practice criteria for the fourth characteristic of being credible.

In May 2006, the Security  Consultative Committee issued the United States-Japan Roadmap for  Realignment Implementation (2006 Roadmap) under which the U.S.  government anticipated relocating some military forces and their  dependents from Okinawa, Japan, to Guam by 2014. At that time, the  plan was for approximately 8,600 Marines and 9,000 dependents to move  to Guam. The Department of Defense (DOD) previously estimated that at  least $1.3 billion was needed to improve Guam\u2019s public infrastructure to  accommodate this relocation. Guam\u2019s public infrastructure includes the  utilities, methods of transportation, equipment, or facilities under the  control of a public entity, such as a power authority, or local government  for use by the public to support the realignment of forces and  dependents. However, after 6 years of unsuccessful attempts to  implement the 2006 Roadmap, the Security Consultative Committee  announced in a joint statement in April 2012 a revised realignment plan  under which approximately 5,000 Marines and 1,300 dependents would  be moved to Guam\u2014approximately 64 percent less than the original  plan. This revised realignment plan has prompted DOD to review the  actions previously planned for Guam under the 2006 Roadmap and their  effects on Guam, including those related to the island\u2019s public  infrastructure.", "We have previously reported on the challenges associated with Guam\u2019s  public infrastructure and the realignment of U.S. forces. For example, we  found in 2009 that Guam\u2019s public infrastructure would likely be  inadequate to meet the increased demand resulting from the original  2006 Roadmap realignment plan and that Guam would need to  significantly expand its existing public infrastructure for electric power  generation, potable water production, wastewater collection and  treatment, and solid waste collection and disposal to provide the needed  additional utility capacity. In that we report, we recommended that DOD  develop a comprehensive plan for DOD\u2019s Guam utility development  efforts to be included with DOD\u2019s comprehensive Guam master plan.  DOD concurred with the recommendation. As we found in May 2013,  however, DOD continues to lack an integrated master plan for its current  overall Asia posture realignment, including its current plans for Guam,  and has not updated its list of utilities and other public infrastructure  requirements for Guam. We, therefore, recommended that as the master  planning process continues over the next several years, DOD should  develop annual updates on the status of planning efforts for appropriate  congressional committees until such time as the master plans are  completed for each geographic segment of the realignment. These  updates should include, but not be limited to, providing congressional  committees with up-to-date information on the status of initiatives,  identified requirements and time frames, and any updated cost  information linked to specific facilities or projects. DOD concurred and  stated that it will provide updates through the completion of the master  planning process.", "In addition, congressional committees have discussed the uncertainty  surrounding cost and schedule information regarding the realignment of  U.S. forces to Guam. With specific respect to Guam\u2019s public  infrastructure, the Senate Armed Services Committee noted in 2012 that,  until provided with details to adequately assess the strategic impact,  feasibility, and affordability of realignment initiatives, it was unwilling to  authorize further obligations of funds for projects on Guam in support of  the relocation, to include investments proposed for public facility and  infrastructure requirements. In 2011 and 2013, Congress restricted the  use of certain DOD funds to support the realignment of Marines until DOD  provided to the congressional defense committees\u2019 specified information  related to its plans to move units to Guam and its overall posture in the  Pacific. The restrictions also imposed limitations on the use of DOD  funds for the development of public infrastructure.", "See H.R. Rep.

We also conducted a site  visit in April 2013 to Guam, where we interviewed the Governor, Speaker  of the Guam Legislature, other Guam legislators, Guam Auditor General,  and various officials from 12 Government of Guam agencies and  departments representing the various public infrastructure sectors on  Guam likely to be affected by the realignment. The public infrastructure  sectors covered by our review were chosen based on inclusion in (1) prior  Government of Guam and DOD project lists developed for the 2006  Roadmap realignment plan, (2) DOD budget requests, (3) prior GAO  reports on the realignment of U.S. forces to Guam, and (4) federal agency  inspector general reports, as well as those sectors identified by  Government of Guam and DOD officials during our interviews. The  following eight sectors are included in our review: electric power, water  and wastewater, port, solid waste, public health, law enforcement, fire  department, and education infrastructure. The highways and other roads  sector is not included in our review because Government of Guam and  DOD officials did not identify it as a sector likely to be adversely affected  by the realignment since existing programs and agencies, such as the  Defense Access Roads and the Department of Transportation\u2019s Federal  Highway Administration, are currently allocating funds for road and  highway improvements on Guam.", "To describe the existing condition of Guam\u2019s public infrastructure, we  reviewed federal inspector general reports, technical studies and  business case analyses, and questionnaires conducted by DOD for the  revised realignment plan. To describe the types of assistance DOD  generally has provided to defense-affected communities and the other  types of funding sources that have been used to fund Guam public  infrastructure projects, we reviewed past congressional hearings records,  DOD documents, and community impact analyses to determine previous  instances of DOD providing public infrastructure funding to communities  as well as Guam\u2019s single audit report schedule of expenditures of federal  grant awards to identify examples of non-DOD, federal grant programs  from which the Government of Guam has received infrastructure funding.  To assess DOD\u2019s efforts to revalidate public infrastructure requirements  under the revised realignment plan and differentiate between  requirements that address Guam\u2019s current public infrastructure needs and  those related to the realignment, we reviewed information on DOD and  the Government of Guam\u2019s planning activities related to public  infrastructure improvements needed to support the revised realignment  plan and compared this information to previous public infrastructure lists  developed by the Government of Guam, DOD, and other federal entities  to support the 2006 Roadmap realignment plan. To determine the extent  to which the cost estimate for Guam\u2019s public water and wastewater  infrastructure improvements used by DOD to support its budget requests  was developed according to the characteristics of a reliable cost estimate,  we reviewed the cost estimating methodology and compared them to the  cost estimating guidance in GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and Assessment  Guide: Best Practices for Developing and Managing Capital Program  Costs. To determine the reliability of the numerical data provided to us  by DOD organizations for all of our objectives, we collected information  on how the data was collected, managed, and used through interviews of  relevant DOD and federal agency officials. By assessing this information  against GAO data quality standards, we determined that the data  presented in our findings were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. Appendix I provides a more detailed description of our scope and  methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2013 through  December 2013, in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

Port Authority  officials told us that the Port has not been modernized since it was  constructed in the 1960s and that, typically, most ports are modernized  every 20 years. According to Port Authority officials, to accommodate the  realignment, the Port requires building modifications, selected  modifications to yards where cargo is offloaded, and facility expansion, as  well as significant structural integrity improvements to the wharf. For  example, the port requires a lot of maintenance due to corrosive ocean  waters, typhoons, earthquakes, and years of maintenance neglect. Some  of the specific improvements identified include site expansion, utilities  upgrades, bulkhead fortification, and building renovations. In 2010, DOD  provided the Port $50 million in funding to begin some of these  improvements. According to DOD officials, this $50 million is the amount  needed to directly address the requirements of the realignment and will  be used for building modifications and modifications to the yard where  cargo is offloaded as well as expansion of selected port facilities.  In  addition, the Port Authority continues to seek non-federal funding sources  to allow for successful operations and execution of its mission.

Medically underserved areas are areas designated as having too few  primary care providers, high infant mortality, high poverty, and/or high  elderly population.

Much of OEA\u2019s assistance in the past was  directed toward communities that lost military and civilian personnel  because of the closure or major realignment of a base. However,  because the 2005 BRAC round and other DOD initiatives created  significant growth at many bases, OEA also has assisted defense- affected communities with growth planning. For example, one defense- affected community used OEA funding to hire personnel, maintain offices,  and conduct planning. Another community\u2019s local redevelopment  authority used OEA funding to hire dedicated professional staff and  contract with a consultant to prepare a redevelopment plan.

For  example, OEA officials noted the public infrastructure funding associated  with the construction of Trident submarine bases at Bangor, Washington,  and Kings Bay, Georgia. In these two instances, DOD provided millions of  dollars in funding for public infrastructure projects to the local  communities surrounding Bangor and Kings Bay because DOD\u2019s public  infrastructure needs would exceed those already in place and serving the  communities. During the 1970s, DOD decided to build submarine bases  at Bangor and Kings Bay and determined that the subsequent growth  would generate significant public infrastructure needs that the local  communities could not support. In both cases, the expansion of the bases  would require significant construction and result in the eventual influx of  significant amounts of personnel to the surrounding communities for  which the local governments\u2019 public infrastructure was generally  inadequate. Congress authorized the Secretary of Defense to provide  financial assistance to the local communities for the costs of providing  increased municipal services and facilities. For both programs, DOD  assigned OEA with responsibility for program management.

This funding  can come from other, non-DOD federal programs, with DOD advocating  that existing federal programs should be leveraged as much as possible.  Along these lines, several federal agencies have existing programs that  have funded public infrastructure improvements on Guam in recent years.  For example, EPA, which assists Territories under its Environmental  Protection Consolidated Grants program, provided Guam with almost  $6.8 million in fiscal year 2012 to fund drinking water and wastewater  system improvements. The Department of the Interior\u2019s Office of Insular  Affairs provided Guam with over $6 million in fiscal year 2013 in capital  improvement grants to fund a variety of infrastructure needs. Table 1  shows examples of public infrastructure programs for which Guam has  received funding from non-DOD federal programs in the last few years.", "In addition to obtaining funding through non-DOD federal programs, local  communities can also raise their own funds for public infrastructure  projects. In the case of Guam, two key challenges have been identified as  affecting its ability to raise funds. Specifically, according to Government of  Guam officials, limited government revenues and limited debt capacity  due to its statutory debt limitation hinder its ability to finance its public  infrastructure projects. First, Guam has faced an operating deficit over the  past few years and current revenues are not sufficient to support  operational requirements. The Governor of Guam told us that without a  major increase in economic activity and the resulting increase in  revenues, the administration will be unable to address additional public  infrastructure requirements other than those necessary for basic  operations and debt service requirements. Government of Guam officials  explained that the major revenue challenges for the government are the  inability of taxpayers to pay taxes, the inability of the government to  access military bases to conduct random inspections to ensure military  contractors and vendors are in compliance with Guam\u2019s tax laws, and the  large amount of DOD-controlled land on Guam that is not available for  economic development. Two Department of the Interior reports identified  that Guam\u2019s operating revenues challenges are partly a result of poor tax   At the time of those reports, the Department of the  collection efforts.Interior estimated that persistent deficiencies in Guam\u2019s tax collection  process were resulting in lost tax revenues of at least $23.5 million each  year. Guam officials told us that since those reports were issued they  have taken steps to address the findings in the reports and improve their  tax collection efforts but that the taxpayer\u2019s inability to pay will always be  a challenge.", "We have previously found that although communities near military growth  locations can face growth-related challenges in the short term, such as  challenges in providing additional infrastructure, they can expect to  realize economic benefits in the long term, such as increased revenue.  An increase in military and federal civilian employees on Guam stemming  from the realignment may be a potential source of additional revenue. For  instance, Guam receives federal income taxes paid by military and civilian  employees of the U.S. government stationed in Guam. Under section 30   the Internal Revenue  of the Organic Act of Guam and a related statute,Service reimburses Guam for the income taxes it collects from federal  civilian and military personnel assigned to Guam. The Internal Revenue  Service pays section 30 funding to Guam annually. The money  represents the income tax paid by federal employees and military service  members who work on Guam but not collected locally. This amounted to  $52 million in 2010, and this amount is expected to increase with the  realignment thereby providing the Government of Guam with increased  revenue. However, Guam officials told us they were concerned that since  the composition of the Marines to be relocated to Guam under the revised  realignment plan would be mostly rotational, they would not be  reimbursed for the income taxes since these personnel may be stationed  on Guam for less than 6 months. In response to these concerns, DOD  recently announced procedures to account for and reimburse to Guam  income tax paid by all U.S. Marines\u2014whether part of a rotational unit or  permanently stationed on island. With DOD\u2019s announcement, according  to Government of Guam officials, Marines stationed in Guam will be  included under section 30, regardless of how long they are on Guam,  thereby providing the Government of Guam with additional revenue.", "The second challenge identified as affecting Guam\u2019s ability to raise funds  is its statutory debt limitation. The Government of Guam\u2019s ability to  borrow funds to help pay for public infrastructure projects and programs  related to the realignment may be constrained because of a statutory debt  limitation contained in the Organic Act of Guam, depending on the form  and terms of the prospective debt. Section 11 of the act places a  limitation on government borrowing, limiting Guam\u2019s public indebtedness  to no more than 10 percent of the aggregate tax valuation of property on  Guam. However, not all government obligations are included in the debt  ceiling. For instance, section 11 of the Organic Act notes that bonds or  other obligations of the Government of Guam payable solely from  revenues derived from any public improvement or undertaking shall not  be considered public indebtedness as defined in the Organic Act of  Guam. As such, they would not be counted towards the government\u2019s  statutory debt limitation. However, whether certain obligations fall into this  exception and should not be included in the Government of Guam\u2019s debt  limit calculation has generally been a highly litigated issue and may be  determined on a case-by-case basis by the Guam courts.Government of Guam has determined and decided on the form and terms  of debt it plans to incur to help fund off-base projects and programs  related to the realignment, it is unknown what effect this debt limitation  provision will have on the ability of the Government of Guam to incur debt  for the purposes of the realignment.", "Despite these challenges, the Government of Guam has been able to  obtain funding through issuing bonds in the past. For example, in  December 2011, the Government of Guam successfully issued $235  million in bonds to pay unpaid tax refunds and past due cost of living  allowances to certain retired government employees. These bonds were  financed from revenues generated from the island\u2019s business privilege  tax. Further, in April 2011, the Government of Guam successfully sold  $90.7 million worth of bonds to construct a new Guam museum and for  other projects that benefit Guam\u2019s tourism industry, such as the  restoration of a community center and bell tower and the construction of a  historic monument and plaza to commemorate Ferdinand Magellan\u2019s visit  to Guam. These bonds were financed from revenues generated from  Guam\u2019s hotel occupancy tax. These successful bond offerings  demonstrate that a market may exist among investors for the Government  of Guam\u2019s debt, which could be a potential source of funding for its  necessary public infrastructure improvements. Further, Guam\u2019s  autonomous government agencies related to public infrastructure\u2014 Power, Waterworks, and Port Authorities\u2014have the ability to issue bonds  for infrastructure improvements. Bonds issued by autonomous agencies  are often backed by the agencies\u2019 own revenue streams, such as  customer rates. Guam officials cautioned, however, there is a limit to how  much they can raise rates on their customers to increase revenue,  particularly since for some utilities, Guam already has relatively high rates  when compared to other insular areas and Hawaii. Like other bonds  issued by the Government of Guam, the determination of whether a bond  issued by one of these agencies would count against the Government of  Guam\u2019s statutory debt ceiling also depends upon the form and terms of  the debt and can be a highly litigated issue."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Revalidated Its Guam Public Infrastructure Requirements or Differentiated Between Requirements to Address Long- Standing Conditions and Those Related to the Revised Realignment Plan", "paragraphs": ["DOD has requested funding from Congress for projects to improve  Guam\u2019s public infrastructure.

The National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 contained similar restrictions, and  in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013,  Congress rescinded $21 million of the $33 million appropriated to DOD  for fiscal year 2012 for Guam. OEA requested $139.4 million for public  infrastructure projects on Guam for fiscal year 2013. Congress  appropriated $243.4 million for OEA for fiscal year 2013,no authorization for use of the funding for public infrastructure projects on  Guam. Consequently, according to an OEA official, because DOD did not  have the authority to spend the funds for Guam, $119.4 million was  reprogrammed in July 2013 to address shortcomings elsewhere in DOD.  As a result, these funds are no longer available to DOD for Guam public  infrastructure projects. These congressional actions have implications for  DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2014 budget request. For example, in its fiscal year  2014 budget request, DOD requested $273.3 million to fund  improvements to the water treatment system on Guam. These funds were  intended to fund the second phase of those improvements, as DOD\u2019s  expectation was that the $106.4 million requested for fiscal year 2013  would have funded the first phase. While DOD is awaiting congressional  action on its fiscal year 2014 budget request, it appears that DOD\u2019s  request is in advance of need since there was no phase one of the water  and wastewater treatment funding and the funds were reprogrammed. As  of October 2014, bills pending in Congress varied on the extension of the  restriction on the use of funds for the realignment of Marines to Guam,  including the restriction related to public infrastructure. While the House   but provided  bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 would  repeal the restriction from the previous year, the version of the bill  reported by the Senate Armed Services Committee included an extension  of the restriction on use of funds to implement the realignment and public  infrastructure funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Revalidated the Guam Public Infrastructure Projects Included in Budget Requests or Differentiated Between Current Requirements and Those for the Realignment", "paragraphs": ["DOD has not revalidated the projects identified in its budget requests to  reflect the smaller DOD population associated with the revised  realignment plan.

OEA said that some of these  projects, such as the artifact repository, should not be affected despite the  change in the realignment plans because it is needed to fulfill federal  historic preservation requirements and would be required under either  plan. However, it is unclear if other projects, such as the water and  wastewater improvements and the mental health facility, are still  necessary or necessary to the same extent given the significant reduction  in forces under the revised realignment plan and the as yet undetermined  location of the main Marine Corps installation on the island. According to  DOD officials, the projects initially validated by the Economic Adjustment  Committee for the 2006 realignment plan and included in DOD budget  requests will be reassessed based on the revised realignment plan as  part of the supplemental EIS process to be completed in 2015.", "DOD also has not clearly differentiated between requirements to address  long-standing conditions in Guam\u2019s public infrastructure and those to  address increased capacity to support the new realignment plan for most  sectors. As a result, it is unclear to what extent the public infrastructure  projects in DOD\u2019s budget requests are needed to support the  realignment. For example, one of the possible locations for constructing  and operating the main Marine installation being considered under the  ongoing supplemental EIS is Naval Base Guam in the southern part of  the island. However, this base handles all of its own wastewater needs  and gets its potable water from its own wells and the Fena Reservoir,  thus not requiring DOD to rely on the public water and wastewater  systems. If this location is chosen, it would raise questions about the  funding DOD has requested for making improvements to the water and  wastewater treatment plant that DOD had justified by citing the need for  additional capacity to support the additional troops associated with the  realignment. Similarly, DOD has not estimated the extent to which the  mental health facility or school bus acquisition projects would actually be  used by personnel associated with the new realignment, none of whom  were on Guam in 2012 or will be on Guam in 2013 or 2014 even though  DOD cited the additional capacity associated with the realignment as a  basis for its budget request.", "For the electricity sector, we found that DOD has taken steps to  differentiate between requirements related to the realignment and those  to address long-standing conditions. In February 2013, DOD asked the  Guam Power Authority to model what upgrades would be needed to meet  the increased demand associated with three of the possible five locations  for constructing and operating the main Marine Corps installation. The  Power Authority provided DOD with the specific electric transmission and  distribution improvements that would be needed and their estimated costs  which ranged from $25 million to $35 million depending on the location.  However, according to our discussions with Government of Guam and  DOD officials, DOD has not asked for similar analyses from other affected  Guam agencies or begun a comprehensive analysis across all public  infrastructure sectors to differentiate between requirements to address  existing conditions and what is needed specifically to address additional  capacity for the realignment.", "The Joint Guam Program Office and Naval Facilities Engineering  Command officials told us that they are currently conducting assessments  to reexamine and revalidate the need, scope, and funding required for all  utilities and infrastructure projects during DOD\u2019s development of the  supplemental EIS.

Moreover, DOD has not conducted a comprehensive analysis to  differentiate between requirements to address long-standing Guam public  infrastructure deficiencies and extra capacity to support the realignment.  Without such an analysis, DOD will not have the information to identify  accurately the costs directly attributable to the realignment and help  justify its budget requests to Congress to help pay for the portion of the  projects that are attributable to the extra capacity to support the  realignment. Both Guam and DOD officials also agreed that developing  this type of information would better determine what appropriate amount  of Guam public infrastructure improvements DOD should fund and those  Guam should fund.

During the development of the EIS, DOD, the Guam Waterworks  Authority, and the EPA cooperated to identify and prioritize water and  wastewater projects island-wide that were necessary to support the 2006  Marine Corps realignment plan. As part of this effort, DOD (as the EIS  sponsor) paid for and EPA (as an EIS cooperating agency) managed a  contract with an environmental firm for the development of a refined  Guam water and wastewater infrastructure cost estimate. The contractor  updated the original 2010 estimate on several occasions with the latest  being in September 2012. That update indicates that approximately $1.3  billion in improvements are needed for Guam\u2019s water and wastewater  infrastructure to address existing deficiencies, including out-of-compliance  facilities, as well as requirements to support the Marine Corps  realignment. DOD used this cost estimate to support its fiscal year 2013  and 2014 budget requests for Guam water and wastewater  improvements. However, when reviewing this cost estimate, we were  unable to determine which projects within the $1.3 billion estimate were  specifically for capacity increases due to the military realignment and  associated with the fiscal years 2013 and 2014 budget requests. In  assessing the estimate against best practices, we determined that this  estimate is not reliable because it does not include all relevant costs, is  based on limited data, and, as documented, lacks many of the key  characteristics to be considered a reliable cost estimate.

Furthermore, the guide indicates that these best  practices can be organized into the four characteristics of a reliable cost  estimate that management can use for making informed program and  budget decisions. Specifically, an estimate is considered comprehensive when it accounts for all possible costs associated  with a program, is structured in sufficient detail to ensure that costs  are neither omitted nor double counted, and documents all cost- influencing assumptions; well-documented when supporting documentation explains the  process, sources, and methods used to create the estimate, contains  the underlying data used to develop the estimate, and is adequately  reviewed and approved by management; accurate when it is not overly conservative or optimistic, is based on  an assessment of the costs most likely to be incurred, and is regularly  updated so that it always reflects the current status of the program;  and credible when any limitations of the analysis because of uncertainty  or sensitivity surrounding data or assumptions are discussed, the  estimate\u2019s results are cross-checked, and an independent cost  estimate is conducted by a group outside the acquiring organization to  determine whether other estimating methods produce similar results.", "Each of these four characteristics consists of several best practices (see  appendix II for a summary of these practices and our Cost Estimating and  Assessment Guide for more details on the individual best practices).

According  to documentation attached to DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2013 budget, DOD  emphasized that it cannot continue the practice of starting programs that  prove to be unaffordable and according to our Cost Estimating and  Assessment Guide, whether or not a program is affordable depends a  great deal on the quality of its cost estimate. Without a reliable estimate  that is updated in response to program changes, Congress is hindered in  its ability to assess budgets and affordability.

Furthermore, DOD and the Navy\u2019s JGPO have not clearly identified which  Guam public infrastructure requirements and costs directly support the  additional capacity needed for the realignment and which address current  deficiencies. In addition, OEA did not fully incorporate cost estimating  best practices in developing its cost estimate for Guam\u2019s water and  wastewater infrastructure projects that was used to support previous  budget requests. Our analysis of the cost estimate and its updates found  that the estimate satisfies a small portion of the best practice criteria and  thus is not a reliable estimate to support budget requests.

Without reliable cost estimates developed for the realignment  plan in a manner consistent with GAO\u2019s cost estimating guide, DOD will  be hampered in achieving its affordability goal of not starting a program  without firm cost goals in place and may be seeking funds for public  infrastructure projects that may no longer be needed.

DOD concurred that the need and scope of additional,  realignment-related Guam public infrastructure projects will be revalidated  as necessary based on the results of the analysis in the ongoing  supplemental EIS. However, for the Guam wastewater public  infrastructure project, DOD commented that the requested funding is not  contingent upon the size of the realignment but rather represents funding  for improvements to address noncompliance with EPA regulations. As a  result, DOD concluded that the requests associated with the wastewater  treatment facilities do not warrant realignment-related revalidation.  We  disagree.  First, while DOD\u2019s justifications for the wastewater treatment  funding cite the need for remedies and residents\u2019 current needs, the  justifications also state that the funding and project is required to support  growth resulting from the military realignment. Given that the size of the  realignment has been reduced significantly, a revalidation of the  wastewater project remains warranted. Second, without a revalidation of  the wastewater project, it will continue to be unclear to what extent the  requested funds for the project are still necessary or necessary to the  same extent given the significant reduction in forces under the revised  realignment plan and the as yet undetermined location of the main Marine  Corps installation. Specifically, as discussed in the report, a possible  location for the main Marine installation is Naval Base Guam, which  handles its own wastewater needs and does not require DOD to rely on  the public wastewater system.  If this location is chosen, DOD would  appear to no longer have a basis for its cited need for additional  wastewater capacity to support the realignment as part of its budget  request justifications.", "DOD stated that it partially concurred with our second recommendation to  conduct a comprehensive analysis across all applicable public  infrastructure sectors to determine what infrastructure requirements and  costs are needed to address long-standing deficiencies in Guam\u2019s  infrastructure and which are needed to directly support the realignment.  DOD noted that a determination of realignment-related infrastructure  requirements and costs is an anticipated outcome of the supplemental  EIS. DOD\u2019s comments, however, do not address whether it plans to  clearly differentiate between those infrastructure requirements and costs  needed to address existing deficiencies in Guam\u2019s infrastructure and  those needed to directly support the additional capacity associated with  the realignment, as we specifically recommended.  Doing so is important,  because as explained in the report, clearly differentiating between  existing public infrastructure deficiencies and any additional capacity  needed to support the realignment would help DOD more accurately  identify the costs directly attributable to the realignment.  DOD\u2019s analysis  would then provide congressional decision makers with information they  need to appropriately fund requests for public infrastructure projects on  Guam.", "DOD partially concurred with our third recommendation to fully  incorporate the best practices identified by GAO for developing high  quality cost estimates, as future cost estimates for Guam public  infrastructure projects are developed. In response to this  recommendation, DOD stated that future realignment-related cost  estimates and budget submissions will be developed in accordance with  DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation and that final engineering cost  estimates for specific projects will be developed in the normal course of  executing the fiscal year 2014 program. While budget submissions must  conform to DOD guidance, OMB guidance and our cost estimating and  assessment guide, which is a compilation of cost estimating best  practices from across industry and government, confirm that cost  estimates should conform to best practices and follow certain specific  steps to ensure that they are reliable and credible. Development of  reliable and credible cost estimates is important, whether as part of  budget submissions or in advance of those submissions. As discussed in  this report, our analysis of DOD\u2019s cost estimate for Guam\u2019s largest public  infrastructure project\u2014the water and wastewater treatment facility\u2014 demonstrates that weaknesses exist in DOD\u2019s cost estimating practices  that, if left unaddressed, increase the likelihood that costs will increase.  By not following best practices in preparing its cost estimate, DOD cannot  ensure that the estimate is reliable and credible. As DOD continues to  provide information to Congress regarding the realignment, we believe  DOD has the opportunity to improve the quality of its estimates by  applying cost estimating best practices in its approach.
