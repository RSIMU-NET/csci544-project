However, when we attempted to find supporting documents in iPERMS,  we found that this system had not been consistently populated with the  required service member documents, resulting in incomplete personnel  records. For example, when testing our sampled transactions, we  discovered that documents, such as orders to support a special duty  assignment, permanent change of station orders, and release or  discharge from active duty, that should have been in iPERMS were not.  The Army has designated the Human Resources Command as the owner  of iPERMS; however, local installation personnel offices across the  country are responsible for entering most documents into individual  service member iPERMS accounts. We found that documents needed to  support pay transactions are not in iPERMS because (1) Army Regulation  600-8-104 does not require the specific personnel forms to be included  and (2) some pay-supporting documents are finance documents and are  not considered personnel documents.documents should also be maintained in the Army\u2019s central repository of  pay-supporting documentation.", "In addition, the Army\u2019s efforts to achieve auditability are compounded by  payroll system limitations.
