Instead, the Army determined that each of the remaining 10 combat divisions would comprise 3 fully active ground maneuver brigades.

In his March 1996 testimony, the Secretary of Defense said that in recent years, DOD had taken advantage of the drawdown and slowed modernization in order to fully fund those expenditures that guarantee near-term readiness, such as spare parts, training, and maintenance. As a result, modernization funding in fiscal year 1997 was said to be the lowest it had been in many years, about one-third of what it was in fiscal  year 1985.

In addition, the Army did not authorize 19,200 positions that are needed to bring some existing units up to their full required strength.

Some of these assumptions were favorable in that they minimized risks to U.S. forces. For example, to be consistent with defense guidance, TAA assumed that U.S. forces had immediate access to ports and airfields in the theater of operations, faced limited chemical attacks, and were immediately available for redeployment if previously committed to OOTWs. Less optimistic assumptions would have led to higher support requirements. On the other hand, the Army did not consider all available resources to satisfy its unmet support force requirements, such as some support force capabilities that currently reside in the Army\u2019s eight National Guard divisions and the TDA force, and support available from outside contractors and defense civilians. Also, while TAA is an analytically rigorous process, some aspects of its methodology could be improved. For example, TAA lacks mechanisms for adjusting to change during its 2-year cycle; some model inputs, such as consumption of fuel and water, were not sufficiently scrutinized; and sensitivity analyses were generally not used to measure the impact of alternative assumptions and resourcing decisions on risk.

The support forces identified by the model are then matched to actual Army support units.", "At this point, priorities are established among the competing requirements, and approaches are discussed to mitigate the risks of unmet requirements. One approach has been to authorize fewer personnel to some units than are required to meet their full wartime requirement. Additionally, the active/reserve force mix is examined on a branch by branch basis to assess whether sufficient active forces are available to meet early deployment requirements.

However, TAA 2003 found that about 79,000 of the more than 188,000 support force positions required in the first 30 days of the first MRC do not arrive on time because the Army lacks sufficient numbers of active support forces to meet these requirements and must rely on reserve forces instead. This represents 30 percent of the 260,000 total authorized Army force needed during this time period, and 42 percent of the Army support forces required. Branches with the most late arrivals include engineering, transportation, quartermaster, and medical\u2014branches with high concentrations of reserve personnel. This risk is exacerbated when the Army relies on reserve forces during the first 7 days of the war fight. Almost one-quarter of the reserve support forces assigned to meet requirements during the first 30 days (19,200 positions) are needed in the first 7 days of the MRC.", "The 30-day time frame to mobilize and deploy reserve support forces is substantiated in classified studies by the RAND Corporation that examined the availability of reserve forces and by Army officials responsible for reserve mobilization activities. The Army estimates that mobilizing reserve forces, from unit recall to arrival at the port of embarkation, takes about 15 days for a small support unit and 31 days for a large unit. Personnel may be transported by air, but their equipment likely will be shipped by sea. Depending on whether the equipment sails from the east or west coast and to which theater, it will take an additional 12 to 30 days to arrive, unload, and assemble the equipment. Therefore, a small reserve unit will be available for the war fight no earlier than 27 days after call-up, and a large reserve unit will require at least 43 days.  (See app. II for a listing of mobilization tasks and the time required to complete them.)", "OSD officials believe that if it were possible to reduce late risk by making more active forces available during the first 30 days, strategic lift constraints would limit the number of active support forces that could be moved to theater.

The second MRC will have access to relatively small numbers of active support forces, most of them having deployed already in support of the first MRC. Consequently, the Army must rely on reserve component forces to meet most of its requirements in the second MRC. Only 12 percent of the support forces needed in the second MRC are active, compared with 47 percent in the first MRC. Branches with low representation of active forces in the second MRC include engineer, transportation, quartermaster, and artillery.

Drawing from its active, National Guard, and Reserve forces, the Army identified 528,000 authorized TOE positions that it could apply to its 672,000 Army requirement to fight two MRCs, leaving an initial imbalance of 144,000 positions. The Army\u2019s total TOE force is actually higher than 528,000 positions (see table 2.1), but some resources are excluded from consideration in TAA, such as the eight National Guard divisions the Army considers as a strategic hedge, and forces needed to perform unique mission requirements.", "The Army then analyzed all of its support forces at Corps level and above to determine how it could reduce the risk associated with its shortfall. This resulted in the Army shifting about 66,000 active and reserve positions from support units excess to the war fight to higher priority support units. Units providing fire fighting, engineering, and medical support were among those selected for conversion. After these conversions, the Army was left with a shortfall of about 78,000 positions. This shortfall was allocated as follows. Some existing active support units were authorized fewer positions than are needed to meet their full wartime requirement. In TAA 2003, these amounted to about 19,200 positions. The expectation is that these understrength units would be brought up to full strength before being mobilized. These additional personnel would come from the Individual Ready Reserve or new recruits. The remaining shortfall of 58,400 positions represents units that are needed to meet a wartime requirement but have not been allocated any position authorizations, that is, units that exist only on paper. Table 2.2 shows how each of the Army\u2019s major support branches will be affected by the conversions and where the remaining 58,400 positions in vacant units reside. Among the branches benefiting most were quartermaster and transportation, which accounted for more than half of the initial shortfall in totally vacant units.", "Two additional actions were taken by the Army to mitigate the risk associated with its remaining unmet requirements.

Casualties are computed through a model that uses the Army\u2019s full two-conflict requirement of 672,000, rather than the 528,000 authorized Army positions to meet that requirement. The number of casualties is a function of the population at risk, which is reflected in defense guidance; the wounded in action rate, which is calculated in the TAA modeling; and the disease, nonbattle injury rate, which is established by the Army Surgeon General. Campaign simulations generate the combatant battle casualties, which accounts for about 80 percent of all casualties. The remaining 20 percent are extended to support forces with algorithms. Variables that are considered in arriving at casualty estimates include the battlefield location (e.g., brigade area, division rear, and communications zone); intensity of the war fight (e.g., defend, attack, and delay); and the weapon systems involved. The Army uses a high-resolution model that pits individual weapon systems against one another to project equipment and personnel killed or injured for a multitude of platforms (e.g., 12 different types of tanks, light armored vehicles, and helicopters), according to their lethality under various conditions (e.g., moving, stationary, and exposed).", "Once the Army computes its casualties for each MRC, it does not increase its force requirements to provide casualty replacements.

TAA assumed that U.S. forces would have immediate, unobstructed access to ports and airfields in the theater of operation. An adverse case excursion was modeled in which immediate access to primary ports and airfields was denied in a one-MRC scenario. This excursion reflected a requirement for additional positions above that needed for two nearly simultaneous MRCs when it was assumed that immediate access would be available.

For the reserve call-up to occur on the same day as the first deployment of U.S. forces assumes that it occurs at the earliest feasible opportunity.", "Limited chemical use. TAA assumed limited use of chemical weapons by enemy forces in each of the MRCs. Because of the constrained amount of chemical weapons modeled, some TAA participants did not believe the scenario provided a realistic representation. A more intensive chemical attack was modeled in a single MRC adverse case excursion. Results of this excursion indicated a requirement for additional support forces, but this is not reflected in the overall TAA base case requirement of 672,000 spaces.

For example, fuel off-loaded onto a pier will remain on the pier until transportation is available to move it.

An official at Forces Command, which has a 1998 active component TDA of about 13,000, told us that workload-based manpower management had not been a high priority in recent years because of turmoil in the workforce caused by downsizing and reallocation of workload due to base realignments and closures.

In October 1996, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs stated that a challenge to adopting workload-based management will be changing the perspective of resourcing officials from a philosophy of managing personnel resources based on budget to managing personnel resources based on workload.", "Although managing to budget allows commanders to allocate resources based on available budgets, we believe that using it as the sole-allocation process does not provide the commander a vision of what cannot be done as a result of declining budgets and may discourage commands from identifying efficiencies if they know they will be receiving a cut regardless.", "In addition, managing to budget does not provide an analytical basis on which to make trade-offs among TDA workload priorities. For example, during deliberations for TAA 2001, which was completed in 1993, an attempt by major command representatives to allocate a cut in TDA positions among their commands ended in gridlock, in part due to the lack of an analytical basis on which to divide the resources. The result was that each command\u2019s TDA military positions were cut by 7.5 percent, regardless of its individual missions or requirements. Such a cut impacts some commands more than others. For example, Intelligence and Security Command officials told us that 75 percent of its officers were controlled by other agencies; therefore, it could not eliminate any of these positions. As a result, an across-the-board 7.5 percent reduction applied to Intelligence and Security Command officers fell disproportionately on the remaining 25 percent of its officers that the command had authority over.", "Efforts to allocate resources based on workload will require the support of the Army leadership to be successful.

One criterion for determining whether an internal control weakness is material is if it significantly weakens safeguards against waste.

Further, officials in the commands we visited pointed to budgetary challenges to converting military positions to civilians. First, the commands are reluctant to convert military positions to civilian positions because they cannot be assured that operations and maintenance money, which funds civilian pay, will be available to hire a new civilian. Officials told us that the transfer of a military position to a civilian position is authorized years before the civilian is hired and sometimes by the year of execution, inadequate operations and maintenance funding prevent the command from hiring a new civilian.

Medical reservists are in turn called up to back fill the medical treatment facilities. In TAA 2003, about 5,000 requirements were filled with predesignated TDA medical positions. While it may not be feasible to back fill certain specialties with reservists, two features of the medical model could be reviewed for broader application.
