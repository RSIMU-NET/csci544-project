As you know, last month we issued a major new series of reports, entitled Performance and Accountability Series: Major Management Challenges and Program Risks, and an update of our high risk series. Collectively, the reports show that long-standing performance and management challenges hinder the federal government\u2019s efforts to achieve results. The report series also highlighted numerous improvements that agencies need to make in their performance, management, and accountability. Making these improvements will require the sustained efforts of the leadership and staff within agencies. At the same time, the report series also underscored the pivotal role that the federal government\u2019s central management agencies\u2014 in particular, OMB\u2014must play in guiding and overseeing agencies\u2019 efforts to address the shortcomings that we identified and to implement the changes necessary to improve performance.", "Today, as requested by the Subcommittee, we will cover three major points. First, we will provide an outline of OMB\u2019s wide-ranging management responsibilities and note that the question of whether to integrate or separate management and budget functions has been long debated. Second, we will discuss the effectiveness of OMB\u2019s management leadership, which, in our view, has been uneven. Finally, we will discuss the factors that appear to contribute to progress in sustaining improvements in federal management. As agreed, our statement today is based on, and updates as appropriate, the testimony we provided on these three points when we appeared before this Subcommittee last May.

However, the creation of OMB did not ensure that an institutionalized capacity for governmentwide management leadership would be sustained, nor did it establish how OMB should balance its budget and management responsibilities. As a result, observers have continued to debate how to best ensure that management issues can be effectively considered within the context of\u2014yet without being overwhelmed by\u2014the budget process. Some observers have advocated integrating the two functions, while others have proposed the creation of dedicated offices or a separate agency to provide governmentwide management leadership.", "Prior OMB reorganizations, reflecting these different points of view, have alternated between seeking to more directly integrate management into the budget review process and creating separate management offices. Previous congressional and OMB attempts to elevate the status of management by creating separate management units within OMB sought to ensure that an adequate level of effort was focused on management issues. Underscoring its concern that management issues receive appropriate attention, Congress established the DDM position to provide top-level leadership to improve the management of the federal government.", "In 1994, OMB reorganized to integrate its budget analysis, management review, and policy development roles, in an initiative called \u201cOMB 2000.\u201d This reorganization was the most recent of a series of attempts to bolster OMB\u2019s management capacity and influence.

The first Governmentwide Performance Plan, as required by the Results Act, was prepared as an integrated component of the President\u2019s 1999 Budget; this year\u2019s Plan, released on Monday with the President\u2019s 2000 Budget, again describes three aspects of federal government performance: fiscal, management, and program. In OMB\u2019s view, the performance of government programs is inextricably linked to the fiscal and economic environment and the management framework in which they operate.", "In our assessment of the Fiscal Year 1999 Governmentwide Performance Plan, we noted that the separate management performance section within the plan was a useful approach that added essential context and depth to the Plan. This year\u2019s Plan follows a structure similar to that developed last year, including (1) a discussion of the Administration\u2019s High Impact Agencies initiative, which focuses on defining service delivery commitments, developing customer and employee satisfaction measures, using interagency partnerships, and enhancing electronic access; and (2) 24 specific priority management objectives (PMO), many of which are also on GAO\u2019s high risk list. These PMOs were selected by OMB as areas in need of real change and are intended to create a clear set of priorities for the Administration\u2019s management improvement efforts.", "PMOs included in the Fiscal Year 2000 Governmentwide Performance Plan. However, in our assessment of the Fiscal Year 1999 Plan, we noted that there needed to be a clearer and stronger linkage between these PMOs and the underlying agency annual performance plans. Specifically, by improving the discussion of the program performance consequences of the PMOs, OMB could better ensure that agencies develop relevant goals and strategies in their performance plans and clarify agency accountability for specific results. We recommended that OMB ensure that agencies incorporate appropriate goals and strategies in their annual performance plans and describe their relevance to achieving the priority management objectives described in the governmentwide performance plan.", "Today, we will highlight some of the management issues that have been both of particular concern to this Subcommittee and the subject of our recent work."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Helping Agencies Meet Information Technology Management Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Like most organizations, federal agencies increasingly depend on information technology (IT) to improve their performance and meet mission goals.

Further, OMB places each of the 24 major agencies into one of three tiers after receiving quarterly progress reports, based on OMB\u2019s judgment as to whether evidence of the agency\u2019s reported progress is or is not sufficient. Additionally, OMB has clarified instructions on agencies preparing business continuity and contingency plans.", "Many congressional committees have played a central role in addressing the Year 2000 challenge by holding agencies accountable for demonstrating progress and by heightening public appreciation of the problem.

Implementing these initiatives effectively will require a more concerted effort at individual agencies and at the governmentwide level. Agencies need to do a better job of establishing comprehensive computer security programs that address systemic problems as well as individual audit findings in this area. Moreover, we found that most agencies have not addressed enhancing information security in their fiscal year 1999 performance plans. In addition to individual agency actions, more effective governmentwide oversight is important to (1) ensure that agency executives understand the risks, (2) monitor agency performance, and (3) resolve issues affecting multiple agencies.

As our reviews demonstrate, agencies continue to be challenged by (1) weaknesses in IT investment selection and control processes; (2) slow progress in designing and implementing IT architectures; (3) inadequate software development, cost estimation, and acquisition practices; and (4) the demand for effective CIO leadership and organizations. Improvements in these areas will be difficult to achieve without effective agency leadership support, highly qualified and experienced CIOs, and effective OMB leadership and oversight. With the Deputy Director for Management serving as its co-chair, OMB must continue to work effectively with the federal CIO Council to focus management attention on putting in place disciplined information technology management processes that can lead to improvements in the delivery of high quality, cost-effective results.

Organizational success hinges on having the right employees on board and on providing them with the training, tools, structures, incentives, and accountability to work effectively.

In the past, management issues often remained subordinated to budget concerns and timeframes, and the leverage the budget could offer to advance management efforts was not directly used to address management issues. The experiences to-date suggest that certain factors are associated with the successful implementation of management initiatives. Building and sustaining these factors appears to be pivotal regardless of the specific organizational arrangements used to implement the management initiatives.", "First, top management support and commitment within both OMB and the White House is often critical to providing a focus on governmentwide management issues throughout both the budget process and the executive agencies themselves. As our study of OMB 2000 pointed out, management and performance measurement issues gained considerable attention in the budget formulation process initially because of the clear commitment of OMB\u2019s leadership. However, top leadership\u2019s focus can change over time, which can undermine the follow-through needed to move an initiative from policy development to successful implementation. Thus, institutional focal points can have important roles in sustaining these initiatives over time by serving as continuing \u201cchampions\u201d to maintain attention to management initiatives and help ensure follow-through.", "Second, a strong linkage with the budget formulation process can be a key factor in gaining serious attention for management initiatives throughout government. Regardless of the location of the leadership, management initiatives need to be reflected in and supported by the budget and, in fact, no single organizational arrangement by itself guarantees this will happen. Many management policies require budgetary resources for their effective implementation, whether it is financial management reform or information systems investment. Furthermore, initiatives such as the Results Act seek to improve decision-making by explicitly calling for performance plans to be integrated with budget requests. We have found that previous management reforms, such as the Planning-Programming-Budgeting- System and Management By Objectives, suffered when they were not integrated with routine budget presentations and account structures.", "Third, effective collaboration with the agencies\u2014through such approaches as task forces and interagency councils\u2014has emerged as an important central leadership strategy in both developing policies that are sensitive to implementation concerns and gaining consensus and consistent follow- through within the executive branch. In effect, agency collaboration serves to institutionalize many management policies initiated by either Congress or OMB. In our 1989 report on OMB, we found that OMB\u2019s work with interagency councils was successful in fostering communication across the executive branch, building commitment to reform efforts, tapping talents that exist within agencies, keeping management issues in the forefront, and initiating important improvement projects.", "Finally, support from the Congress has proven to be critical in sustaining interest in management initiatives over time. Congress has, in effect, served as the institutional champion for many of these initiatives, providing a consistent focus for oversight and reinforcement of important policies. For example, Congress\u2019\u2014and in particular this Subcommittee\u2019s\u2014 attention to the Year 2000 problem, information management, and financial management, has served to elevate these problems on the administration\u2019s management agenda.", "Separate from the policy decisions concerning how best to organize and focus attention on governmentwide federal management issues, there are some intermediate steps that OMB could take to clarify its responsibilities and improve federal management. For example, OMB could more clearly describe the management results it is trying to achieve, and how it can be held accountable for these results, in its strategic and annual performance plans. Many of OMB\u2019s strategic and annual goals were not as results- oriented as they could be. Continued improvement in OMB\u2019s plans would provide congressional decisionmakers with better information to use in determining the extent to which OMB is addressing its statutory management and budgetary responsibilities, as well as in assessing OMB\u2019s contributions toward achieving desired results. In our 1995 review of OMB 2000, we recommended that OMB review the impact of its reorganization as part of its planned broader assessment of its role in formulating and implementing management policies for the government. OMB has not formally assessed the effectiveness, for example, of the different approaches taken by its statutory offices to promote the integration of management and budget issues. We believe it is important that OMB understand how its organization affects its capacity to provide sustained management leadership.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes our statement.
