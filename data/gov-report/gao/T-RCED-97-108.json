In our statement last year, we focused on HUD\u2019s progress in addressing the management deficiencies that led us to designate the Department as one of our \u201chigh risk\u201d areas. We also focused on various assumptions that HUD made in developing its budget request and on the impact of those assumptions on the Department\u2019s cost estimates for multifamily reengineering and for renewing Section 8 contracts for low-income rental assistance. This year, our primary focus is on HUD\u2019s request for over $9 billion to renew rental assistance contracts, as well as on some of the assumptions that underlie HUD\u2019s estimate.", "Our statement discusses (1) the estimates HUD used to develop its budget request for renewing Section 8 assisted housing contracts, (2) HUD\u2019s justification for 50,000 additional Section 8 certificates, (3) HUD\u2019s success in reducing the level of uncommitted public housing modernization funds held by housing authorities, and (4) HUD\u2019s request for $100 million to fund the second round of the Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community (EZ/EC) program. Our work is based on our review of HUD\u2019s fiscal year 1998 budget justification materials, our discussions of those materials with HUD officials, and an analysis that we and HUD performed of Section 8 budget authority reserves at HUD state offices in Georgia and Texas.", "In summary, we found the following:", "HUD\u2019s fiscal year 1998 budget request for $9.2 billion in budget authority to renew expiring Section 8 contracts for assisted housing includes amounts that may not be required or could be offset. First, HUD\u2019s request contains allowances for contingencies\u2014costs that may or may not accrue or that cannot be precisely estimated\u2014with an estimated value of $531 million. However, because HUD also allows housing agencies that administer the tenant-based program to retain a large portion of their unspent reserves for contingencies, HUD may not need funding for the contingencies noted above. Second, in developing this budget request, HUD may be able to offset (reduce) some of its current renewal needs after it has identified all unspent budget authority accumulated over prior years\u2014an effort it plans to complete by March 31, 1997. Finally, since its budget was released, HUD has found that two housing programs that provide project-basedassistance do not need to be renewed in fiscal year 1998, and therefore the programs do not require the $90 million that HUD budgeted for them.", "HUD also has requested $305 million in budget authority for fiscal year 1998 to fund 50,000 new Section 8 certificates. According to HUD, the certificates will accommodate family relocation caused by the Department\u2019s Welfare-to-Work initiative, but it is unclear how HUD estimated the number of units or justified their need. For example, HUD has neither given a basis for choosing 50,000 as its request nor provided a plan for distributing these certificates to states or urban centers according to their need. In addition, HUD plans to request an additional 50,000 units over the next 4 years, adding approximately $2.4 billion in renewal costs through fiscal year 2002 for the additional 100,000 certificates.", "Over the past 3 years, public housing authorities (PHA) have decreased the amount of uncommitted public housing modernization funding that they have available for major modernization projects by approximately 30 percent. Despite this progress, approximately $925 million remains uncommitted. In addition, several large troubled housing authorities have larger uncommitted balances than they did 3 years ago. Despite the pressure on HUD\u2019s budget because of the increasing need to renew Section 8 contracts, these housing authorities will continue to be granted additional funding in accordance with HUD\u2019s formula for awarding modernization grants.", "HUD\u2019s request for $100 million to fully fund a second round of the Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community program appears premature as it is unlikely that HUD can commit this amount during fiscal year 1998."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HUD\u2019s Fiscal Year 1998 Budget and Programs", "paragraphs": ["Through its programs, HUD provides rental assistance to more than 4 million low-income tenants, has insured mortgages for about 23 million homeowners, has provided funding to help revitalize over 4,000 communities, and helps ensure equal access to housing. In recent years, approximately three-quarters of HUD\u2019s budget outlays have been for public and assisted housing programs. These programs are supported through annual appropriations (i.e., discretionary authority) that are subject to discretionary spending limits under the Budget Enforcement Act, as amended.", "HUD\u2019s fiscal year 1998 budget proposal requests about $24.8 billion in discretionary budget authority and plans about $34 billion in outlays. This request represents a 28-percent increase in budget authority and a 2-percent increase in outlays compared with HUD\u2019s estimated outlay for fiscal year 1997. The significant increase in budget authority reflects the considerable growth from 1997 to 1998 in the number of multiyear contracts that need to be renewed under the Section 8 assisted housing program, including both the tenant-based and project-based programs. In 1997, HUD needed $3.6 billion in budget authority to renew contracts. HUD estimates that it will need $9.2 billion in budget authority in fiscal year 1998 to renew contracts for over half of all units assisted under Section 8.

HUD is currently identifying the amount of these other reserves; however, instead of using them to offset its fiscal year 1998 budget needs, the Department plans to allow housing authorities to retain much of their reserves to cover contingencies. HUD\u2019s estimated renewal costs also include about $90 million for programs that do not need to be renewed in fiscal year 1998."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Tenant-Based Contract Renewal Request Includes Several Contingency Factors", "paragraphs": ["HUD\u2019s tenant-based contract renewal estimate includes allowances for contingencies and assumptions that increase the budget request by about $531 million. These include (1) $162 million allowance for contingencies to cover uncertainties in the number of units to be renewed; (2) $253 million to provide a 2-week funding allowance per housing unit to account for changes in economic conditions; (3) $116 million to account for the anticipated effects of welfare reform on tenants\u2019 incomes and, in turn, on the rent that housing authorities can collect from these tenants. Neither HUD\u2019s budget justification materials nor our discussions with HUD officials provided specific justification or support for these allowances.", "According to HUD officials, the contingency allowance of $162 million is for possible errors in the estimated number of units that need to be renewed. Although HUD obtained the estimated number of units from its Central Accounting and Program System (HUDCAPS), in commenting on a draft of this testimony, HUD\u2019s Deputy Secretary said that not all contracts are included in HUDCAPS. For example, the accounting system does not include contracts in process from prior year funding, contracts not yet awarded for funded units, and housing units that have been converted from project-based to tenant-based assistance. Accordingly, HUD officials believe that they need a 2-percent contingency in the budget to address these unknown costs.", "Second, the average unit cost of $6,386 that HUD used to develop its total fiscal year 1998 estimate of tenant-based renewal needs includes a contingency factor to account for unexpected program costs. According to HUD officials, unexpected program costs occur when, for example, rents increase or tenants\u2019 incomes decrease. We estimate that this contingency factor provides 2 additional weeks of funding for each unit and increases the total request for contract renewal funding by $253 million.", "A third contingency factor accounts for the impact of welfare reform on tenants\u2019 rent contributions. HUD estimates this impact to be about $92 per unit, per year and includes it in the average annual cost of tenant-based units, thus increasing HUD\u2019s contract renewal request by about $116 million. HUD officials told us that this amount compensates for the reductions in tenants\u2019 contributions to rents anticipated when tenants lose their welfare benefits. These reductions increase HUD\u2019s contribution to the rental payment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unspent Budget Authority Also Is Available to Cover Contingencies", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, HUD has been reconciling PHAs\u2019 Section 8 contract accounts to determine how much unspent budget authority is available to renew expiring contracts. The Department expects to complete this process by March 31, 1997. By the end of fiscal year 1996, HUD had identified approximately $1.6 billion in unspent budget authority\u2014or excess contract reserves\u2014which it used to extend the funding for expiring Section 8 tenant-based contracts. This action, which took place too late in the budget process to be reflected in the fiscal year 1997 budget, shows up for the first time in the fiscal year 1998 budget. In the meantime, HUD has identified additional reserves, a portion of which it believes can be used to further reduce the amount of budget authority needed to renew contracts in fiscal year 1998. HUD plans to calculate this reduction and provide this information to the Congress after completing the reconciliation process.", "HUD officials told us that the Department will use the following process to determine the amount by which it can reduce its fiscal year 1998 budget request. After HUD finalizes the amount of the reserves, it will continue its policy of allowing housing authorities to limit the portion of their reserves that can be used to extend expiring contracts. This policy limits HUD\u2019s ability to offset its budget request for contract renewals with accumulated unspent budget authority and raises the amount of budget authority that HUD must request. Specifically, HUD has determined that a housing authority can use its reserves to extend contracts only if the housing authority first retains a minimum of 50 percent of the funding needed to fully fund all of the housing authority\u2019s Section 8 units for 1 fiscal year. Although not all housing authorities have sufficient excess contract reserves to do this, HUD officials believe that this policy ensures that in most cases reserve funds will be available to cover increased program costs or other contingencies such as potential increases in rents or the loss of tenants\u2019 income.", "HUD officials could not explain whether these contingencies could be addressed by the various allowances for contingencies that we described earlier, and they did not have a basis for specifying that the 50-percent level was an appropriate amount for housing authorities to retain. While these costs may occur and establishing some contingency amount for them may be reasonable, the 50-percent reserve is in itself a contingency allowance and apparently duplicates the other contingency factors that HUD has built into its budget request. In commenting on a draft of this testimony, the Deputy Secretary agreed that housing authorities\u2019 reserves are a source of contingency funding. He said that the size of the reserve depends on the nature of an authority\u2019s portfolio of tenant-based assistance and that these reserves are an area that is under review by the Department."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Premature Funding Requests Increase HUD\u2019s Project-Based Contract Renewal Estimate", "paragraphs": ["HUD\u2019s budget request for Section 8 contract renewal funding includes two line items for project-based housing assistance that HUD has since determined do not require renewal in fiscal year 1998. These two line items total almost $90 million in requested budget authority. The first item is a request for $54 million and is part of HUD\u2019s portfolio reengineering program to restructure some project-based contracts. The $54 million provides new Section 8 budget authority for projects that HUD\u2019s budget assumes will be reengineered before their current Section 8 contracts expire. However, because these contracts provide below-market rents, HUD officials told us that reengineering these projects is highly unlikely until the contracts expire in fiscal year 2000, if then. As a result, this line item does not need to be included in the fiscal year 1998 request. The second item is a request for $35 million to renew expiring vouchers set aside for disabled persons.

However, it is unclear how HUD determined that 50,000 vouchers would be needed to help families relocate or how HUD would distribute the new certificates to states and urban centers where this need is likely to be felt. HUD officials told us that the Department has not analyzed the potential need for this new kind of assistance, but on the basis of studies by HUD and others of the general need for affordable housing, they believe that the overall need nationwide for more assisted housing justifies these incremental certificates.", "Furthermore, the 50,000 units are part of a larger, 5-year plan to increase the tenant-based program by 100,000 units. HUD officials told us that this plan is part of the administration\u2019s continued commitment to expand the availability of tenant-based rental assistance, within the context of a budget that reaches balance in fiscal year 2002. The cumulative effect of adding these new units would be to increase renewal costs by approximately $2.4 billion through fiscal year 2002."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Balances of Uncommitted Modernization Funding Have Decreased, but Some Housing Authorities\u2019 Balances Have Increased", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal year 1998, HUD is requesting $2.5 billion for public housing capital activities, the same amount it received in fiscal year 1997. These funds are distributed to public housing authorities, which are then responsible for committing and spending these funds to modernize their public housing units. In 1994, we reported that housing authorities had an aggregate backlog of $1.4 billion in modernization funds. The backlog comprises funds that have been available to the housing authorities for more than 2 years but have not been committed for use\u2014HUD officials believe that 2 years is an adequate period within which to spend funds for capital purposes. Currently, housing authorities have approximately $925 million in backlogged funding.", "Failing to commit modernization funds in a timely manner means that vacant and deteriorated public housing remains unsuitable for habitation and that the programs are not serving the needs of low-income families. We reported in 1994 that 22 large housing authorities had been granted $4.8 billion in fiscal year 1991 and prior years\u2019 approved funds and that of that amount, $808 million, or 17 percent, remained uncommitted as of September 30, 1993. Since we issued that report, HUD has worked with housing authorities to reduce their backlogs. As of September 30, 1996, the same 22 large housing authorities we reported on almost 3 years ago had been granted a total of $8 billion in fiscal year 1994 and prior years\u2019 funds. Of that amount, $785 million, or about 10 percent, was in the combined backlogs of these 22 authorities. While these housing authorities\u2019 approved funds increased 68 percent during this time, their total backlog decreased 3 percent. HUD officials told us that they have been successful in helping housing authorities reduce their backlogs by providing greater flexibility, by streamlining regulations, and providing technical assistance, particularly to the troubled or near-troubled housing authorities.", "Notwithstanding HUD\u2019s overall success in reducing the modernization backlog, the sizes of the backlogs at several large housing authorities have actually increased since we reported in 1994. For example, the Washington, D.C., Housing Authority, as of the end of September 30, 1996, had a backlog of $115 million, or 39 percent of its fiscal year 1994 and prior years\u2019 approved funds. For the same period, the New Orleans Housing Authority had a backlog of $72 million, or 32 percent of its total approved funds, and the San Francisco Housing Authority had a backlog of $31 million, or 15 percent of its approved balance. Of the 22 PHAs reviewed, 6 have larger backlogs than they did 3 years ago, including the 3 PHAs noted above. Of these six PHAs, four had a backlog that was higher as a percentage of their total than they had in 1994. In commenting on a draft of this testimony, the Deputy Secretary said that he expects HUD to rectify the backlog of those four PHAs by fiscal year 1998. Moreover, he said that HUD is holding new modernization funding for these four PHAs until they have adequate capacity to administer the funding effectively.", "Regardless of the size of its backlog or its capacity to effectively commit funds, a housing authority still receives an annual modernization grant under the program\u2019s allocation formula. Although HUD can, under the regulations, recapture modernization funding that has gone uncommitted for more than several years, officials told us that this seldom occurs. Thus, the effect of formula funding is to increase the backlog of modernization funding\u2014notwithstanding HUD\u2019s hold on the funds\u2014for those PHAs that continue to be unsuccessful in committing their modernization grants.

According to HUD\u2019s budget request, the Department anticipates fully committing these funds during fiscal year 1998. However, many steps must be taken before HUD can grant these funds. For example, legislation must be passed to authorize the second round of designations. Subsequently, HUD must write related regulations, invite communities to apply for program grants, allow time for communities to prepare and submit their applications, evaluate the applications, and select the communities that would receive these funds. During the first round of this program, HUD required 16 months after the Congress passed the legislation to designate the EZs and ECs.", "Unless the Congress passes authorizing legislation soon, HUD is not likely to be ready to use the majority of these funds during fiscal year 1998. This means that HUD\u2019s request of $100 million in fiscal year 1998 could be premature. HUD\u2019s director and deputy director of economic development told us that although they have not prepared a schedule for the second round, they anticipate that they can draw from experiences in the first round to accelerate the community designation process.
