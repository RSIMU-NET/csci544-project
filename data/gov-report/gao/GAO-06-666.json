Schedules have also expanded significantly, and most critical mission capabilities will not be delivered in fiscal year 2006, as initially planned. The deferral of capabilities and performance shortfalls has significant implications for future missions--especially if program dollars are needed to maintain legacy systems longer than expected. The tracking of space objects could be particularly affected, given that none of the work on CCIC2S's critical space mission capabilities has been completed, and estimated completion dates for this work have yet to be determined. Unstable program requirements and the failure to match requirements to available resources have contributed to the program's cost and schedule overruns. Since the program began in 2000, the Air Force has added, deleted, and modified requirements without adequately determining the effect of these changes on resources. To control cost growth, the Air Force has frequently deferred work to later years and has yet to determine when and at what cost development is to be completed. Several key controls needed to mitigate the CCIC2S program's cost and schedule problems are not in place. First, DOD did not designate the CCIC2S program as a major automated information system acquisition--a designation that would have required high-level oversight other than that provided by the Air Force, which has been ineffective. In addition, the Air Force's contracting approach has limited the program's ability to thoroughly assess the reliability of the contractor's cost and schedule performance information and the impact of defining, prioritizing, and adding capabilities. Despite this risky approach, the Defense Contract Management Agency did not independently monitor contractor performance.

With other  programs to improve data collection sensors that feed data into CCIC2S\u2014 such as the Space Fence and Space Based Space Surveillance system\u2014 the number of observations and processing requirements will increase  significantly in the future, taxing the current system further. In a 2005  study, the CCIC2S contractor determined that SPADOC\u2019s processing  capacity will not be able to handle the increased number of observations  predicted beginning in 2012. For the near term, according to Air Force  officials, the CCIC2S contractor has identified operations and maintenance  changes for SPADOC to handle increases in the number of observations.

Missing, vague, or changing requirements tend to  be a major cause of poor outcomes in these programs. For example,  according to Air Force officials, the major causes for the delay in the Air  Mission Evolution system\u2014a CCIC2S system that was delivered in  January 2004, over 2 years behind schedule\u2014included problems with  software development and integration.

To better ensure  programs are affordable and fully funded before they are initiated, DOD  guidance calls for every acquisition program to stabilize requirements and  determine the program\u2019s total costs before program start. Despite best  practices and DOD policy, the Air Force initiated the CCIC2S program  without establishing a stable set of program-specific requirements and did  not do so until January 2004\u2014more than 3 years after program start. In  that time, the Air Force made numerous additions, deletions, and  modifications to CCIC2S\u2019s requirements. For example, the Air Force  deleted, added back, and then modified a requirement for multiple security  levels. According to an Air Force review of program requirements, some  deleted requirements were duplicative or conflicting.", "Assessments of available resources were also inadequate. According to  DOD guidance, every acquisition program should rigorously address issues  such as the program\u2019s life-cycle costs and whether it is affordable and fully  funded. By not conducting these rigorous assessments, DOD and the Air  Force did not have the information needed to commit to the program over  its life cycle.

At this most mature level, quantitative  feedback about performance and innovative ideas and technologies  contribute to continuous process improvements. A senior program official  stated that the CCIC2S contractor was rated at a level 5 for software  development.

We have previously reported  that program funding instability often occurs because DOD starts too  many programs, creating severe budget constraints. Another factor we  have reported that contributes to funding instability is that DOD\u2019s  programs are funded annually, requiring competition among other  programs for limited available funding. The CCIC2S program has not  been an exception to these factors. For example, prior to initiating the  CCIC2S program in 2000, DOD reduced the program\u2019s initial estimated  resource requirements by a total of $75 million. In 2002, DOD decided not  to increase requested program funding. According to DOD, funding was  limited to program baseline levels because the program was a lesser  priority.

Designating the CCIC2S  program as a major automated information system acquisition would put  in place the high-level oversight and rigorous analyses needed to help  ensure (1) the program has top-level accountability and support for the  program, (2) DOD has the knowledge necessary for making trade-offs in  program requirements so that they match available resources, and   (3) DOD has the ability to prioritize and commit to the program within the  context of its other acquisition programs and long-range investment plans.  As of June 2006, however, the office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense  for Networks and Information Integration has yet to formally make a  decision on whether to designate the program as a major automated  information system acquisition.", "According to Air Force and DCMA officials, the program office has taken  several steps, which we did not assess, to address some management  control problems, including the following actions:    Prohibited direct contact between the contractor and users\u2014which  they acknowledge had a direct impact on program cost and schedule  performance\u2014to keep the contractor from reprioritizing work to meet  the immediate needs of the users, in 2004. Additionally, the program  office and the contractor implemented an engineering review board  process to evaluate any proposed change in terms of its validity in  relation to validated requirements as well as its impact to program cost  and schedule estimates.

However,  since the 1980s, DOD\u2019s efforts to modernize these systems have been  fraught with cost increases, schedule delays, and performance shortfalls.  Under the current development effort, the Air Force continues to defer the  completion of key critical space requirements, placing the DOD\u2019s ability to  perform air and missile defense and space situational awareness missions  at risk. Without matching requirements to available resources, the CCIC2S  program will continue to flounder. Failing to conduct this match at the  onset of this complex effort led DOD to develop unrealistic cost and  schedule estimates as well as to over-promise capability. Specifically, the  Air Force did not ensure that the program had stable requirements and a  sound process for clarifying and controlling them, and thus the resources  to satisfy the requirements were severely underestimated. The minimal  top-level and external oversight and accountability of the program  contributed to the problems.

DOD agreed that the CCIC2S program be designated as a major automated  information system with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks  and Information Integration as the milestone decision authority with  oversight responsibility and accountability for its successful  implementation. In addition, DOD agreed with conducting an affordability  assessment, economic analysis, and independent estimate of life-cycle  costs on future development activities but not with the current activities  due to potential mission impacts. Specifically, DOD stated these  assessments should be conducted on future delivery blocks of the CCIC2S  program, but not on the current block. DOD asserted that its recent   $127 million CCIC2S funding reduction across the Future Years Defense  Program (FYDP) pared down CCIC2S development activities to those  essential to national security needs.", "We do not disagree with this approach to the extent that continuing these  development activities is critical to national security. However, continuing  CCIC2S development without establishing a match between requirements  and available resources may also hinder DOD\u2019s ability to satisfy national  security needs because of the increased risk that the program fails to  achieve its promised capability.  While DOD raises the issue of the cost of  delaying the program, it does not address the cost of proceeding as  planned. Our work has shown that in numerous programs, continuing to  spend money on development programs without sufficient knowledge or  clear direction results in cost overruns and schedule delays. Further, given  recent congressional concerns over DOD\u2019s management of CCIC2S,  demonstrating on a timely basis how requirements and available resources  are to be matched while protecting national security is especially  important.  Since an assessment of CCIC2S\u2019s specific operational risks to  national security was beyond the scope of our review, we clarified our  recommendation to read that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary  of the Air Force to limit future development activities to those deemed  critical to national security needs until the Department takes the actions  discussed above.", "DOD agreed to take actions relating to establishing and implementing  management controls and approaches to analyze the resource impacts of  changes in requirements and to ensure reliable program data. DOD stated  that these changes had already been implemented or are being planned.  During our review, program and DCMA officials told us that some  changes\u2014such as prohibiting the contractor from reprioritizing work  without Air Force approval and implementing an engineering review board  to assess requirements changes\u2014had been made. However, they also  noted that other measures to manage requirements and institute better  management controls\u2014such as increasing program office management  staffing and capabilities, modifying the work breakdown structure and  earned value management system, and implementing a new approach and  metrics to track program progress\u2014were under way or planned.
