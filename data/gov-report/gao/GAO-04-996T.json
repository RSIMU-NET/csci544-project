In fiscal year 2003, VA estimated that about 157,000 veterans  were legally blind, and about 44,000 of these veterans were enrolled in VA  health care. Since the 1940s, the demographics of VA\u2019s blind veteran  population have changed from young veterans totally blind as a result of  traumatic injury to primarily older veterans whose legal blindness is  caused by age-related eye diseases.", "You expressed concern that VA has not updated its delivery of care  options for blind rehabilitation programs by offering, in addition to  inpatient services, a range of outpatient services closer to where veterans  live. To determine how VA serves the needs of legally blind veterans and  what role outpatient training services could play, we reviewed (1) the  availability of VA outpatient blind rehabilitation services, (2) whether  legally blind veterans benefit from VA and non-VA outpatient services, and  (3) what factors affect VA\u2019s ability to increase veterans\u2019 access to blind  rehabilitation outpatient services.", "To address these issues, we met with officials from VA\u2019s Rehabilitative  Strategic Health Care Group, including the Blind Rehabilitation Service  Program Office (program office). We also met with VA\u2019s directors for  ophthalmology and optometry. We reviewed applicable policies and  procedures regarding VA\u2019s blind rehabilitation services, its strategic plan  for blind rehabilitation, and its planning documents for special disability  populations. To determine what blind rehabilitation services were  available to veterans, we visited five medical centers offering blind  rehabilitation services and met with Blind Rehabilitation Center (BRC)  officials as well as case managers and rehabilitation specialists who work  with legally blind veterans. We asked BRC officials and case managers to  evaluate veterans on the waiting lists for admission to these BRCs as of  March 31, 2004, to identify those who could potentially be better served  through access to outpatient blind rehabilitation services, if such services  were available. We also interviewed case managers who were located at  medical centers without a BRC and representatives of the Blinded  Veterans Association to gain their perspectives on the types of care that  would benefit legally blind veterans. In addition, we met with officials  from state and private nonprofit agencies in Arizona, Illinois, and  Washington to learn about the blind rehabilitation programs they offer  older citizens. Our review was conducted from September 2003 through  July 2004 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.", "In summary, VA provides three types of blind rehabilitation outpatient  training services, but they are available only in a few VA locations. These  services range from short-term programs provided in VA facilities to  services provided in the veteran\u2019s own home. VA also believes that some  legally blind veterans could benefit from increased access to outpatient  blind rehabilitation services. In fact, VA officials reported to us that 21  percent of veterans on the waiting lists for admission to the five BRCs we  visited could potentially be better served through access to outpatient  blind rehabilitation services, if such services were available. Finally, two  factors affect the expansion of VA\u2019s outpatient blind rehabilitation  services. The first involves VA\u2019s long-standing position that training for  legally blind veterans should be provided in a comprehensive inpatient  setting. This delivery model has not kept pace with VA\u2019s overall health  care strategy that reduces its reliance on inpatient care and emphasizes  more outpatient care. The second reported factor affecting the use of  outpatient blind rehabilitation services is its method of allocating funds for  medical care. VA\u2019s Visual Impairment Advisory Board (VIAB) believes that  the funds allocated for basic outpatient care for legally blind veterans do  not cover the cost of providing blind rehabilitation outpatient services.  The VIAB is currently working with VA\u2019s Office of Finance and Allocation  Resource Center to develop an allocation amount that would better  reflect the cost of providing blind rehabilitation services on an outpatient  basis, which could provide an incentive to expand this care. We are  recommending that VA take action to ensure that a broad range of  inpatient and outpatient blind rehabilitation services is more widely  available to legally blind veterans."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt made a commitment that no  servicemen blinded in combat in World War II would be returned to their  homes without adequate training to meet the problems imposed by their  blindness, according to VA. From 1944 to 1947, the Army and Navy  provided this rehabilitation training. In 1947, responsibility for this training  was transferred to VA, and in 1948, VA opened its first BRC to provide  comprehensive inpatient care to legally blind veterans.", "In 1956, blind rehabilitation services were expanded to include veterans  whose legal blindness was not service-connected. Because of this  expansion, the demographics of VA\u2019s blind veteran population shifted  toward predominately older veterans whose legal blindness was caused by  age-related eye diseases. Expanded eligibility also caused an increase in  demand for services. VA responded to this demand by opening 9 additional  BRCs in the United States and Puerto Rico for a total of 10 facilities with  241 authorized beds. (See table 1.) As of May 5 2004, VA reported that  there were 2,127 legally blind veterans waiting for admission to BRCs.", "In fiscal year 2003, VA estimated that about 157,000 veterans were legally  blind, with more than 60 percent age 75 or older. About 44,000 legally  blind veterans were enrolled in VA health care. VA estimated that through  2022, the number of legally blind veterans would remain stable. (See   fig. 1.)", "The National Institutes of Health (NIH) considers the increase in age- related eye diseases to be an emerging major public health problem.  According to NIH, the four leading diseases that cause age-related legal  blindness are cataract, glaucoma, macular degeneration, and diabetic  retinopathy, each affecting vision differently. (See fig. 2 for illustrations of  how each disease affects vision.) Cataract is a clouding of the eye\u2019s  normally clear lens. Most cataracts appear with advancing age, and by age  80, more than half of all Americans develop them. Glaucoma causes  gradual damage to the optic nerve\u2014the nerve to the eye\u2014that results in  decreasing peripheral vision. It is estimated that as many as 4 million  Americans have glaucoma. Macular degeneration results in the loss of  central visual clarity and contrast sensitivity. It is the most common cause  of legal blindness in older Americans and rarely affects those under the  age of 60. Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes  impairing vision over time. It results in the loss of visual clarity, peripheral  vision, and color and contrast sensitivity. It also increases the eye\u2019s  sensitivity to glare. Nearly half of all diabetics will develop some degree of  diabetic retinopathy, and the risk increases with veterans\u2019 age and the  length of time they have had diabetes.", "To assist legally blind veterans, VA established Visual Impairment Services  Team (VIST) coordinators who act as case managers and are responsible  for coordinating all medical services for these veterans, including  obtaining medical examinations and arranging for blind rehabilitation  services. There are about 170 VIST coordinators, who are located at VA  medical centers that have at least 100 enrolled legally blind veterans. VIST  coordinators are also responsible for certain administrative services such  as reviewing the veteran\u2019s compensation and pension benefits. Almost all  of VA\u2019s blind rehabilitation services for veterans are provided through  comprehensive inpatient care at BRCs, where veterans are trained to use  their remaining vision and other senses, as well as adaptive devices such  as canes, to help compensate for impaired vision. VA offers both basic and  computer training. (See table 2 for examples of the types of skills taught  during basic and computer training.)", "In fiscal years 2002 and 2003, VA spent over $56 million each year for  inpatient training at BRCs.

Serving  veterans in the surrounding 13-county area, it is primarily for veterans who  can independently perform activities of daily living and who require only  limited training in visual skills and orientation and mobility, such as  traveling within and outside their homes. According to a VISOR official,  the program is meant to provide training to veterans while they wait for  admission to a BRC or to veterans who do not want to attend a BRC.  Veterans who participate in this program are housed in hoptel beds  within the medical facility. In fiscal year 2003, 54 veterans attended the  VISOR program; about 20 to 30 percent of these veterans were legally  blind.

VA officials reported that 315  out of 1,501 of these veterans, or 21 percent, could potentially be better  served through access to outpatient blind rehabilitation services, if such  services were available. The types of veterans VA believes could  potentially benefit from outpatient services include those who are very  elderly or lack the physical stamina to participate in a comprehensive 28-  to 42-day BRC program and those who have medical needs that cannot be  provided by the BRC. For example, some BRCs are unable to accept  patients requiring kidney dialysis. In addition, some veterans do not want  to leave their families for long periods of time and some legally blind  veterans are primary caretakers for their spouses and are unable to leave  their homes. VA officials also told us that veterans in good health who can  independently perform activities of daily living and require only limited or  specialized training could also be served effectively on an outpatient basis.", "A VA study concluded that there is a need for increased outpatient  services for legally blind veterans. In 1999, VA convened a Blind  Rehabilitation Gold Ribbon Panel to study concerns about the growing  number of legally blind veterans. The panel examined how VA historically  provided blind rehabilitation services and recommended that VA transition  from its primarily inpatient model of care to one that included both  inpatient and outpatient services. In 2000, VA established the VIAB to  implement the panel\u2019s recommendations. The VIAB drafted guidance for a  uniform standard of care policy for visually impaired veterans throughout  VA\u2019s health care system. This guidance outlined a continuum of care to  provide a range of services from basic low vision to comprehensive  inpatient rehabilitation training, including use of more outpatient services  from both VA and non-VA sources. In January 2004, a final draft of the  uniform standard of care policy was forwarded to VA\u2019s Health Systems  Committee for approval. The committee believed additional information  was needed for its approval and requested additional analysis that  compared currently available blind rehabilitation services with anticipated  needs. VA plans to complete this analysis in the first quarter of fiscal year  2005 and then resubmit the uniform standard of care policy and the  additional analysis to the Health Systems Committee. VA officials were  unable to provide a timeframe for the Health Systems Committee\u2019s  approval.", "Some VIST coordinators have already provided outpatient services to  legally blind veterans by referring them to state and private blind  rehabilitation services. For example, in Florida a VIST coordinator  referred veterans to the Lighthouse for the Blind for computer training at  its outpatient facility if they did not live near and did not want to travel to  the BRC. A VIST coordinator in Oklahoma arranged contractor-provided  computer training in the veteran\u2019s home for veterans with a 20 percent or  more service-connected disability. The coordinator issued the computer  equipment to a local contractor; the contractor then set up the equipment  in the veteran\u2019s home and provided the training. Another VIST coordinator  in North Carolina referred all legally blind veterans to state service  agencies, including veterans waiting for admission to a BRC. Each county  in that state had a social worker for the blind that referred its citizens to  independent living programs for in-home training in orientation and  mobility and living skills. The state provided this training at no charge to  the veteran and VA paid for the equipment.", "Recently, VA has begun to shift computer training from inpatient settings  at BRCs to private sector outpatient settings. VA\u2019s goal was to remove  from the BRC waiting list by July 30, 2004, those veterans seeking  admission to a BRC only for computer training. In spring 2004, VA issued  instructions stating that the prosthetic budget of each medical center,  which already paid for computer equipment for legally blind veterans,  would now pay for computer training. Additionally, the Blind  Rehabilitation Service Program Office asked BRCs to identify all the  veterans waiting for admission for computer training and refer them back  to their VIST coordinator for local computer training. If BRC and VIST  coordinator staff determined that local computer training was not  available or appropriate for a veteran, they were to provide an explanation  to the program office. On May 5, 2004, 674 veterans were waiting for  admission to a BRC for computer training. As of July 1, 2004, 520 veterans  were removed from the BRC waiting list because arrangements were made  for them to receive computer training from non-VA sources or they no  longer wanted the training."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Factors that Affect Expansion of Blind Rehabilitation Outpatient Services", "paragraphs": ["There are two factors that affect VA\u2019s expansion of outpatient services  systemwide. One factor is the agency\u2019s long-standing belief that  rehabilitation training for legally blind veterans can be best provided in a  comprehensive inpatient setting. The second reported factor is VA\u2019s  method of allocating funds for blind rehabilitation outpatient services,  which provides local medical center management discretion to provide  funds for them.", "Some VA officials told us that one factor affecting veterans\u2019 access to  outpatient care has been the agency\u2019s traditional focus on providing  comprehensive inpatient training at BRCs. VA has historically considered  the BRCs to be an exemplary model of care, and since 1948 BRCs have  been the primary source of care for legally blind veterans. However, this  delivery model has not kept pace with VA\u2019s overall health care strategy  that reduces reliance on inpatient care and emphasizes outpatient care.  VA\u2019s continued reliance on inpatient blind rehabilitation care is evident in  its recent decision to build two additional BRCs in Long Beach, California,  and Biloxi, Mississippi. We have, however, observed some recent changes  that may affect this reliance on inpatient services. For example, VA has  new leadership in its blind rehabilitation program that has expressed an  interest in providing a broad range of inpatient and outpatient services to  meet the training needs of legally blind veterans. Further, as previously  discussed, the VIAB\u2019s draft continuum of care policy recommends a full  range of blind rehabilitation services, emphasizing more outpatient care,  including VICTORS, VISOR, and BROS.", "VA blind rehabilitation officials also told us that they believe changes to  VA\u2019s resource allocation method could provide an incentive to expand  blind rehabilitation services on an outpatient basis. The VIAB believes that  the funds allocated for basic outpatient care for legally blind veterans do  not cover the cost of providing blind rehabilitation services. Veterans  Integrated Service Networks (networks) are allocated funds to provide  basic outpatient care for veterans, which they then allocate to the medical  centers in their regions. Both the networks and the medical centers have  the discretion to prioritize the use of these funds for blind rehabilitation  services or any other medical care. Some networks and medical centers  have made outpatient blind rehabilitation training a priority and use these  funds to provide outpatient services. For example, the network that covers  Florida and Puerto Rico has used its allocations to fund seven BROS that  are located throughout the region to provide outpatient blind  rehabilitation services to legally blind veterans in their own homes or at  VA facilities. Currently, the VIAB is working with VA\u2019s Office of Finance  and Allocation Resource Center to develop an allocation amount that  would better reflect the cost of providing blind rehabilitation services on  an outpatient basis, which could in turn, provide an incentive for networks  and medical centers to expand outpatient rehabilitation services for legally  blind veterans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Many legally blind veterans have some vision, which frequently can be  enhanced with optical low vision devices and training that includes  learning to perform everyday activities such as cooking, reading  prescription bottles, doing laundry, and paying bills. Since the 1940s, VA\u2019s  preferred method of providing training to these veterans has been through  inpatient services offered by BRCs. Because of its predisposition toward  inpatient care, VA has developed little capacity to provide this care on an  outpatient basis uniformly throughout the country. For the last 10 years,  VA has been transitioning its overall health care system from a delivery  model based primarily on inpatient care to one incorporating more  outpatient care. Outpatient services for legally blind veterans, however,  have lagged behind this trend. Recently, VA drafted a uniform standard of  care policy that recommends a full range of blind rehabilitation services,  emphasizing more outpatient care, including more services provided by  VISOR, VICTORS, and BROS type programs.
