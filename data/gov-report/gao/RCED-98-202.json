In fiscal year 1997, it had expenditures totaling $16.4 billion. Under the Section 8 program, residents in subsidized units generally pay 30 percent of their income for rent and HUD pays the balance. The Section 8 program provides rental assistance tied to specific property units (project-based assistance) and to families and individuals who live in affordable rental housing of their choice, as long as the units meet HUD\u2019s rent and quality standards (tenant-based assistance). According to HUD data, in fiscal year 1997, the tenant-based and project-based programs each served approximately 1.4 million households. This report focuses on issues concerning the project-based rental assistance program, including the project-based assistance associated with housing for the elderly and disabled.", "HUD has estimated a growing need for Section 8 project-based funding over the next 5 years to cover the costs of renewing expiring Section 8 rental assistance contracts and of providing additional funding to existing Section 8 contracts that lack sufficient funds to cover payments for the full term of the contracts. As a result, the Congress has become increasingly concerned that HUD have effective systems in place to identify unexpended Section 8 funds that can be used to offset future funding needs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "History of the Section 8 Program", "paragraphs": ["The Section 8 housing assistance program, named for the revised section 8 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, was originally established by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-383). Section 8 rental assistance is generally limited to families whose incomes are at or below 50 percent of the area\u2019s median income and to rental units that meet HUD or local standards for decent, safe, and sanitary housing. In the project-based program, assistance is tied to specific housing units under an assistance contract, rather than to the families themselves, and is therefore referred to as \u201cproject based.\u201d HUD generally contracts directly with, and provides rental subsidies to, the owners of private rental housing; in some cases, HUD contracts with state finance agencies that are responsible for administering the rental assistance program for low-income residents. Typically, the initial contracts were for 15, 20, or 40 years.", "In recent years, the Congress has generally preferred to provide new Section 8 rental assistance in the form of tenant-based assistance. However, the Congress continues to provide funding to renew existing Section 8 project-based contracts as they expire and to amend contracts with insufficient funding to meet their contract terms. The Congress also continues to provide new project-based assistance for properties funded under the Section 202 housing for the elderly program and the Section 811 housing for the disabled capital advance program. According to HUD, about 24,000 active Section 8 project-based contracts covered about 1.4 million property units as of September 30, 1997. These contracts are associated with four main programs and several smaller programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Four Main Section 8 Project-Based Programs", "paragraphs": ["The four principal project-based programs are the (1) New Construction/Substantial Rehabilitation Program, (2) Elderly/Disabled Program, (3) Loan Management Set Aside Program, and (4) Property Disposition Program. These programs are described below.", "New Construction/Substantial Rehabilitation Program. The purpose of this program was to encourage developers to build or rehabilitate projects for lower-income families by providing rental assistance contracts for a negotiated number of units in a project for periods ranging from 15 to 40 years. The program was established in 1974 and repealed by the Congress in 1983 because of its high cost. Thus, funding for new project-based rental assistance contracts associated with newly constructed or rehabilitated properties was discontinued in 1983, except for new contracts associated with housing for the elderly and disabled.", "Elderly/Disabled Program. Since fiscal year 1992, HUD\u2019s programs for the elderly and disabled have provided property development funding to sponsors of low-income housing through capital advances and project-based rental assistance contracts. The sponsors do not have to repay the advances as long as they continue to meet HUD\u2019s requirements for keeping rents affordable. Thus, the rental assistance contracts need to subsidize only operating costs because no mortgages are associated with the properties. The contracts under the current program are not funded under the same appropriations account as the Section 8 rental assistance program, but the project-based assistance under these programs is substantially the same as Section 8 project-based assistance, except that the subsidy is limited to operating costs. HUD includes these contracts in its inventory of Section 8 project-based contracts. New contracts currently being issued for project-based assistance for properties for the elderly and disabled are generally issued for 5- or 20-year terms, depending upon when the project was initially approved.", "Loan Management Set Aside Program. This program was developed to provide Section 8 rental assistance to financially troubled projects. Section 8 contracts under this program were initially for 15-year terms. These contracts began expiring during the 1990s and required renewal funding. No new loan management set aside Section 8 contracts have been issued since fiscal year 1994.", "Multifamily Property Disposition Program. The purpose of this program is to facilitate the sale or transfer to new owners those properties acquired through foreclosures on defaulted loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Legislation enacted in 1988 required HUD to preserve some of the units in these properties as affordable housing for low- to moderate-income households. HUD satisfied this requirement by providing project-based rental assistance under 15-year Section 8 contracts with the new owners. In 1995, HUD stopped entering into new project-based contracts for property disposition and began using Section 8 vouchers and certificates under the tenant-based program instead. However, some new project-based contracts with 15-year terms will be executed in the future as a result of a demonstration program that HUD implemented in 1994 to test the feasibility of tenant ownership options at foreclosed properties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Smaller Section 8 Project-Based Programs", "paragraphs": ["Other Section 8 programs include the (1) housing preservation program, (2) project-based tenant protection program, and (3) community investment demonstration program, also referred to as the pension program.

The Congress established the program to avoid displacing lower-income households and losing affordable housing stock. These consequences were anticipated as the owners of federally insured properties, developed during the 1960s and 1970s, were approaching eligibility to pay off their mortgages. Once they have paid off the mortgages, owners do not have to meet existing operating restrictions, such as limits on residents\u2019 income levels and the rents that could be charged. HUD provided project-based rental assistance as one of the incentives for owners to continue low-income restrictions. The Congress discontinued the use of this incentive to reduce excessive program costs by 1997 and terminated the preservation program in its entirety in fiscal year 1998.", "Project-Based Tenant Protection Program. This program provides vouchers or certificates to eligible households who face displacement or rent increases for various reasons, such as the owners\u2019 opting out of the Section 8 project-based program or HUD\u2019s terminating the project-based assistance because owners failed to comply with housing quality standards. Under this program, HUD\u2019s Office of Housing receives appropriations but transfers the funding over to HUD\u2019s Office of Public and Indian Housing, which provides the tenant-based assistance.", "Community Investment Demonstration Program. This program, referred to as the pension fund program, was created by the Congress in 1993 to demonstrate how the leveraging of HUD\u2019s resources can encourage pension funds to invest in the production and preservation of affordable housing. Six participating pension funds make or purchase uninsured loans to finance the construction or rehabilitation of multifamily rental housing for lower-income families. To reduce the risks incurred by the pension funds, HUD uses Section 8 project-based funds, limited to 120 percent of the local fair market rent under contracts of up to 15 years."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HUD\u2019s Funding Requests for Section 8 Project-Based Contracts", "paragraphs": ["HUD receives funding (budget authority) for the project-based program primarily to pay for contract renewals as well as for contract amendments to fund contracts that do not have sufficient funds to make payments for the full term of the contract.

This need arises when the initial funding was not sufficient to provide adequate rental assistance over the life of the contract. In 1996, the Congress revised the Section 8 program to permit HUD to transfer any remaining budget authority from expired or terminated Section 8 project-based assistance contracts to other housing assistance contracts. Prior to this change, HUD\u2019s authority to use recaptured budget authority from expired or terminated contracts had to be treated in accordance with the terms of the annual appropriations acts.", "Because an increasing number of Section 8 project-based contracts are coming due for renewal and because of the need to provide amendment funding to existing contracts, HUD has estimated a growing need for budget authority.

According to an official in that office, such information could not be provided because the appropriations for the tenant-based and project-based programs are provided in one lump sum, and the Department has not tracked the two programs separately.

Currently, most project-based contracts are in the form of housing assistance payment contracts that are administered by HUD personnel. These contracts are to be converted into annual contributions contracts administered by a public housing agency or a housing finance agency. HUD says that state housing agencies currently administering Section 8 tenant-based programs would be offered an opportunity to administer an annual contributions contract for all the remaining project-based contracts in the state if they have the administrative capacity to do so.

The latter category will include contracts that have been terminated. In addition, we obtained information from Office of Housing officials at headquarters and field office locations concerning the status of unexpended balances associated with the elderly/disabled, property disposition, and pension fund programs because of issues associated with these programs, such as program changes that affect the need for existing funds. Additionally, we examined HUD\u2019s reports on the status of funds on inactive projects (also referred to as aging reports) and other documentation provided by the Office of the Chief Financial Officer to analyze selected inactive, expired, and pending contracts. However, we did not conduct a systematic analysis of all of HUD\u2019s Section 8 project-based unexpended balances to identify funds that were no longer needed.", "To examine the effectiveness of HUD\u2019s procedures to evaluate unexpended Section 8 project-based balances to ensure they do not reach unreasonable levels and are spent in a timely manner, we reviewed and analyzed HUD\u2019s annual certification process for Section 8 project-based balances and reviewed HUD\u2019s Budget Forecast System (BFS) model, which the Department uses to estimate Section 8 amendment needs for budgeting purposes, as well as various analyses produced by the model.

We obtained the supporting data files and examined the model\u2019s input and output to determine if the model was working as intended. The funding estimates produced by the model are in nominal dollars, not adjusted for inflation. We reviewed five different analyses and worked with HUD throughout the review to correct the errors in data and methodology that we identified. We also reviewed HUD\u2019s fiscal year 1999 budget request for amendment funding for the Section 8 project-based program. This request was supported by an April 1997 BFS analysis.

The remaining $1 billion (2 percent) was for other programs, such as the housing preservation, pension fund, and tenant protection programs.", "While most of the undisbursed obligations are needed to fulfill HUD\u2019s Section 8 funding commitments over the remaining life of each contract, funding in excess of contractual needs has accumulated in some cases. Specifically, for 1,085 contracts that expired on or before September 30, 1996, we identified about $345 million in undisbursed obligations as of September 30, 1997. About 900 of these contracts, with balances totaling about $218 million, expired during 1994 or earlier. These balances generally remained because rental assistance payments were lower than HUD anticipated when the contracts were funded.

Specifically, for 304 of the 440 contracts without recent expenditures, HUD field offices indicated that 77 of these contracts had been terminated for various reasons. The other 227 contracts were designated as either active, pending, or suspended. Included in the active category were 104 contracts with property owners serving the elderly or disabled, with about $100 million in Section 8 balances, that were not disbursing funds at all because the owners had not requested rental assistance payments.

About $77 million of this total was reserved for a 1994 HUD demonstration program in which a state housing finance agency agreed to administer the disposition of 11 foreclosed properties. The program requires that tenant groups receive preference in purchasing the properties. HUD expects to execute the 15-year contracts under this program within 2 years.", "Another $53 million in unobligated but reserved funds in the property disposition program was for 16 unexecuted contracts having funding reservation dates as far back as 1984. In the three cases we examined, totaling $6.4 million, HUD either could not identify the property or told us that the new owners decided not to participate in the Section 8 program. For example, HUD records showed that a field office had reserved about $4.6 million for a Section 8 contract in 1985 but never executed the contract because of a change in disposition plans. At another office, property disposition staff reserved about $1.4 million in August 1994 for a HUD-owned property it planned to transfer to a unit of city government. However, by August 1996, the purchaser had decided to demolish the property instead of accepting the Section 8 contract. In another case, HUD officials informed us that they could not identify a specific property associated with a 1991 reservation of $423,000 that we questioned. In all of these situations, HUD officials stated that the funds should have been released.", "In the category of \u201cother\u201d programs, HUD had about $170 million in unobligated but reserved funds. The largest portion of this amount, about $123 million, was for the pension fund program, which the Congress authorized in 1993 to test the feasibility of becoming partners with large pension funds in the purchase, rehabilitation, and construction of affordable housing. HUD agreed to subsidize these properties through 15-year Section 8 contracts, with rents limited to 120 percent of an area\u2019s fair market rent. As of April 1998, six participating pension funds had submitted applications for the renovation of 42 properties. HUD has approved 24 of the proposals, and work had been completed on 15. By the end of fiscal year 1998, HUD expects that as many as 30 properties, consisting of about 3,300 units, will be financed by participating pension funds. HUD has developed a preliminary proposal for the repeal of this program; however, we were told that such action would not affect the completion of projects currently in the pipeline.", "In addition to the unobligated but reserved fund balances for future Section 8 contracts, many existing contracts that have already been executed have unobligated but reserved balances remaining. Our analysis of these balances showed that some are not needed. For instance, 271 Section 8 contracts that had expired on or before September 30, 1996, had about $60 million in unobligated but reserved balances remaining. We also found cases in which HUD continued to record Section 8 reservations as valid in its accounting records even though the Section 8 contracts were never executed. For example, we examined two reservations, made in 1980 and 1990, that totaled $29 million. The $20 million reservation recorded in 1980 had no further activity reflected in HUD\u2019s accounting records. The cognizant field office confirmed that this reservation should have been removed from the accounting records. The reservation had been associated with a property that was planned under the new construction/substantial rehabilitation program, but the commitment for the property was never made. Similarly, we found a $9 million reservation, recorded in 1990, that was associated with a property for the elderly and disabled that the cognizant field office reported it could not identify. Funds for both of these properties remained reserved as of September 30, 1997.", "In addition, we found that HUD had reserved approximately $25 million of Section 8 project-based funding during the last week of fiscal year 1997 for 82 contracts previously executed under the housing preservation program. However, on the basis of HUD\u2019s own projections of contract expenditure rates through contract expiration, it is questionable whether most of these contracts need the additional funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unobligated and Unreserved Balances Are Available in Fiscal Year 1998", "paragraphs": ["As of September 30, 1997, HUD\u2019s Section 8 project-based balances included about $.7 billion in unobligated and unreserved funds that it carried into fiscal year 1998.

An Office of Housing official informed us that it did not have an immediate need for these project-based disposition funds and had carried them over into fiscal year 1998. As discussed previously, since 1995, HUD has discontinued the use of project-based assistance for property disposition and uses tenant-based assistance instead.

HUD contractor staff maintain and operate the BFS model. For each active Section 8 project-based contract, the BFS model compares projected expenditures over the life of the contract, adjusted for inflation, with funding that is currently available and estimates whether each contract has a funding shortfall or excess funding that can be recaptured. The model includes two categories of funding: undisbursed obligations and unobligated but reserved funds. The BFS model provides estimates, by year, of the projected shortfall amounts and of the recaptures associated with expiring contracts.

In this methodology, HUD spreads estimated funding shortfalls over the remaining term of the contract rather than beginning in the year the contract is projected to run out of funds. For example, for a contract costing $1 million a year with 10 years remaining and $9 million available, the $1 million shortfall would be spread out in $100,000 increments over the next 10 years, rather than being identified as a shortfall of $1 million in the tenth year.

In addition, the methodology excludes some active contracts that did not receive any payments during the 6 months included in the analysis. HUD officials emphasized to us that the methodology would overstate some needs and understate others. However, the Department has not examined the overall impact of this methodology on the estimates. Our analysis of the expenditure rates indicates this problem tends to overstate expenditures to some degree. HUD officials have agreed that the methodology should be corrected.

This total includes the following amounts: $833 million in project-based amendment funding that, according to the budget director for the Office of Housing, was appropriated to the Department for fiscal year 1998, including amounts associated with properties funded under the capital advance program for the elderly and disabled; $133 million of Section 8 project-based amendment funds that were unobligated and unreserved at the end of fiscal year 1997 and were carried over for use in 1998; $517 million in project-based funding that we identified in chapter 2 as being no longer needed.", "These funds would nearly offset the net funding needs through 2035, as shown in table 3.2.", "In terms of errors, this analysis again excludes about 1,800 active contracts, which would further reduce funding shortfalls. Our analysis indicates that if these contracts were included, the total long-term funding need would be reduced by approximately $200 million. These contracts were excluded because (1) the contractor made an error by accidently excluding 400 of the contracts and (2) the Office of Housing provided a file of contracts to be used in the analysis that excluded 1,400 active contracts. In addition, this analysis continues to use the methodology for estimating expenditures that tends to overstate expenditures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD\u2019s Sensitivity Analyses Illustrate the Effects of Different Assumptions", "paragraphs": ["According to HUD\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Budget Director, and other HUD staff, the April 1998 estimate of $1.5 billion in net funding needs for Section 8 contract amendments (in table 3.2) could understate actual needs because the inflation rate is low (about 2 percent) and the analysis assumes limits on rent increases for many properties. That is, the net funding needs produced by BFS analyses vary depending upon the assumptions about future inflation rates and the limits on future rent increases. To illustrate how changes in these assumptions can affect estimates of amendment needs, HUD prepared two sensitivity analyses.", "The first sensitivity analysis is based on the same inflation factors as the analysis presented in table 3.2 (ranging from 1.9 to 2.2 percent), but this analysis does not include assumptions incorporating legislatively mandated limits on rent increases. This analysis projects amendment funding shortfalls for Section 8 project-based assistance of about $18 billion, recaptures of about $10.6 billion, and net funding needs of about $7.5 billion through 2035. Table 3.3 presents the results of this analysis.", "The second sensitivity analysis assumed that the inflation rate for each year was 3.2 percent and also excluded the impact of limits on rent increases. As shown in table 3.4, this analysis projects shortfalls of $24 billion, recaptures of $9.7 billion, and net funding needs of $14.2 billion through 2035.", "HUD officials view the estimates shown in table 3.2 and the sensitivity analyses shown in tables 3.3 and 3.4 as a range of potential amendment funding needs. However, it is important to note that both sensitivity analyses exclude the effect of the legislatively mandated limits on future rent increases\u2014that is, they assume that the limits are repealed and that the inflation estimates apply to all Section 8 contracts. At this time, we are not aware of any major legislative efforts to repeal the limits on rent increases. As shown in table 3.2, the legislatively mandated limits substantially lower the estimate of long-term amendment needs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["HUD\u2019s policies and procedures for identifying and deobligating funds that are no longer needed do not ensure that all Section 8 project-based balances are evaluated each year and that balances that are no longer needed for specific Section 8 project-based contracts are identified and deobligated in a timely manner. The current review process does not provide HUD with adequate assurance that the reviews are being conducted properly and that identified funds are being deobligated. Assurance is inadequate because HUD does not adequately oversee the review process conducted by program offices and because the program officials who are responsible for reviewing the balances are not required to certify that the unexpended balances associated with the Section 8 project-based contracts continue to be needed. As we discussed in chapter 2, we identified about $517 million in funding that was still reflected in HUD\u2019s accounting system as of September 30, 1997, and that was no longer needed because the contracts expired, were terminated, or were never executed. If such funding had been identified by HUD, it could have been used to help offset the Department\u2019s need for Section 8 amendment funding.", "In addition, the Department has requested more funding for Section 8 contract amendments than needed because it does not have effective processes in place to take unexpended balances into account when determining funding needs as part of its budget process. While HUD uses a model to perform such analysis, we found a number of errors in the analysis it used for formulating its fiscal year 1999 budget request. These errors included active contracts being excluded, all available funding not being fully reflected, and weaknesses in the methodology used to estimate expenditure rates. These errors stemmed from the Department\u2019s not ensuring that the data used in the model were complete, accurate, and current and that sufficient quality checks were performed either by HUD or contractor staff to ensure that the analyses were reliable. While HUD and contractor staff took actions to correct most of the problems that we identified during our review, it is important that HUD have effective controls in place to ensure that these problems do not recur in future analyses. In addition, HUD has yet to correct problems with the methodology used by the BFS model to estimate future expenditure rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To improve the Department\u2019s oversight of Section 8 project-based balances, we recommend that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development require the Chief Financial Officer to revise the procedures used in the Department\u2019s annual review of unexpended balances to ensure that reviews are completed and that balances that are not needed are identified and deobligated in a timely manner. This process should include a requirement that those officials responsible for reviewing the balances actually certify the continued need for the unexpended balances associated with Section 8 project-based contracts and that the Office of the Chief Financial Officer provide sufficient oversight to determine the adequacy of the reviews conducted.", "We also recommend that the Secretary require the Chief Financial Officer and the Office of Housing to ensure that HUD\u2019s future funding requests for the Section 8 project-based program fully take into account the availability of unexpended balances that may be used to offset funding needs. To accomplish this goal, the Department would need to establish controls to ensure that the data used in any supporting analyses are complete, accurate, and current; that available funding is fully reflected; and that sufficient checks are performed to ensure that the analyses produced are reliable. In addition, the Department should improve the methodology used to estimate future expenditure rates for Section 8 project-based contracts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft copy of this report to HUD for its review and comment. In commenting on the draft, HUD agreed with the data presented in the report and with the recommendations. However, HUD disagreed with the way in which we presented the results of three analyses of Section 8 project-based funding needs. HUD believed that the report\u2019s presentation would have been strengthened if instead of emphasizing one of the analyses, we presented the results of the three analyses dated April 1998 in a consolidated table and did more to explain the risks associated with each analysis. In this regard, HUD stated that our report highlights a HUD-prepared analysis that uses the low inflation assumptions for the 1999 budget and essentially \u201cfreezes\u201d much of the expenditures on Section 8 contracts at current rates for long periods. HUD stated that a more realistic assumption is that rents and incomes will increase in the future (notwithstanding current law limiting certain rent increases) and these increases will result in a growing drain on the obligated balances on those contracts. HUD also emphasized that it believes that estimates of Section 8 project-based amendment needs are very sensitive to inflation rates and that estimates of amendment shortfalls and recaptures should be expressed as a range, based on alternative inflation assumptions.", "We agree with HUD that estimates of long-term amendment needs are sensitive to assumptions regarding inflation. In fact, the report clearly states that HUD\u2019s long-term amendment needs could increase substantially if inflation rates prove to be higher than currently estimated. However, we believe that our presentation of the three analyses of Section 8 project-based funding needs is appropriate. The report gives more emphasis to one analysis because that analysis is based on legislatively mandated limits on rent increases for certain properties and OMB\u2019s economic assumptions for the fiscal year 1999 budget. In contrast, the other two analyses of long-term amendment needs that HUD prepared do not reflect the legislatively mandated limits on rent increases and thus tend to overstate the increases in Section 8 assistance that many properties would receive under current law. Accordingly, we do not agree with HUD\u2019s assertion that these analyses reflect more realistic assumptions concerning Section 8 project-based amendment needs. Our report does recognize, however, that HUD views the three analyses as a potential range of amendment funding needs.", "HUD also stated that the report leads to a conclusion that remaining balances can be diverted out of the project-based inventory with no long-range consequences. Instead, HUD states that each dollar taken from the inventory will have to be replaced with budget authority at some point in the future. Our report does not conclude that remaining balances can be diverted from the program. However, we do not agree that HUD is in a position to conclude that each dollar taken from Section 8 project-based amendment funding would necessarily have to be replaced at some point in the future. Before a reliable conclusion on the long-term funding needs of the Section 8 project-based program can be made, HUD needs to implement our recommendation to improve the methodology used to estimate future expenditure rates for the Section 8 project-based contracts because the methodology currently used may substantially overstate expenditure rates. In addition, HUD needs to establish controls to ensure that the data used in its analyses are complete, current, and accurate. Once these actions are completed, we believe the Department will be in a better position to reach reliable conclusions concerning its short- and long-term funding needs.
