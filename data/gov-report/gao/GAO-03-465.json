To support the operation, maintenance, and modernization of its business systems, the department requested approximately $18 billion for fiscal year 2003. Funding is only part of the solution to improving DOD's current system environment. A key ingredient to success is effectively managing and overseeing these investments. DOD has invested approximately $316 million in four key Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) projects. However, DOD has not demonstrated that this substantial investment will markedly improve DOD financial management information needed for decision-making and financial reporting purposes. In fact, the DOD Comptroller terminated one project in December 2002, after an investment of over $126 million, citing poor program performance and increasing costs. Continued investment in the other three projects has not been justified because requisite analyses of the costs, benefits, and risks of each one do not reflect cost increases and/or schedule delays. DOD oversight of the four DFAS projects has not been effective. Collectively, DFAS, the DOD Comptroller, and the DOD Chief Information Officer share investment management responsibility for these four projects.

In November 1994, DOD began the  SPS program to acquire and deploy a single automated system to perform  all contract management-related functions within DOD\u2019s procurement  process for all DOD organizations and activities.  The laudable goal of SPS  was to replace 76 existing procurement systems with a single departmental  system.  DOD estimated that SPS had a life-cycle cost of approximately $3  billion over a 10-year period.  According to DOD, SPS was to support about  43,000 users at over 1,000 sites worldwide and was to interface with key  financial management functions, such as payment processing.   Additionally, SPS was intended to replace the contract administration  functions currently performed by the Mechanization of Contract  Administration Services, a system implemented in 1968.  Our July 2001  report and February 2002 testimony identified weaknesses in the  department\u2019s management of its investment in SPS.

In 1997, DOD selected DJAS to  be one of three general fund accounting systems.  The other two general  fund systems were the Standard Accounting and Reporting System and the  Standard Accounting and Budgetary Reporting System.  As originally  envisioned, DJAS would perform the accounting for the Army and the Air  Force as well as the DOD transportation and security assistance areas.   Subsequently, in February 1998, DFAS decided that the Air Force could  withdraw from using DJAS, because either the Air Force processes or the  DJAS processes would need significant reengineering to permit use of a  joint accounting system.  As a result, the Air Force started its own general  fund accounting system\u2014General Fund and Finance System\u2014which  resulted in the development of a fourth general fund accounting system.", "In June 2000, the DOD Inspector General reported that DFAS was  developing DJAS at an estimated life-cycle cost of about $700 million  without demonstrating that the program was the most cost-effective  alternative for providing a portion of DOD\u2019s general fund accounting.

For example, DDRS is no longer intended to provide the  capability to build an audit trail so that financial data can be tracked back  to its transaction-based support, as originally planned.  The Federal  Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 requires that agency  financial management systems comply with federal financial management  systems requirements, applicable federal accounting standards, and the  U.S. Government Standard General Ledger at the transaction level.   Systems meeting these requirements should be able to produce auditable  financial statements and otherwise have audit trail capability.  However,  DDRS system users will have to rely on the audit trail capabilities of feeder  systems in order to trace individual transactions to their source  documents.  As we have previously reported, the data from the feeder  systems, which are outside the control of DFAS and provide approximately  80 percent of the data that DOD needs for financial reporting purposes, are  not reliable.  Additionally, until DCD is operational, DDRS will be receiving  data from the feeder systems in order to prepare the department\u2019s financial  reports on the results of its operations.  Therefore, DOD\u2019s financial reports  produced by DDRS will (1) continue to be incomplete and inaccurate and  thus not useful for decision-making purposes and (2) remain unable to  withstand the scrutiny of a financial audit.", "For DSDS, an economic analysis was prepared in September 2000.   However, it has not been updated to reflect material changes in the project.   For example, as shown in figure 6, the full operational capability (FOC)  date at the time the economic analysis was prepared was February 2003.  However, according to information provided by DFAS, the current FOC  date is December 2005\u2014a schedule slippage of almost 3 years. Such  delays postpone the delivery of promised benefits.  DFAS has stated that  the cost information is being updated to support a Milestone C decision,  which they anticipate will occur in early fiscal year 2004.", "Additionally, DSDS delivery of promised benefits depends upon the  DCD/DCW being implemented on time.  However, as previously discussed,  DCD/DCW implementation has been fraught with difficulties, which has a  corresponding adverse effect on DSDS schedule delays. For example,  DCD/DCW project management officials are in the process of addressing  102 requests for requirement changes.   According to the DCD/DCW  program manager, the date for resolving these changes and approving the  Operational Requirements Document is November 2003.  Until this process  is completed, affected systems integration testing for other DCD/DCW  dependent systems, such as DSDS, cannot be finalized.   Further, according  to DFAS officials, the continued operation of existing legacy systems may  result in an increase to the DSDS life-cycle cost estimate by approximately  $14 million for each 6-month delay.  This would quickly erode the savings of  $171 million that DFAS estimated in September 2000, and reconfirmed in  January 2003.", "Without an updated economic analysis to justify continued investment in  DDRS and DSDS, DOD does not have reasonable assurance that continued  investment will result in commensurate improvement in the financial  management operations of the department."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Oversight of DFAS IT Projects Has Not Been Effective", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s oversight over the four DFAS projects we reviewed has been  ineffective.

Additionally, they told us that their review is  limited to a review of budgetary information and budget exhibits, and that  they compare the current year budget request to the previous year\u2019s request  to determine if any significant funding increases are being requested for the  coming fiscal year.  If the budget request is generally consistent from year  to year, they said that they do not raise questions about the project.   According to these officials, the review of DFAS\u2019s fiscal year 2003 budget  did not result in the identification of issues that warranted further review.", "While the DOD Comptroller is the responsible authority for DFAS  activities, DFAS is also responsible for ensuring that its proposed  investments will result in systems that are implemented at acceptable costs  and within reasonable and expected time frames.  To fulfill this  responsibility, DFAS established the CIO/BIE Council to oversee system  investments.  As outlined in the CIO/BIE Council charter, members of the  council are responsible for, among other things, advising the Leadership  Council\u2014DFAS\u2019s senior decision-making body\u2014on IT investment  decisions. The CIO/BIE Council membership includes representatives of  DFAS\u2019s business lines, such as accounting services and commercial pay, as  well as IT management.", "In order to assure that the roles, responsibilities, and authorities of the IT  investment board are well defined and that board processes are clear, the  ITIM Framework states that an IT investment process guide should be  created to direct IT investment board operations. While DFAS has  endeavored to give the CIO/BIE a role in the acquisition management and  oversight process, it has not provided clear, consistent guidance to  describe that role and the associated operating procedure. Though the  council charter does mention the CIO/BIE Council\u2019s responsibilities, it does  not adequately describe them, address the council\u2019s authority, or describe  how the council is to fulfill its responsibilities. The DFAS 8000 series also  addresses CIO/BIE responsibilities (DFAS 8000.1-R, Part C). However, the  8000 series does not describe how the CIO/BIE is expected to execute its  responsibilities, including providing corporate oversight and reviewing  capital budget proposals.  The lack of clear definition of responsibilities  and authority limits the council\u2019s ability to effectively perform oversight- related activities.  For the four IT investment projects we reviewed, we  found no evidence that the CIO/BIE effectively monitored the cost,  schedule, or performance goals of the four projects.", "As previously noted, the DOD CIO is responsible for overseeing major  automated information systems.  As such, this office is responsible for  ensuring that the investments being made in DCD/DCW and DPPS are  justified.  However, the DOD CIO did not effectively exercise this authority.   In regard to DPPS, the DOD CIO was designated the milestone decision  authority in November 1996.  While DOD CIO officials told us that they  were aware of the problems with DPPS, they were unable to provide any  documentation that indicated they had raised concerns with the DPPS  effort.", "DCD/DCW was not brought under the purview of the DOD CIO until March  2001\u2014 approximately 2\u00bd years after the project began.  DOD CIO officials  expressed concerns about the viability of DCD/DCW and questioned  DFAS\u2019s decision to move forward absent an economic analysis.  However,  they were unable to provide us with documentation that indicated they had  carried out their oversight responsibilities and independently determined  whether DCD/DCW was a viable investment.", "According to DOD CIO officials, despite being the milestone decision  authority for major projects, they have little practical authority in  influencing component agency IT projects.  As such, they said they try to  work with the program managers to ensure that all of the required  documentation for passing the next milestone is prepared, but the  department\u2019s culture, which rests organizational authority and funding  control with the components, precludes them from exercising effective IT  investment oversight.  The comments of the DOD CIO officials support the  fact that the current stovepiped, parochial management of DOD\u2019s IT  investments has led to the previously discussed proliferation of business  systems.  As we previously reported, DOD\u2019s organizational structure and  embedded culture have made it difficult to implement departmentwide  oversight or visibility over information resources.", "Similarly, we recently reported that DOD does not yet have the  departmental investment governance structure and process controls  needed to adequately align ongoing investments with DOD\u2019s architectural  goals and direction. Instead, DOD continues to allow its component  organizations to make their own investment decisions, following different  approaches and criteria. We reported that this stovepiped decision-making  process has contributed to the department\u2019s current complex, error prone  environment of over 1,700 systems.  In particular, DOD has not yet  established and applied common investment criteria to its ongoing IT  system projects using a hierarchy of investment review and funding  decision-making bodies, each composed of representatives from across the  department. DOD also has not yet conducted a comprehensive review of its  ongoing IT investments to ensure that they are consistent with its  architecture development efforts.  Until it does these things, DOD will  likely continue to lack effective control over the billions of dollars it is  currently spending on IT projects.  To address this problem we  recommended that DOD establish a series of investment review boards,  each responsible and accountable for selecting and controlling investments  that meet defined threshold criteria, and each composed of the appropriate  level of executive representatives, depending on the threshold criteria,  from across the department.  We also reiterated our open  recommendations governing limitations in business system investments  pending development of the architecture."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD is investing billions of dollars annually in hundreds of systems that  perform the same function spread across numerous DOD components. As  we have previously reported, this proliferation of systems has resulted in  part because DOD\u2019s embedded culture and parochial operations have  permitted each of the military services and DOD agencies to manage and  oversee their IT investments apart from one another.  It has also occurred  because DOD has not effectively managed its investments in IT business  systems, as our past work and the DOD Inspector General work have  demonstrated.  As a result, DOD runs a high risk that hundreds of millions  of dollars will continue to be invested annually in modernization efforts  that will not result in improvements in the department\u2019s operations.", "In each of the four system projects we discuss in the report, DOD has  invested millions of dollars without economically justifying its investments,  in large part because those entities responsible for managing and  overseeing these investments have not required such justification despite  schedule slippages, cost overruns, and reductions in planned capability.   Urgent need for effective investment control is exemplified by DPPS\u2014$126  million for a terminated project. More vigorous oversight of DPPS could  have precluded the substantial investment in this failed effort.  Until it has  effective investment management and oversight, DOD will not have  reasonable assurance that its continued investment in the remaining three  projects discussed in this report, as well as its other system projects, are  justified."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of  Defense (Comptroller) to limit funding in the DFAS Corporate Database/  Corporate Warehouse, the Defense Standard Disbursing System, and the  Defense Departmental Reporting System until the DOD Comptroller, in  collaboration with the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Command, Control,  Communications & Intelligence), and the Director, Program Analysis and  Evaluation, demonstrates on the basis of credible analysis and data that  continued investment in these three projects will produce benefits that  exceed costs.", "We further recommend that the Secretary of Defense, in light of the  department\u2019s ongoing efforts to modernize its business systems, direct the  Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to evaluate all remaining DFAS  IT projects and ensure that each project is being implemented at  acceptable costs, within reasonable time frames, and is contributing to  tangible, observable improvements in mission performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided written comments on a draft of this report.

To  assist us in our evaluation, we used our Information Technology  Investment Management (ITIM) framework.  The ITIM identifies critical  processes for successful IT investment and organizes these processes into  a framework of increasingly mature stages.  We focused on the Stage 2  critical processes of IT project oversight and IT investment board practices  based on DFAS\u2019s self assessment that it was at Stage 2.

For these four projects we reviewed documentation, such as  mission needs statements, acquisition program baseline updates, and  project management plans.  According to DOD, it provided estimates for  DCD/DCW and DDRS in constant dollars and DPPS and DSDS in escalated  dollars.  We also reviewed and analyzed charters and meeting minutes of  the DFAS investment oversight boards and working groups.  To supplement  our document reviews, we interviewed senior DFAS officials in the CIO and  Systems Integration Offices, as well as the program managers for the four  projects.
