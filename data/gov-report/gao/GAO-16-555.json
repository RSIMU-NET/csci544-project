HHS, in consultation with key stakeholders, has developed draft data fields and definitions for human trafficking and expects to begin piloting the data collection effort in fall 2016. Further, the National Institute of Justice, within the Department of Justice (DOJ), has awarded grants for the development and testing of methodologies that could be used to estimate the prevalence of human trafficking.", "Federal, state and local law enforcement officials and prosecutors GAO interviewed reported that investigating and prosecuting human trafficking cases is challenging for multiple reasons, including a lack of victim cooperation, limited availability of services for victims, and difficulty identifying human trafficking. Officials told us that obtaining the victim's cooperation is important because the victim is generally the primary witness and source of evidence; however, obtaining and securing victims' cooperation is difficult, as victims may be unable or unwilling to testify due to distrust of law enforcement or fear of retaliation by the trafficker. According to these officials, victim service programs, such as those that provide mental health and substance abuse services, have helped improve victim cooperation; however, the availability of services is limited. Further, officials reported that identifying and distinguishing human trafficking from other crimes such as prostitution can be challenging. Federal, state, and local agencies have taken or are taking actions to address these challenges, such as increasing the availability of victim services through grants and implementing training and public awareness initiatives.", "GAO identified 42 grant programs with awards made in 2014 and 2015 that may be used to combat human trafficking or to assist victims of human trafficking, 15 of which are intended solely for these purposes. Although some overlap exists among these human trafficking grant programs, federal agencies have established processes to help prevent unnecessary duplication. For instance, in response to recommendations in a prior GAO report, DOJ requires grant applicants to identify any federal grants they are currently operating under as well as federal grants for which they have applied. In addition, agencies that participate in the Grantmaking Committee of the Senior Policy Operating Group are encouraged to share grant solicitations and information on proposed grant awards, allowing other agencies to comment on proposed grant awards and determine whether they plan to award funding to the same organization."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Sometimes perceived to be a foreign issue, human trafficking\u2014 the  exploitation of a person typically through force, fraud, or coercion for such  purposes as forced labor, involuntary servitude or  commercial sex\u2014is  occurring in the United States.  Human trafficking victims include women,  men and transgender individuals, adults and children, and foreign  nationals and U.S. citizens or nationals who are diverse with respect to  race, ethnicity, and sexuality, among other factors. Human trafficking can  take place in rural, suburban, and urban settings throughout the country,  and often involves victims who are already vulnerable\u2014such as missing  and runaway youth or persons dealing with substance abuse addictions.  Traffickers may lure victims into work or commercial sex with false  promises\u2014such as offering to help a teenage girl become a model\u2014and  ultimately force victims to remain in the employment situation through  various means, such as physical and sexual abuse; threatening to harm  the victim\u2019s family; or for foreign nationals, withholding their identification  and immigration documents.  Traffickers may be family members,  intimate partners, acquaintances, or strangers, and they may run the  human trafficking operation on their own or be a member of a large or  small organized criminal network. For example, in January 2015, a  federal jury convicted four gang members in El Paso, Texas\u2014one of  whom was a former juvenile probation officer\u2014for child sex trafficking and  related crimes. In June 2015, a military official from Qatar and his wife  were charged with engaging in forced labor by obtaining the labor and  services of two persons by means of force, threats of force, physical  restraint, and threats of physical restraint in San Antonio, Texas.", "Federal agencies, including the Departments of Health and Human  Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), Labor, and  State, as well as state and local law enforcement and non-governmental  organizations, have taken a collaborative approach to combating human  trafficking in the United States, both in conducting investigations and  prosecutions and ensuring that victims have access to needed services.  For instance, HHS and DOJ have several grant programs in place to train  and support law enforcement and organizations that assist victims in their  efforts to combat human trafficking, as well as to provide services to  victims, each of which also support collaboration among stakeholders. In  2014, HHS, DHS, and DOJ, in partnership with other federal agencies,  issued the first Federal Strategic Action Plan on Services for Victims of  Human Trafficking in the United States, which identified actions that each  agency will take to help rebuild the lives of trafficking victims through  coordination, collaboration, and capacity building.", "The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (JVTA) of 2015 includes a  provision for GAO to report on federal and selected state efforts to  combat human trafficking in the United States, as well as identify federal  grant programs that can be used to assist victims of trafficking.

What challenges, if any, do federal and selected state law  enforcement and prosecutorial agencies face when combating human  trafficking in the United States, and what actions have they or others  taken to address identified challenges?  3.  What federal grant programs are intended to combat human  trafficking and assist victims within the United States, and what steps  have federal agencies taken, if any, to reduce the potential for  duplication among grant programs?", "For purposes of this report, we focused on human trafficking within the  United States, which includes U.S. citizens or nationals, or those with or  without lawful immigration status, who are trafficked within the United  States, as well as foreign persons who are brought to the United States  from abroad for the purpose of trafficking.", "To address the first objective, we reviewed the JVTA and other federal  laws related to human trafficking, and interviewed DOJ, DHS, and HHS  officials to learn whether any federal agencies had efforts underway to  collect data that could be used to determine the prevalence of human  trafficking in the United States.  We also reviewed documentation issued  by the President\u2019s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat  Trafficking to learn about additional federal efforts to determine  prevalence.  We analyzed data from federal investigative and  prosecutorial agencies and two federally-funded entities, the National  Human Trafficking Resource Center (NHTRC) and the National Center for  Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), which, while not specifically  intended to do so, could give an indication of where human trafficking is  occurring in the United States for fiscal years 2013 through 2015.  We  assessed the reliability of the data the agencies and other entities  provided by questioning knowledgeable officials and reviewing the data  for obvious errors and anomalies. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To address the second objective, we interviewed headquarters officials  from the Department of Defense, DOJ, DHS, Labor, State, and the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) who are responsible for  identifying, investigating, and prosecuting human trafficking-related  crimes.

We selected these jurisdictions because they are located in states that  are among the top 10 in terms of human trafficking tips, per capita, that  were sent to NHTRC or NCMEC. We also selected these jurisdictions  because they reflect a variation in geography and receipt of human  trafficking task force funding, and are priority areas identified by DHS\u2019s  department-wide anti-human trafficking effort. In addition to federal  agencies, we interviewed state and local law enforcement and  prosecutorial agencies that were part of the identified task forces in each  of these jurisdictions. During the interviews, we asked officials whether  they experienced any challenges in carrying out their duties related to  combating human trafficking and to identify any efforts that have been or  could be taken to address challenges. While these officials\u2019 perspectives  cannot be generalized to all jurisdictions, they provided insights into  federal, state, and local efforts to combat human trafficking. We also  interviewed representatives from six non-governmental organizations that  provide services to human trafficking victims and were part of the  identified task forces in each of the selected jurisdictions. In addition, we  interviewed officials from the Federal Judicial Center to further  understand challenges faced when combating human trafficking.", "To address the third objective, we worked with agencies to develop a list  of federal grant programs that provide funding for activities related to  combating human trafficking and assisting victims. We reviewed grant  documentation and interviewed federal officials responsible for  administering human trafficking-related grant programs and grantees.  Using the GAO established framework for addressing overlap and  duplication, we used the following definitions for purposes of assessing  human trafficking grant programs:", "Overlap occurs when multiple granting agencies or grant programs  have similar goals, engage in similar activities or strategies to achieve  these goals, or target the same or similar beneficiaries.", "Duplication occurs on multiple levels. It occurs when a single grantee  uses grant funds from different federal sources to pay for the exact  same expenditure. Duplication also occurs when two or more granting  agencies or grant programs engage in the same or similar activities or  provide funding to support the same or similar services to the same  beneficiaries.", "To assess what efforts have been made to prevent any unnecessary  duplication among human trafficking grants, we reviewed DOJ and HHS  guidance and interviewed federal officials to better understand processes  put in place to prevent potential duplication. For more information on our  scope and methodology, see appendix I.", "We conducted our work from July 2015 to June 2016 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards.

The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of  2000 (TVPA), as amended, defines human trafficking under the term  \u201csevere forms of trafficking in persons.\u201d Pursuant to the TVPA, as  amended, sex trafficking is the recruitment, harboring, transportation,  provision, obtaining, patronizing, or soliciting of a person for the purpose  of a commercial sex act.  Sex trafficking is a \u201csevere\u201d form of trafficking  where it involves force, fraud or coercion, or where the victim has not  attained 18 years of age, in which case force, fraud or coercion are not  necessary elements. In the case of sex trafficking, a perpetrator\u2014which  could be a pimp, intimate partner or relative of the victim\u2014generally  forces the victim to engage in commercial sexual activity. For instance,  victims may be forced to act as hostesses in a \u201ccantina,\u201d which is a bar at  which payment for drinks includes the company of women. Additional  payment can be made for sexual contact, and officials told us that many  cantinas may contain rooms for the purpose of sexual acts, while others  pay for the transaction at the bar and then engage in the sexual act in a  nearby hotel. The TVPA defines labor related trafficking generally as the  recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person  for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the  purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or  slavery. Labor trafficking can take various forms, such as debt bondage,  domestic servitude, and forced labor.  For example, in one case,  workers from Thailand were brought to the United States with the  understanding that they would have highly-paid work as welders.   However, once they arrived in the country, they were forced to work in  restaurants without pay, had their passports confiscated, and were  confined to cramped apartments without any electricity, water, or gas."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal and State Laws to Combat Human Trafficking", "paragraphs": ["Federal efforts to combat and prevent human trafficking in the United  States have evolved over time, including various laws that have  established federal agencies\u2019 roles in these efforts. During the 1990s, the  United States began to take steps to address human trafficking at home  and abroad. DOJ prosecuted trafficking cases under several federal  criminal statutes, including the involuntary servitude statutes, the Mann  Act, and labor laws on workplace conditions and compensation.   However, involuntary servitude was restricted to cases of physical abuse  including force, or threats of force, or threats of legal coercion, and did not  include psychological coercion, which is often used by today\u2019s  traffickers. These statutes spread enforcement authority across the  federal government and resulted in different case outcomes, depending  on the charges brought or which agency learned of the allegations of  abuse.", "Over the past few decades, Congress has taken numerous legislative  actions to help combat human trafficking and ensure that victims have  access to needed services. In October 2000, the TVPA was enacted to  combat trafficking in persons, ensure just and effective punishment of  traffickers and protect trafficking victims.  Among other things, the  TVPA, as amended, makes it illegal to knowingly or recklessly use force,  fraud, or coercion to recruit, entice, harbor, transport, provide, obtain,  advertise, maintain, patronize, or solicit any person to engage in a  commercial sex act. The TVPA also makes it illegal to take the above  actions, and thus cause a person under 18 years of age to engage in a  commercial sex act, with or without the use of force, fraud, or coercion.  In addition, the TVPA criminalizes the use of certain means, including  force, threats of force, physical restraint, or serious harm or threats of  such harm to knowingly provide or obtain persons for any labor or  services, such as working in farms, factories, and households. The act  also updated and supplemented existing involuntary servitude statutes  used to prosecute trafficking crimes, enhanced the penalties for trafficking  crimes, and provided a range of new protections and assistance for  victims of trafficking.  The TVPA provided for the creation of the  Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking, now known  as the President\u2019s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat  Trafficking in Persons, as a cabinet-level entity that convenes routinely to  advance and coordinate both federal policies and the implementation of  the TVPA.", "As amended by the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of  2003, the TVPA also established the Senior Policy Operating Group  (SPOG), consisting of senior officials from 14 federal agencies and the  White House National Security Council and the Domestic Policy Council,  to coordinate activities of federal departments and agencies regarding  policies (including grants and grant policies) involving international human  trafficking and the implementation of the TVPA. This multidisciplinary  approach includes the enforcement of criminal and labor law,  development of victim-centered identification and protection measures,  support for innovations in data gathering and research, education and  public awareness, enhanced partnerships and research opportunities,  and strategically linked foreign assistance and diplomatic engagement.  Congress also reauthorized the TVPA in 2005 and 2008; and, in 2013,  further amended provisions of the act, its reauthorizations, and other  related laws.", "In 2015, the President signed into law the JVTA, which, among other  things, required the Attorney General to ensure that law enforcement  officers and federal prosecutors receive anti-trafficking training; required  the Federal Judicial Center, the research and education agency of the  federal judicial system,  to provide training for judges on ordering  restitution for victims of certain trafficking-related offenses under chapter  77 of title 18, U.S. Code; mandated that the Secretary of Homeland  Security implement a human trafficking training program for department  personnel; and required the Attorney General to implement and maintain  a national strategy for combating human trafficking.", "In addition to the federal statutes, the 50 states and the District of  Columbia have laws that address human trafficking to some degree,  whether explicitly under a \u201chuman trafficking\u201d statute or pursuant to other  relevant laws. State laws differ and may include various features that  criminalize sex or labor trafficking or other related conduct; require  training for law enforcement; lower the burden of proof for sex trafficking  of minors by not requiring force, fraud or coercion as elements of the  offense; and provide victim assistance, among other things."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agency Roles and Responsibilities to Combat Human Trafficking in the United States and Assist Victims", "paragraphs": ["Several components within DOJ, DHS, Defense, Labor, and State have  responsibility for investigating and prosecuting human trafficking crimes,  as shown in figure 1.", "In addition to federal investigative and prosecutorial agencies, other  agencies play a role in helping to identify human trafficking, such as the  Transportation Security Administration (TSA), U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services (USCIS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection,  Federal Emergency Management Agency, and Coast Guard. These  agencies may also encounter human trafficking victims in their daily  operations, including at airports, land borders, and seaports. EEOC and  Labor\u2019s Wage and Hour Division may encounter human trafficking when  conducting investigations related to their statutory authority.

These efforts include  integrated and tailored services for victims of trafficking, training and  technical assistance to communities serving high-risk populations, and  capacity-building to strengthen coordinated regional and local responses  to human trafficking.

In 2011, partly in response to a 2007 GAO report that  recommended a federal coordinating body to combat human trafficking,  DOJ, in collaboration with DHS and Labor, established Anti-trafficking  Coordination Teams (ACTeams). The teams are located in six U.S.  cities and are comprised of federal investigators and prosecutors from the  USAO, FBI, ICE HSI, and Labor\u2019s Inspector General and Wage and Hour  Division.  The Federal Enforcement Working Group, which oversees the  ACTeams, selected these cities based on the agencies\u2019 commitment to  combat human trafficking and to reflect a diversity of city size, federal  agency staffing levels, nature of human trafficking threats, and federal  agency experience with human trafficking investigations and  prosecutions.  The purpose of the ACTeams is to coordinate federal  criminal human trafficking investigations and prosecutions to protect the  rights of human trafficking victims, bring traffickers to justice, and  dismantle human trafficking networks.", "Pursuing trafficking investigations and prosecutions also involves the  support of state and local law enforcement, which may be in the best  position to find trafficking victims because of their familiarity with their  respective jurisdictions; and nongovernmental organizations, where  victims may more readily seek assistance. Moreover, victim service  organizations assist human trafficking victims by providing assistance to  address their short-term and long-term needs\u2014such as legal and  immigration services, housing, employment, education, food, clothing, job  training, medical care, and child care. Since 2004, OVC and BJA have  partnered to support multidisciplinary task forces that bring together law  enforcement and victim service providers.  This partnership supports a  state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency and a victim service  provider. OVC awards support the provision of a comprehensive array of  culturally and linguistically appropriate direct services to trafficking  victims, while BJA awards support the coordinated efforts of local, state,  federal, and tribal law enforcement to investigate and prosecute  traffickers. In fiscal year 2014, OVC and BJA undertook an analysis of the  enhanced collaborative model and examined how well the funded task  forces were operating. Based on both qualitative and quantitative  analyses, program improvements were made, and a new solicitation  incorporating these improvements was issued in fiscal year 2015. During  fiscal year 2015, OVC and BJA provided nearly $22.7 million to 16 task  forces in 14 states.", "Another key federal effort to combat human trafficking in the United  States is DHS\u2019s Blue Campaign, which the department describes as the  unified voice for DHS\u2019s efforts to combat human trafficking.

In general, officials stated that obtaining the victim\u2019s  cooperation is important for human trafficking investigations and  prosecutions because the victim is generally the primary witness and  source of evidence. The officials told us that human trafficking victims  may be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the investigation or  prosecution because they distrust law enforcement, may be traumatized  by abuse or addicted to drugs, have a sentimental attachment to the  trafficker, do not see themselves as victims, or fear retaliation from the  trafficker. For example, some victims may not cooperate because the  trafficker is holding or threatening the victim\u2019s family abroad. Officials also  stated that juvenile victims can present challenges because they may  come from troubled homes or foster care and may feel that they are  better cared for by the trafficker than at home and do not want to receive  any help.", "Law enforcement are to use a victim centered approach when combating  human trafficking that may help improve the victim\u2019s ability and  willingness to cooperate. This approach seeks to minimize  retraumatization associated with the criminal justice process by providing  the support of victim advocates and service providers, empowering  survivors as engaged participants in the process, and providing survivors  an opportunity to play a role in seeing their traffickers brought to justice.  Such an approach places value on the identification and stabilization of  victims and providing immigration relief, as well as the investigation and  prosecution of traffickers. Identifying, not criminalizing, victims is the first  step in adopting a victim-centered strategy and to achieve this goal,  officers must be committed to helping victims feel safe, secure, and  stable. Officials in 12 of the 32 interviews we conducted with law  enforcement and prosecutors told us there are strategies that may help  improve the victim\u2019s ability and willingness to cooperate, such as  facilitating access to immigration relief and protecting the victim\u2019s family  abroad for foreign victims, or providing services to both foreign and  domestic victims.", "Immigration relief: T visa, U visa, or Continued Presence. According to  USCIS, immigration relief options encourage victims to report crimes and  work with law enforcement. Trafficking victims may seek immigration  relief in the form of T nonimmigrant status (T visa) for victims of a severe  form of trafficking who meet certain criteria and U nonimmigrant status (U  visa) for victims of qualifying criminal activity, including human trafficking  and fraud in foreign labor contracting, who satisfy U visa-specific  criteria. The T visa and U visa allow the victims to remain in the country,  for up to 4 years, which may be extended under certain circumstances, so  they can assist with the investigation or prosecution of human trafficking  or qualifying crimes, respectively. Individuals with T or U visas are  authorized for employment incident to their nonimmigrant status, and U  visa applicants may receive work authorization while their application is  still pending.  U visa holders may be eligible for lawful permanent  residence if, among other things, they have been physically present in the  United States continuously for at least 3 years since admission as a U  nonimmigrant.  For T visa holders, the physical presence requirement  may be satisfied by demonstrating continuous physical presence either  for 3 years since the date of admission as a T nonimmigrant, or during the  investigation or prosecution of trafficking, whichever period of time is less.  Further, ICE can grant Continued Presence, which is a temporary form of  protection available to foreign national victims of human trafficking without  lawful immigration status if they are potential witnesses to that trafficking,  and upon the application by federal law enforcement officials to DHS.   Continued Presence allows victims to remain and work in the country  temporarily, for 1 year, and may be renewed in 1 year increments, during  the ongoing investigation into the human trafficking-related crimes  committed against them. See appendix II for information on T and U  visa applications and petitions, and Continued Presence approvals and  denials for fiscal years 2013 through 2015.

Federal agencies have victim service coordinators who  help navigate the victim through the criminal justice process and connect  the victim with appropriate services. Additionally, OVC and ACF provide  grants for comprehensive and specialized victim service programs to non- governmental organizations and others. These organizations utilize  grant funding to provide services such as shelters, medical services,  substance abuse treatment, legal services, food and clothing, mental  health, literacy education, job training, interpreter and translation services,  support groups, and mentoring programs for human trafficking victims.  Officials in 9 of the 32 of interviews we conducted with law enforcement  and prosecutors reported that providing these services helps stabilize  victims and encourages them to cooperate.

Of the 15 officials who reported limited  availability of services in their area of responsibility, 8 told us that  short-term assistance, particularly shelters were needed. According to  officials, many victim assistance service providers that typically serve  other populations may not be prepared or willing to deal with human  trafficking victims as very few shelters specialize in services for  human trafficking victims. For example, in some cases these shelters  are designed to address the needs of survivors of domestic violence,  such as resources to become financially stable and access to  government services and childcare, whereas, trafficking victims need  medical and psychological assistance tailored to meet their unique  needs. Further, officials told us that shelters may not accept human  trafficking victims because they fear that the victim will recruit women  from the shelter for the trafficker.", "Long-term assistance. Of the 15 officials who reported limited  availability of services in their area of responsibility, 7 told us that  there is insufficient long-term assistance, including housing, mental  health services, and drug rehabilitation, available for trafficking  victims. For example, law enforcement officials in one of our site visits  told us that their areas of responsibility are ill-equipped to provide  long-term services to human trafficking victims. As a result, victims  are sent to other states to receive services. In addition, a service  provider told us that finding long-term housing presents a challenge  when the victim has a criminal background or bad credit history.  Further, other officials told us that in some circumstances services are  more limited for U.S. citizens than for foreign victims. The officials  explained that, historically, the federal government\u2019s efforts to combat  human trafficking in the United States and assist victims have been  focused primarily on foreign nationals. While the TVPA of 2000  included certain provisions for services for victims of human trafficking  in the United States, its reauthorization in the William Wilberforce  Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 established  a program specifically to assist U.S. citizen and lawful permanent  resident victims of trafficking.", "In recent years, DOJ, HHS, and some states, including those within the  scope of our review, have taken steps to increase the availability of  services, primarily by providing funding through grants. Two of the six  service providers we spoke with told us that in some instances no one  service provider can provide all the services a human trafficking victim  needs and organizations must work together to help victims. Further, 5 of  the 6 service providers we spoke with reported that victim services are  limited for human trafficking victims; in particular, they reported difficulty  finding shelter or housing options for victims.  When asked about actions  the federal government could take to address this challenge, 2 of 6  service providers noted that it would be helpful if the federal government  increased funding. In 2015, DOJ increased funding to support services  specifically for human trafficking victims by $13.5 million, compared to the  previous year. Specifically, in fiscal year 2014, DOJ awarded $13.1  million through two grant programs and, in fiscal year 2015, $26.6 million  through four grant programs. HHS officials reported that in fiscal year  2015, the agency increased funding by $1.54 million to support services  specifically for human trafficking victims. Specifically, officials reported  that this included a $1.44 million increase for domestic victims of  trafficking and $0.1 million for foreign victims of trafficking compared to  fiscal year 2014. Further, multiple states, including those within the scope  of our review, as well as the District of Columbia, have enacted laws to  facilitate the provision of services to victims of trafficking.

Further,  officials from 3 of the 6 service providers we met with reported  distinguishing human trafficking from prostitution as a challenge. On the  surface, human trafficking may appear to be voluntary prostitution or an  undocumented laborer working under his or her own volition. Therefore,  in these instances, individuals who are actually victims may instead be  treated as criminals\u2014prostitutes or undocumented workers. For example,  officials and service providers in one of our selected areas told us that  human trafficking is common in the area, but that it is difficult for local law  enforcement to distinguish this illicit activity from voluntary prostitution.  Further, of the 9 officials who reported challenges identifying human  trafficking, 7 told us that it is more difficult to identify and detect labor  trafficking compared to sex trafficking. According to these officials, sex  trafficking takes place out in the open and is often advertised online,  making it easier for law enforcement to identify the crime. However, labor  trafficking often occurs behind closed doors\u2014including sweatshops,  massage parlors, agriculture, restaurants, hotels and households\u2014 making it harder to identify. For example, officials told us about one 2015  labor trafficking case that involved a nanny from Nigeria. According to  officials, the victim had a contract with her trafficker which stipulated $100  per month to take care of five children. However, she had not been paid  since she moved to the United States and was being physically and  psychologically abused. The victim fled and sought shelter with a  neighbor.", "Federal agencies, and state and local agencies in the locations we  visited, have several training and public awareness initiatives underway  that are intended to help identify, investigate and prosecute human  trafficking, including the following: Federal Agency Initiatives. Each of the federal law enforcement and  prosecutorial agencies with whom we met provide training to their  employees and other law enforcement officials on how to identify human  trafficking, among other things. For example,  ICE HSI provides a human trafficking training course that uses video  scenarios and group discussions to teach its agents how to identify  human trafficking, how to distinguish human trafficking from  smuggling, and how to conduct victim-centered investigations, among  other things.", "The FBI provides annual specialized training in the commercial sexual  exploitation of children and dealing with victims of child sex trafficking.  This course teaches law enforcement personnel investigative  strategies to address the child sex trafficking threat, and methods in  understanding the various types of victims in these cases, how to  interact with them, and victim services available to them.  The FBI  also published a law enforcement sensitive investigative guide on sex  trafficking of juveniles.", "The Attorney General has provided guidance to USAOs for  developing strategic anti-trafficking plans, including recommended  practices for identifying, investigating, prosecuting, and tracking  human trafficking offenses. The Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys  also provided USAOs with guidance for establishing and coordinating  human trafficking task forces.", "The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, in coordination with  the Blue Campaign, offers a web-based human trafficking training  course that teaches law enforcement officers at the federal, state,  local, and tribal levels how to recognize human trafficking  encountered during routine duties, how to protect victims, and how to  initiate human trafficking investigations. In addition, the Federal Law  Enforcement Training Center provides human trafficking training to  federal officers and agents as part of its basic training program. In  fiscal year 2015, 128 law enforcement officers took the training.  Further, since July 2015, the Federal Law Enforcement Training  Center has provided human trafficking awareness training by text or  video to 3,007 students in basic training programs.", "In addition, federal agencies provide training to state and local agencies,  as well as the public, regarding human trafficking, including the following:", "FBI field offices conducted approximately 672 human trafficking  training sessions in fiscal year 2014 to various groups, including, but  not limited to, state and local law enforcement, social workers,  healthcare providers, hotel workers, faith based groups, non- governmental organizations, students and educators.", "HHS piloted the Stop.

According to HHS officials, the  department will expand the training to social workers, substance  abuse and mental health providers, and public health professionals in  fiscal year 2016.  In addition, the officials said that in fiscal year 2015,  15,265 professionals and first responders likely to interact with victims  of trafficking were trained through a network of several HHS-funded  anti-trafficking grantees.", "The Blue Campaign, in collaboration with the ICE HSI Victim  Assistance Program and other DHS components, provided human  trafficking awareness training to government, nongovernment, and  private industries, including those in hospitality, health care, and  education.", "Other federal agencies, whose employees may come across human  trafficking victims in their day-to-day operations\u2014including U.S. Customs  and Border Protection, TSA, USCIS, and the U.S. Coast Guard\u2014also  provide human trafficking training to their employees. Further, Labor\u2019s  Wage and Hour Division and the EEOC also look for human trafficking  indicators when conducting their own investigative and enforcement work.  According to officials, these agencies are to refer potential human  trafficking cases to the appropriate law enforcement agencies for further  investigation. For example, TSA officials we met with told us that from  March 2015 to February 2016, they referred six reports of suspected  human trafficking to ICE HSI. Figure 2 shows an example of a resource  available to agencies and the public to help them identify human  trafficking.", "Further, some federal agencies also have efforts related to public  awareness of human trafficking. For example, in January 2016, OVC  released resources to raise awareness and serve victims, including a  video series called \u201cThe Faces of Human Trafficking\u201d and posters to be  used for outreach and education efforts of service providers, law  enforcement, prosecutors, and others in the community. The series  includes information about sex and labor trafficking, multidisciplinary  approaches to serving victims of human trafficking, effective victim  services, victims' legal needs, and voices of survivors. Since 2010, DHS,  through the Blue Campaign, reported it has worked to raise public  awareness about human trafficking, leveraging partnerships with select  government and nongovernmental entities to educate the public to  recognize human trafficking and report suspected instances. According to  DHS officials, Blue Campaign posters are displayed in public locations  including airports and bus stops.

These materials, which included posters, brochures, fact sheets,  and cards with tips on identifying victims, were available in eight  languages.  According to HHS officials, in fiscal year 2016, the  department is updating its public awareness campaign materials to be  complementary to other federal resources.

According to  Federal Judicial Center officials we spoke with, 1,300 registered viewers  participated in the webinar, which is now available for on-demand viewing  on the Federal Judicial Center website.  They also told us that, in April  2016, 198 district judges attended a workshop in which, among other  topics, a human trafficking sentencing scenario was discussed. According  to Federal Judicial Center officials, adjudicating human trafficking cases  can be challenging for judges because they have to determine the role  the victim played in the trafficking situation and it may be difficult to  determine what kept the victims from escaping, and led them to instead  obey the trafficker.", "State and Local Initiatives.

However, one of the four state  prosecutors we interviewed said that the length of time it takes the USAO  to decide whether to accept or decline the case, which has taken over a  year in certain instances, can make it difficult for them to obtain evidence  once the case is referred to them.  Human trafficking-related prosecutions  can occur at both the federal and state level. Law enforcement officials  told us that, in most instances, they refer cases to the state prosecutor  when the USAO declines to prosecute the case. Based on our review of  data provided by the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, the most  common reasons that USAOs reported declining human trafficking cases  were \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d and \u201cmatters being referred to another  jurisdiction.\u201d(See appendix II for additional information on declinations.)

These officials told us that there has been an increase in human  trafficking and other criminal activity in the Bakken area\u2014a relatively  remote area\u2014due to the oil boom. According to FBI and ICE HSI officials,  the agencies are taking steps to address this challenge. FBI officials told  us that the agency opened a field office in spring 2016 in western North  Dakota, which is closer to the area where crime, in general, has  increased.

Fifteen grant programs  administered by DOJ and HHS are intended solely to combat human  trafficking or assist victims.  In fiscal years 2014 and 2015, 123  organizations were awarded funds under these grant programs. These  initiatives include programs that provide training and technical assistance  to service providers and law enforcement agencies; support multi- disciplinary task forces to ensure victim-centered responses to human  trafficking; and provide services directly to victims of human trafficking.  Further, each grant program may be used for more than one of these  purposes.  More specifically, the 15 grant programs can be used for:  Collaboration and partnerships. 12 of the grant programs allow funds to  be used for collaboration between or within law enforcement and service  providers through mechanisms such as task forces, coalitions, and  partnerships.  For example, the Enhanced Collaborative Model grant  program, administered by OVC and BJA, supports the development and  enhancement of multidisciplinary human trafficking task forces. These  task forces implement collaborative approaches to involve both law  enforcement and service providers in implementing a victim-centered  approach to human trafficking investigations, prosecutions, and  assistance.", "Data, research, and evaluation: 3 of the grant programs include an  element of data collection on human trafficking cases, research on human  trafficking, or evaluation of best practices.

Similarly, 9 of the 15 grant programs provide support  for direct services to victims of human trafficking.  As described earlier,  according to our prior work addressing overlap and duplication, overlap  among programs occurs when multiple programs engage in similar  activities or strategies, as many of the human trafficking grants do.", "Of the 123 organizations that were awarded grants specific to human  trafficking in fiscal years 2014 or 2015, 13 received multiple human  trafficking grants for either victim services or for collaboration, training,  and technical assistance from DOJ and HHS.

Of the 13, 7 had multiple  grants that could be used for victim services, and 3 had multiple grants  that could be used for collaboration, training, and technical assistance.  For instance, two organizations received a grant for Services to Victims of  Human Trafficking in 2014 and a grant for the Enhanced Collaborative  Model in 2015, both from DOJ.  Both grants can be used to provide direct  services to victims of human trafficking. Another organization received  similar grants for victim services from DOJ and HHS in 2014, and a third  grant to establish a task force and provide services in 2015.  HHS officials  noted that they were comfortable with awarding multiple services grants  to this organization because different populations were served under  each grant application.  DOJ officials noted that the same organization  received the task force grant because they had submitted a strong  application and they believed a task force would benefit the area in which  the organization worked.", "DOJ officials noted that geographical distribution is an important factor  when making award decisions, and that they would not generally award  two grants in a location that may be duplicative, such as two Enhanced  Collaborative Model awards in the same city.  However, they noted that  they may award funds under the same grant program to multiple service  providers in cities that may have a high need for services or have a high  number of identified trafficking victims.  HHS officials told us that they do  attempt to achieve geographic dispersion when awarding grants under  the Rescue and Restore program, Trafficking Victim Assistance Program,  and Demonstration Grants for Domestic Victims of Human Trafficking.   Officials from both agencies said that they do not consider the locations of  grants awarded by other agencies when awarding grants. Five cities have  multiple organizations located in their cities that have been awarded the  same DOJ grants as one another, but in those cases, each organization  serves a different population or provides different services, according to  DOJ officials. Based on our analysis of DOJ and HHS grant data, over  half of all grants were awarded in the 9 states that are in the top one-third  with respect to matters referred for federal prosecution and calls and tips  related to human trafficking.

According to DOJ and HHS officials, each  agency operates an internal working group to allow the components  administering human trafficking grants to communicate on a regular  basis. HHS officials indicated that offices that administer human  trafficking grant programs meet monthly to exchange information, which  may include grant-related announcements and coordination of anti- trafficking activities.  Similarly, DOJ officials told us that all DOJ  components that address human trafficking meet on a quarterly basis with  the goal of ensuring coordination in policy and grant-making. Further,  DOJ has taken action to implement recommendations from a prior GAO  report to identify overlapping grant programs and mitigate the risk of  unnecessary grant award duplication in its programs.  In response to  these recommendations, DOJ also requires grant applicants to identify in  their applications any federal grants they are currently operating under as  well as federal grants for which they have applied. Finally, in response to  recommendations in the same GAO report, DOJ has conducted two  studies of overlap and duplication among fiscal year 2012 grant programs  administered by the Office of Justice Programs, the Office on Violence  against Women, and the Office of Community Oriented Policing  Services.", "DOJ and HHS officials also reported that they routinely share grant  announcements with one another in an informal manner.

DOJ and HHS officials  told us that they conduct regular meetings to monitor progress in  advancing the goals laid out in the strategic plan, one of which is to  coordinate victim services effectively through collaboration across  multiple service sectors to, among other things, reduce duplication of  efforts. In addition, HHS officials noted that DOJ and HHS meet bi-weekly  during co-chair meetings for the SPOG Victim Services Committee and  both agencies participate in the SPOG Grantmaking Committee  meetings, which provide additional opportunities to share information for  the purposes of coordination and collaboration.  According to HHS  officials, this coordination prevents duplication because they are aware of  the actions of all of the agencies involved in administering grants targeted  at human trafficking.  Officials from DOJ and HHS also told us that the  agencies are working together to develop guidance for grantees that have  been awarded human trafficking grants from both agencies so that  grantees can avoid using grant funds for duplicative activities. HHS  officials noted that the first set of guidance, for serving foreign victims of  human trafficking, would be released in summer 2016.

SPOG guidance was  updated in March 2016, and according to officials who administer the  SPOG Grantmaking Committee, the updated guidance encourages  enhanced information sharing among participating agencies. Specifically,  the updated guidance directs participating agencies to share information  with members of the Grantmaking Committee prior to final decisions in at  least one of the following ways: (1) share plans for programs containing  anti-trafficking components during the grant program development  process; (2) notify the SPOG of grant solicitations within a reasonable  time after they are issued; or (3) notify SPOG partner agencies of  proposed funding recipients prior to announcing the award.

This  report addresses the following questions:  1. What federal efforts have been made to determine the prevalence of human trafficking in the United States? 2. What challenges, if any, do federal and selected state law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies face when combating human trafficking in the United States, and what actions have they and others taken to address identified challenges? 3. What federal grant programs are intended to combat human trafficking and assist victims within the United States, and what steps have federal agencies taken, if any, to reduce the potential for duplication among grant programs?", "For purposes of this report, we focused on human trafficking within the  United States, which includes U.S. citizens or nationals, or those with or  without lawful immigration status who are trafficked within the United  States, as well as foreign persons who are brought to the United States  from abroad for the purpose of trafficking.", "To address the first objective, we reviewed prior GAO human trafficking  reports, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 and other federal  laws related to human trafficking, and we interviewed Department of  Justice (DOJ), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) officials, to learn  whether their component agencies had efforts underway to collect human  tracking data that could be used to determine the prevalence of human  trafficking in the United States.  We also reviewed documentation issued  by the President\u2019s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat  Trafficking to learn about additional federal efforts to collect information  on the prevalence of human trafficking.  We obtained and analyzed data  from federal investigative and prosecutorial agencies and federally- funded entities that, while not specifically intended to do so, could give an  indication of where human trafficking is occurring in the United States.   We assessed the reliability of the data the agencies and other entities  provided by questioning knowledgeable officials and reviewing the data  for obvious errors and anomalies. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives. We  identified potential sources of human trafficking information, including  National Human Trafficking Resource Center (NHTRC) and the National  Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).  We received data  related to calls, tips, and reports received by NHTRC and NCMEC and  interviewed officials to determine how the information was collected and  what criteria were used to determine whether a call or report was  categorized as related to human trafficking. We also obtained prosecution  and investigations data from DOJ, DHS, Department of Labor (Labor),  and Department of State (State). Further, we reviewed DOJ\u2019s grants to  identify studies funded to assess human trafficking in the United States.  We also interviewed DOJ grantees to understand their ongoing research  to quantify human trafficking.", "To identify challenges federal and selected state law enforcement and  prosecutorial agencies face when combating human trafficking and efforts  undertaken to address these challenges, we identified relevant federal  law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies based on our previous work  and review of legislation related to human trafficking. We then interviewed  headquarters officials from the Department of Defense, DOJ, DHS, Labor,  State, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) who  are responsible for identifying or investigating human trafficking and other  unlawful activities, or prosecuting or litigating cases involving human  trafficking-related violations. At DOJ, we interviewed officials from the  Office of the Deputy Attorney General, Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI), Civil Rights Division/Criminal Section, Criminal Division/Child  Exploitation and Obscenity Section, and the Executive Office for U.S.  Attorneys. At DHS, we interviewed officials from the Office of the Deputy  Secretary, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland  Security Investigations (HSI), Transportation Security Administration, U.S.  Customs and Border Protection, and U.S. Coast Guard. At Labor, we  interviewed officials from the Wage and Hour Division and Office of the  Inspector General, and at State we interviewed officials from the Bureau  of Diplomatic Security. For the FBI, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office (USAO), ICE  HSI, Bureau of Diplomatic Security, and EEOC, we interviewed  investigators and prosecutors (or litigators) located in field offices that  cover four jurisdictions\u2014Washington, DC/ Northern Virginia; Houston,  Texas; Los Angeles, California; and Bismarck, North Dakota.", "We selected these four jurisdictions because they are located in states  that are among the top 10 in terms of human trafficking tips, per capita,  that were sent to the NHTRC or to NCMEC. We also selected these  jurisdictions because they reflect a variation in geography and receipt of  federal funding to establish or continue a human trafficking task force  through the Enhanced Collaborative Model to Combat Human Trafficking  during fiscal year 2015. In addition, all of the jurisdictions we selected are  within geographic priority areas identified by DHS through the Blue  Campaign. The purpose of the Blue Campaign is to provide training and  raise public awareness about human trafficking, among other things. The  campaign has identified priority geographic areas and populations to  focus its outreach efforts during fiscal year 2016.", "We conducted 32 interviews with federal, state and local law enforcement  and prosecutorial agencies who were part of the identified task forces in  these jurisdictions.  During the interviews, we asked officials whether they  experienced any challenges in carrying out their duties related to  combating human trafficking and to identify any efforts that have been or  could be taken to address challenges. Officials identified challenges when  we explicitly asked them to identify them or during the course of our  discussion. When we report the number of agencies that identified a  particular challenge, this does not necessarily mean that the remaining  agencies did not also experience the challenge. It means that those  stakeholders did not raise the challenge during the course of our  interviews. While these officials\u2019 perspectives cannot be generalized to all  jurisdictions, they provided insights into federal, state, and local efforts to  combat human trafficking. We also interviewed representatives from six  non-governmental organizations that provide services to human  trafficking victims in the selected jurisdictions. In addition, we interviewed  officials from the Federal Judicial Center and the federal judge who  conducted the required training for federal judges as mandated by the  Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, and the National Association of  Attorneys General to further understand challenges faced when  combating human trafficking.", "To address our third objective, we asked the DHS, DOJ, HHS, Labor and  State, which had been identified in a prior study as agencies  administering grant programs related to human trafficking, to each  provide us a list of grant programs that could be used to combat human  trafficking in the United States or assist victims. We corroborated  agencies\u2019 lists with online resources, such as grants.gov, and also  followed up with interviews at which we requested additional information  and ensured that we were aware of all grant programs that could be used  to address human trafficking. We identified a total of 42 grant programs  that could be used to address human trafficking, although because  services for human trafficking victims may be one of many allowable uses  for some grant programs, it is possible that there are some programs that  were not identified by granting agencies or by our analysis of public  records.  However, we limited our duplication analysis to the 15 that were  intended solely for human trafficking purposes, because we determined  that there would most likely be duplication across these grant programs  as they were created to address the same issue. Using the established  GAO framework for addressing overlap and duplication, we use the  following definitions for purposes of assessing human trafficking grant  programs:", "Overlap occurs when multiple granting agencies or grant programs  have similar goals, engage in similar activities or strategies to achieve  these goals, or target the same or similar beneficiaries. Overlap may  result from statutory or other limitations beyond an agency\u2019s control.", "Duplication occurs on multiple levels. It occurs when a single grantee  uses grant funds from different federal sources to pay for the exact  same expenditure. Duplication also occurs when two or more granting  agencies or grant programs engage in the same or similar activities or  provide funding to support the same or similar services to the same  beneficiaries. Duplication thus stems from overlap. When granting  agencies do not identify overlap, assess its impact, or coordinate their  activities in acknowledgment of the overlap, there is a heightened risk  of unnecessary duplication because one granting agency may not be  knowledgeable of the ways in which its funding decision duplicates  another\u2019s. At times, federal funding is leveraged by design to achieve  a single purpose through multiple federal funding streams. These  funding arrangements are not characterized as unnecessary  duplication for purposes of this review so long as federal agencies are  aware of them or have deliberately planned for grant programs to be  complementary.", "To assess the possibility for overlap among the 15 grant programs  intended solely to address human trafficking, we reviewed grant  solicitations from fiscal years 2014 and 2015, the most recent two years  in which grants had been awarded, to identify similarities and differences  between the allowable activities and target beneficiaries. We divided  allowable activities into five categories to determine how many of the  grant programs could be used for the same purpose.  We then examined  the grant awards for each program to assess whether any organizations  that had been awarded human trafficking grants were or could be using  the grants to provide the same services to the same or similar groups of  beneficiaries.  We identified 14 organizations that were awarded multiple  human trafficking grants in 2014 or 2015.  To determine whether  duplication was actually occurring, we interviewed officials responsible for  administering grant programs at the Bureau of Justice Assistance, the  National Institute of Justice, the Office of Juvenile Justice and  Delinquency Prevention, and the Office for Victims of Crime in DOJ and  the Administration for Children and Families in HHS about the specific  organizations that had received multiple grants.  We also spoke with three  of the organizations regarding how they ensure that funds from each  grant are being used for the approved purposes.  We selected the  organizations based on the number and similarity of grants they were  awarded and whether the grants were from both federal agencies.", "To evaluate what efforts, if any, have been made to prevent unnecessary  duplication among human trafficking grants, we reviewed documentation  on collaboration efforts, including the Attorney General\u2019s Annual Report to  Congress and Assessment of U.S. Government Activities to Combat  Trafficking in Persons and guidance from the Senior Policy Operating  Group\u2019s (SPOG) Grantmaking Committee. We also interviewed federal  agency officials, including members of the SPOG and officials responsible  for administering grant programs from  the Bureau of Justice Assistance,  the National Institute of Justice, the Office of Juvenile Justice and  Delinquency Prevention, and the Office for Victims of Crime in DOJ and  the Administration for Children and Families in HHS regarding formal and  informal mechanisms for coordinating with one another to prevent overlap  among grants and duplication among grant awards.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2015 to June 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Federal Human Trafficking Investigation and Prosecution Data", "paragraphs": ["Responsibility for addressing human trafficking crimes falls to multiple  federal agencies. These agencies reported data on the investigations,  prosecutions, indictments, and arrests related to trafficking crimes for  fiscal years 2013 to 2015. These data are a general indicator of the level  of agency effort on trafficking in persons, although they are limited by a  number of factors. Because trafficking in persons is a hidden crime and  victims are hesitant to come forward, it is difficult to estimate the extent of  trafficking in persons crimes. Moreover, because prosecutors may charge  traffickers with other crimes (e.g., kidnapping, the Mann Act, immigration  violations, or money laundering) for strategic or tactical reasons, data on  the number of trafficking in persons investigations and prosecutions do  not provide a complete picture of the number of traffickers who have been  thwarted. The data systems agencies use are primarily case  management systems, which may not be able to extract trafficking data if  trafficking was not listed as a charge. Additionally, if an investigation on  smuggling later reveals a trafficking violation, some data systems will  continue to store investigative data under the smuggling classification.", "The complexity of the investigations and the limitations of data systems  make providing data on human trafficking a labor-intensive effort for  agencies. Therefore, these data are not comparable across the agencies  and it is not possible to associate arrest and indictment data with a  particular case because of differences in agency data systems. Moreover,  agency officials noted that investigations do not always lead to  prosecutions, because situations that appear to be trafficking may prove  to be alien smuggling or prostitution accompanied by abuse and,  therefore, do not meet the criteria to be prosecuted as trafficking cases.
