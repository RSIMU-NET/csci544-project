FDA classifies medical device types into three classes, with class I including those with the lowest risk to patients (such as forceps) and class III including those with the greatest risk (such as pacemakers). FDA's responsibilities include premarket and postmarket oversight--spanning, for example, both premarket review of devices and postmarket surveillance (the collection and analysis of data on marketed devices). These responsibilities apply to all devices marketed in the United States, regardless of whether they are manufactured domestically or overseas. In 2009, GAO added FDA's oversight of medical products, including devices, to its list of high-risk areas warranting attention by Congress and the executive branch. GAO was asked to testify on recent work related to FDA's responsibilities for medical devices, including premarket review, postmarket surveillance, and inspection of manufacturing establishments. This statement is based on a recent GAO report, Medical Devices: FDA Should Take Steps to Ensure That High-Risk Device Types Are Approved through the Most Stringent Premarket Review Process ( GAO-09-190 , January 15, 2009) and on other GAO reports and testimonies related to FDA oversight."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that FDA does not review all class III devices through its most stringent premarket review process. Unless exempt by regulation, new devices must clear FDA premarket review through either the 510(k) premarket notification process, which is used to determine if a new device is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed device, or through the more stringent premarket approval (PMA) process, which requires the manufacturer to supply evidence providing reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective. In 1976, Congress envisioned that FDA would eventually approve all class III devices through the more stringent PMA process, but this process remains incomplete. GAO found that in fiscal years 2003 through 2007, FDA cleared 228 submissions representing 24 types of class III devices through the 510(k) process. GAO recommended in its January 2009 report that FDA expeditiously take steps to issue regulations requiring PMAs for or reclassifying class III device types currently allowed to enter the market via the 510(k) process. In response, in April 2009, FDA required manufacturers to submit information on the safety and effectiveness of these types of devices. However, FDA did not specify a time frame for how quickly it will reclassify them or require PMAs for those device types that remain in class III. FDA also faces challenges in postmarket surveillance of medical devices. In 2008, GAO reported that the number of adverse event reports associated with medical devices increased substantially from 2000 to 2006. Both GAO and FDA, however, have identified shortcomings in FDA's postmarket oversight. For example, in 2006 FDA reported that the agency's ability to understand the risks related to the use of medical devices is limited by the fact that the volume of submitted reports exceeded FDA's ability to consistently enter or review the reports in a routine manner. In 2008, FDA officials told us that while they have a number of strategies to prioritize their reviews of adverse event reports, they still cannot review all the reports they receive. Finally, GAO has found that FDA has not conducted required inspections of manufacturing establishments, another key FDA responsibility for medical devices marketed in the United States. In 2008, GAO reported that FDA has not met a statutory requirement to inspect certain domestic manufacturing establishments every 2 years. Instead, FDA officials estimated that the agency has inspected domestic establishments every 3 years (for class III devices) or 5 years (for class II devices). There is no comparable requirement to inspect foreign establishments, and FDA officials estimate that they have been inspected every 6 years (for class III devices) or 27 years (for class II devices). GAO reported that FDA has taken some steps to address shortcomings related to inspections of foreign establishments, but GAO has not evaluated whether these changes will improve FDA's inspection program. Taken together, these shortcomings in both premarket and postmarket activities raise serious concerns about FDA's regulation of medical devices."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today as you examine issues related to the  regulation of medical devices.

Reports issued by FDA\u2019s Science  Board in 2007 and the Congressional Research Service in 2008 point out  that the demands on the agency have soared in recent years for a variety of  reasons, including the complexity of new products submitted to FDA for  premarket approval and the globalization of the industries that FDA  regulates. The Science Board also found that FDA\u2019s resources had not  increased in proportion to the growing demands placed on it, putting  public health at risk. In its fiscal year 2007 and 2008 reports, the HHS  Office of Inspector General identified the oversight of drug and device  safety as one of HHS\u2019s top management challenges.

FDA classifies each type of  device into one of three classes\u2014class I, II, or III\u2014based on the level of  risk it poses and the controls necessary to provide reasonable assurance  that it is safe and effective. According to FDA, the risk the type of device  poses to the patient or the user is a major factor in the class it is assigned:  class I includes devices with the lowest risk and class III includes devices  with the highest risk. Examples of types of devices in each class include  the following:    class I: tongue depressors, elastic bandages, reading glasses, and forceps;    class II: electrocardiographs, powered bone drills, and mercury    class III: pacemakers and replacement heart valves.", "In general, unless exempt under FDA regulations, devices are subject to  one of two types of FDA premarket review before they may be legally  marketed in the United States.", "Premarket approval (PMA): The manufacturer must provide evidence,  typically including clinical data, providing reasonable assurance that the  new device is safe and effective.

Our analysis  included traditional and abbreviated 510(k) submissions, original PMA  submissions, and submissions for two types of supplemental PMAs: panel- track PMA supplements (which are supplements requesting approval for a  significant change in design or performance, or a new use of a device, for  which clinical data are generally necessary to provide reasonable  assurance of safety and effectiveness) and 180-day PMA supplements  (which are supplements requesting approval for a significant change in  components, materials, design, specification, software, color additives, or  labeling).", "To assess FDA\u2019s program for inspecting establishments that manufacture  medical devices, we analyzed information from three FDA databases and  interviewed officials from FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological  Health and Office of Regulatory Affairs, which each have responsibilities  for managing the medical device inspection program. We also obtained  updated information from FDA on the status of FDA\u2019s programs for third- party inspections in June 2009. Specifically, we obtained data from FDA on  the number of inspections conducted by accredited third parties since  March 11, 2004\u2014the date when FDA first cleared an accredited  organization to conduct inspections.", "We conducted our work in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.

In contrast,  in order to meet the PMA approval requirement of providing reasonable  assurance that a new device is safe and effective, most original PMAs and  some PMA supplements require clinical data.", "Faster. FDA generally makes decisions on 510(k) submissions faster than  it makes decisions on PMA submissions.

The estimated cost to FDA for reviewing submissions is  substantially lower for 510(k) submissions than for PMA submissions. For  fiscal year 2005, for example, according to FDA the estimated average cost  for the agency to review a 510(k) submission was about $18,200, while the  estimate for a PMA submission was about $870,000. For the applicant, the  standard fee provided to FDA at the time of submission is also  significantly lower for a 510(k) submission than for a PMA submission.

With the enactment of the Medical Device  Amendments of 1976, Congress imposed requirements under which all  class III devices would be approved through the PMA process before being  marketed in the United States. However, certain types of class III devices  that were in commercial distribution in the United States before May 28,  1976 (called preamendment device types) and those determined to be  substantially equivalent to them may be cleared through the less stringent  510(k) process until FDA publishes regulations requiring them to go  through the PMA process or reclassifies them into a lower class. Prior to  1990, FDA issued regulations requiring some class III device types to go  through the PMA process but many class III device types continued to be  reviewed through the 510(k) process. The Safe Medical Devices Act of  1990 required FDA (1) to reexamine the preamendment class III device  types for which PMAs were not yet required to determine if they should be  reclassified to class I or II or remain in class III and (2) to establish a  schedule to promulgate regulations requiring those preamendment device  types that remain in class III to obtain FDA approval through the PMA  process.

Of the 228 510(k) submissions for class III devices that FDA  cleared in fiscal years 2003 through 2007, FDA\u2019s databases flagged   66 percent as being for device types that are implantable, life sustaining, or  of significant risk.

The 228 class III device  submissions cleared by FDA through the 510(k) process in fiscal years  2003 through 2007 represented 24 separate types of class III devices. As of  October 2008, 4 of these device types had been reclassified to class II, but  20 device types could still be cleared through the 510(k) process. FDA  officials said that the agency is committed to issuing regulations either  reclassifying or requiring PMAs for the class III devices currently allowed  to receive clearance for marketing via the 510(k) process, but did not  provide a time frame for doing so.", "We recommended that the Secretary of Health and Human Services direct  the FDA Commissioner to expeditiously take steps to issue regulations for  each class III device type currently allowed to enter the market through  the 510(k) process. These steps should include issuing regulations to   (1) reclassify each device type into class I or class II, or require it to  remain in class III, and (2) for those device types remaining in class III,  require approval for marketing through the PMA process. In commenting  on a draft of our report, HHS agreed with our recommendation, noting that  since 1994 (when FDA announced its strategy to implement provisions of  the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990) FDA has called for PMAs or  reclassified the majority of class III devices that did not require PMAs at  that time. The department\u2019s comments, however, did not specify time  frames in which FDA will address the remaining class III device types  allowed to enter the market via the 510(k) process, stating instead that the  agency is considering its legal and procedural options for completing this  task as expeditiously as possible, consistent with available resources and  competing time frames. Given that more than 3 decades have passed since  Congress envisioned that all class III devices would eventually be required  to undergo premarket review through the more stringent PMA process, we  believe it is imperative that FDA take immediate steps to address the  remaining class III device types that may still enter the market through the  less stringent 510(k) process by requiring PMAs for or reclassifying them.", "In April 2009, FDA took what it termed \u201cthe first step towards completing  the review of Class III device types predating the 1976 law, as was  recommended by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) in a  January 2009 report to Congress.\u201d Specifically, FDA announced that it was  requiring manufacturers of 25 types of class III medical devices marketed  prior to 1976 to submit safety and effectiveness information to the agency  by August 7, 2009, so that it may evaluate the risk level for each device  type. In the Federal Register notice announcing the requirement, FDA  stated that once the safety and effectiveness information was submitted,  the agency would be able to determine which device types would be  required to undergo the agency\u2019s most stringent premarket review process.  FDA\u2019s requirement that manufacturers submit safety and effectiveness  information is an essential initial step toward implementing our  recommendation and fully implementing the law. However, FDA did not  specify a time frame for how quickly it will review the submitted  information, determine whether to reclassify the device types, and require  PMAs for those that remain in class III.", "It should be noted, however, that while the PMA process is more stringent  than the 510(k) process, FDA can approve a device through the PMA  process without clinical data demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of  the device. For example, in our review of FDA\u2019s approval of PMAs for  certain temporomandibular joint (jaw) implants, FDA managers overruled  their review staff to approve one of the devices, despite the review staff\u2019s  concern over the sufficiency of the clinical data. The review decision  stated that either good engineering data or good clinical data\u2014not  necessarily both\u2014were acceptable to approve a device and accepted the  engineering data as a basis for approving an implanted device for which  the review staff had determined that the clinical data were inadequate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA Faces Challenges in Postmarket Surveillance", "paragraphs": ["In our recent high-risk report, we noted that FDA\u2019s monitoring of  postmarket safety of approved products, including medical devices, has  been questioned by numerous groups.

In January 2007, we  reported on the status of the Accredited Persons Inspection Program,  citing, among other things, concerns regarding its implementation and  potential incentives and disincentives that may influence manufacturers\u2019  participation. We found that several factors may influence  manufacturers\u2019 interest in voluntarily requesting an inspection by accredited organization. According to FDA and representatives of affecte entities, there are potential incentives and disincentives to reques ting an  inspection, as well as reasons for deferring participation in the program.  Potential incentives include the opportunity to reduce the number of  inspections conducted to meet FDA and other countries\u2019 requirements and  to control the scheduling of the inspection. Potential disincentives include  bearing the cost for the inspection and uncertainty about the potential  consequences of making a commitment to having an inspection to assess  compliance with FDA requirements in the near future. Some  manufacturers might be deferring participation. For example,  manufacturers that already contract with a specific accredited  organization to conduct inspections to meet the requirements of other  countries might defer participation until FDA has cleared that organization  to conduct independent inspections.
