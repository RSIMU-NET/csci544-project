The equity the U.S. government  held in the former Post Office Department became the initial capital of  USPS (approximately $3 billion), and the U.S. government remained  responsible for all the liabilities attributable to operations of the former  Post Office Department.  At inception, the Postal Service did not have any  unpaid liabilities to OPM for retirement benefits.

Under the 30-year installment arrangement, the  Service paid $63 million toward that additional cost for fiscal year 1972,  leaving an unpaid liability balance of $954 million to be paid for future  years.  In each subsequent year, additional liabilities were accrued as a  result of pay increases in each of those years.  Because the liabilities being  added each year are also being paid off in 30-year installments, the overall  liability for unpaid pension costs has grown dramatically, even though the  Service has been making annual payments on the accumulating balance.", "Figure 8 shows the growth in the liability balance attributable to increases  in CSRS employee pay.

Of that liability amount, the  Service has paid OPM $4.8 billion, plus interest of $2.3 billion for a total of  $7.1 billion.
