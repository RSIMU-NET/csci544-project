NNSA and DOD undertake LEPs to refurbish or replace nuclear weapons' aging components. In 2010, they began an LEP to consolidate four versions of a legacy nuclear weapon, the B61 bomb, into a bomb called the B61-12 (see fig.). NNSA and DOD have stated they must complete this LEP by 2024 to uphold U.S. commitments to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. As of September 2015, NNSA and DOD estimated that the B61-12 LEP would cost about $8.9 billion.", "Senate Report 113-44 included a provision for GAO to periodically assess the status of the B61-12 LEP. This report assesses (1) NNSA's management approach for the B61-12 LEP and (2) the extent to which NNSA and the Air Force are managing risks in the LEP. GAO reviewed project plans, schedules, management plans, and other documents and program data, and visited the two NNSA national laboratories\u2014Sandia and Los Alamos\u2014that serve as the design agencies for the LEP."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The B61-12 life extension program's (LEP) managers have developed a management approach that officials from the Department of Energy's (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) regard as improved over the management approach used for past LEPs, which experienced schedule delays and cost overruns. Among other things, the B61-12 LEP is the first LEP to use earned value management, a tool that measures the planned versus actual value of work accomplished in a given period, which may help NNSA ensure that work progresses on budget and on schedule. It is also the first LEP to integrate the schedules and cost estimates for activities at all participating NNSA sites. NNSA used this new approach to inform its first Program Execution Guide for defense programs, issued in August 2014, which applies to all NNSA defense programs. NNSA's new management approach notwithstanding, the B61-12 LEP faces ongoing management challenges in some areas, including staff shortfalls and an earned value management system that has yet to be tested. The new management approach may help the LEP address these potential challenges, but it is too soon to determine whether this will be the case.", "To manage risks in the B61-12 LEP, NNSA and the Air Force use a risk management database and integrated schedules to categorize risks and incorporate risk management steps in the schedules. According to NNSA and Air Force officials, some risks have already been managed in this manner. For example, NNSA estimates that making a needed material procurement in advance prevented a potential delay of more than a year and a potential cost increase of more than $2 million. Remaining risks include the risk that components may fail in certain flight environments and risks related to testing of certain nonnuclear components. NNSA is also working to ensure future compatibility with the F-35 aircraft. NNSA and Air Force officials said they will not know for several years whether steps planned to manage these risks are adequate. A constrained development and production schedule\u2014which DOE's and DOD's Nuclear Weapons Council characterized as having \u201clittle, if any, margin left\u201d\u2014complicates efforts to manage risks. Factors constraining the schedule include the aging of components in current versions of the B61, delays in starting the B61-12 LEP because of a lengthy design study, the effects of sequestration, and the need to complete the B61-12 LEP so that NNSA can begin other planned LEPs. GAO will continue to monitor these issues as it assesses the LEP in later stages."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making no new recommendations but discusses the status of prior GAO recommendations in this report.

DOD provided technical comments that were also incorporated, as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Many weapons in the U.S. nuclear stockpile have aged far beyond their  designed operational lives and, according to the Department of Defense  (DOD), require modernization to ensure that the nuclear arsenal is safe,  secure, and effective for as long as such weapons exist. Some of the  oldest of the weapons in the active stockpile are versions of the B61  bomb, an aircraft-delivered weapon that is a key component of the United  States\u2019 commitments to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s (NATO)  nuclear deterrent. To maintain the readiness of the B61 and other  weapons in the stockpile, the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) National  Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and DOD undertake life  extension programs (LEP) that entail refurbishing or replacing weapons\u2019  components to extend the lives of weapons by 20 years or more. LEPs  may also enhance safety and security characteristics of weapons, as well  as consolidate the stockpile into fewer weapon types to minimize  maintenance and testing costs while preserving needed military  capabilities.", "Under the B61 LEP, NNSA and the Air Force\u2014the armed service  responsible for air-delivered weapons such as the B61\u2014plan to  consolidate four of the five versions of the B61 bomb (B61 legacy  bombs), each of which was designed to fulfill specific military  requirements, into a single weapon known as the B61-12, which will be  equipped with a new tail kit guidance assembly that will enable it to meet  all military requirements. The consolidation of B61 legacy bombs into the  single B61-12 weapon is expected to allow NNSA and DOD to reduce the  number of nuclear gravity bombs in the stockpile by about one-half. In  addition, DOD and NNSA expect the B61-12 to provide mission  capabilities that will allow the retirement of a megaton-class weapon, the  B83-1 bomb, that would be expected to produce significantly more  collateral damage than the lower-yield B61-12. Altogether, the reduction  in the number of bombs and retirement of the B83-1 bomb will reduce the  amount of special nuclear material in the U.S. stockpile of gravity bombs  by more than one-half. Because critical components in B61 legacy  bombs are approaching the end of their operational lives, NNSA and  DOD have underscored the importance of beginning production of the  B61-12 in 2020 and completing the LEP by 2024 to uphold the United  States\u2019 commitments to NATO\u2019s nuclear deterrent. With thousands of  individual components, the B61-12 LEP is the most complicated and  expensive LEP undertaken since DOE initiated stockpile life extension  activities in January 1996.", "We have examined other LEPs in past reports and found that NNSA and  DOD have had difficulty effectively managing these programs. In March  2009, for example, we found that, in LEPs for the W76 warhead and  legacy B61 bombs, NNSA and DOD established unrealistic schedules,  did not establish consistent cost baselines, and did not effectively  manage technical risks. These problems resulted in delays, additional  expenditures, difficulties tracking the cost of the W76 program, and a B61  refurbishment that did not meet all of NNSA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s technical  objectives. We recommended that NNSA develop and use consistent  budget assumptions and criteria for the baseline to track costs over time,  among other actions. NNSA agreed with our recommendation and has  taken steps toward improvement in this area, which we continue to  monitor. In addition, in a May 2011 report on the B61 LEP, we found that  NNSA and DOD had not yet prepared a long-term risk management plan  to help avoid operational gaps and ensure that the United States would  be able to maintain the capability to support its NATO commitments if the  LEP were delayed or canceled. We recommended in that report that the  appropriate DOD components, in coordination with NNSA, prepare an  operational risk management plan for the LEP, identifying the measures  required to ensure that the United States is able to maintain its  commitments to NATO with no gaps in operational capability, among  other recommendations. DOD and NNSA agreed with our  recommendations and, in September 2011, the Air Force, in coordination  with NNSA, issued an initial program delay risk mitigation plan. The plan  presented risk mitigation options in the event that the LEP was delayed.  The Air Force is currently updating the plan.", "The cost and schedule of the B61-12 LEP have been subject to  significant changes since the LEP\u2019s inception. Since our May 2011  report, NNSA\u2019s and the Air Force\u2019s total cost estimate for the LEP has  increased from an initial estimate of about $4 billion to about $8.9 billion,  as of September 2015, and the first production date has moved from  2017 to 2020. Much of the work under this LEP remains to be executed,  with the largest share of program spending yet to come; as of September  2015, about $1.6 billion has been spent on the LEP.", "In this context, Senate Report 113-44, accompanying S. 1197, National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, includes a provision for  us to examine key elements of the B61-12 LEP and periodically review it  as it passes through the phases of the seven-step process\u2014known as  the Phase 6.X process\u2014under which NNSA and DOD jointly manage  LEPs.

These documents included  project plans, schedules, management plans, and selected acquisition  reports. In addition, we visited NNSA\u2019s Sandia National Laboratories and  Los Alamos National Laboratory, the two laboratories that serve as  design agencies for the LEP, to view systems that track project activities,  cost and schedule information, and the execution of risk management  steps, as well as to meet program officials responsible for the design and  production of the B61-12 and see some of the components under  development. To assess the extent to which NNSA and the Air Force are  managing risks in the LEP, we reviewed the documents described above,  as well as viewed and discussed the LEP\u2019s Active Risk Manager  database during our visit to Sandia National Laboratories. For both  objectives, we examined DOE directives, such as program orders and  guides, NNSA policy letters, and DOD instructions, as well as the B61-12  LEP\u2019s program-developed guidance documents and the procedural  guidance for the Phase 6.X process. In addition, for criteria and context,  we used the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide (Cost Guide)  and our past reports on LEPs and NNSA cost estimating practices.

According to  NNSA officials and documents, the bomb assembly will include  reused, refurbished, and new nuclear and nonnuclear components.  The design approach for the LEP maximizes reuse of existing nuclear  and nonnuclear components and is intended to improve the safety  and security of the weapon using proven technologies. NNSA  manages the development and production of the bomb assembly  under the direction of a federal program office and federal program  manager located at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New  Mexico, which is also the site of NNSA\u2019s Sandia National  Laboratories. NNSA sites and laboratories involved in the LEP include  Sandia National Laboratories, the design agency for nonnuclear  components, a production agency for some components, and system- level integrator of the overall weapon design; Los Alamos National  Laboratory, the design and production agency for the nuclear  explosive package; the Kansas City National Security Campus, the Y- 12 National Security Complex, and the Savannah River Site, the  production agencies for various new or refurbished weapon  components; and the Pantex Plant, where some bomb components  are produced and final assembly of the bombs takes place. In  addition, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory provides  independent review of Los Alamos National Laboratory\u2019s work on  nuclear components.

According to  Air Force officials and documents, the tail kit assembly will provide the  B61-12 with a guided freefall capability that improves the accuracy of  weapon delivery. The guided capability will enable the weapon to  meet military requirements with a lower nuclear yield, allowing for the  use of less special nuclear material. The B61-12 is designed to be  compatible with existing dual-capable aircraft\u2014the F-15, F-16, and  PA-200\u2014as well as the B-2 strategic bomber and planned future  aircraft such as the F-35 fighter. The Air Force\u2019s responsibilities  include integrating the B61-12 with its delivery aircraft and the  operational flight program software. This software is being upgraded  in the F-15 and B-2 delivery aircraft so that these aircraft can work  with the B61-12\u2019s digital interface. The Air Force Nuclear Weapons  Center at Kirtland Air Force Base manages technical integration,  system qualification, and other LEP-related tasks required to certify  and field the weapon as well as tail kit acquisition, as contracted to  Boeing.

Since we issued those reports, the B61-12 LEP\u2019s program  managers developed a management approach for the program that  draws on DOE directives and other sources, including our Cost Guide.  For example, we found in our November 2014 report on NNSA project  and program management that the B61-12 LEP\u2019s managers used our  Cost Guide, as well as direction under the Phase 6.X process and DOE\u2019s  project management order and cost guide, to develop their approach for  developing cost estimates.", "Several officials from both NNSA and DOD characterized the B61-12  LEP\u2019s overall program management approach as improved over the  approaches used in previous LEPs. This approach includes the following  practices and tools:  Improved management capability and authority. The B61-12  LEP\u2019s program office has taken steps to improve management  capability and authority. According to NNSA officials, the LEP  successfully requested that the department enlarge its federal  program office staff to provide more management capability.  Specifically, the program office had 3 full-time equivalent (FTE) staff  at the beginning of the program; as of October 2015, it has 8 FTEs,  augmented by contractor staff of about 12 FTEs, according to  program officials. Moreover, since 2014, the federal program manager  said that he has successfully requested contingency and  management reserve funds of $983 million over the life of the  program\u2014about 13.5 percent of NNSA\u2019s estimated $7.3 billion total  project cost\u2014which he has authority to use to help manage the  effects of realized risks or changes in funding, such as a continuing  resolution.", "An earned value management system. According to NNSA and  DOD officials we interviewed, the B61-12 LEP is the first LEP to use  earned value management, a tool that may help NNSA ensure that its  work progresses on budget and on schedule. Each participating  NNSA site is responsible for reporting earned value data monthly  against the scope, schedule, and budget baselines established for  each site\u2019s activities. According to NNSA officials involved with the  LEP, earned value management identifies schedule variances as they  happen so that the program is aware of any work that may be  progressing more slowly than expected and could go on to affect key  milestones.  Integrated master schedules. According to NNSA officials we  interviewed, the B61-12 LEP is also the first NNSA defense program  to summarize details from site schedules into a summary NNSA  Integrated Master Schedule (NIMS) for work at the participating NNSA  sites. The B61-12 LEP also has developed a top-level schedule that  all program participants use, the Joint Integrated Master Schedule  (JIMS). In past LEPs, according to the officials we interviewed,  NNSA did not fully reconcile and integrate its individual sites\u2019  schedules, which may have contributed to program delays and cost  increases. The JIMS and other integrated master schedules are key  tools in the B61-12 LEP\u2019s schedule and risk management strategy,  according to officials we interviewed.  Integrated cost estimates. An official from NNSA\u2019s Office of Cost  Policy and Analysis told us that the B61-12 LEP is the first NNSA  defense program to issue a cost estimate that integrates all  participating sites\u2019 costs into a single program cost estimate. In past  LEPs, according to the official, NNSA did not integrate its individual  sites\u2019 cost estimates, which contributed to baseline costs being  underestimated.  Independent cost estimate. The official from NNSA\u2019s Office of Cost  Policy and Analysis told us that the office annually prepares and  publishes an independent cost estimate for the NNSA portion of the  B61-12 LEP to help inform the cost estimate prepared by the B61-12  LEP program manager. This estimate is prepared without reference to  the program manager\u2019s estimate and uses a different method. The  estimate can then be compared to the program manager\u2019s estimate to  further refine it as the program develops the formal baseline cost  estimate known as the baseline cost report, one of the key steps  preceding the transition to Phase 6.4. As we found in our November  2014 report on NNSA cost estimating practices, having an  independent entity conduct an independent cost estimate and  compare it to a project team\u2019s estimate provides an unbiased test of  whether the project team\u2019s cost estimate is reasonable.", "Technology and manufacturing readiness assessments.", "According to B61-12 program officials, the B61-12 program  management team uses NNSA business practices to assess  technology and manufacturing readiness levels for the LEP. The  officials told us that all weapon components are maturing as planned  with respect to their technology or manufacturing readiness. Officials  also told us that they were conservatively applying NNSA business  practices and noted that some components that have been in use for  years may be assessed at lower readiness levels to account for other  design changes in the B61-12. In addition, NNSA is in the process of  planning for a technology readiness review later in 2015 by a group of  Sandia National Laboratories experts that are not otherwise part of  the B61-12 LEP. We have found in previous work that such  independent peer reviews can identify important technology issues.", "Peer review of the nuclear explosive package. Nuclear weapons  designers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which is not  otherwise involved in the LEP, provide peer review of the nuclear  explosive package components being designed at Los Alamos  National Laboratory\u2014a practice in keeping with past LEPs. Since the  United States ceased nuclear explosive testing in 1992, DOE and  NNSA have relied on, among other things, national laboratory peer  reviews to help ensure the continued safety, reliability, and  effectiveness of U.S. nuclear weapons without explosive testing.  According to the official in charge of the peer review, no significant  issues with the nuclear explosive package have emerged in the peer  review.", "About 4 years after the B61-12 LEP began, NNSA incorporated elements  of the B61-12 LEP management approach into a new policy for defense  program management.

It applies to all ongoing and planned LEPs, including the  B61-12 LEP. NNSA officials told us that the B61-12 LEP\u2019s program  management approach served as a model for many of the management  practices and tools established in the Program Execution Guide. These  practices include the use of earned value management systems,  integrated master schedules, and risk management systems. NNSA  officials told us that the name of the Program Execution Guide has  created some confusion, and that it is not a DOE Guide\u2014which provides  nonmandatory means for meeting DOE requirements\u2014but rather an  NNSA policy letter. To allay the confusion, the officials told us, NNSA is  in the process of renaming the document the Defense Programs Program  Execution Instruction.

According to an  NNSA official, even with the increase in federal staff, NNSA needs  two to three times more personnel in the federal program manager\u2019s  office to ensure sufficient federal management and oversight. As  noted above, the NNSA federal program office employs about 20  people\u20148 federal FTEs and about 12 FTE-equivalent contractors\u2014to  manage NNSA activities. In contrast, the Air Force office employs  about 80 federal FTEs and contractors to manage Air Force activities.  In addition, the November 2014 report of the Congressional Advisory  Panel on the Governance of the Nuclear Security Enterprise raised  issues about the sufficiency of NNSA program managers\u2019 authority.  Specifically, the report states, \u201cAlthough NNSA designates  government program managers for each major program, their  authorities have been very limited. Most importantly, they have lacked  control over resources necessary to exercise needed leadership. In  practice, they could more accurately be described as program  coordinators than as program managers.\u201d Similarly, in our March 2009  report, we found that NNSA\u2019s program manager for the W76 LEP did  not have sufficient authority over the construction or operation of a  facility that was critical to the LEP, which played a role in resulting  cost and schedule overruns.", "Untested earned value management. NNSA and DOD officials we  interviewed noted that NNSA\u2019s earned value management system will  be useful only insofar as good data are entered into the system and  the system is used to inform program management. We have similarly  noted in our Cost Guide that using earned value management  represents a culture change and requires sustained management  interest, as well as properly qualified and trained staff to validate and  interpret earned value data. According to the officials we  interviewed, the system is too new for them to determine conclusively  whether the data are accurate and the earned value management  system is being used effectively. The officials said that work to  validate the data in the system is ongoing, with formal reviews to  assess the quality of the system planned for 2016.", "Cost estimating requirements and practices that have not  followed best practices. In our November 2014 report, we found that  NNSA defense programs generally, and the B61-12 LEP specifically,  were not required to follow cost estimating best practices. For  example, in that report, we found that the B61-12 LEP\u2019s team- produced guidance for the program cost estimate did not stipulate that  NNSA program managers or its contractors must follow any DOE or  NNSA requirements or guidance to develop the B61-12 cost estimate.  We recommended in the report that DOE revise its directives that  apply to programs to require that DOE and NNSA and its contractors  develop cost estimates in accordance with best practices. DOE  agreed with this recommendation and, in June 2015, the Secretary of  Energy issued a memorandum directing the heads of all department  elements to use established methods and best practices, including  practices identified in our Cost Guide, to develop, maintain, and  document cost estimates for capital asset projects. We note that the  memorandum pertains to departmental policy related to project  management, not to program management. In the area of programs,  NNSA officials described actions that it had begun taking to address  our recommendation regarding cost estimating practices. We  continue to monitor DOE\u2019s response to our recommendation.", "Guidance on technology readiness that has not followed best  practices. An NNSA business practice requires technology readiness  reviews for LEPs, but it does not specify technology readiness  requirements for entering into first production\u2014Phase 6.5 of the 6.X  process.

In our November 2010 report,  we recommended that the Secretary of Energy evaluate where DOE\u2019s  guidance for gauging the maturity of new technologies is inconsistent  with best practices and, as appropriate, revise the guidance to be  consistent with federal agency best practices. DOE generally agreed  with our recommendation. Concerning projects, in his June 2015  memorandum, the Secretary of Energy directed that critical  technologies should reach TRL 7 before major system projects\u2014 those with a total cost of greater than $750 million\u2014receive approval  of their performance baselines.

Specifically, the LEP\u2019s 48 product realization teams (PRT)\u2014the  groups of scientists, engineers, and subject-matter experts that perform  the ground-level project work on B61-12 components and  subassemblies\u2014are responsible for identifying risks. Most risks are  managed at the PRT level, but risks that have the potential to affect top- level schedule milestones or the program\u2019s ability to deliver a weapon that  meets performance requirements are presented to joint review boards for  inclusion in the Active Risk Manager database. These higher-level risks\u2014 referred to as joint risks\u2014are categorized according to the likelihood of  their occurrence and the consequences should they occur. Joint risks with  the highest likelihood and consequence are color coded as \u201cred\u201d risks,  with successively lower-likelihood and \u2013consequence risks labeled as  \u201cyellow\u201d and \u201cgreen,\u201d respectively. Program officials develop risk  management steps for each joint risk, document and make time for these  steps in both the Active Risk Manager database and the relevant  integrated master schedules, and brief the Nuclear Weapons Council on  the status of joint risks. Additionally, NNSA identifies and documents  opportunities\u2014program areas with the potential to realize saved time and  cost.", "According to NNSA and Air Force officials, some of the joint risks  identified through this process have already been successfully managed.  For example, NNSA officials told us that they were able to avoid the risk  of a shortage of a type of glass necessary for electrical connections by  procuring the glass for the entire program in advance. NNSA estimates  that avoiding this risk prevented a program delay that could have lasted  for more than a year and increased program costs by more than $2  million.", "Other joint risks may affect later stages of the B61-12 LEP, so it is too  soon to tell if plans to manage them will be effective. Joint risks in the  \u201cred\u201d category (i.e., high risk) include risks related to the compatibility of  the B61-12 with the still-developing F-35 aircraft, the risk of temperature- related component failures in certain flight environments, and schedule  risks related to the hydrodynamic testing of certain changed nonnuclear  components. In November 2015, the federal program manager for the  LEP reported that these risks remain \u201cred\u201d but are \u201ctrending\u201d in a positive  direction.

NNSA and DOD officials acknowledged the  schedule\u2019s constraints, which they say are driven by factors including  delays in starting the B61-12 LEP because of a lengthy design study, the  effects of sequestration, and the need to complete work on the B61-12  LEP to enable NNSA to start work on planned future LEPs. In testimony  given to the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on  Armed Services in March 2015, the Nuclear Weapons Council  characterized the B61-12 LEP\u2019s schedule as having \u201clittle, if any, margin  left.\u201d DOD officials have testified before Congress that the B61-12 LEP  must be completed on the current schedule to ensure that the aging of  B61 legacy bombs does not affect the United States\u2019 ability to maintain its  commitments to NATO, and DOE officials have testified that the LEP  must be completed to ensure that DOE can effectively manage other  ongoing and planned LEPs and stockpile stewardship activities.
