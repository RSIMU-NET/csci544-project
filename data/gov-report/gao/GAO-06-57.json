Over the 10-year period, 8 percent of payments were delayed by 2 weeks or more. Payments were somewhat more likely to be timely in more recent years. The process for renewing HUD's subsidy contracts with owners can affect the timeliness of housing assistance payments, according to many owners, HUD officials, and contract administrators that HUD hires to work with owners. HUD's renewal process is largely a manual, hard-copy paper process that requires multiple staff to complete. Problems with this cumbersome, paper-intensive process may delay contract renewals and cause late payments. Also, a lack of systematic internal processes for HUD staff to better estimate the amounts that HUD needs to obligate to contracts each year and monitor contract funding levels on an ongoing basis can contribute to delays in housing assistance payments. Although HUD allows owners to borrow from reserve accounts to lessen the effect of delayed housing assistance payments, 3 of 16 project owners told GAO that they had to make late payments on their mortgages or other bills--such as utilities, telephone service, or pest control--as a result of HUD's payment delays. Owners who are heavily reliant on HUD's subsidy to operate their properties are likely to be more severely affected by payment delays than other, more financially stable, owners. Owners reported receiving no warning from HUD when payments would be delayed, and several told GAO that such notification would allow them to mitigate a delay. Nonetheless, project owners, industry group officials, and HUD officials generally agreed that late housing assistance payments would be unlikely to cause an owner to leave HUD's housing assistance programs, because such a decision is generally driven primarily by local market factors."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides  rental assistance subsidies to privately owned, multifamily projects so that  they are affordable to low-income households. In fiscal year 2004, HUD  assisted approximately 1.6 million households through project-based rental  assistance contracts, committing about $4.4 billion to fund these contracts  with property owners. Owners rely on these subsidies from HUD, often to a  great extent, to pay for daily operating expenses, such as staff salaries and  maintenance, as well as to make their monthly mortgage payments and set  aside funds for contingencies and major repairs. Although HUD\u2019s subsidy  payments to owners are not subject to a statutory or regulatory standard  for timeliness, HUD\u2019s goal, with some exceptions, is to provide the  payments by the 1st business day of the month.", "Project owners, and various associations representing them, have  expressed concern that HUD has been late in paying some owners their  monthly subsidy and that late payments to owners have become a chronic  problem in recent years. According to some owners, late payments can lead  them to defer maintenance, miss payments on monthly utility bills, or risk  default on their mortgages. Furthermore, late payments might influence  owners to \u201copt out\u201d of HUD\u2019s rental assistance programs when their  contracts with HUD expire, potentially resulting in a reduction of  affordable housing units for low-income households.", "You asked us to review the effects that late housing assistance payments  may have on project owners and the availability of affordable housing.

We analyzed trends in these data to determine  whether payment timeliness changed over time and whether there were  differences in payment timeliness by the type of contract administrator  (i.e., whether HUD staff or contractors processed monthly vouchers). To  determine the factors that affect the timeliness of housing assistance  payments, we analyzed the portion of HUD\u2019s monthly payment data  (generally, payments made in fiscal years 2002 through 2004) that captured  the reasons particular payments were delayed. We supplemented our  analyses by interviewing HUD officials from headquarters and eight field  offices (which were selected to represent a range of experiences by state\u2014 those with high and low percentages of late payments), contract  administrators, project owners, and industry group officials. To assess the  effects of payment delays on project owners and their willingness to  continue providing affordable housing, we compared available HUD data  on projects that opted out of HUD\u2019s programs with monthly payment  timeliness data to determine whether these projects experienced more  payment delays than projects that are currently receiving assistance from  HUD. At the HUD field offices where we did site visits, we interviewed  project owners and contract administrators to determine (1) the reasons  owners opted out of HUD\u2019s programs, (2) the extent to which delayed  housing assistance payments may have factored into this decision, and (3)  what other effects (e.g., financial difficulties) payment delays had on  project owners. We also discussed these issues with HUD and officials  from eight industry associations representing property owners. We  conducted our work between October 2004 and September 2005 in  Baltimore, Maryland; Boston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; Des Moines,  Iowa; Kansas City, Kansas; Kansas City, Missouri; Los Angeles, California;  Manchester, New Hampshire; Seattle, Washington; and Washington, D.C., in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Appendix I provides additional details on our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["HUD operates a variety of project-based rental assistance programs  through which it pays subsidies, or housing assistance payments, to private  owners of multifamily housing that help make this housing affordable for  lower income households. In some cases, HUD subsidized the construction  of the housing (or substantial rehabilitation of existing properties) through  means such as discounted mortgages insured by HUD\u2019s Federal Housing  Administration; in others, such as the Section 202 Supportive Housing for  the Elderly Program, HUD provided grants to construct the housing. HUD  entered into long-term contracts, often 20 to 40 years, committing it and the  property owners to providing long-term affordable housing. Under these  contracts, tenants generally pay 30 percent of their adjusted income toward  their rents, with the HUD subsidy equal to the difference between what the  tenants pay and the contract rents that HUD and the owners negotiate in  advance.", "In the mid- to late-1990s, Congress and HUD made several important  changes to the duration of housing assistance contract terms (and the  budgeting for them), the contract rents owners would receive relative to  local market conditions, and the manner in which HUD administers its  ongoing project-based housing assistance contracts. Specifically:  Because of budgetary constraints, HUD shortened the terms of  subsequent renewals, after the initial 20- to 40-year terms began expiring  in the mid-1990s. HUD reduced the contract terms to 1 or 5 years, with  the funding renewed annually subject to appropriations.", "Second, in 1997, Congress passed the Multifamily Assisted Housing  Reform and Affordability Act (MAHRA), as amended, in an effort,  among other things, to ensure that the rents HUD subsidizes remain  comparable with market rents. Over the course of the initial longer  term agreements with owners, contract rents in some cases came to  substantially exceed local market rents. MAHRA required an assessment  of each project when it neared the end of its original contract term to  determine whether the contract rents were comparable to current  market rents and whether the project had sufficient cash flow to meet  its debt as well as daily and long-term operating expenses. If the  expiring contract rents were below market rates, HUD could increase  the contract rents to market rates upon renewal (i.e., \u201cmark up to  market\u201d). Conversely, HUD could decrease the contract rents upon  renewal if they were higher than market rents (i.e., \u201cmark down to  market\u201d).", "Finally, in 1999, because of staffing constraints (primarily in HUD\u2019s field  offices) and the workload involved in renewing the increasing numbers  of rental assistance contracts reaching the end of their initial terms,  HUD began an initiative to contract out the oversight and administration  of most of its project-based contracts. The entities that HUD hired\u2014 typically public housing authorities or state housing finance agencies\u2014 are responsible for conducting on-site management reviews of assisted  properties; adjusting contract rents; reviewing, processing, and paying  monthly vouchers submitted by owners; renewing contracts with  property owners; and responding to health and safety issues at the  properties. These performance-based contract administrators (PBCA)  now administer the majority of contracts\u2014over 13,000 of approximately  23,000 contracts in fiscal year 2004.", "According to HUD officials, the department has not yet transferred all of its  rental assistance contracts to the PBCAs. HUD plans to have traditional, or  nonperformance-based contractors, continue to administer the  approximately 5,000 contracts that they were administering until these  contracts expire; at which time, these contracts will be assigned to the  PBCAs. The traditional contract administrators are, often, local public  housing authorities handling a very limited number of contracts. HUD itself  also administers the contracts under certain programs, such as the Section  202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Program and the Section 811  Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities Program. HUD  announced in April 2004 that it was conducting a competitive sourcing  effort to determine the most efficient and cost-effective means to  administer some of these contracts. At the conclusion of this effort, HUD  will seek new budget authority to pay for contract administration services.  Consequently, while the PBCAs handle most of HUD\u2019s project-based  housing, three types of administrators are involved in day-to-day program  oversight and administration, including tasks involved in processing  monthly housing assistance payments.", "To receive their monthly housing assistance payments, owners must submit  monthly vouchers to account for changes in occupancy and tenants\u2019  incomes that affect the actual amount of subsidy due. However, the manner  in which the owners submit these vouchers and the process by which they  get paid varies depending on which of the three types of contract  administrators handles their contract (see fig. 1). For HUD-administered  contracts, the owner submits a monthly voucher to HUD for verification,  and HUD in turn pays the owner based on the amount in the voucher. For  PBCA-administered contracts, the owner submits a monthly voucher to the  PBCA, which verifies the voucher and forwards it to HUD for payment.  HUD then transfers the amount verified on the voucher to the PBCA, which  in turn pays the owner. In contrast, for traditionally administered contracts,  HUD and the contract administrator develop a yearly budget, and HUD  pays the contract administrator set monthly payments. The owner submits  monthly vouchers to the contract administrator for verification, and the  contract administrator pays the amount approved on the voucher. At the  end of the year, HUD and the contract administrator reconcile the  payments HUD made to the contract administrator with the amounts the  contract administrator paid to the owner, exchanging payment as  necessary to settle any difference.", "HUD has an ongoing effort to improve its rental assistance programs\u2019  business processes and make better use of information technology related  to those programs. In 2004, HUD launched a Business Process  Reengineering (BPR) initiative to, among other things, improve inefficient  and redundant processes, as identified by HUD\u2019s contractor for this effort,  and to integrate HUD\u2019s data systems. HUD expects its contractor to identify  its recommended changes by June 2006.

Moreover, HUD\u2019s process of  estimating how much funding it needs to obligate to contracts; HUD\u2019s  inconsistent approach to monitoring contracts to determine when  additional funding should be obligated; and lack of staff access to, and  training on, HUD payment databases also may have affected the timeliness  of housing assistance payments. Additionally, HUD\u2019s interpretation of  legislative restrictions on its ability to use recaptured funds may have  exacerbated payment delays.

Therefore, an owner cannot receive a monthly voucher payment  on a contract that HUD has not renewed.", "Our analysis of HUD data from fiscal years 2002 through 2004 shows that 60  percent of the payments that were 2 weeks or more late was associated  with pending contract renewals, among late payments on PBCA- and  HUD-administered contracts for which HUD recorded the reason for the  delay (see fig. 8).", "A contract renewal may be \u201cpending\u201d when one or more parties involved in  the process\u2014HUD, the PBCA, or the owner\u2014have not completed the  necessary steps to finalize the renewal. Based on our interviews with HUD  officials, contract administrators, and owners, pending contract renewals  may result from owners\u2019 failing to submit their renewal packages on time.  Often the delay occurs when owners must submit a study of market rents,  completed by a certified appraiser, in order to determine the market rent  levels. However, late payments associated with contract renewals may also  occur because HUD has not completed its required processing. For  example, according to a HUD official, at one field office we visited,  contract renewals were delayed because HUD field staff were behind in  updating necessary information, such as the new rent schedules associated  with the renewals and the contract execution dates in HUD payment  systems.", "HUD\u2019s contract renewal process itself also may take longer than expected,  contributing to late housing assistance payments, because the process is  largely manual and paper driven and requires multiple staff in the PBCAs  and HUD to complete (see fig. 9). Upon receipt of renewal packages from  owners, the PBCAs then prepare and forward signed contracts (in hard  copy) to HUD field offices, which execute the contracts; in turn, the field  offices send hard copies of contracts to a HUD accounting center, which  activates contract funding. In order to allow sufficient time to complete the  necessary processing, HUD\u2019s policy currently requires owners to submit a  renewal package to their PBCAs 120 days before a contract expires, and  gives the PBCAs 30 days to forward the renewal package to HUD for  completion (leaving HUD 90 days for processing). However, some of the  owners with whom we spoke told us that their contract renewals had not  been completed by the contract expiration dates, even though they had  submitted their renewal packages on time.", "While initial contract renewals (upon expiration of the owner\u2019s initial long- term contract) often exceeded the 120-day processing time, subsequent  renewals were less time-consuming and resulted in fewer delays, according  to HUD officials, the PBCAs, and owners. Initial renewals could be  challenging for owners because they often involved HUD\u2019s reassessment of  whether the contract rents were in line with market rents. Additionally, the  initial renewal represents the first time that owners have to provide HUD  with the extensive documentation required for contract renewals in order  to continue receiving housing assistance payments. Our analysis of the  most recent 3 years of HUD data (fiscal years 2002 through 2004) shows  that while 25 percent of initial contract renewals exceeded the 120-day  processing time frame set by HUD, 17 percent of subsequent renewals  exceeded that time frame, as shown in figure 10. Increased timeliness on  subsequent renewals might be explained partly by owners\u2019 gaining  competency\u2014that is, the PBCAs and owners described a \u201clearning curve\u201d  when owners renewed their contracts for the first time.", "The processing times for contract renewals that HUD\u2019s data show do not  include some interactions between the PBCAs and owners. More  specifically, HUD\u2019s data systems capture the dates on which it receives  completed renewal packages from the PBCAs, but do not capture the dates  for earlier steps in the process. For instance, the data systems do not  capture the dates when owners initially submit renewal packages to the  PBCAs and, thus, the amount of time it may take the PBCAs and owners to  go \u201cback and forth\u201d to assemble completed packages.", "According to our analysis, the processing time for the contract renewals  also was likely to exceed HUD\u2019s 120-day standard when owners chose or  were subject to one of two options at their initial renewals. First, for  properties with contract rents lower than comparable market rents,  owners had the option to request contract renewals under the \u201cmark-up-to- market\u201d option, which required (1) owners to obtain an appraiser\u2019s  determination of comparable market rents and (2) HUD to reassess the  contract rents in order to raise them to applicable market level rents. For  fiscal years 2002 through 2004, 60 percent of the 471 contract renewals  using the mark-up-to-market option took more than the expected 120 days.  Second, for expiring contracts with rents higher than comparable market  rents, contract administrators referred the owners to HUD\u2019s Office of  Multifamily Housing Assistance Restructuring (OMHAR), a process that  can lead to rents in renewed contracts that are lower than those in the  expiring contracts (the \u201cmark-to-market\u201d option). For fiscal years 2002  through 2004, 56 percent of the 1,276 contract renewals referred to OMHAR  to reduce rents\u2014and, in many cases, to restructure the property owners\u2019  debt\u2014took more than the expected 120 days to process.", "Recognizing that contract renewal is lengthy and cumbersome, HUD\u2019s goal  is to automate the renewal process and reduce the 120-day time frame  through a BPR effort for its rental assistance programs. HUD launched this  initiative in 2004 to, among other things, develop plans to improve what it  characterizes as \u201cinefficient or redundant processes\u201d and to integrate data  systems. For example, according to a senior HUD official, the department\u2019s  goal is to automate the entire contract renewal process by 2007, eliminating  the need for HUD and owners to physically sign the contracts. According to  HUD officials, this effort would eventually include a more streamlined and  automated contract renewal process. However, this effort is in its early  stages, and is currently not focused on streamlining the contract renewal  process or addressing the problem of late housing assistance payments.  HUD does not have concrete plans regarding how it will accomplish these  goals, nor does it have funding in place to implement any of the  recommendations the reengineering effort might develop."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD\u2019s Difficulties in Assessing Rate of Funding Use and Monitoring Funding Levels May Have Affected Timeliness of Housing Assistance Payments", "paragraphs": ["The methods HUD uses to estimate the amount of funds needed for the  term of each of its project-based assistance contracts and the way it  monitors the funding levels on those contracts may also affect the  timeliness of housing assistance payments. When HUD renews a contract,  and when it obligates additional funding for each year of contracts with  5-year terms, it obligates an estimate of the actual subsidy payments to  which the owner will be entitled over the course of a year. However, those  estimates are often too low, according to HUD headquarters and field office  officials and contract administrators. For example, an underestimate of  rent increases or utility costs or a change in household demographics or  incomes at a property will affect the rate at which a contract exhausts its  funds, potentially causing the contract to need additional funds obligated  to it before the end of the year. If HUD underestimates the subsidy  payments, the department needs to allocate more funds to the contract and  adjust its obligation upwards to make all of the monthly payments.", "Throughout the year, HUD headquarters uses a \u201cburn-rate calculation\u201d to  monitor the rate at which a contract exhausts or \u201cburns\u201d the obligated  funds and to identify those contracts that may have too little (or too much)  funding. According to some HUD field office and PBCA officials, they also  proactively monitor contract fund levels. Based on the rate at which a  contract exhausts its funds, HUD obligates more funds if needed.", "However, based on our analysis of available HUD data and our discussions  with HUD field office officials, owners, and contract administrators,  payments on some contracts were still delayed because they needed to  have additional funds allocated and obligated before a payment could be  made. As shown in figure 8, our analysis of HUD\u2019s payment data shows  that, where the reasons for delayed payments on PBCA- and  HUD-administered contracts were available, 11 percent of delays of 2  weeks or more were due to contracts needing additional funds obligated.  That is, those payments were delayed because, at the time the owners\u2019  vouchers were processed, HUD had not allocated and obligated enough  funding to the contracts to cover the payments.", "One potential factor contributing to payment delays related to obligating  contract funding is likely that staff at some HUD field offices\u2014unlike their  counterparts in other field offices and staff at some of the PBCAs\u2014did not  have access to data systems or were not trained to use them to monitor  funding levels. At some of the field offices we visited, officials reported that  they did not have access to the HUD data systems that would allow them to  adequately monitor contract funding levels. For example, one field office  official told us that he needed access to one of HUD\u2019s accounting data  systems to more accurately monitor contract funding. According to this  official, he requested \u201cread-only\u201d access to this system, which requires a  security clearance, but never received information on the status of his  application from HUD headquarters. HUD field offices reported, and  headquarters confirmed, that some field officials have not received training  to carry out some functions critical to monitoring the burn rate. One field  office official reported that none of the staff in her office had received  training in a payment processing database, which is critical for monitoring  the status of monthly payments. A HUD headquarters official reported that  changes in the agency\u2019s workforce demographics posed challenges because  not all of the field offices have staff with an optimal mix of skill and  experience.", "According to a senior HUD official, HUD\u2019s BPR is intended to provide a  systematic, agencywide solution to the contract funding issues that field  office officials have been trying to address on an ad hoc basis to prevent  payment delays.

HUD requires HUD-insured properties and properties  with HUD-held mortgages to set aside funds in a reserve account, which is  designed primarily to help fund capital improvements on the properties.  HUD also allows owners to withdraw funds from this account in the event  of HUD\u2019s payment delays, so that owners are able to make their mortgage  payments. However, properties that are not insured by HUD and do not  have a HUD-held mortgage may not have a reserve account, and, according  to HUD and industry group officials, owners with small or newer properties  may not have sufficient reserves to cover delays. Even if the reserves were  sufficient, industry group officials have pointed out that owners might have  to defer capital improvements during payment delays, and also lose  interest that they would otherwise accrue in the reserve account. Some  projects also have a residual receipts account from which owners may  borrow.

Over the  10-year period we examined, HUD made most payments on time\u2014that is,  by the 1st business day of the month. However, a significant percentage of  HUD\u2019s payments were late. The delays, particularly those of 2 weeks or  more, can cause financial hardships for property owners. For example, the  subsidies not only help pay mortgages, but also the daily operating  expenses of many owners. In retrospect, new requirements under MAHRA  and the transition to a new system of contract administration likely  increased delays, particularly in the late 1990s. The initial difficulties in  implementing MAHRA requirements have abated, and HUD largely has  completed the transition to performance-based contract administration.  However, while the timeliness of housing assistance payments has  improved in recent years, the number of significantly late payments  remains a concern.", "Although HUD has made changes to improve contract administration, it  has not comprehensively addressed the factors that most affect the  timeliness of payments\u2014that is, its contract renewal and contract funding  and monitoring processes. HUD has recognized that its contract renewal  process is cumbersome and inefficient and wants to cut contract  processing time as one goal of a broader BPR effort. However, that effort  has just gotten under way and currently is not closely focused on the  housing assistance payment process. As a result, if HUD were to rely solely  on the reengineering effort, it would miss opportunities to effect more  immediate improvements to the processing of contract renewals. In  addition, HUD effectively could prevent many delayed payments by better  estimating the amounts it needs to obligate to contracts each year, more  systematically monitoring contract funding levels on an ongoing basis, and  promptly allocating and obligating additional funding to contracts when  necessary. Currently, while contract funding needs can increase for  unforeseen reasons, HUD often underestimates how much funding a  contract will need when it obligates funds at the beginning of a year.  Furthermore, HUD\u2019s existing monitoring has not prevented payment delays  associated with contracts needing additional funding obligated in order for  HUD to pay the owner.", "As previously noted, HUD has opportunities to improve its contract  processes and avoid the often damaging disruptions late payments could  cause. While project owners and industry groups have indicated that late  housing payments alone would not lead them to opt out of HUD programs,  late housing assistance payments have serious consequences for owners  and potentially for the residents they serve.

We did not look at the dollar amount of these payments. For  contracts administered by performance-based and traditional (or  nonperformance-based) administrators, the Treasury payment is disbursed  to the administrator, which in turn makes payments to the project owners.  In contrast, for HUD-administered contracts, the Treasury disburses  payments directly to the owners.", "We analyzed trends in timeliness over the 10-year period as well as the most  recent 3-year period (fiscal years 2002 through 2004) for a more current  picture of payment timeliness. We also calculated the percentage of  payments that had various degrees of lateness (such as 1 to 6 days or 4  weeks or more). For fiscal year 2004, we compared timeliness for payments  processed by the different types of contract administrators involved in this  process (i.e., HUD field offices, performance-based contract administrators  (PBCA), and traditional contract administrators, for which the HUD  Financial Management Center processes payments). We limited our  analysis to fiscal year 2004 because the data we obtained from HUD do not  allow us to identify for prior fiscal years which type of contract  administrator was responsible for each contract, and, over the course of  these years, HUD was in the process of transferring contract  administration responsibilities to the PBCAs.
