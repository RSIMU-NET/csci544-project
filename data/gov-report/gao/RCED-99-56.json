This office has the lead responsibility for drafting a new training plan that, when completed in early calendar year 1999, will lay out a strategy for improving DOE employee training over fiscal years 1999 through 2001. We also held discussions with officials on the Department\u2019s Training and Development Management Council. This council is responsible for overseeing the efforts to improve DOE\u2019s training program. In addition, we interviewed officials and reviewed training activities of six DOE headquarters offices\u2014the Offices of Defense Programs; Environment, Safety, and Health; Energy Information Administration; Environmental Management; Science (formerly Energy Research); and Fossil Energy. These offices were selected because, according to their staffing levels, they are some of the largest offices within DOE headquarters.

Within the federal government, these contacts included training officials with the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Transportation\u2019s Federal Aviation Administration, and the Tennessee Valley Authority. These agencies, as well as DOE, voluntarily provided training cost information to us and a private organization, the American Society for Training and Development\u2019s Benchmarking Forum. Outside the federal government, we contacted an official with the American Society for Training and Development\u2019s Benchmarking Forum, which had collected training cost information from nearly 60 private sector companies. From the contacts made, training cost information was obtained, analyzed, and compared with training cost information we had obtained from DOE.

With respect to how DOE spends its training funds, we identified two factors that account for the high costs associated with DOE training. Those factors are that DOE offices and contractors offer a high percentage of training that is not mandated by laws and/or regulations and that DOE\u2019s offices and contractors independently develop and deliver training.

We found that DOE has not conducted a comprehensive assessment of occupational needs throughout the Department.", "The primary reason that a comprehensive assessment has not been conducted throughout DOE is that the Department\u2019s order on federal employee training contains no provision for doing one. Specifically, the training order outlines the objectives and responsibilities for federal employee training throughout the Department. It also outlines the components essential to the administration of employee training. The order does not, however, require that occupational training needs be assessed. DOE training officials indicated that such an assessment had been included in the preceding DOE order on employee training but was deleted from the current order under the Department\u2019s paperwork reduction program.", "During this and previous reviews of DOE activities, we have identified several departmental occupational groups that would most likely benefit from an assessment of occupational training needs. For instance, we believe that property managers may not be adequately trained. Supporting that view, we found that DOE recently surveyed 145 property managers and determined that 65 (or about 45 percent) had received no formal property management training. DOE also recently surveyed its field locations to determine if project managers are being properly trained. DOE guidance requires that employees who are project managers must be certified as possessing certain skills and receiving certain training. However, preliminary data show that many project managers have not received certification. For instance, DOE\u2019s Savannah River Operations Office reported that only 2 of its 33 project managers had been certified. We further reported that managers throughout DOE believe that the lack of skilled staff in program, project, and contractor oversight positions is one of the Department\u2019s most fundamental problems.", "Recognizing that certain occupational groups should have their training needs assessed, DOE, in November 1998, proposed a revised order and manual on federal employee training. The proposed manual states that an occupational needs assessment must be completed at least every 5 years once the revised order and manual are made final. In addition, the manual notes that such an assessment must include, but not be limited to, scientific and technical, acquisition, project management, and financial management functions. The DOE training official responsible for drafting the revised order and manual advised us that the 5-year assessment cycle was arbitrarily chosen.

As of December 1998, neither effort has been successful in standardizing training. The Universal Catalog was only 35-percent complete and more than 1 year behind schedule for completion.

DOE training officials have established a goal of completing IDPs for 90 percent of DOE employees by December 31, 1999.

The problems cited by the review included duplication and waste associated with the development and delivery of both federal and contractor training and a lack of consistency in the training provided across the Department. The review concluded, among other things, that if a DOE-wide training program were developed, tens of millions of dollars in annual training costs could be avoided.", "In response to the 1995 DOE review, the Department issued a strategic plan in July 1995 to improve federal employee training. DOE indicated that it intended to eventually develop a similar document to improve training for its contractors. Since its issuance, the strategic plan has had some success. For instance, DOE has established a new training structure that includes, for example, the Training and Development Management Council, which is responsible for overseeing the efforts to improve DOE\u2019s training program. In addition, DOE has established two training centers of excellence.", "On the other hand, DOE has not achieved many of the goals established by the strategic plan. For instance, DOE had intended to reduce by 50 percent the number of duplicate training courses offered by it and its contractors. According to DOE officials, the Department must first enter all training courses into a central database before it can analyze courses and reduce redundancy.", "In July 1997, DOE decided to terminate its strategic training plan, recognizing that it had not been entirely successful, and replace it with a new training plan. DOE began drafting this new training plan in November 1997 and intends to make the plan final early in calendar year 1999. With the new training plan, DOE believes that further reductions in training expenditures are possible. In that regard, the plan contains 18 performance expectations to be accomplished. Those expectations include, for instance, (1) having DOE\u2019s average training expenditures per employee be in alignment with similar federal agencies and the private sector by December 31, 1999; (2) not having DOE fund the development of duplicate training courses as of December 31, 1999; and (3) establishing six training centers of excellence by December 31, 2000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overall Costs and Overall Savings From the Plan Have Not Been Realistically Estimated", "paragraphs": ["According to DOE\u2019s new training plan, it is important that DOE estimate the overall dollar savings to be realized from the plan. Such an estimate, DOE training officials believe, is necessary to obtain the support needed from senior DOE management and the funding needed from the Congress. We found, however, that the plan provides a limited projection of the overall costs to implement the plan and no overall estimate of the cost savings to be realized from it. Instead, the plan only provides certain indications of the cost savings that are possible. However, these estimated cost savings are overstated. For that reason, it in unclear whether the plan\u2019s savings will exceed its costs.", "In the draft plan, DOE estimates that about $2 million will be needed over fiscal years 1999 through 2001 to implement the performance actions contained in the plan. DOE also acknowledges that this overall estimate is understated. It states that cost estimates have not yet been made final for certain key portions of the plan, including the implementation of a DOE-wide training information system and a technology-supported learning program. In a March 1998 submission to the Congress, DOE estimated that the costs for these two portions for fiscal years 1999 through 2001 would be $3.8 million and $3.4 million, respectively. However, no fiscal year 1999 funding was appropriated for these two portions.", "Conversely, DOE provides no overall estimate of cost savings for the 3-year period covered by the plan. Instead, DOE intends to wait and see what cost savings the plan will generate. In the plan, nevertheless, DOE points out that about $3 million in savings were realized during fiscal year 1998 from several initiatives supported by the plan. Our review determined that these savings are overstated. For example, the $3 million savings is based, in part, on reported cost savings of about $1.7 million by DOE\u2019s National Environmental Training Office in Aiken, South Carolina, for developing training courses that were then used at other DOE locations. We found, however, that the $1.7 million in savings was not offset against the approximately $1.9 million in costs to operate the Training Office in 1998. DOE training officials told us they will reevaluate and validate the cost data before the plan is made final.

We found, however, that the training plan does not present a policy on the centers\u2019 use or mandate that the centers will be the sole source for training on a topical area. Without that mandate, there is no assurance that duplication of training will be eliminated by the centers.", "Furthermore, DOE\u2019s draft training plan provides little information on the centers-of-excellence concept. According to the training plan, two centers of excellence were successfully launched in December 1997. On the basis of that success, the plan indicates that further actions are planned. These include (1) forming a panel of experts to review applications to become a center of excellence, (2) recommending topical areas for center-of-excellence designation, and (3) developing general operating principles and means to evaluate the operating centers of excellence. The training plan indicates that four additional centers of excellence will be established by the end of fiscal year 2000.", "However, the training plan does not articulate a policy on, or mandate the use of, the centers within the Department. Absent that mandate, we found that one of the centers has separately delivered training courses on subjects that already existed within the Department.

We determined that a similar course of comparable duration already existed elsewhere within DOE. For example, contractors at both DOE\u2019s Oak Ridge Operations Office and Rocky Flats Field Office offer a 3-day course on Environmental Laws and Regulations. In commenting on this matter, the director of the training office said that DOE and DOE/contractor training organizations have historically worked independently. Therefore, it will take some time for these very same organizations to work more closely together.

In May 1998, we reported that, for four contractors we reviewed, the applicable DOE field locations used various measures during fiscal year 1997 to evaluate contractors\u2019 training performance. For example, at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, DOE included a performance measure in the contract that required the contractor to develop a plan to consolidate all training records into an integrated database. In addition, at the Rocky Flats Field Office, DOE included a performance measure in the contract that required the contractor to fulfill 95 percent of the special requests for training when more than 3-days\u2019 notice had been given. Although such measures could improve record keeping and course scheduling, they would not, for the most part, help eliminate unnecessary costs for contractor training or improve training effectiveness.", "In on our review of contractor training, we identified three performance measures that were not being used DOE-wide that could reduce contractor training costs.

For example, the contractor at one location contacted outsourced about 65 percent of its training to a qualified vendor at an estimated savings of more than $0.6 million over a 2-year period.", "Use training course materials from other DOE locations rather than develop courses independently. One contractor, for example, advised us it has no policy or procedures requiring it to consider using materials from other DOE locations before deciding to develop a new training course.
