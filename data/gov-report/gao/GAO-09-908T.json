The report addresses: (1) selected states' and localities' uses of Recovery Act funds, (2) the approaches taken by the selected states and localities to ensure accountability for Recovery Act funds, and (3) states' plans to evaluate the impact of Recovery Act funds. GAO's work for the report is focused on 16 states and certain localities in those jurisdictions as well as the District of Columbia--representing about 65 percent of the U.S. population and two-thirds of the intergovernmental federal assistance available. GAO collected documents and interviewed state and local officials. GAO analyzed federal agency guidance and spoke with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) officials and with program officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the Departments of Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Labor, and Transportation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Across the United States, as of August 28, 2009, Treasury had outlayed about $45 billion of the estimated $49 billion in Recovery Act funds projected for use in states and localities in fiscal year 2009. More than three quarters of the federal outlays have been provided through the increased Medicaid Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) and the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF) administered by the Department of Education. GAO's work focused on nine federal programs that are estimated to account for approximately 87 percent of federal Recovery Act outlays in fiscal year 2009 for programs administered by states and localities. All 16 states and the District have drawn down increased Medicaid FMAP grant awards of just over $19.6 billion for October 1, 2008, through September 4, 2009, which amounted to almost 84 percent of such funds available to them. All states and the District experienced enrollment growth in this period. Several states noted that the increased FMAP funds were critical in their efforts to maintain coverage at current levels. States and the District reported they are planning to use the increased federal funds to cover their increased Medicaid caseload and to maintain current benefits and eligibility levels. As of September 1, the Department of Transportation (DOT) had obligated approximately $11 billion for almost 3,800 highway infrastructure and other eligible projects in the 16 states and the District and had reimbursed these 17 jurisdictions about $604 million. Across the nation, almost half of the obligations have been for pavement improvement projects because they did not require extensive environmental clearances, were quick to design, obligate and bid on, could employ people quickly, and could be completed within 3 years. Officials from most states considered project readiness, including the 3-year completion requirement, when making project selections and only later identified to what extent these projects fulfilled the economically distressed area requirement. We found substantial variation in how states identified economically distressed areas and how they prioritized project selection for these areas. FHWA issued clarifying guidance to address our recommendation in August 2009. As of September 1, 2009, the District and 15 of the 16 states covered by our review had received approval from Education for their initial SFSF funding applications. Pennsylvania had submitted an application to Education, but it had not yet been approved. As of August 28, 2009, Education has made $21 billion in SFSF grants for Education available to the 15 states and the District--of which over $7.7 billion had been drawn down as of August 28, 2009. School districts said they would use SFSF funds to maintain current levels of education funding, particularly for retaining staff and current education programs. They also told us that SFSF funds would help offset state budget cuts. Overall, states reported using Recovery Act funds to stabilize state budgets and to cope with fiscal stresses. The funds helped them maintain staffing for existing programs and minimize or avoid tax increases as well as reductions in services. States have implemented various internal control programs; however, federal Single Audit guidance and reporting does not fully address Recovery Act risk. The Single Audit reporting deadline is too late to provide audit results in time for the audited entity to take action on deficiencies noted in Recovery Act programs. Moreover, current guidance does not achieve the level of accountability needed to effectively respond to Recovery Act risks. Direct recipients of Recovery Act funds, including states and localities, are expected to report quarterly on a number of measures, including the use of funds and estimates of the number of jobs created and retained."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our work examining the uses and  planning by selected states and localities for funds made available by the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act).

Actual declines in sales,  personal income, and corporate income tax revenues influenced state  actions to begin to fill an estimated $230 billion in budget gaps for fiscal  years 2009 through 2011. The national unemployment rate also increased  to 9.5 percent in June 2009, and high unemployment can place greater  stress on state budgets as demand for services, such as Medicaid,  increases.

Most commonly, states reported that they are using or planning  to use freed-up funds to cover their increased Medicaid caseload, to  maintain current benefits and eligibility levels, and to help finance their  respective state budgets. Several states noted that given the poor  economic climate in their respective states, these funds were critical in  their efforts to maintain Medicaid coverage at current levels.", "While officials from several states spoke positively about CMS\u2019s guidance  related to FMAP requirements, over half of the states and the District  reported they wanted CMS to provide additional guidance regarding how  they report monthly on increased FMAP spending and whether certain  programmatic changes would affect their eligibility for funds. For  example, Medicaid officials from several states told us they were hesitant  to implement minor programmatic changes, such as changes to prior  authorization requirements, pregnancy verifications, or ongoing rate  changes, out of concern that doing so would jeopardize their eligibility for  increased FMAP. In addition, at least three states raised concerns that  glitches related to new or updated information systems used to generate  provider payments could affect their eligibility for these funds.", "Due to the variability of state operations, funding processes, and political  structures, CMS has worked with states on a case-by-case basis to discuss  and resolve issues that arise. Specifically, communications between CMS  and several states indicate efforts to clarify issues related to the  contributions to the state share of Medicaid spending by political  subdivisions or to rainy-day funds. Since we issued our July report, on July  30, 2009, CMS published new guidance for states regarding the prompt  payment requirement.

While officials from almost all of the states we reviewed  said that they considered project readiness, including the 3-year  completion requirement, when making project selections, there was  substantial variation in the extent to which states prioritized projects in  economically distressed areas and how they identified these areas. Many  states based their project selections on other factors and only later  identified whether these projects were in economically distressed areas.  We reported in July that DOT and FHWA had not provided clear  guidance\u2014while officials emphasized the importance of giving priority to  these areas, it did not define what giving priority meant, and thus did not  ensure that the act\u2019s priority provisions would be consistently applied. We  also found instances of states developing their own eligibility requirements  for economically distressed areas using data or criteria not specified in the  Public Works and Economic Development Act.  For example, one state  identified these areas based in part on home foreclosure rates\u2014data not  specified in the Public Works Act.  In each of the cases we identified, the  states informed us that FHWA approved the state\u2019s use of alternative  criteria. However, FHWA did not consult with or seek the approval of the  Department of Commerce, and it was not clear under what authority  FHWA approved these criteria.  As a result we recommended that the  Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of  Commerce, develop (1) clear guidance on identifying and giving priority to  economically distressed areas, and (2) more consistent procedures for  FHWA to use in reviewing and approving states\u2019 criteria for designating  distressed areas.", "In response to the recommendation in our July report, FHWA, in  consultation with the Department of Commerce, developed guidance that  addresses our recommendation. In particular, FHWA\u2019s August 2009  guidance directs states to give priority to projects that are located in an  economically distressed area and can be completed within the 3-year  timeframe over other projects. In the guidance, FHWA also directs states  to maintain information as to how they identified, vetted, examined, and  selected projects located in economically distressed areas. In addition,  FHWA\u2019s guidance sets out criteria that states may use to identify  economically distressed areas based on \u201cspecial need.\u201d The criteria aligns  closely with criteria used by the Department of Commerce\u2019s Economic  Development Administration (EDA) in designating special needs areas in  its own grant programs, including factors such as actual or threatened  business closures (including job loss thresholds), military base closures,  and natural disasters or emergencies. According to EDA, while the agency  traditionally approves special needs designations on a case-by-case basis  for its own grant program, it does not have the resources to do so for the  purpose of Recovery Act highway funding. Rather, in supplemental  guidance issued August 24, 2009, FHWA required states to document their  reliance on \u201cspecial need\u201d criteria and provide the documentation to  FHWA Division Offices, thereby making the designation of new \u201cspecial  need\u201d areas for the for Recovery Act highway funding \u201cself executing\u201d by  the states, meaning the states will apply the criteria laid out in the  guidance to identify these areas. We plan to continue to monitor FHWA\u2019s  and the states\u2019 implementation of the economically distressed area  requirement, including the states\u2019 application of the special needs criteria,  in our future reviews.", "Finally, the states are required to certify that they will maintain the level of  state effort for programs covered by the Recovery Act. With one  exception, the states have completed these certifications, but they face  challenges. Maintaining a state\u2019s level of effort can be particularly  important in the highway program. We have found that the preponderance  of evidence suggests that increasing federal highway funds influences  states and localities to substitute federal funds for funds they otherwise  would have spent on highways. As we previously reported, substitution  makes it difficult to target an economic stimulus package so that it results  in a dollar-for-dollar increase in infrastructure investment.", "Most states revised the initial certifications they submitted to DOT. As we  reported in April, many states submitted explanatory certifications\u2014such  as stating that the certification was based on the \u201cbest information  available at the time\u201d\u2014or conditional certifications, meaning that the  certification was subject to conditions or assumptions, future legislative  action, future revenues, or other conditions. On April 22, 2009, the  Secretary of Transportation sent a letter to each of the nation\u2019s governors  and provided additional guidance, including that conditional and  explanatory certifications were not permitted, and gave states the option  of amending their certifications by May 22. All states and the District have  submitted their certifications. According to DOT officials, the department  has concluded that the form of each certification is consistent with the  additional guidance. While DOT has concluded that the form of the revised  certifications is consistent with the additional guidance, it is evaluating the  states\u2019 method of calculating the amounts they planned to expend for the  covered programs and the reasonableness of these numbers.", "States face drastic fiscal challenges, and most states are estimating that  their fiscal year 2009 and 2010 revenue collections will be well below  estimates. In the face of these challenges, some states told us that meeting  the maintenance-of-effort requirements over time poses significant  challenges. For example, federal and state transportation officials in  Illinois told us that to meet its maintenance-of-effort requirements in the  face of lower-than-expected fuel tax receipts, the state would have to use  general fund or other revenues to cover any shortfall in the level of effort  stated in its certification. Mississippi transportation officials are  concerned about the possibility of statewide, across-the-board spending  cuts in 2010.

Specifically, a March fact sheet, the Secretary\u2019s April letter to  Governors, and program guidance issued in April and May mention that  the purposes of the SFSF include helping stabilize state and local budgets,  avoiding reductions in education and other essential services, and  ensuring LEAs and public IHEs have resources to \u201cavert cuts and retain  teachers and professors.\u201d The documents also link educational progress to  economic recovery and growth and identify four principles to guide the  distribution and use of Recovery Act funds: (1) spend funds quickly to  retain and create jobs; (2) improve student achievement through school  improvement and reform; (3) ensure transparency, public reporting, and  accountability; and (4) invest one-time Recovery Act funds thoughtfully to  avoid unsustainable continuing commitments after the funding expires,  known as the \u201cfunding cliff.\u201d", "After meeting assurances to maintain state support for education at least  at fiscal year 2006 levels, states are required to use the education  stabilization fund to restore state support to the greater of fiscal year 2008  or 2009 levels for elementary and secondary education, public IHEs, and, if  applicable, early childhood education programs. States must distribute  these funds to school districts using the primary state education formula  but maintain discretion in how funds are allocated to public IHEs. If, after  restoring state support for education, additional funds remain, the state  must allocate those funds to school districts according to the Elementary  and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), Title I, Part A funding  formula. On the other hand, if a state\u2019s education stabilization fund  allocation is insufficient to restore state support for education, then a state  must allocate funds in proportion to the relative shortfall in state support  to public school districts and public IHEs. Education stabilization funds  must be allocated to school districts and public IHEs and cannot be  retained at the state level.", "Once education stabilization funds are awarded to school districts and  public IHEs, they have considerable flexibility over how they use those  funds. School districts are allowed to use education stabilization funds for  any allowable purpose under ESEA, the Individuals with Disabilities  Education Act (IDEA), the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act, or the  Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (Perkins Act),  subject to some prohibitions on using funds for, among other things,  sports facilities and vehicles. In particular, Education\u2019s guidance states  that because allowable uses under the Impact Aid provisions of ESEA are  broad, school districts have discretion to use education stabilization funds  for a broad range of things, such as salaries of teachers, administrators,  and support staff, and purchases of textbooks, computers, and other  equipment. The Recovery Act allows public IHEs to use education  stabilization funds in such a way as to mitigate the need to raise tuition  and fees, as well as for the modernization, renovation, and repair of  facilities, subject to certain limitations. However, the Recovery Act  prohibits public IHEs from using education stabilization funds for such  things as increasing endowments; modernizing, renovating, or repairing  sports facilities; or maintaining equipment. Education\u2019s SFSF guidance  expressly prohibits states from placing restrictions on LEAs\u2019 use of  education stabilization funds, beyond those in the law, but allows states  some discretion in placing limits on how IHEs may use these funds.", "The SFSF provides states and school districts with additional flexibility,  subject to certain conditions, to help them address fiscal challenges. For  example, the Secretary of Education is granted authority to permit waivers  of state maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirements if a state certified that  state education spending will not decrease as a percentage of total state  revenues. Education issued guidance on the MOE requirement, including  the waiver provision, on May 1, 2009. Also, the Secretary may permit a  state or school district to treat education stabilization funds as nonfederal  funds for the purpose of meeting MOE requirements for any program  administered by Education, subject to certain conditions.", "States have broad discretion over how the $8.8 billion in the SFSF  government services fund are used. The Recovery Act provides that these  funds must be used for public safety and other government services and  that these services may include assistance for education, as well as  modernization, renovation, and repairs of public schools or IHEs.", "On April 1, 2009, Education made at least 67 percent of each state\u2019s SFSF  funds available, subject to the receipt of an application containing state  assurances, information on state levels of support for education and  estimates of restoration amounts, and baseline data demonstrating state  status on each of the four education reform assurances. If a state could not  certify that it would meet the MOE requirement, Education required it to  certify that it will meet requirements for receiving a waiver\u2014that is, that  education spending would not decrease relative to total state revenues. In  determining state level of support for elementary and secondary  education, Education required states to use their primary formula for  distributing funds to school districts but also allowed states some  flexibility in broadening this definition. For IHEs, states have some  discretion in how they establish the state level of support, with the  provision that they cannot include support for capital projects, research  and development, or amounts paid in tuition and fees by students. In order  to meet statutory requirements for states to establish their current status  regarding each of the four required programmatic assurances, Education  provided each state with the option of using baseline data Education had  identified or providing another source of baseline data. Some of the data  provided by Education was derived from self-reported data submitted  annually by the states to Education as part of their Consolidated State  Performance Reports (CSPR), but Education also relied on data from third  parties, including the Data Quality Campaign (DQC), the National Center  for Educational Achievement (NCEA), and Achieve.", "Education has reviewed applications as they arrive for completeness and  has awarded states their funds once it determined all assurances and  required information had been submitted. Education set the application  deadline for July 1, 2009. On June 24, 2009, Education issued guidance to  states informing them they must amend their applications if there are  changes to the reported levels of state support that were used to  determine maintenance of effort or to calculate restoration amounts.", "As an update to our July report, as of September 1, 2009, the District and  15 of the states covered by our review had received approval from  Education for their initial SFSF funding applications. Pennsylvania had  submitted an application to Education but it had not yet been approved.  As of August 28, 2009, Education had made $21 billion in SFSF grants for  Education available to the 15 states and the District. As of August 28, 2009,  14 of these states had drawn down SFSF Recovery Act funds. In total, over  $7.7 billion, or about 36 percent of available funds had been drawn down  by these states as of August 28, 2009.", "Three of the selected states\u2014Florida, Massachusetts, and New Jersey\u2014 said they would not meet the maintenance-of-effort requirements but  would meet the eligibility requirements for a waiver and that they would  apply for a waiver. Most of the states\u2019 applications show that they plan to  provide the majority of education stabilization funds to LEAs, with the  remainder of funds going to IHEs. Several states and the District of  Columbia estimated in their application that they would have funds  remaining beyond those that would be used to restore education spending  in fiscal years 2009 and 2010. These funds can be used to restore education  spending in fiscal year 2011, with any amount left over to be distributed to  LEAs.", "States have flexibility in how they allocate education stabilization funds  among IHEs but, once they establish their state funding formula, not in  how they allocate the funds among LEAs. Florida and Mississippi allocated  funds among their IHEs, including universities and community colleges,  using formulas based on factors such as enrollment levels. Other states  allocated SFSF funds taking into consideration the budget conditions of  the IHEs.", "Regarding LEAs, most states planned to allocate funds based on states\u2019  primary funding formulae. Many states are using a state formula based on  student enrollment weighted by characteristics of students and LEAs. For  example, Colorado\u2019s formula accounts for the number of students at risk  while the formula used by the District allocates funds to LEAs using  weights for each student based on the relative cost of educating students  with specific characteristics. For example, an official from Washington,  D.C. Public Schools said a student who is an English language learner may  cost more to educate than a similar student who is fluent in English.", "States may use the government services portion of SFSF for education but  have discretion to use the funds for a variety of purposes. Officials from  Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, and New York reported that their states plan  to use some or most of their government services funds for educational  purposes. Other states are applying the funds to public safety. For  example, according to state officials, California is using the government  services fund for it corrections system, and Georgia will use the funds for  salaries of state troopers and staff of forensic laboratories and state  prisons.", "Officials in many school districts told us that SFSF funds would help offset  state budget cuts and would be used to maintain current levels of  education funding. However, many school district officials also reported  that using SFSF funds for education reforms was challenging given the  other more pressing fiscal needs.", "Although their plans are generally not finalized, officials in many school  districts we visited reported that their districts are preparing to use SFSF  funds to prevent teacher layoffs, hire new teachers, and provide  professional development programs. Most school districts will use the  funding to help retain jobs that would have been cut without SFSF  funding. For example, Miami Dade officials estimate that the stabilization  funds will help them save nearly two thousand teaching positions. State  and school district officials in eight states we visited (California, Colorado,  Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, and North Carolina)  also reported that SFSF funding will allow their state to retain positions,  including teaching positions that would have been eliminated without the  funding. In the Richmond County School System in Georgia, officials  noted they plan to retain positions that support its schools, such as  teachers, paraprofessionals, nurses, media specialists and guidance  counselors. Local officials in Mississippi reported that budget-related  hiring freezes had hindered their ability to hire new staff, but because of  SFSF funding, they now plan to hire. In addition, local officials in a few  states told us they plan to use the funding to support teachers. For  example, officials in Waterloo Community and Ottumwa Community  School Districts in Iowa as well as officials from Miami-Dade County in  Florida cited professional development as a potential use of funding to  support teachers.", "Although school districts are preventing layoffs and continuing to provide  educational services with the SFSF funding, most did not indicate they  would use these funds to pursue educational reform. School district  officials cited a number of barriers, which include budget shortfalls, lack  of guidance from states, and insufficient planning time. In addition to  retaining and creating jobs, school districts have considerable flexibility to  use these resources over the next 2 years to advance reforms that could  have long-term impact. However, a few school district officials reported  that addressing reform efforts was not in their capacity when faced with  teacher layoffs and deep budget cuts. In Flint, Michigan, officials reported  that SFSF funds will be used to cope with budget deficits rather than to  advance programs, such as early childhood education or repairing public  school facilities. According to the Superintendent of Flint Community  Schools, the infrastructure in Flint is deteriorating, and no new school  buildings have been built in over 30 years. Flint officials said they would  like to use SFSF funds for renovating buildings and other programs, but  the SFSF funds are needed to maintain current education programs.", "Officials in many school districts we visited reported having inadequate  guidance from their state on using SFSF funding, making reform efforts  more difficult to pursue. School district officials in most states we visited  reported they lacked adequate guidance from their state to plan and report  on the use of SFSF funding. Without adequate guidance and time for  planning, school district officials told us that preparing for the funds was  difficult. At the time of our visits, several school districts were unaware of  their funding amounts, which, officials in two school districts said, created  additional challenges in planning for the 2009-2010 school year. One  charter school we visited in North Carolina reported that layoffs will be  required unless their state notifies them soon how much SFSF funding  they will receive. State officials in North Carolina, as well as in several  other states, told us they are waiting for the state legislature to pass the  state budget before finalizing SFSF funding amounts for school districts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "IHEs Plan to Use SFSF Funds for Faculty Salaries and Other Purposes and Expect the Funds to Save Jobs and Mitigate Tuition Increases", "paragraphs": ["Although many IHEs had not finalized plans for using SFSF funds, the  most common expected use for the funds at the IHEs we visited was to  pay salaries of IHE faculty and staff.

Officials at  several IHEs noted that this will have a positive impact on the educational  environment such as, by preventing increases in class size and enabling  the institutions to offer the classes that students need to graduate. In  addition to preserving existing jobs, some IHEs anticipate creating jobs  with SFSF funds. Besides saving and creating jobs at IHEs, officials noted  that SFSF monies will have an indirect impact on jobs in the community.  IHE officials also noted that SFSF funds will indirectly improve  employment because some faculty being paid with the funds will help  unemployed workers develop new skills, including skills in fields, such as  health care, that have a high demand for trained workers.
