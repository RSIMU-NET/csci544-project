GAO found that the clearinghouse was not being used by agencies to identify planned geospatial investments to promote coordination and reduce duplication. In addition, the committee had not yet fully planned for or implemented an approach to manage geospatial data as related groups of investments to allow agencies to more effectively plan geospatial data collection efforts and minimize duplicative investments, and its strategic plan was missing key elements.", "Other shortfalls have impaired progress in coordinating geospatial data. Specifically, none of the three federal departments in GAO's review had fully implemented important activities such as preparing and implementing a strategy for advancing geospatial activities within their respective departments. Moreover, the agencies in GAO's review responsible for governmentwide management of specific geospatial data had implemented some but not all key activities for coordinating the national coverage of specific geospatial data.", "While OMB has oversight responsibilities for geospatial data, GAO reported in November 2012 that according to OMB staff, the agency did not have complete and reliable information to identify potentially duplicative geospatial investments. GAO also reported that FGDC, federal departments and agencies, and OMB had not yet fully implemented policies and procedures for coordinating geospatial investments because these efforts had not been a priority. As a result, efforts to acquire data were uncoordinated and the federal government acquired duplicative geospatial data.

In  1953, the Bureau of the Budget first issued Circular A-16, encouraging  expeditious surveying and mapping activities across all levels of  government and avoidance of duplicative efforts. In 1990, OMB revised  Circular A-16 to, among other things, establish the Federal Geospatial  Data Committee (FGDC) within Interior to promote the coordinated use,  sharing, and dissemination of geospatial data nationwide. Building on that  guidance, in 1994 the President issued Executive Order 12906 for the  purpose of addressing wasteful duplication and incompatibility of  geospatial information, and assigned FGDC the responsibility to  coordinate the development of NSDI. In 2002, OMB again revised  Circular A-16 to further describe the components of NSDI; clearly define  agency responsibilities for acquiring, maintaining, distributing, using, and  preserving geospatial data; and to reaffirm FGDC\u2019s role as the  interagency coordinating body for NSDI-related activities. The circular  established the following five components of NSDI and described how  these components were to be implemented.", "Data themes. Data themes are topics of national significance, such  as cadastre, which includes rights and interests in real property and  surveys and land use/land cover, which includes land surface features  and use. OMB Circular A-16 currently identifies 34 data themes and  identifies the \u201clead\u201d agency or agencies for each theme. Each data  theme is to be comprised of one or more electronic data records,  known as a dataset. Of the 34 themes, 9 are identified as a  \u201cframework\u201d theme \u2014that is, a theme identified in Circular A-16 as  being critical for any geospatial application.", "Standards. Geospatial standards provide common and repeatable  rules or guidelines for the development, documentation, and  exchange of geospatial datasets.", "Metadata. Metadata are information about datasets, such as content,  source, accuracy, method of collection, and point-of-contact.  Metadata are used to facilitate the search of and access to datasets  within a data library or clearinghouse, and enable potential users to  determine the data\u2019s applicability for their use.", "National Spatial Data Clearinghouse. The clearinghouse is intended  to be a centralized geospatial metadata repository that contains  geospatial metadata records from federal agencies, state and local  governments, and academic and private sector organizations that can  be searched to determine whether needed geospatial data exist and  can be shared. Federal agencies are required to identify their existing  and planned geospatial investments in the clearinghouse, and search  the clearinghouse for cost-saving opportunities before acquiring  geospatial data. In 2003, FGDC created the Geospatial One-Stop to  provide \u201cone-stop\u201d access to geospatial metadata from a centralized  database and search function. In October 2011, the Geospatial One- Stop was retired, and FGDC initiated a pilot project, known as the  Geospatial Platform, which was envisioned to provide shared and  trusted geospatial data, services, and applications for use by  government agencies, their partners, and the public. According to  Interior officials, Interior is the managing partner of the Geospatial  Platform.

For example,  FGDC had developed a metadata standard that included descriptive  information about a dataset\u2014such as the framework theme to which it  relates, the time frame of when the data was collected, and who to  contact for more information that facilitates the sharing of geospatial  data. FGDC had also established a clearinghouse that allowed users to  determine whether the geospatial data (including planned data) they are  seeking exist. As noted previously, the clearinghouse consists of a  centralized repository that contains geospatial metadatafederal agencies, state and local governments, academic and private- sector organizations; and multiple web-based portals from which the  metadata can be searched.", "However, despite this progress, we found that FGDC had not fully  implemented key aspects of activities needed for coordinating  investments in geospatial data. First, although the clearinghouse was  reported to have been modified in May 2012 to allow agencies to identify  their planned investments, as of September 2012, there were no federal  agencies using this function because FGDC had not yet completed and  shared guidance with agencies on how to do so.", "Second, FGDC had not fully planned for or implemented a portfolio  management approach per OMB guidance. Specifically, we found that  FGDC had evaluated the 34 data themes identified in OMB Circular A-16  to determine whether any changes were needed; in August 2011, the  Steering Committee proposed consolidating the 34 data themes into 17  themes; FGDC Secretariat officials subsequently stated that FGDC  agencies were proposing to eliminate one more theme for a total of 16.  We reported that officials further stated that, as of August 2012, lead  agencies had been identified for each of the 16 themes. However, at the  time, the data themes, lead agencies, and datasets had neither been  finalized nor approved, and FGDC had yet to provide guidance to  agencies about how to implement the portfolio management approach.  While Secretariat officials stated that they had developed a draft  implementation plan in November 2011, when we issued our November  2012 report, the plan had not been finalized or approved, and FGDC  Secretariat officials were unable, on behalf of FGDC agencies, to provide  a time frame for doing so.", "Third, FGDC\u2019s strategic plan was missing key components and had not  been kept up-to-date. Specifically, we found that FGDC\u2019s current plan had  been issued in 2004 and included OMB-required components such as (1)  a vision statement, (2) three outcome-oriented goals and 13 objectives to  be accomplished between 2005 and 2008, and (3) a high-level  description of how all but 1 of the 13 objectives were to be achieved.  However, the plan did not include components such as needed  resources, performance measures for 9 of the 13 objectives, or external  factors that could affect the achievement of the plan\u2019s goals and  objectives.

Instead, FGDC officials had been primarily focused on the  development of the Geospatial Platform. As a result, we determined in  2012 that efforts to acquire data were uncoordinated and the federal  government acquired duplicative geospatial data.

In May 2013, OMB issued guidance to agencies on  how to document information on the nature of investments, such as using  common standards, specifications, and formats developed by the  geospatial community, which would allow others to determine the fitness  of the data for their needs.
