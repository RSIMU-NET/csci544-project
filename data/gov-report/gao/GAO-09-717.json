The Department of Labor (DOL) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are to ensure that employers comply with several labor and tax laws related to worker classification. GAO was asked to examine the extent of misclassification; actions DOL and IRS have taken to address misclassification, including the extent to which they collaborate with each other, states, and other agencies; and options that could help address misclassification. To meet its objectives, GAO reviewed DOL, IRS, and other studies on misclassification and DOL and IRS policies and activities related to classification; interviewed officials from these agencies as well as other stakeholders; analyzed data from DOL investigations involving misclassification; and surveyed states."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The national extent of employee misclassification is unknown; however, earlier and more recent, though not as comprehensive, studies suggest that it could be a significant problem with adverse consequences. For example, for tax year 1984, IRS estimated that U.S. employers misclassified a total of 3.4 million employees, resulting in an estimated revenue loss of $1.6 billion (in 1984 dollars). DOL commissioned a study in 2000 that found that 10 percent to 30 percent of firms audited in 9 states misclassified at least some employees. Although employee misclassification itself is not a violation of law, it is often associated with labor and tax law violations. DOL's detection of misclassification generally results from its investigations of alleged violations of federal labor law, particularly complaints involving nonpayment of overtime or minimum wages. Although outreach to workers could help reduce the incidence of misclassification, DOL's work in this area is limited, and the agency rarely uses penalties in cases of misclassification. IRS enforces worker classification compliance primarily through examinations of employers but also offers settlements through which eligible employers under examination can reduce taxes they might owe if they maintain proper classification of their workers in the future. IRS provides general information on classification through its publications and fact sheets available on its Web site and targets outreach efforts to tax and payroll professionals, but generally not to workers. IRS faces challenges with these compliance efforts because of resource constraints and limits that the tax law places on IRS's classification enforcement and education activities. DOL and IRS typically do not exchange the information they collect on misclassification, in part because of certain restrictions in the tax code on IRS's ability to share tax information with federal agencies. Also, DOL agencies do not share information internally on misclassification. Few states collaborate with DOL to address misclassification, however, IRS and 34 states share information on misclassification-related audits, as permitted under the tax code. Generally, IRS and states have found collaboration to be helpful, although some states believe information sharing practices could be improved. Some states have reported successful collaboration among their own agencies, including through task forces or joint interagency initiatives to detect misclassification. Although these initiatives are relatively recent, state officials told us that they have been effective in uncovering misclassification. GAO identified various options that could help address the misclassification of employees as independent contractors. Stakeholders GAO surveyed, including labor and employer groups, did not unanimously support or oppose any of these options. However, some options received more support, including enhancing coordination between federal and state agencies, expanding outreach to workers on classification, and allowing employers to voluntarily enter IRS's settlement program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2007, states uncovered at least 150,000 workers who may not  have received protections and benefits to which they were entitled  because their employers misclassified them as independent contractors  when they should have been classified as employees. According to the  Bureau of Labor Statistics, approximately 10.3 million workers, or   7.4 percent of the employed workforce, were classified as independent  contractors in the United States in 2005, although it is not clear how many  of these workers were misclassified. Misclassification can precipitate  violations of labor and tax laws. Independent contractors are not covered  by many of the labor laws that protect employees and are not eligible for  many benefits to which employees are entitled. Misclassified employees  may not know that they are improperly classified and may not be aware  that they are being denied the protections and benefits to which they are  entitled under federal and state laws. In addition, when employers  misclassify workers as independent contractors, they may fail to pay and  withhold payroll taxes they would otherwise be required to pay and  withhold, and the workers may not be aware of their tax obligations.", "No single agency is directly responsible for ensuring proper worker  classification. Several federal agencies have responsibility, however, for  ensuring that workers receive the benefits and protections to which they  are entitled as employees. The Department of Labor (DOL) is responsible  for ensuring employer compliance with several labor laws, including the  Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA). Other federal agencies  responsible for enforcing laws that provide employees\u2014but not  independent contractors\u2014with benefits and protections include the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission and the National Labor Relations  Board. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is not responsible for ensuring  that employee protections are provided, but is responsible for ensuring  that employers and employees pay proper payroll tax amounts and that  employers properly withhold taxes from workers\u2019 pay. IRS also seeks to  provide general information to employers about worker classification.", "In response to your request, this report provides information on the  misclassification of employees as independent contractors, including   (1) what is known about the extent of the misclassification of employees  as independent contractors and its associated tax and labor implications;  (2) what actions DOL has taken to address misclassification, if any;   (3) what actions IRS has taken to address misclassification, if any; (4) the  extent to which DOL and IRS collaborate with each other, states, and  other relevant agencies to prevent and address cases of employee  misclassification; and (5) options that could help address challenges in  preventing and responding to misclassification.", "To determine what is known about the extent of misclassification, we  reviewed IRS\u2019s past estimates and its plans to update its estimates of the  revenue losses associated with misclassification; analyzed the information  from audits that states report to DOL on the number of employers they  determined to have misclassified employees; and reviewed  misclassification studies conducted by states, universities, and research  institutes. To describe actions DOL has taken to address employee  misclassification, we examined laws, regulations, and agency policies and  documentation; examined summary data from DOL\u2019s Wage and Hour  Division (WHD) on cases involving misclassification concluded during  fiscal year 2008; reviewed select WHD misclassification case files;  interviewed agency officials and investigators as well as employer and  labor advocates; and surveyed states to obtain their perspectives on DOL\u2019s  education and outreach efforts. To describe actions IRS has taken to  address employee misclassification, we reviewed IRS\u2019s strategy for  enforcing rules and regulations related to employee misclassification,  analyzed data from IRS\u2019s enforcement programs related to employee  misclassification, reviewed IRS\u2019s education and outreach activities, and  interviewed independent contractor and labor advocates. To understand  how DOL and IRS cooperate with each other and with states and other  relevant agencies, we examined agency policies and procedures for  referring cases involving misclassification, interviewed agency and state  officials, conducted a Web-based survey of states to determine how they  coordinate with DOL and IRS, and reviewed information from IRS\u2019s  Questionable Employment Tax Practices (QETP) initiative, a collaboration  between IRS and states aimed at increasing tax compliance by employers.  To describe options to help address misclassification, we reviewed GAO  and other federal agency reports and recommendations and other  organizations\u2019 studies on misclassification of employees. We also surveyed  relevant stakeholders to help identify such options and summarize any  related trade-offs.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2008 through August  2009 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives. For more information on  our scope and methodology, see appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In general, employee misclassification occurs when an employer  improperly classifies a worker as an independent contractor instead of an  employee. As we reported in 2006, the tests used to determine whether a  worker is an independent contractor or an employee are complex and  differ from law to law. While laws vary in their definitions of the  conditions that make a worker an employee, in general, a person is  considered an employee if he or she is subject to another\u2019s right to control  the manner and means of performing the work. In contrast, independent  contractors are individuals who obtain customers on their own to provide  services (and who may have other employees working for them) and who  are not subject to control over the manner by which they perform their  services.", "Many independent contractors are classified properly, and the  independent contractor relationship can offer advantages to both  businesses and workers. Businesses may choose to hire independent  contractors for reasons such as being able to easily expand or contract  their workforces to accommodate workload fluctuations or fill temporary  absences. Workers may choose to become independent contractors to  have greater control over their work schedules or when they pay taxes,  rather than have employers withhold taxes from their paychecks.", "However, employers have financial incentives to misclassify employees as  independent contractors. While employers are generally responsible for  matching the Social Security and Medicare tax payments their employees  make and paying all federal unemployment taxes and a portion of or all  state unemployment taxes, independent contractors are generally  responsible for paying their own Social Security and Medicare tax  liabilities and do not pay unemployment taxes because they are not  eligible to receive unemployment insurance benefits. In addition,  businesses generally are not required to withhold the income, Social  Security, or Medicare taxes from payments made to independent  contractors that they are required to withhold for their employees.  Independent contractors may also be responsible for making their own  workers\u2019 compensation payments, depending on their state program. The  differences, in general terms, between the tax responsibilities of  employees and independent contractors are summarized in table 1.", "While businesses may be confused about how to properly classify  workers, some employers may misclassify employees to circumvent laws  that restrict employers\u2019 hiring, retention, and other labor practices, and to  avoid providing numerous rights and privileges provided to employees by  federal workforce protection laws. These laws include    FLSA, which establishes minimum wage, overtime, and child labor  the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Age Discrimination in  Employment Act of 1967, which protect employees from discrimination  based on disability or age;  the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which provides various  protections for employees who need time off from their jobs because of  medical problems or the birth or adoption of a child; and  the National Labor Relations Act, which guarantees the right of employees  to organize and bargain collectively.", "Employers may also choose to misclassify their employees in order to  avoid having to obtain proof that workers are U.S. citizens or obtain work  visas for them. In addition, independent contractors generally do not  qualify to participate in health and pension plans that employers may offer  to employees. Finally, when employers misclassify employees, they may  be able to undercut competitors because their costs are reduced.", "While some workers may agree to be misclassified as independent  contractors in order to be paid in cash, avoid withholding of taxes, or  prevent having to provide proof of their immigration status, other workers  may not realize that they have been misclassified. In addition, they may  not realize that as independent contractors, they are not protected under  many laws designed to protect employees, and that they have obligations  for which employees are not responsible, such as payment of their own  taxes over the course of the year.", "Responsibility for enforcing laws that afford employee protections and  administering programs that can be affected by employee misclassification  issues is dispersed among a number of federal and state agencies, as  shown in table 2.", "Misclassification itself is not a violation of any federal labor law, but it can  result in violations of federal and state laws. For example, DOL\u2019s Wage and  Hour Division (WHD) may cite employers that have misclassified their  employees as independent contractors for violations of FLSA relating to  recordkeeping (not keeping required records for these employees),  nonpayment of the federal minimum wage, and nonpayment of overtime. It  also assesses back wages owed to workers in cases where  misclassification leads to nonpayment of overtime or minimum wage. IRS  can also assess taxes and penalties on employers that it finds have  misclassified employees.", "However, some workers who would otherwise be considered employees  are deemed not to be employees for tax purposes. With increased IRS  enforcement of the employment tax laws beginning in the late 1960s,  controversies developed over whether employers had correctly classified  certain workers as independent contractors rather than as employees. In  some instances when IRS prevailed in reclassifying workers as employees,  the employers became liable for portions of employees\u2019 Social Security  and income tax liabilities (that the employers had failed to withhold and  remit), although the employees might have fully paid their liabilities for  self-employment and income taxes.", "In response to this problem, Congress enacted section 530 of the Revenue  Act of 1978. That provision generally allows employers to treat workers as  not being employees for employment tax purposes regardless of the  workers\u2019 actual status if the employers meet three tests. The employers  must have filed all federal tax returns in a manner consistent with not  treating the workers as employees, consistently treated similarly situated  workers as independent contractors, and had a reasonable basis for  treating the workers as independent contractors. Under section 530, a  reasonable basis exists if the employer reasonably relied on (1) past IRS  examination practice with respect to the employer, (2) published rulings  or judicial precedent, (3) long-standing recognized practices in the  industry of which the employer is a member, or (4) any other reasonable  basis for treating a worker as an independent contractor. Section 530 also  prohibits IRS from issuing regulations or Revenue Rulings with respect to  the classification of any individual for the purposes of employment taxes.  Congress intended that this moratorium to be temporary until more  workable rules were established, but the moratorium continues to this  day. The provision was extended indefinitely by the Tax Equity and Fiscal  Responsibility Act of 1982.", "Federal agencies use different tests to determine whether a worker is an  independent contractor or an employee. IRS uses the concepts of  behavioral control and financial control and the relationship between the  employer and the worker to determine whether a worker is an employee,  while WHD uses six factors identified by the United States Supreme Court  to determine employee status during investigations of FLSA violations.  The complexity and variety of worker classification tests may also  complicate agencies\u2019 enforcement efforts. In addition, states use varying  definitions of employee. For example, according to a report commissioned  by DOL, at least 4 states follow IRS\u2019s test, and at least 10 states use their  own definitions. The remaining states use various definitions that rely at  least in part on whether the employer has the right to control the worker.", "Decisions regarding employee status are sometimes determined through  the courts. For example, in a recent decision, the United States Court of  Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that drivers for FedEx\u2019s  small package delivery unit are independent contractors, and not  employees, and therefore do not have the right to bargain collectively.  FedEx had sought review of the determination by the National Labor  Relations Board that the FedEx drivers were employees and that FedEx  had committed an unfair labor practice by refusing to bargain with the  union certified as the collective bargaining representative of its  Wilmington, Massachusetts drivers. In ruling that the drivers are  independent contractors, the court noted that because FedEx Ground  drivers can operate multiple routes, hire extra drivers, and sell their routes  without company permission, they were not like employees of traditional  trucking companies.", "Legislation aimed at preventing employee misclassification has been  introduced in previous sessions of Congress. At least four bills relating to  employee misclassification were introduced in the 110th Congress. Two of  the bills, both titled the Employee Misclassification Prevention Act (H.R.  6111 and S. 3648), were introduced in the House of Representatives and  the Senate, respectively, to amend FLSA to require employers to keep  records of independent contractors and to provide a special penalty for  misclassification. Two other bills were aimed, in part, at amending the  Internal Revenue Code to aid in proper classification. The Independent  Contractor Proper Classification Act of 2007 (S. 2044) was introduced in  the Senate to provide procedures for the proper classification of  employees and independent contractors, including amending the tax code  and requiring DOL and IRS to exchange information regarding cases  involving employee misclassification. In the House of Representatives, the  Taxpayer Responsibility, Accountability, and Consistency Act of 2008  (H.R. 5804) sought to amend the Internal Revenue Code to modify the  rules relating to the treatment of individuals as independent contractors or  employees, including requiring IRS to inform DOL of cases involving  employee misclassification. However, these bills were not enacted into  law."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Current Extent of Misclassification Is Unknown, but Misclassification Can Be a Significant Problem with Adverse Consequences", "paragraphs": ["Although the national extent of employee misclassification is unknown,  earlier national studies and more recent, though not comprehensive,  studies suggest that employee misclassification could be a significant  problem with adverse consequences.", "In its last comprehensive estimate of misclassification, for tax year 1984,  IRS estimated that nationally about 15 percent of employers misclassified  a total of 3.4 million employees as independent contractors, resulting in an  estimated revenue loss of $1.6 billion (in 1984 dollars). Nearly 60 percent  of the revenue loss was attributable to the misclassified individuals failing  to report and pay income taxes on compensation they received as  misclassified independent contractors. The remaining revenue loss  stemmed from the failure of (1) employers and misclassified independent  contractors to pay taxes for Social Security and Medicare and   (2) employers to pay federal unemployment taxes.", "For 84 percent of the workers misclassified as independent contractors in  tax year 1984, employers reported the workers\u2019 compensation to IRS and  the workers, as required, on the IRS Form 1099-MISC information return.  These workers subsequently reported most of their compensation (77  percent) on their tax returns. In contrast, workers misclassified as  independent contractors for whom employers did not report  compensation on Form 1099-MISC reported only 29 percent of their  compensation on their tax returns.", "Although IRS has not updated the information from its 1984 report, it plans  to review the national extent of employee misclassification as part of a  broader study of employment tax compliance. However, IRS officials  anticipate that the results of this study will not be available until 2013, at  the earliest. As part of its National Research Program, IRS plans to  examine a randomly selected sample of employers\u2019 tax returns for tax  years 2008 to 2010. IRS employment tax officials told us they may need to  extend the study if they have not collected sufficient data to provide  reliable estimates. For the misclassification part of the employment tax  compliance study, they said they hope to estimate the number of  employers that misclassify employees, the number of employees who are  misclassified, and the resulting loss of tax revenue. The officials also said  they are uncertain whether IRS will be able to collect sufficient data to  estimate the extent of misclassification within particular industries or  geographic regions.", "A study commissioned by DOL in 2000 found that from 10 percent to   30 percent of firms audited in nine selected states had misclassified  employees as independent contractors. The study also estimated that if  only 1 percent of all employees were misclassified nationally, the loss in  overall unemployment insurance revenue because of employers\u2019  underreporting of unemployment taxes across all states would be nearly  $200 million annually. In addition, the Bureau of Labor Statistics  periodically conducts a survey of contingent workers (defined as workers  holding jobs that are expected to last only a limited period of time),  including independent contractors. The most recent survey, conducted in  2005, revealed that 10.3 million U.S. workers were classified as  independent contractors\u2014approximately 7.4 percent of all workers.  However, the survey did not indicate how many of these workers were  misclassified.", "State officials we interviewed told us that in their opinion,  misclassification has generally increased over recent years. State activity  in this area may support this view. For example, officials from New  Hampshire\u2019s Department of Labor said the agency recently hired four new  investigators to focus exclusively on investigations of employee  misclassification. Summary data states reported to DOL\u2019s Employment  and Training Administration, which oversees state administration of the  unemployment insurance program, showed that from 2000 to 2007 the  number of misclassified workers uncovered by state audits had increased  from approximately 106,000 workers to over 150,000 workers, as shown in  figure 1. While these counts reveal an upward trend, they likely  undercount the overall number of misclassified employees, since states  generally audit less than 2 percent of employers each year.", "State officials, however, told us that summary data they reported to DOL\u2019s  Employment and Training Administration (ETA) did not include all  misclassification identified by their investigations. For example, officials  from one state said they did not report cases to DOL that did not meet  ETA\u2019s prescriptive audit criteria that mandate, among other things,  extensive testing of an employer\u2019s payroll records. Furthermore, the  official pointed out that the data ETA collects do not include cases  involving workers in the underground economy, where workers are paid in  cash and income is not reported to states or IRS.", "Studies conducted by states, universities, and research institutes have  been generally limited in scope\u2014for example, confined to one state or a  specific industry within a state. However, some of these studies have  noted that misclassification is especially prevalent in certain industries,  such as construction. For example, a study conducted by Harvard  University on the extent of misclassification in the construction industry in  Maine estimated that approximately 14 percent of construction firms  misclassified at least some of their employees each year from 1999 to  2002. Maine state officials told us that following the study, they began  targeting construction firms for their unemployment insurance audits and  found higher levels of misclassification\u2014up to 45 percent of the firms  audited misclassified at least some of their employees.", "Misclassification may undermine workers\u2019 access to protections, such as  unemployment insurance and workers\u2019 compensation. For example, one  group that advocates for workers cited an instance of a construction  worker who fell three stories, was severely injured, and incurred hospital  expenses of over $10,000 related to the injury. Because the worker was  misclassified as an independent contractor, his employer did not provide  workers\u2019 compensation coverage for the employee. Several union officials  told us that misclassification of workers is especially prevalent in the  construction industry where workers are often paid entirely in cash and,  as a result, are not noted on the employers\u2019 records at all, either as  employees or independent contractors. These officials told us they believe  that some employers have been emboldened to begin operating on a cash  basis by the ease with which they are able to misclassify their workers.", "The WHD investigation case files we reviewed provided detail on several  instances where misclassified employees did not receive minimum wages  or overtime pay. For example, one case involved a medical transcription  service that hired workers\u2014whom WHD determined had been  misclassified as independent contractors under FLSA\u2014to work out of  their homes transcribing medical files they downloaded from the  company\u2019s computer system. When the system was not accessible,  workers were not paid\u2014although they were required to remain available  until the system became operational\u2014and, as a result, they were not paid  the minimum wage required by FLSA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOL Has Taken Limited Steps to Detect and Address Misclassification", "paragraphs": ["DOL\u2019s detection of employee misclassification is generally the indirect  result of its investigations of alleged FLSA violations, particularly  complaints involving nonpayment of overtime or minimum wages. WHD  officials have stated to Congress that the misclassification of an employee  as an independent contractor is not itself a violation of FLSA or other laws  WHD enforces. Misclassification, however, is often associated with FLSA  violations\u2014in particular, recordkeeping violations and the failure to pay  overtime or minimum wages. When WHD finds FLSA violations resulting  from misclassification, it assesses back wages owed to workers as  appropriate. In addition, although there is no penalty for recordkeeping  violations, WHD requires businesses to place any workers the employer  reclassifies as employees on the company payroll records, as per FLSA  rules.", "Our review of the case files also showed that WHD investigators, in the  course of their investigations, did not consistently review documents that  could indicate that employees had been misclassified. Specifically,  investigators may ask employers about independent contractors or  uncover misclassification through worker interviews, according to the  information contained in the case files. However, they did not, as a matter  of course, review employer records such as IRS Forms 1099-MISC that  show payments made to independent contractors. Reviewing these  records could aid WHD investigators in identifying workers who have  been misclassified. Although one district director told us it is standard  practice for investigators in his office to ask for this type of information  during an investigation, it is not WHD policy to do so.", "Many of the experts we interviewed said that targeted investigations of  employers or industries could increase the detection of misclassification.  Approximately 80 percent of the investigations WHD concluded in 2008  involving misclassification were initiated because of complaints from  workers about possible labor violations. However, several experts we  spoke with pointed out that some workers, such as immigrants or those in  low-wage industries, are often less likely to file complaints with WHD.  Thus, a lack of targeted investigations coupled with the reluctance of  misclassified workers to complain may result in less effective enforcement  of proper classification. WHD officials told us that their ability to conduct  targeted investigations in recent years has been limited by reductions in  agency resources combined with consistently high levels of worker  complaints about possible labor law violations. According to WHD  policy, the first priority of the agency\u2019s enforcement is to respond to complaints.", "WHD conducts few investigations targeted at misclassification, though it  has begun to place a greater focus on misclassification within existing  agency initiatives. WHD concluded over 24,500 FLSA cases in fiscal year  2008, and misclassification was the primary reason for the violation  identified in 131 investigations. Most of these investigations (80 percent)  were initiated by complaints from workers rather than being targeted by  WHD. In the 26 investigations that were targeted by WHD, the agency  identified 341 misclassified employees who were owed back wages of over  $88,000. In the 1990s, WHD implemented initiatives to conduct targeted  investigations within low-wage industries with a history of FLSA  violations, such as restaurants, hotels, and nursing homes. These  initiatives enabled WHD to detect employee misclassification to the extent  it was prevalent in those industries. WHD officials told us that in fiscal  year 2007, in part because of heightened congressional interest in  misclassification, they instructed their district directors to place a special  emphasis on those low-wage industries within their districts with a history  of misclassifying employees. During fiscal year 2009, for example, the New  Orleans district office planned to conduct targeted investigations of the  staffing and janitorial industries in its region, although it limited this effort  to three investigations.", "Examples of state efforts support the potential effect of targeted  investigations aimed at detecting misclassification. New York\u2019s  Department of Labor has created a task force that conducts investigations  and audits aimed specifically at detecting misclassification. Among other  activities, the task force conducts sweeps, or targeted investigations of  businesses located within a certain area or within industries where  misclassification is prevalent. In conducting investigations during 2007 and  2008 that targeted approximately 300 businesses in the retail and  commercial industries, the task force found that 67 percent of the  businesses were in violation of unemployment laws, labor standards, or  workers\u2019 compensation laws. In addition, at the request of investigators,  the task force scheduled follow-up audits of about half of these employers.  As of December 2008, it had completed 54 of these audits and found in  approximately 70 percent of them that employers had continued to  misclassify at least some employees as independent contractors.", "In addition, the task force conducted targeted investigations of over   600 businesses, primarily in the construction industry. It found labor  violations in nearly half of these businesses and ordered follow-up  investigations. Just over half of these investigations have been completed,  resulting in nearly 7,800 employees being identified as misclassified. The  state determined that the misclassification led to $2.2 million in unpaid  wages, over $3.5 million in unpaid unemployment taxes and associated  penalties, and over $1 million in penalties related to workers\u2019  compensation. As a result of all investigations conducted during a 16- month period ending December 31, 2008, the task force detected 12,300  instances of misclassification, with approximately $12 million in  associated unpaid wages. In contrast, in fiscal year 2008, WHD identified  1,619 instances of misclassification nationwide during its investigations  and assessed about $1 million in unpaid wages.", "DOL has begun to track cases of misclassification in its WHD  investigations database. However, although DOL\u2019s Occupational Safety  and Health Administration (OSHA) may identify misclassification during  its safety and health inspections, it does not record this information in its  inspections database. In addition, in their responses to our survey, a  majority of state workforce agencies noted that their states collect data on  the occurrences of misclassification, but most of those states do not send  this information to DOL. For example, an official in one state agency told  us that in 2008 his state conducted investigations that led to the detection  of approximately 46,000 instances of misclassification, but that DOL  collected no information associated with those cases. Since this  information would likely include the names of employers that  misclassified their employees, and the industries involved, collecting it  could enable DOL to focus its investigations more effectively on certain  employers or industries with a known history of misclassification."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOL Makes Only Limited Use of Education or Penalties to Deter Misclassification", "paragraphs": ["Although education and outreach to workers could help reduce the  incidence of misclassification, DOL\u2019s work in this area is limited.

In addition to publications,  the DOL Web site provides printable workplace posters, some of which  employers are required to display in their workplaces. However, none of  WHD\u2019s posters contain information on employment relationships or  misclassification.", "DOL employees sometimes hand out to workers pamphlets that contain  general information on workers\u2019 rights. Also, DOL staff provides  information materials at seminars and training sessions for employers.  While these materials address what constitutes an employment  relationship, they do not specifically mention misclassification. Similarly,  WHD district directors we interviewed told us that their staffs do not  conduct employer and worker outreach activities specifically on  misclassification. However, some said their staffs may provide information  about misclassification when answering questions from employers or  workers. Finally, an OSHA official told us that the agency does not  conduct any outreach or education directly related to misclassification,  although officials in one region told us that workers were misclassified as  independent contractors at over 80 percent of the construction sites they  inspected.", "According to our survey, few states regard DOL\u2019s efforts to educate  workers and employers on employee misclassification to be effective. In  fact, 16 states had no awareness of DOL education or outreach on the  subject. Of the states that were aware of DOL\u2019s outreach activities, only   5 reported that they thought outreach for workers was effective, and only  6 stated that it was effective for employers. Further, some experts we  interviewed also expressed the view that DOL\u2019s education and outreach  efforts on misclassification are inadequate and that improvement is  needed, especially for vulnerable populations. For example, some noted  that immigrants are less likely to know their rights and are more likely to  be misclassified than other types of workers.", "WHD district directors we interviewed noted that there are challenges  associated with reaching vulnerable populations, such as immigrant  workers. Some noted that many noncitizens, whether documented or not,  are wary of government and therefore reluctant to approach DOL officials  or attend DOL-sponsored events. Despite this challenge, the directors told  us that their offices coordinate with immigrant population communities in  order to educate workers on labor issues. For instance, staff from the  Boston and New Orleans district offices told us they participate in  presentations, information sessions, and forums with the Hispanic  communities in their districts in coordination with the Mexican  consulates.

WHD levied penalties in less than 2 percent of the cases  involving misclassification it completed in fiscal year 2008\u20142 of 131  investigations. In contrast, the division levied penalties in 6 percent of the  cases involving FLSA violations from 2000 to 2007. WHD can only levy  penalties for violations of the minimum wage or overtime pay provisions  of FLSA when the violations are willful or repeated, though a WHD district  director noted that it can be difficult to prove that employers are willfully  misclassifying employees. In addition, although WHD determined that  there were back wages to be paid in most of these cases, we found that  investigators did not always follow up to ensure that employees were paid  the back wages assessed. For example, in one case we reviewed, the  employer did not provide documented proof that she paid back wages of  over $5,000 owed to her employees, but WHD closed the case and  recorded the back wages as paid. Further, WHD officials told us that if the  division uncovers violations caused by misclassification, it does not  generally conduct follow-up investigations to ensure that the employees  are properly classified."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "IRS Has Several Enforcement and Education Efforts That Focus on Misclassification but Faces Challenges in Undertaking These Efforts", "paragraphs": ["IRS\u2019s misclassification enforcement strategy relies on identifying and  examining employers that have potentially misclassified employees. IRS  primarily identifies employers to examine for potential misclassification  through four sources:    The Determination of Worker Status (Form SS-8) Program, in which  workers or employers request that IRS determine whether a specific  worker is an employee or an independent contractor for purposes of  federal employment tax and income tax withholding through the  submission of Form SS-8. IRS examines some of the employers it  determines to have misclassified workers through the SS-8 program.", "The Employment Tax Examination Program (ETEP), in which IRS uses  specific criteria to identify for examination employers that have a high  likelihood of having misclassified employees.", "General employment tax examinations, meaning examinations of tax  returns that are started because of separate employment tax issue that  lead to examinations of classification issues.", "The Questionable Employment Tax Practices (QETP) program, through  which IRS and states share information on worker classification-related  examinations and other questionable employment tax issues. IRS  examines some employers that states have determined to have  misclassified employees.", "IRS\u2019s Small Business/Self Employed Division (SB/SE) conducts the  majority of IRS\u2019s misclassification-related examinations. It made  applicable assessments (taxes and penalties) in 71 percent of such  examinations that it closed during fiscal year 2008, resulting in a total of  almost $64 million in assessments, as shown in table 3. A description of  the four programs though which IRS primarily generates misclassification- related examinations follows table 3. Also following table 3 is a  description of IRS\u2019s Classification Settlement Program (CSP), which  enables qualifying employers under examination for misclassification- related issues to lower their misclassification-related tax liabilities if they  agree to properly classify their workers in the future.", "Through its SS-8 program, IRS provides workers or employers that file  Forms SS-8 with its determination on the correct classification of the  workers in question. IRS also uses the program to identify employers that  may have misclassified employees and therefore would be fruitful to  examine. In fiscal year 2008, 72 percent of all Form SS-8 requests filed  resulted in IRS determinations that the workers in question were  employees, 25 percent were closed without any advice given, and   3 percent resulted in determinations that the workers in question were  independent contractors or had other results. IRS\u2019s SS-8 unit makes these  determinations, in part, using information workers or employers provide  on Forms SS-8. After making classification determinations, IRS sends  letters to employers to provide them with guidance on how to voluntarily  amend their tax returns to comply with the determinations. IRS\u2019s SS-8 unit  then uses specific criteria to determine which cases it should refer for  examination, including the amount of compensation the worker in  question earned, the number of similar workers hired by the employer, and  whether the case likely involves fraud. The majority of employers the SS-8  unit determined to have misclassified employees are very small  businesses, which generally are not referred because examining such  businesses is generally not cost effective. As a result, IRS officials  estimated that for recent tax years, only an average of 2 percent to   3 percent of employers it identified to have misclassified employees  through SS-8 determinations were referred for examination, and an even  smaller percentage resulted in examinations.", "For ETEP, IRS uses a computer matching program to identify annually  employers that potentially misclassified employees. The match criteria  include employers that reported paying compensation to workers (on  Form 1099-MISC), the amount of compensation the workers reported on  their tax returns, and the portion of the workers\u2019 total income that was  paid by the employers. IRS uses these criteria to identify employers to  examine with the greatest potential for tax assessments. IRS officials told  us that generally IRS examines about 1 percent to 3 percent of the  employers it identifies annually through ETEP to have potentially  misclassified employees. IRS does not examine some employers that it  determines based on the ETEP match to have potentially misclassified  employees, such as those that no longer appear to be in business; appear  to have legitimate reasons for meeting the ETEP selection criteria, such as  employers who compensate real estate agents, who are statutorily defined  as independent contractors; or are protected by section 530.

QETP is a collaborative initiative between IRS  and, currently, 34 participating states through which IRS and state  workforce agencies share information on misclassification examinations.  IRS employment tax officials told us that the examination information that  states provide through QETP is especially useful to the agency because it  is timely, making it easier for IRS to contact and collect money from  noncompliant employers.", "In addition to its programs that generate misclassification examinations,  IRS uses CSP to offer settlements to employers that it is examining for  misclassification. Through CSP, which IRS initiated in 1996, employers  under examination that meet certain criteria can lower their  misclassification-related assessments if they agree to correctly classify  their workers in the future and pay proper employment taxes. As of  November 2008, IRS had entered into about 2,800 settlement agreements,  of which about 2,500 involved SB/SE. Employment tax officials in this IRS  division estimated that their CSP agreements signed through the end of  2006 have resulted in at least approximately $76 million in taxes  voluntarily reported by participating employers without further IRS  intervention.

First,  because misclassification is a complex issue, addressing proper  classification can be labor intensive for the IRS officials involved. For  example, in determining whether workers are employees or independent  contractors, IRS examiners must look to the common law, which can be a  complex process. The examiners must collect and weigh evidence on the  related common law factors to determine what is relevant for classifying  each relationship between the respective businesses and the workers in  question.", "Second, given competing agency priorities, IRS has limited resources to  allocate to these programs. With regard to enforcement, it has resources to  examine only a small percentage of the potential misclassification cases it  detects. As shown in table 3, SB/SE completed examinations of less than  1,200 employers in 2008, a very small number when compared to the  millions of small business and self-employed taxpayers in the United  States. IRS focuses its examinations on employers with potential for large  assessments or cases that likely affect a number of workers. To encourage  voluntary compliance, IRS sends SS-8 determination letters to employers,  and has also sent \u201csoft notices\u201d to employers it determined had not  reclassified their workers after receiving these letters. However, IRS  officials told us that SS-8 determination letters and soft notices can be  ineffective if the letter or the notice signals that IRS will not further pursue  the noncompliant employers. For example, according to these officials,  only about 20 percent of employers that are sent SS-8 determination letters  but that are not selected for examination voluntarily comply with IRS\u2019s  classification determination. With regard to education, IRS uses indirect  methods to reach the millions of businesses across the United States, such  as sending correspondence to a large list of contacts in various industries  and posting information in industry newsletters. According to IRS  employment tax officials, information on misclassification is generally  passed down two or three levels in order to reach employers.", "Third, according to IRS officials we interviewed, section 530 is both a  major reason that it cannot examine many of the suspected cases of  misclassification it identifies and an impediment to its ability to educate  taxpayers on misclassification issues, as discussed below.", "Before examining each potential misclassification case, IRS examiners  must verify whether the employer in question qualifies for section 530  protection. This verification process can be time and labor intensive,  because examiners must determine whether the employers in question  meet the three tests for section 530 protection.", "Section 530 also restricts IRS\u2019s ability to issue regulations and Revenue  Rulings with respect to the classification of any individual for purposes of  employment taxes. Because of this limitation, IRS restricts the educational  information it issues to informal general guidance and SS-8 determinations  and rulings, which provide recommendations on how to classify specific  workers. However, as noted previously, applying the classification rules  can be complex. IRS employment tax officials told us that businesses  regularly request IRS\u2019s guidance on how to classify workers. In  accordance with section 530, IRS officials do not answer such inquiries  but instead recommend that the businesses file Form SS-8 requests, which  take time for the businesses to file and for IRS to process. Representatives  of worker, business, and paid tax return preparer groups pointed to a great  deal of confusion about proper worker classification.

WHD officials said they may not provide  referrals to states or other federal agencies because the definition of an  employee varies by statute and the division does not want its investigators  to interpret statutes outside its jurisdiction.

Furthermore, because DOL  conducts limited education and outreach on misclassification, many  workers have insufficient information on employment relationships and  may not understand their employment status and rights. In addition,  vulnerable populations, including low-wage workers and immigrants, may  not know they are misclassified and, as result, may not receive the  protections and benefits to which they are entitled. By not regularly  sharing information on cases involving misclassification, federal and state  agencies are also losing opportunities to protect workers and to make the  most effective use of their resources. Also, because DOL is not working  with states active in this area to identify misclassification, it is not using its  resources most effectively by establishing a collaborative effort between  federal and state agencies to address misclassification.", "Many of the IRS-related options we analyzed to address misclassification  were generally perceived to have merit as means to address  misclassification, but all have some drawbacks, according to those  stakeholders we surveyed. Although several options had support from  many of those who provided input, we had no reliable measure of the  extent of misclassification and did not have sufficient information to  weigh the benefits compared to the drawbacks of the options given the  scope of our work. Even so, qualitative information provided by the  stakeholders can help policymakers and tax administrators judge whether  any of the options merit pursuit.", "Likewise, some actions have potential to address misclassification in a  cost-effective manner while also adhering to IRS\u2019s strategic vision for the  next few years. For example, IRS and DOL can do more to educate  employers and workers. Given that most complaints come from workers,  further educating them about the consequences of misclassification may  be especially useful. Developing a standard document on classification  rights and related tax obligations that all new workers would either be  given by employers or referred to on agencies\u2019 Web sites would be  particularly well targeted. Similarly, IRS could build on its existing state  contacts to resolve current concerns with the QETP initiative, which  mutually benefits both federal and state parties. Regularly collaborating  with participating states can help ensure that issues are addressed by both  IRS and states in a timely manner. Finally, expanding CSP to allow for  voluntary self-correction of classification decisions could prompt  compliance among employers that IRS is unlikely to pursue through  enforcement because of limited resources. Soft notices targeted to  employers that appear to be misclassifying would give them a chance to  self correct before IRS decides whether to examine them and should be  tested to determine their effectiveness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making six recommendations to the Secretary of Labor and the  Commissioner of Internal Revenue to assist in preventing and responding  to employee misclassification.", "To increase its detection of FLSA and other labor law violations, we  recommend that the Secretary of Labor direct the WHD Administrator to  increase the division\u2019s focus on misclassification of employees as  independent contractors during targeted investigations.", "To enhance efforts to protect workers and make the most effective use of  their resources, we recommend that the Secretary of Labor direct the  WHD Administrator and the Assistant Secretary for OSHA to ensure that  information on cases involving the misclassification of employees as  independent contractors is shared between the two entities and that cases  outside their jurisdiction are referred to states and other relevant agencies,  as required.", "To identify promising practices in addressing misclassification and use  agency resources most effectively, we recommend that the Secretary of  Labor and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue establish a joint  interagency effort with other federal and state agencies to address the  misclassification of employees as independent contractors. Because tax  data may provide useful leads on noncompliance, the task force should  determine to what extent tax information would assist other agencies and,  if it would be sufficiently helpful, seek a legislative change through the  Department of the Treasury to allow for sharing of tax information with  appropriate privacy protections.", "To enhance understanding of classification issues by workers\u2014especially  those in low-wage industries\u2014we recommend that the Secretary of Labor  collaborate with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to offer education  and outreach to workers on classification rules and implications and  related tax obligations.

WHD commented that it would reexamine its training  documents and field guidance to ensure that employee classification was  addressed during all stages of an investigation. In addition, WHD agreed to  focus on increasing compliance for workers in industries where  misclassification is prevalent.", "DOL also agreed that there is value in sharing information on cases  involving the misclassification of employees as independent contractors  between WHD and OSHA and with state agencies. WHD and OSHA stated  that they are both committed to working closely together to exchange  information and improve protections afforded workers. In addition, WHD  said that it would assess its current referral processes to ensure that they  adequately provided for referrals to other agencies in cases related to  employee misclassification.", "In their comments, the agencies expressed support for our  recommendation to establish a joint interagency effort to address  misclassification. DOL stated that a joint effort between DOL and IRS may  prove useful in WHD\u2019s efforts to enforce wage and hour laws, and that  WHD would participate in any such interdepartmental effort.

IRS also said it would consider expanding the CSP to employers  not under examination and commented that if it decides to expand the  program, it will consider all options, including issuing notices and soft  letters and soliciting volunteers through outreach and education. We  appreciate that IRS will consider these actions and continue to believe that  extending the CSP to include employers that volunteer to prospectively  reclassify their misclassified employees would be an effective way to  increase proper worker classification and that it would be useful to test  whether sending notices would be a cost-effective feature of an expanded  program.", "As we agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents  of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days  from the date of this letter.

We reviewed IRS\u2019s estimate on the extent of misclassification and  the associated revenue loss for tax year 1984. We also interviewed IRS  officials responsible for planning an update to that estimate. From DOL,  we reviewed a study it commissioned in 2000 on the extent of  misclassification. We also analyzed the information states report to it  regarding their findings of misclassification during their audits of  employers. We analyzed summary data that the states reported for the  years 2000 to 2007. These data included the number of employers in each  state, the number of audits completed, and the number of misclassified  employees identified during these audits. We also reviewed  misclassification studies conducted by states, universities, and research  institutes. Finally, we interviewed officials from federal and state agencies  to obtain their views on misclassification and its consequences for  workers.", "To describe actions taken by DOL to address employee misclassification,  we examined DOL policies and documentation, including DOL\u2019s Wage and  Hour Division\u2019s (WHD) Field Operations Handbook and the Occupational  Safety and Health Administration\u2019s Field Operations Manual. We  interviewed agency officials at the national and district levels, as well as  several investigators from WHD, and spoke with employer and labor  advocates to obtain their perspectives on DOL\u2019s efforts. In some cases, we  relied on interviews conducted for a previous closely related GAO  testimony, issued in July 2008. We also obtained and analyzed WHD data  on cases involving misclassification concluded during fiscal year 2008. We  could not obtain data for other time periods because WHD did not flag  cases to indicate whether they involved misclassification before fiscal year  2008. We assessed the reliability of the data and determined them to be  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. However, because DOL  only flagged cases as involving misclassification when it was the primary  reason for Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) violations, and because WHD  officials told us that not all investigators understood how to properly flag  these cases, this information may be incomplete.", "In total, we examined data for 131 cases involving 1,619 misclassified  employees who were denied payment for overtime or were paid less than  minimum wage. Using these data from the WHD database, we  judgmentally selected 26 case files to review. We selected cases based on  factors such as the number of employees misclassified, the total amount of  back wages computed, whether a single employee was owed over $10,000  in back wages, whether civil money penalties were assessed, and whether  the case resulted from a complaint or was directed by the agency. We  conducted reviews of 13 case files in the WHD New Orleans and Boston  offices and requested copies of the remaining selected case files from  WHD. Because we judgmentally selected these files, our findings from the  reviews of case files are not projectable to all WHD cases.", "To obtain information on state coordination with DOL and IRS, state  perspectives on DOL\u2019s education and outreach efforts, and whether states  collect data on cases involving misclassification, we conducted a Web- based survey of unemployment insurance directors in all states, the  District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. We administered two versions of  this survey: one for states participating in the Questionable Employment  Tax Practices (QETP) program and one for states that do not participate in  the QETP program. After we drafted the questionnaire, we asked for  comments from a knowledgeable official at the National Association of  State Workforce Agencies as well as from an independent GAO survey  professional.", "We conducted two pretests of the survey, one with a state participating in  the QETP program and one with a state that does not participate in the  QETP program, to check that (1) the questions were clear and  unambiguous, (2) terminology was used correctly, (3) the questionnaire  did not place an undue burden on agency officials, (4) the information  could feasibly be obtained, and (5) the survey was comprehensive and  unbiased. We received responses from all 32 states on the survey for QETP  participants, for a response rate of 100 percent. We did not receive a  response from 1 state on the survey for states that do not participate in  QETP, for a response rate of 95 percent. We were unable to contact the  official in Puerto Rico within the study\u2019s time period. Finally, we  interviewed officials in 4 states to obtain more information about their  efforts to address misclassification and, where applicable, reviewed  documentation on these efforts.", "To describe actions IRS takes to address employee misclassification, we  interviewed officials from the employment tax group within IRS\u2019s Small  Business/Self Employed Division (SB/SE), which conducts the majority of  IRS misclassification-related examinations.

SB/SE conducted  all IRS misclassification examinations generated by ETEP and QETP, over  97 percent of the examinations generated by the SS-8 program, and the  majority of general examinations IRS conducted during fiscal year 2008.  We also obtained data from IRS\u2019s Classification Settlement Program. We  assessed the reliability of these IRS data sources and found them to be  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.
