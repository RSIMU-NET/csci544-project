Traditionally, intermediate-level maintenance is accomplished by Navy  intermediate maintenance activities for work that is beyond the capability  or capacity of a ship\u2019s crew. An intermediate maintenance activity tests,  calibrates, and repairs ship systems and equipment, which the ship\u2019s crew  may not have the tools or capability to do. On the other hand, depot work  includes all maintenance actions that require skills or facilities beyond  those of the organizational and intermediate levels.

The  plan was to (1) optimize intermediate-level maintenance through  consolidation of intermediate activities, (2) integrate intermediate and  depot activities to be managed by fleet commanders, and (3) conduct fleet  maintenance using an integrated maintenance process supported by  common business and maintenance procedures. The first phase,  consolidation of intermediate-level maintenance, nears completion. For the  second phase of the program, the Navy has implemented the Pearl Harbor  pilot and may consolidate the operations of the Puget Sound Naval  Shipyard and the Intermediate Maintenance Facility, Northwest (formerly  the Trident Refit Center, Bangor, and the Ship Intermediate Maintenance  Facility, Everett). The third phase, using a single maintenance process for  fleet maintenance, is to be completed in fiscal year 2001.", "Prior to the consolidation, the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and the Naval  Intermediate Maintenance Facility were individual commands with  individual physical plants, organizational infrastructures, and  administrative support services. The shipyard was managed by the Naval  Sea Systems Command and funded through the Navy Working Capital  Fund, while the intermediate maintenance facility was managed by the  Pacific Fleet and financed through direct appropriations. Navy officials  recognized that these different financial and organizational structures  required them to use cumbersome, work-around procedures to share  workloads and resources between the shipyard and the intermediate  maintenance facility. The private ship repair facilities in Hawaii also  complete a small amount of maintenance work for the Navy.", "On April 30, 1998, the Navy consolidated the operations of the Pearl Harbor  Naval Shipyard and the Naval Intermediate Maintenance Facility, including  overhead functions such as engineering, quality assurance, occupational  safety, and administration. Similarly, maintenance shops, crane operations,  and calibration laboratories were also consolidated. Further, the Pacific  Fleet assumed ownership and overall management and financial  responsibility for the consolidated facility, and the Naval Sea Systems  Command continued to be the technical and operating authority. The Navy  named the consolidated facility the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and  Intermediate Maintenance Facility. This consolidation is the Navy\u2019s first  attempt at the full-scale, total merger of two maintenance activities  operating under separate command structures and financial systems.", "To achieve a fully integrated organization, the Navy decided the  consolidated facility should use a single financial structure and selected  direct appropriations instead of the working capital fund during the pilot  period. This decision was based on several factors, including the belief that  the pilot goals could more readily be achieved by using direct  appropriations. The Pacific Fleet was the largest customer of ship  maintenance activities in Hawaii, and most Fleet maintenance activities  (ship repair facilities, shore intermediate maintenance activities, trident  refit centers, and aviation intermediate maintenance departments) were  funded with direct appropriations. Thus, they expected fewer financial  issues using direct appropriations because the Fleet could integrate the  consolidated facility into its financial structure and would not need to  establish another system. Several Navy officials also believed that the  working capital fund included fees and charges that overstate ship  maintenance costs compared to direct appropriations, under which some  overhead is not directly assigned to the cost of operations. On the other  hand, the working capital fund accounts for these costs in an attempt to  identify the full cost of ship maintenance operations. While the level of  resources required to carry out ship maintenance activities is likely to be  similar regardless of whether financed using direct appropriations or the  working capital fund, using the working capital fund a customer is more  likely to be directly responsible for a larger portion of those costs. Use of a  working capital fund better enables Department of Defense (DOD)  components to fully account for their share of the program costs. If Navy  officials decide that direct appropriations are the most appropriate  financial structure at Pearl Harbor after the completion of the pilot, the  consolidated facility would then be permanently transferred from the  working capital fund."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Development of the Pilot Test Plan and Performance Metrics", "paragraphs": ["The Deputy Secretary of Defense required the Navy to develop a test plan  to determine whether the Pearl Harbor consolidation had resulted in an  increased use of personnel and lower overall unit costs than separate  facilities. A panel comprised of officials from the Office of the Secretary of  Defense (OSD) and the Navy selected nine test metrics that represent a  variety of issues and performance indicators for the consolidated facility  (see table 2).", "The Navy used fiscal year 1997 as the baseline for measuring success or  failure of the consolidated facility because this was the last full year the  former Pearl Harbor shipyard and the intermediate maintenance facility  operated as independent activities.

Consequently, we concluded the Pearl Harbor pilot  provided only a general indication that future consolidations would result  in efficiencies largely because of unique aspects of Pearl Harbor ship  maintenance activities and financial management issues. Further, we  reported that OSD and Navy officials had different opinions over the  potential impact of using direct appropriations on the following issues.", "Cost visibility and accountability for consolidated ship maintenance  operations. The Congress established working capital funds to, among  other purposes, provide a flexible funding mechanism that would allow  defense industrial and service activities to operate on the same basis as  the private sector, including the use of standard cost accounting  practices and techniques. According to OSD officials, applying these  practices and techniques has made shipyard costs more visible and  improved the efficiency of operations.", "Naval shipyards and activities remaining in the working capital fund.", "OSD officials were concerned that the Navy had not adequately  addressed the impact of removing all naval shipyards from the working  capital fund. They believed that if the Navy removed the shipyards from  the fund, the Navy would have to request direct appropriations to pay  the cost of the shipyards to transfer from the working capital fund or  other activities in the fund would need to absorb a larger share of costs.", "Ship maintenance activities during periods without appropriations. A  working capital fund is not directly subject to the annual appropriations  cycle and can continue operations without interruption between fiscal  years. Consequently, the former Pearl Harbor shipyard operators were  freed from reprogramming limitations and restrictions applicable to  regular appropriations and were allowed to incur costs without waiting  for enactment of an appropriation. Because this financial flexibility is  considered critical to shipyard operations, OSD officials were  concerned that the Navy had not addressed how eliminating this  flexibility would affect Pearl Harbor operations or future  consolidations.", "Capital improvement program for consolidated ship maintenance  activities. According to OSD officials, an important aspect of a working  capital fund is its capital improvement program. In the case of the  former Pearl Harbor shipyard, it depreciated its capital assets and  collected this expense through the reimbursable rate charged to its  customers. Therefore, the fund had a ready reserve to finance capital  improvements for the shipyard. However, OSD officials were concerned  that future funding levels may be insufficient because of uncertainties in  the appropriation process.", "We concluded that while the consolidation of shipyard and intermediate  maintenance activities offered clear benefits, financial management issues  existed that needed to be resolved for future operations at Pearl Harbor  and in considering other consolidations.

Contrary to the standards to identify the full cost of operations, the  consolidated facility\u2019s systems did not recognize costs if they are paid by  other Navy activities. Pacific Fleet and Pearl Harbor officials stated that  their focus is to manage the consolidated facility\u2019s appropriations and  obligations and to execute the allocated funding within budget authority. In  addition, they stated their belief that their systems and processes are not  required to identify and accumulate data on any costs not paid from the  appropriated funding provided to the consolidated facility. Specifically, at  the time of our review, the categories of costs associated with consolidated  ship maintenance operations that the facility\u2019s systems did not routinely  and systematically identify and accumulate include:  Facilities and equipment depreciation. Depreciation costs are no longer  accumulated because the former Pearl Harbor shipyard and all of its  facilities and equipment are now Pacific Fleet assets that will be  recapitalized through direct appropriations.
