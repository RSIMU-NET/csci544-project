To manage these properties, VA uses land-use authorities that allow VA to enter into various types of agreements for the use of its property in exchange for revenues or in-kind considerations. GAO was asked to examine VA's use of land-use agreements.", "This report addresses the extent to which VA (1) maintains reliable data on land-use agreements and the revenue they generate, (2) monitors the billing and collection processes at selected VA medical centers, and (3) monitors land-use agreements at selected VA medical centers. GAO analyzed data from VA's database on its land-use agreements for fiscal year 2012, reviewed agency documentation, and interviewed VA officials.

For example, one land-use agreement was recorded 37 times, once for each building listed in the agreement, 13 agreements terminated before fiscal year 2012 had not been removed from the system, and more than $240,000 in revenue from one medical center had not been recorded. VA relies on local medical center staff to enter data timely and accurately, but lacks a mechanism for independently verifying the data. Implementing such a mechanism and working with medical centers to make corrections as needed would better position VA to reliably account for its land-use agreements and the associated revenues they generate.", "GAO found weaknesses in the billing and collection processes for land-use agreements at three selected VA medical centers due primarily to ineffective monitoring. For example, VA incorrectly billed its sharing partners for 14 of 34 agreements at the three centers, which resulted in VA not billing $300,000 of the nearly $5.3 million owed. In addition, at the New York center, VA had not billed a sharing partner for several years' rent that totaled over $1 million. VA began collections after discovering the error; over $200,000 was outstanding as of April 2014. VA stated that it did not perform systematic reviews of the billing and collection practices at the three centers and had not established mechanisms to do so. VA officials at the New York and North Chicago centers stated that information is also not timely shared on the status of agreements with offices that perform billing due to lack of collaboration. Until VA addresses these issues, VA lacks assurance that it is collecting the revenues owed by its sharing partners.", "VA did not effectively monitor many of its land-use agreements at two of the centers. GAO found problems with unenforced agreement terms, expired agreements, and instances where land-use agreements did not exist. Examples include the following:", "In West Los Angeles, VA waived the revenues in an agreement with a nonprofit organization\u2014$250,000 in fiscal year 2012 alone\u2014due to financial hardship. However, VA policy does not allow revenues to be waived.", "In New York, one sharing partner\u2014a local School of Medicine\u2014with seven expired agreements remained on the property and occupied the premises without written authorization during fiscal year 2012.", "The City of Los Angeles has used 12 acres of VA land for recreational use since the 1980s without a signed agreement or payments to VA.

Since the  1990s, VA\u2019s portfolio has been shaped by changes to its organizational  mission\u2014transitioning from predominately hospital-based care to  outpatient-based services for veterans and their families. As a result of  this organizational transformation and other factors, millions of square  feet of VA\u2019s property at its medical facilities and centers in the past was  underutilized or vacant.with this portfolio, Congress provided VA with several legal authorities  that enable the department to enter into agreements with public or private  entities for the use of its underutilized or vacant property in exchange for  cash or some other benefit. For instance, VA has authority to enter into a  particular type of lease, called an enhanced-use lease (EUL), which  allows the agency to enter into long-term agreements with public and  private entities for the use of VA property, resulting in cash or in-kind  consideration for VA. Additionally, VA has authority to enter into sharing  agreements with entities to provide the use of VA space for the benefit of   To effectively manage the challenges associated  veterans or nonveterans in exchange for payment or services. Other  authorities include outleases, licenses, and permits.", "In exchange for use of the space, VA receives revenue, or in-kind  considerations, or both. The in-kind considerations can be used to offset  the costs of maintaining its property through cost avoidance or savings, or  to enhance the availability of the services it offers to veterans or its  employees. Examples of the benefits derived from leasing its property  can include providing additional care options to homeless veterans,  making parking available for veterans seeking treatment, and providing  child-care services for VA employees and others. VA agreements may  also offer benefits to the community as a whole, such as recreational  facilities and credit unions. However, while VA\u2019s underutilized and vacant  space can be leased for the benefit of veterans or the public at large,  VA\u2019s policy is to prioritize making agreements that in no way result in a  diminution of services for veterans and also focus on providing supportive  housing or service centers for homeless veterans.", "For all federal agencies, including VA, we have identified the  management of real federal property as a high-risk area and have  included it on GAO\u2019s High-Risk List since 2003. In February 2013, we reported that federal departments and agencies have given high-level  attention to this issue and have made progress in real property  management. However, the underlying challenges remain. Specifically,  the government continues to lack consistent, accurate, and useful data to  support decision making. Likewise, the VA Office of Inspector General  (IG) reported in February and September 2012 that VA could improve its  monitoring and oversight of EUL agreements. Specifically, the IG found  that the EUL agreements were not always effectively monitored in a way  that served the best interests of veterans and the department.  Additionally, the IG found that VA could not fully determine the  effectiveness of leased space due to inaccurate reporting on benefits, and  that decision making by local VA staff sometimes lacked transparency.

These sites were selected because they  had among the largest number of agreements or highest amount of  estimated revenue maintained in CAI. Our testing of the existence and   We took steps to assess the reliability of the  completeness of VA land-use agreement records determined that VA  records were neither accurate nor complete, as discussed later in this  report. As such, we determined that while the CAI data were reliable  enough to select our three sites for review, the data were not sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of reporting the total number of agreements held  by VA and the revenue those agreements generated in fiscal year 2012  for this audit.", "Over the course of this engagement, we visited the three selected sites to  corroborate some of the data maintained in CAI and to accomplish other  audit objectives. During these site visits, our overall approach included  interviewing local medical center officials such as medical facilities\u2019  directors, contracting officials, and fiscal officials. With our interviews, we  made inquiries on VA\u2019s processes and controls related to the billing and  collection of its revenues, and tested billing and collections on fiscal year  2012 land-use agreements provided to us by the medical centers. Finally,  we toured the facilities and recorded our observations about the space  relative to the terms as documented in the agreements.", "To determine the extent to which VA monitors the billing and collection  processes at selected VA medical centers, we examined VA policies and  procedures as they relate to billing and collections of land-use  agreements, interviewed VA officials responsible for billing and collecting  revenues from land-use agreements at the three selected sites (New York  City, New York; North Chicago, Illinois; and West Los Angeles, California)  and reviewed all billing and collection documents associated with the  land-use agreements at those sites.

Federal internal control standards state that for an effectively  designed control system, key duties and responsibilities need to be  divided or segregated among different people to reduce the risk of error  or fraud. These controls should include separating the responsibilities  for authorizing transactions, processing and recording them, reviewing  them, and accepting any acquired assets. Without proper segregation of  duties, risk of errors, improper transactions, and fraud increases.  According to West Los Angeles officials, the medical center is considering  steps to correct the segregation of duties issue by assigning certain  duties to the fiscal office. However, the West Los Angeles site did not  provide any details on the steps it would take or the timeline it would  follow to implement these actions.

According to this same official, the waiver for  the rental provision may have occurred in the late 2000s due to the  nonprofit experiencing financial hardship.of the VA solicitation for award, demonstrating financial viability was  one of the criteria considered in evaluating this partner. Further, VA  policy requires the monitoring of sharing agreements and does not  have a provision that allows for the waiving of such revenues.

VA\u2019s system for managing its  numerous land-use agreements, including its system for recording  associated revenues and benefits, is in need of corrective action.  Because we found that the VHA data maintained in CAI are unreliable,  these data cannot be used to accurately and reliably manage the bulk of  VA\u2019s land-use agreements as intended.

As noted in  our report, deficiencies in its monitoring of the billing and collection of  revenues have impaired VA in the timely collection of all revenues due  from its sharing partners and the proper recording of the revenues to its  medical-care appropriations account at one of the medical centers. In  addition, VA did not have mechanisms in place at two medical centers to  ensure that different individuals charged with the responsibility of  executing and managing agreements and collecting revenues worked  together in a collaborative manner. Further, VA lacked adequate  processes that enabled it to readily access land-use agreements and  perform monitoring of the execution of its land-use agreements at two of  the three selected sites, which resulted in land-use agreement terms not  being properly documented in writing or being enforced by VA and the  failure to execute renewals when the agreements have expired. The  ineffective monitoring of land-use agreements at the VA medical centers  is further exacerbated by the lack of any detailed guidance by VA on how  to manage the expiration of land-use agreements. Finally, the lack of  appropriately segregated duties at its West Los Angeles medical center is  also problematic and needs to be immediately addressed; however,  officials at that medical center have not developed a plan for doing so.  This lapse of a key internal control increases the likelihood that revenues  from land-use agreements may be vulnerable to potential fraud and  abuse.
