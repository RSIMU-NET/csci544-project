GAO was asked to determine (1) the extent of debt of separated battle-injured soldiers and deceased Army soldiers who served in the GWOT, (2) the impact of DOD debt collection action on separated battle-injured and deceased soldiers and their families, and (3) ways that Congress could make the process for collecting these debts more soldier friendly."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Pay problems rooted in the complex, cumbersome processes used to pay Army soldiers from their initial mobilization through active duty deployment to demobilization have generated military debts. As of September 30, 2005, nearly 1,300 separated Army GWOT soldiers who were injured or killed during combat in Iraq and Afghanistan had incurred over $1.5 million in military debt, including almost 900 battle-injured soldiers with debts of $1.2 million and about 400 soldiers who died in combat with debts of $300,000. As a policy, DOD does not pursue collection of debts of soldiers who were killed in combat. However, hundreds of battle-injured soldiers experienced collection action on their debts. The extent of these debts may be greater due to incomplete reporting. GAO's case studies of 19 battle-injured soldiers showed that collection action on military debts resulted in significant hardships to these soldiers and their families. For example, 16 of the 19 soldiers were unable to pay their basic household expenses; 4 soldiers were unable to obtain loans to purchase a car or house or meet other needs; and 8 soldiers' debts were offset against their income tax refunds. In addition, 16 of the 19 case study soldiers had their debts reported to credit bureaus and 9 soldiers were contacted by private collection agencies. Due to concerns about soldier indebtedness resulting from pay-related problems during deployments, Congress recently gave the Service Secretaries authority to cancel some GWOT soldier debts. Because of restrictions in the law, debts of injured soldiers who separated at different times can be treated differently. For example, soldiers who separated more than 1 year ago are not eligible for debt relief and soldiers who paid their debts are not eligible for refunds. Further, because this authority expires in December 2007, injured soldiers and their families could face bad credit reports, visits from collection agents, and tax refund offsets in the future."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Army continues to mobilize tens of thousands of soldiers each year in  The Army continues to mobilize tens of thousands of soldiers each year in  support of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT).

To determine the effect of debt collection action on separated battle- injured soldiers and their families, we invited soldiers to contact us and  discuss their experience with Army debts. We prepared case studies  summarizing our interviews with soldiers or family members. Where we  were unable to independently validate our case study information, we  attributed it to the soldiers and family members. We based our discussion  of ways in which the debt collection process can be made more soldier  friendly on our previous Army pay and travel-related reports; our review of  applicable laws and regulations and DOD and Army policies and  procedures; discussions with key Army, DFAS, DOD, and Treasury  officials; and our interviews of case study soldiers and their families.

In addition, 3 soldiers told us that they were  erroneously identified as AWOL by their units while they were actually in  the hospital or receiving outpatient care for their war injuries.

The first soldier, case study #1, battled for 1-1/2  years after he separated from the service to resolve his debts and obtain a  reimbursement related to travel expense during his deployment.", "Soldier Engages in 1-1/2 Year Battle to Resolve Debts  An Army Reserve Staff Sergeant who lost his leg in a roadside bomb explosion near the  town of Ramadi, Iraq, on July 14, 2003, found himself involved in a lengthy effort to  resolve pay-related debts after he separated from the Army in August 2004. The  Sergeant\u2019s Army debt was the only unpaid debt on his credit report. The first problem  occurred in August 2004, when the Army failed to terminate the soldier\u2019s active duty pay  after he separated from military service, resulting in an overpayment of $2,728. Because  the soldier was still owed his final separation pay of $2,230, this amount was used to  offset his debt, reducing it to $498. The Army also incorrectly billed the soldier for several  months of Servicemen\u2019s Group Life Insurance (SGLI) premiums, which should have  ceased when the soldier left the service. In attempting to correct the SGLI billings, the  soldier\u2019s account was mistakenly reactivated in the pay system because a Fort Belvoir  finance clerk did not know how to handle this transaction. As a result, the system then  generated an erroneous pay check to the soldier totaling $1,733, increasing his debt to  $2,231. According to the soldier, around the same time, in January 2005, an Army  headquarters official contacted him to say his debt had been resolved, leading the soldier  to believe that the $1,733 payment was the result of his pay audit and possibly included  his unpaid travel reimbursement. However, shortly thereafter, the soldier began receiving  debt collection letters from DFAS for the $2,231 debt, which also appeared on his credit  report. The soldier appealed this debt and requested a waiver, but was turned down due  to a ruling that he should have known that he was not entitled to another pay check once  he had been out of the service for 4 months. Because lenders view unpaid federal debts  as a significant problem, the soldier and his wife decided to forego applying for a loan to  purchase a house until his Army debt was resolved.", "According to DFAS officials, it took about 6 months to research changes in the soldier\u2019s  duty status and pay the soldier\u2019s travel reimbursement. Because the soldier had not been  issued any orders after his initial deployment, DFAS had to work with the Army to prepare  and backdate military orders for each change of status from the time the soldier was  medically evacuated to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, transferred to  Walter Reed Army Medical Center, in Washington, D.C., and entered into the Medical  Retention Program. In addition, we learned that the soldier also received erroneous  monthly billings for Survivor Benefit Program (SBP) premiums\u2014even though he and his  wife had declined participation in writing, as required, when he separated. The monthly  SBP billings continued because Walter Reed had not forwarded the soldier\u2019s paperwork to  the SBP program office at DFAS Cleveland. In December 2005, the soldier\u2019s second,  more detailed request for debt waiver was accepted. In addition, his travel voucher was  approved and he received his contingency travel reimbursement of $2,727\u2014an amount  that exceeded his debt by almost $500. However, the soldier\u2019s SBP program election was  not properly canceled because a change was made to only one of two codes that needed  to be changed in the system. As a result, the soldier\u2019s final debt was not corrected until  February 2006\u20141-1/2 years after he separated.", "Case study #2 involved a seriously injured Army National Guard soldier  who went without pay for several months when his separation paperwork  was not entered in the pay and personnel systems.", "Brain-Damaged Soldier Goes without Pay Due to Error  This Army National Guard Staff Sergeant was injured 3 months after being deployed to  Iraq, when his Humvee was hit by another truck during an attack on December 11, 2004.

When the sergeant suddenly  received no income in October 2005, he learned that he owed the Army a debt of $6,400  and that the paperwork to start his disability benefits had not been processed. About this  time, a finance clerk noted that the sergeant had not been paid for his unused leave.

As a result of this contact, the soldier learned that her Army unit had lost track of her and  had reported her as AWOL while she was being treated for her battle injuries.

However, unlike the authority granted to provide debt relief  for Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, the Secretary\u2019s discretion under  the fiscal year 2006 authorization act is generally more limited. For  example, the Secretary was not given authority to issue refunds and he can  not uniformly provide debt relief to all GWOT soldiers.

However, the remission authority in the act does not cover  soldiers who were released from active duty more than 1 year ago and the  waiver authority does not cover cancellation of debts due to error after the  applicable 3-year statute of limitations.

The best solution to  this problem is for DOD to prevent debts for these soldiers from  happening in the first place, and our past reports have included numerous  recommendations for correcting weaknesses in Army payroll systems and  processes. Over the past year, DOD and the Army have taken a number of  actions to identify and relieve debts of separated battle-injured GWOT  soldiers, and Congress has enacted broader authority for relief of some  soldier debts. There are additional actions available to Congress if it  wishes to make debt relief more soldier friendly. Because of a restriction  in the current law, injured Army GWOT soldiers who separated from the  service at different times have been treated differently, which raises  questions of equity. Some of these soldiers may obtain debt relief, while  others may not. Further, there is no current authority to issue refunds to  battle-injured soldiers who previously paid debts that are now eligible for  relief. Because the current debt relief authority expires on December 31,  2007, injured soldiers and their families who have GWOT-incurred military  debts could face the prospect of bad credit reports, visits by collection  agencies, and offsets of their tax refunds if the authority is not available  throughout the OIF/OEF deployment and a reasonable period after the  deployment ends."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["There are several matters that Congress should consider if it wishes to  strengthen the Secretary\u2019s authority to provide debt relief so that it can be  applied uniformly for all GWOT-incurred debt.

These laws and related federal regulations  establish authority for the Department of Defense (DOD) and the  Department of the Treasury to engage in federal debt collection actions.", "Out-of-service soldier debts occur when a soldier has separated from the  service and is not receiving salary or other payments from the department  that can be offset to collect debt owed to a defense agency or military  service. DOD is authorized to write off debts of fallen soldiers; however, it  may pursue collection of other deceased soldiers\u2019 debts. Out-of-service  debts arise from a large number of circumstances, including overpayments  of pay and allowances (entitlements), such as hostile fire pay, hazardous  duty pay, and family separation pay; travel advances for which expense  vouchers have not been submitted; indebtedness related to public use of  the DOD facilities or services, such as family medical services; and loss or  damage of government property.

Soldier records are identified by soldier name and  social security number in both the WIA databases and DDMS. The data  used in our audit covered fiscal years 2002 through 2005\u2014the first 4 years  of the Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom  deployments.", "We assessed the reliability of data obtained from the WIA databases and  the DDMS systems by obtaining an understanding of the processes used to  collect and report the data, verifying control totals of data extracted and  used for file comparisons, validating the computer program used to  perform the file comparison, asking systems officials to complete our data  reliability questionnaire, and analyzing selected transaction data for  accuracy. We also considered findings and recommendations related to  payroll problems and unidentified soldier debt in our previous audits and  our recent Fort Bragg investigation. DFAS and the Army have  implemented procedures for reviewing and correcting soldier status and  pay account information in the WIA databases and DDMS data is subjected  to periodic DOD audits.", "To determine the impact of debt collection actions on Army battle-injured  and fallen soldiers and their families, we reached out to WIA soldiers and  invited soldiers to contact us and share their experience. We focused on  soldiers whose debts had been reported to credit bureaus and collection  agencies. We were contacted by 19 separated battle-injured Army GWOT  soldiers. We used the experiences of these soldiers to illustrate the  hardships posed by debt collection action on battle-injured soldiers and  their families. For all of the soldiers with debt problems who contacted us,  we worked with the Army and DFAS to help resolve their debts. Where we  were unable to independently validate our case study information, we  attributed it to the soldiers and family members. We analyzed the DDMS  data to confirm management assertions that DFAS does not pursue  collection of debts of fallen soldiers.", "To determine ways that Congress could help make the debt collection  process more soldier friendly, we considered debt relief provisions in  current law, DOD and Army policy, and the experience of soldiers who  contacted us as well as information obtained for case studies included in  our prior reports.
