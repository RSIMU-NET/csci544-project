OSHA has established a number of programs, including the Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP), that take a cooperative approach to obtaining compliance with safety and health regulations and OSHA's standards. OSHA established the VPP in 1982 to recognize worksites with exemplary safety and health programs. GAO was asked to review (1) the number and characteristics of employer worksites in the VPP and factors that have influenced growth, (2) the extent to which OSHA ensures that only qualified worksites participate in the VPP, and (3) the adequacy of OSHA's efforts to monitor performance and evaluate the effectiveness of the VPP. GAO analyzed OSHA's VPP data, reviewed a representative sample of VPP case files, and interviewed agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The VPP has grown steadily since its inception in 1982, with the number of employer worksites in the program more than doubling--from 1,039 sites in 2003 to 2,174 sites in 2008. Although industries represented have not changed significantly, with the chemical industry having the largest number of sites in the VPP, the number of sites in the motor freight transportation industry--which includes U.S. Postal Service sites--increased tenfold from 2003 to 2008. The proportion of smaller VPP sites--those with fewer than 100 workers--increased from 28 percent in 2003 to 39 percent in 2008. Key factors influencing growth of the VPP have been OSHA's emphasis on expansion of the program and VPP participants' outreach to other employers. OSHA's internal controls are not sufficient to ensure that only qualified worksites participate in the VPP. The lack of a policy requiring documentation in VPP files regarding follow-up actions taken in response to incidents, such as fatalities and serious injuries, at VPP sites limits the national office's ability to ensure that its regions have taken the required actions. Such actions include reviewing sites' safety and health systems and determining whether sites should remain in the program. GAO reviewed OSHA's VPP files for the 30 sites that had fatalities from January 2003 to August 2008 and found that the files contained no documentation of actions taken by the regions' VPP staff. GAO interviewed regional officials and reviewed the inspection files for these sites and found that some sites had safety and health violations related to the fatalities, including one site with seven serious violations. As a result, some sites that no longer met the definition of an exemplary worksite remained in the VPP. In addition, OSHA's oversight is limited because it does not have internal controls, such as reviews by the national office, to ensure that regions consistently comply with VPP policies for monitoring sites' injury and illness rates and conducting on-site reviews. For example, the national office has not ensured that regions follow up as required when VPP sites' injury and illness rates rise above the minimum requirements for the program, including having sites develop plans for reducing their rates. Finally, OSHA has not developed goals or measures to assess the performance of the VPP, and the agency's efforts to evaluate the program's effectiveness have been inadequate. OSHA officials said that low injury and illness rates are effective measures of performance. These rates, however, may not be the best measures because GAO found discrepancies between the rates reported by worksites annually to OSHA and the rates OSHA noted during its on-site reviews. In addition, OSHA has not assessed the impact of the VPP on sites' injury and illness rates. In response to a recommendation in a GAO report issued in 2004, OSHA contracted with a consulting firm to conduct a study of the program's effectiveness. However, flaws in the design of the study and low response rates made it unreliable as a measure of effectiveness. OSHA officials acknowledged the study's limitations but had not conducted or planned other evaluations of the VPP."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2007, more than 5,800 workers in the United States died of work-related  injuries, and a reported 4 million workers were injured or became ill on  the job.

OSHA helps ensure the safety and health of the over 112.5 million  private sector workers at the approximately 8.6 million worksites  nationwide by setting safety and health standards and inspecting  worksites. OSHA has also established a number of programs, including the  Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP), designed to reduce work-related  fatalities, injuries, and illnesses through labor, management, and  government cooperation. Through the VPP, OSHA recognizes employers  with exemplary safety and health systems and relatively low injury and  illness rates for their industries. OSHA exempts VPP sites from routine  inspections, although these worksites are subject to inspections resulting  from fatalities or other serious injuries or complaints from workers about  safety or health hazards.", "At your request, we reviewed the VPP. Specifically, we (1) identified the  number and characteristics of employer worksites in the VPP and factors  that have influenced program growth, (2) determined the extent to which  OSHA ensures that only qualified worksites participate in the VPP, and   (3) assessed the adequacy of OSHA\u2019s efforts to monitor performance and  evaluate the effectiveness of the VPP.", "To conduct our work, we reviewed relevant laws and regulations. We also  analyzed data on the characteristics of all employer worksites in OSHA\u2019s  VPP database. We reviewed the reliability of these data and determined  them to be sufficiently reliable for this purpose. We also compared OSHA\u2019s  VPP policies and procedures with internal control standards for the  federal government. In addition, we reviewed OSHA\u2019s VPP case files for a  randomly selected, representative sample of 184 VPP sites in the federally  managed program as of June 2008. We also reviewed OSHA\u2019s inspection  records and VPP files for all VPP sites at which fatalities occurred from  January 2003 to August 2008. We discussed OSHA\u2019s policies and  procedures and information in the files with officials in all 10 regional  offices. We also reviewed the agency\u2019s performance and accountability  reports and its management of the program relative to the guidelines in the  Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. We conducted this  performance audit from March 2008 through May 2009 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards.

Enforcement represents the  preponderance of agency activity and includes safety and health  inspections of employer worksites. Among its compliance assistance  efforts, OSHA established the VPP in 1982 to recognize worksites with  safety and health systems that exceed OSHA\u2019s standards. A key  requirement for participation in the VPP is that worksites have low injury  and illness rates compared with the average rates for their respective  industries.", "The VPP is divided into three programs (see table 1): the Star, Merit, and  Star Demonstration programs. The Star program has the most stringent  requirements because it is for worksites with exemplary safety and health  systems that successfully protect employees from fatality, injury, and  illness.", "OSHA\u2019s Directorate of Cooperative and State Programs\u2014the national  office\u2014oversees the VPP activities of each of its 10 regional and 80 area  offices. Each regional office has a regional administrator, who coordinates  all of the region\u2019s activities, including the VPP, and a VPP manager, who  implements and manages the program. The VPP manager conducts  outreach to potential VPP sites and encourages participants to continually  improve their safety and health systems. In addition, the VPP manager  coordinates the region\u2019s activities related to the program, such as reviews  of applications submitted by potential sites and on-site reviews of VPP  sites.", "Employer worksites apply to OSHA to participate in the VPP. They must  meet a number of requirements, including having an active safety and  health management system that takes a systems approach to preventing  and controlling workplace hazards. As shown in figure 1, OSHA has  defined four basic elements of a comprehensive safety and health  management system. These requirements must be in place for at least 1  year. In addition, there must be no ongoing enforcement actions, such as  inspections, at the worksites or willful violations cited by OSHA within the  3-year period prior to the site\u2019s initial application to participate in the VPP.", "VPP sites are also required to have injury and illness rates below the  average rates for their industries published by Bureau of Labor  Statistics. These rates must be below the average industry rates for 1 of  the most recent 3 years. VPP sites are required to report their injury and  illness rates to OSHA\u2019s regional offices annually. The VPP managers  review this information and send summary reports to the national office.  For each calendar year, the national office compiles a summary report of  injury and illness rates for VPP sites participating in the program.", "OSHA determines whether worksites are qualified to participate in the  VPP through its approval process, which includes an on-site review of  each worksite. According to OSHA guidance, the regional offices are  required to conduct an on-site review of each potential VPP site to ensure  that the four elements are in place and to determine how well the site\u2019s  safety and health management system is working. As part of these reviews,  the regions are required to verify the sites\u2019 injury and illness rates,  interview employees and management, and walk through the facilities.  This initial on-site review usually lasts about 4 days and involves  approximately three to five OSHA staff, according to OSHA\u2019s VPP policies.  OSHA also uses volunteers from other VPP sites\u2014Special Government  Employees who have been trained by OSHA\u2014to conduct some portions of  these reviews. OSHA\u2019s national office is responsible for the initial approval  of all new VPP sites. VPP sites in the Star program must also be  reapproved every 3 to 5 years after an on-site review is conducted by the  region. OSHA\u2019s approval process is outlined in table 2.", "Once they have been approved, VPP sites must commit to continuously  improving the safety and health of their worksites, maintaining low injury  and illness rates, and reporting annually to OSHA on the status of their  safety and health systems. The VPP sites\u2019 annual reports detail their efforts  to continuously improve and detail the sites\u2019 injury and illness rates.  OSHA\u2019s regional offices review these reports to ensure that the VPP sites\u2019  injury and illness rates have not increased beyond the program\u2019s  requirements. According to OSHA\u2019s VPP Policies and Procedures Manual,  OSHA must request that a site withdraw from the VPP if it determines that  the site no longer meets the requirements for VPP participation. OSHA  may also terminate a site for failure to maintain the requirements of the  program. The national office is responsible for collecting the injury and  illness data reported annually by VPP sites to the regions. If VPP sites\u2019   3-year average rates rise above the average rates for their industries  published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the regions must place the site  on a rate-reduction plan if an on-site review is not conducted that year or  must place the site in a 1-year conditional status if an on-site review is  conducted. The regions must also notify the national office of actions they  take in response to incidents, such as fatalities and serious injuries, at VPP  sites. The regions are required to review sites\u2019 safety and health systems  after such incidents to determine (1) whether systemic changes are  needed to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future and   (2) whether the site should remain in the program. The regions may also  conduct on-site reviews of VPP sites if they determine that the incidents  were related to deficiencies in the sites\u2019 safety and health management  systems.

During this period, the number of sites in the  federally managed VPP, representing over two-thirds of all VPP sites,  increased at a similar rate as the number of sites in the state managed  programs. In 2003, there were 734 sites in the federal VPP and 305 in the  state managed VPP. By the end of 2008, both the federal and the state  programs had more than doubled to 1,543 and 631, respectively. (See fig.  2.)", "Although the industries represented in the VPP did not change  significantly from 2003 to 2008, there were substantial increases in certain  industries. The largest industry in the VPP was the chemical industry,  which accounted for a 43 percent increase in the number of VPP sites,  from 208 in 2003 to almost 300 in 2008. The motor freight transportation  industry, which had only 20 sites in 2003, grew tenfold to just over 200  sites in 2008, due in part to the growth in the number of Postal Service  sites. In addition, the number of sites in the electric, gas, and sanitary  services industries increased from about 50 sites to more than 200 during  the same period. See figure 3 for a comparison of the largest industries  represented in the VPP in 2003 and 2008.", "While 4 federal worksites\u2014including the Tobyhanna Army Depot in  Tobyhanna, Pennsylvania, and the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia\u2014have  participated in the VPP since the late 1990s, the number of federal  worksites increased to almost 10 percent of all VPP sites in 2008. At the  end of 2008, almost 200 VPP sites were federal agencies or Postal Service  sites. The majority of these sites\u2014157\u2014were post offices, processing and  distribution centers, and other postal facilities, while most of the  remaining sites were Department of Defense facilities, such as naval  shipyards, Army depots, and Air Force facilities. In addition, from 2005 to  2008, 7 OSHA area offices in 1 region were approved as new VPP sites as a  result of OSHA\u2019s efforts to have all of its offices participate in the program  so that they could be role models for the federal agencies.", "The average size\u2014based on the number of employees\u2014of VPP sites has  become increasingly smaller in the last 5 years. From 2003 to 2008, the  average number of employees at VPP sites decreased from 501 to 408. In  addition, the median size of a VPP site decreased from 210 to 145  employees. As shown in figure 4, the proportion of VPP sites with fewer  than 100 workers increased from 28 percent in 2003 to 39 percent in 2008.  Across all VPP sites, the number of employees covered by the VPP has  grown to over 885,000 workers.", "A key factor influencing growth of the VPP has been OSHA\u2019s emphasis on  expansion of the program. For example, in 2003, the Secretary of Labor for  OSHA announced plans to expand eligibility for the VPP to reach a larger  number of worksites. These plans included adding more federal sites, such  as Department of Defense facilities and certain types of construction sites.  OSHA\u2019s national office has given each of its 10 regions targets for the  number of new sites to be approved each year. While the regions did not  always meet these targets from fiscal years 2003 to 2008, they generally  increased the number of new sites each year, as shown in table 3.", "Several OSHA regional administrators told us that expanding the program  beyond the current level of approved sites will be difficult, given their  current resources.", "Another factor influencing the growth of the VPP is outreach efforts,  including participants\u2019 outreach to other employers and employers seeking  out the program after hearing about it from OSHA or other employers.  According to OSHA officials and VPP participants, outreach efforts focus  on the positive benefits of the program, including improved productivity of  workers at VPP sites and decreased costs, such as reductions in sites\u2019  workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums due to lower injury and  illness rates. Some employers, such as the Postal Service, also cite  avoidance of the costs of workplace injuries\u2014which the National Safety  Council estimated as approximately $39,000 per year, per incident in  2007\u2014as one of the benefits of participation. In addition, the national  association of VPP participants, the Voluntary Protection Programs  Participants\u2019 Association, contributes to program growth through its  mentoring program in which current participants help new sites meet the  qualifications of the VPP.", "We interviewed employees from VPP sites, and their perspectives varied.  Employees who supported the program told us that the benefits include  having a more collaborative partnership between OSHA, management, and  workers; establishing a \u201cmindset of safety\u201d; and addressing several safety  problems at one worksite that workers had tried for several years to have  corrected. Those who did not fully support the program included  employees at VPP sites who told us that they recognized some of the  benefits of the VPP, but that they had reservations about the program. For  example, some employees were concerned that, after the application  process and initial on-site review had been completed, sites may not  maintain the high standards that qualified them for participation.  Furthermore, some employees said that the injury and illness rates  requirements of the VPP are used as a tool by management to pressure  workers not to report injuries and illnesses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OSHA\u2019s Internal Controls Do Not Ensure That Only Qualified Worksites Participate in the VPP", "paragraphs": ["OSHA\u2019s internal controls are not sufficient to ensure that only qualified  worksites participate in the VPP.

OSHA\u2019s VPP Manual requires  regions to review sites\u2019 safety and health systems after such incidents to  determine whether systemic changes are needed to prevent similar  incidents from occurring in the future and whether the site should remain  in the program. However, the manual does not require the regions to  document their decisions or actions taken in the VPP files, which would  allow OSHA\u2019s national office to ensure that the regions took the  appropriate actions. When fatalities, accidents, or other incidents  involving serious safety and health hazards occur at any VPP site, OSHA\u2019s  policy requires that enforcement staff conduct an inspection of the site. In  these cases, the area director is required to notify the VPP manager and  send a report of the inspection. The VPP manager is then required to  report information on the incidents that occurred to the Assistant  Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health, the Director of Cooperative  and State Programs, and the regional administrator. The decision on  whether to conduct an on-site review after such an incident is left to the  discretion of the regional administrator based on the results of the  enforcement inspection. These reports, however, are not required to be  included in the VPP files maintained by the regions. OSHA has a draft  policy that sets time frames for retention of documents in the VPP files,  but the policy does not contain guidance regarding the types of actions  that must be documented in the files. Some regional VPP officials told us  that they have requested such guidance from OSHA\u2019s national office, but  the national office has not issued a directive on what information should  be documented in the files or on how long it should be retained. The OSHA  official responsible for overseeing the program did not agree with regional  VPP officials, and stated that the VPP Manual addresses the  documentation requirements. However, the manual does not require  actions taken by the regions in response to fatalities and serious injuries to  be documented in the VPP files.", "From our review of OSHA\u2019s VPP files, we found that there was no  documentation of actions taken by the regions\u2019 VPP staff to (1) assess the  safety and health systems of the 30 VPP sites where 32 fatalities occurred  from January 2003 to August 2008 or (2) determine whether these VPP  sites should remain in the program. We obtained information on VPP sites  at which fatalities occurred during this period from OSHA\u2019s national  office. To determine what actions were taken in response to the fatalities,  we interviewed regional VPP staff and reviewed the regions\u2019 inspection  and VPP files for the sites with fatalities. Although the actions taken by the  regional VPP staff were not documented in the VPP files, we reviewed the  inspection files and interviewed the VPP staff to determine the actions  they took in response to the fatalities. The VPP managers told us that  they placed 5 of the 30 sites on 1-year conditional status, and that 5 sites  voluntarily withdrew from the VPP. OSHA allowed 17 of the sites to  remain in the VPP\u2014some in the Star program and some in the Merit  program\u2014until their next regularly scheduled on-site reviews. One of  these sites had 3 separate fatalities over the 5-year period. Another site  received 10 violations related to a fatality, including 7 serious violations  and 1 violation related to discrepancies in the site\u2019s injury and illness logs.  OSHA allowed this site to continue to participate in the VPP as a Star site.  Three sites had not been reviewed by the regional VPP staff because  OSHA\u2019s enforcement staff had not completed their investigations of the  sites. As a result, sites that did not meet the definition of the VPP\u2019s Star  program to \u201csuccessfully protect employees from fatality, injury, and  illness\u201d have remained in the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OSHA\u2019s Internal Controls Do Not Ensure That Its Regional Offices Comply with VPP Policies", "paragraphs": ["OSHA\u2019s oversight of the VPP is limited because it does not have internal  controls, such as management reviews by the national office, to ensure  that its regions consistently comply with VPP policies for verifying sites\u2019  injury and illness rates and conducting on-site reviews. Although having  relatively low injury and illness rates are key criteria for program  participation, the regions do not always verify sites\u2019 rates according to  OSHA\u2019s policies. For example, the VPP Manual requires that, prior to  conducting an on-site review, the region must obtain written approval  from the national office allowing access to medical information related to  injuries and illnesses at the site. However, our review of the VPP files and  information from OSHA\u2019s national office showed that, for almost 80  percent of the cases, regions did not obtain such written approval prior to  conducting their on-site reviews. As a result, the regions did not have  access to workers\u2019 medical records needed to verify sites\u2019 injury and  illness rates, and the national office had no assurance that the regions  verified these rates as required.", "In addition, OSHA\u2019s national office did not review the actions taken by the  regions to ensure that they followed up when VPP sites\u2019 injury and illness  rates rose above the minimum requirements for the program. From our  review of OSHA\u2019s 2007 summary report of injury and illness rates for VPP  sites, we found that, for 12 percent of the sites, at least one of their 3-year  average injury and illness rates was higher than the average injury and  illness rates for their industries. For example, one VPP site reported a 3- year average injury and illness rate of 10.0, which was 7.6 points higher  than the industry average of 2.4. Similarly, another site\u2019s 3-year average  injury and illness rate was 7.5 points higher than the industry average. We  found that this site\u2019s injury and illness rate had also been above the  industry averages for each of the previous 4 years, yet it remained in the  VPP Star program. OSHA\u2019s national office does not require regions to  report information on actions taken to ensure that sites lower their injury  and illness rates when these rates rise above the industry averages. The  national office, therefore, cannot ensure that the regions take action as  required. As a result, some sites that have not met a key requirement of the  VPP have remained in the program.", "Finally, some regions conducted less comprehensive reviews of VPP sites  than those required by the VPP Manual. In an effort to leverage its limited  resources, OSHA permitted two regions to conduct abbreviated on-site  reviews as part of a pilot program in which the regions were allowed to  evaluate only one or two elements of sites\u2019 safety and health management  systems, rather than all four elements. From our review of the VPP files,  we estimated that, from 2000 to 2006, OSHA conducted abbreviated on-site  reviews of almost 10 percent of its sites. As a result, some sites for which  OSHA reviewed only two of the four elements may not have met all of the  minimum requirements to participate in the program. According to the  OSHA official responsible for managing the VPP, the agency discontinued  its use of these abbreviated reviews after learning from the pilot that it is  difficult to isolate certain program elements, and that evaluating only one  or two elements leaves out key aspects of the program because the four  elements are interrelated."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OSHA Has Not Adequately Assessed the Performance of the VPP or Evaluated Its Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["OSHA\u2019s efforts to assess the performance of the VPP and evaluate its  effectiveness are not adequate.

OSHA officials told us that, while they have not  established specific goals for the VPP, the best measure of program  performance is that VPP participants consistently report average injury  and illness rates that are about 50 percent below their industries\u2019 average  rates. However, these rates may not be the best measure of performance.  First, our analysis of OSHA\u2019s annual summary reports of injury and illness  rates for 2003 through 2007 showed that, for 35 percent of the sites in our  sample for which data were available, there were discrepancies between  the injury and illness rates reported by the sites and the rates noted in  OSHA\u2019s regional on-site review reports for the same time periods. For  example, OSHA\u2019s 2007 summary report showed that one VPP site reported  an injury and illness rate of zero, but OSHA found during its on-site review  that the rate was actually 1.7 for the same period.

To obtain  information for this study, The Gallup Organization sent a questionnaire to  all VPP sites participating in the federally managed program. However,  the study had significant design flaws.

However, without a more  reliable evaluation of the program, OSHA does not know whether the  program is effectively meeting its objective of recognizing worksites with  exemplary safety and health management systems that exceed OSHA\u2019s  standards."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["OSHA continues to expand the VPP, which adds to the responsibilities of  staff who manage and maintain the integrity of the program and reduces  the resources available to ensure that non-VPP sites comply with safety  and health regulations and with OSHA\u2019s standards. In the absence of  policies that require its regional offices to document information regarding  actions taken in response to fatalities and serious injuries at VPP sites,  OSHA cannot ensure that only qualified sites participate in the program. In  addition, some sites with serious safety and health deficiencies that  contributed to fatalities have remained in the program, which has affected  its integrity. Without sufficient oversight and internal controls, OSHA\u2019s  national office cannot be assured that the regional offices are following  VPP policies. Finally, because OSHA lacks performance goals and  measures to use in assessing the performance of the VPP, it continues to  expand the program without knowing its effect on employer worksites,  such as whether participation in the VPP has improved workers\u2019 safety  and health."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure proper controls and measurement of program performance, the  Secretary of Labor should direct the Assistant Secretary for Occupational  Safety and Health to take the following three actions:    develop a documentation policy regarding information on follow-up  actions taken by OSHA\u2019s regional offices in response to fatalities and  serious injuries at VPP sites;    establish internal controls that ensure consistent compliance by the  regions with OSHA\u2019s VPP policies for conducting on-site reviews and  monitoring injury and illness rates so that only qualified worksites  participate in the program; and   establish a system for monitoring the performance of the VPP by  developing specific performance goals and measures for the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Secretary of Labor for comment.

We reviewed data in OSHA\u2019s VPP database for all sites in the  VPP\u2014both those in the federally managed program and in the VPP  programs managed by the states. We analyzed data on VPP participation  activity from the inception of the program in 1982 through the end of  calendar year 2008. Prior to our analysis, we assessed the reliability of the  information in OSHA\u2019s VPP database by interviewing OSHA officials;  reviewing related documentation, including the data system user manual;  and conducting electronic testing of the data. On the basis of our review of  the database, we found that the data were sufficiently reliable to report the  number and characteristics of participants in the VPP. To determine the  factors that contributed to growth in program participation, we obtained  information about the VPP from officials at OSHA\u2019s national office and the  10 regional offices. To enhance our understanding of the VPP from the  perspective of the participants, we interviewed employees, including  union and nonunion employees at VPP sites as well as employees from  sites that elected not to participate in the VPP.", "To determine the extent to which OSHA ensures that only qualified  worksites participate in the VPP, we reviewed OSHA\u2019s internal controls for  the program and limited our review to VPP sites in the federally managed  program that were part of the Star program. We reviewed sites in the  federally managed program because they represent over 70 percent of the  sites in the program\u20141,543 of the 2,174 sites\u2014and because the policies  and practices for the state managed programs differ from state to state.  We reviewed sites in the Star program because they represented more  than 95 percent of sites in the federally managed VPP at the time of our  review, and because the Star program has the most stringent requirements.  To assess OSHA\u2019s internal controls, we compared OSHA\u2019s VPP Policies  and Procedures Manual with GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government. We also reviewed OSHA\u2019s policies and  procedures for the federal VPP, including (1) procedures for on-site  reviews of VPP sites, (2) annual reporting requirements for VPP sites to  report data to the regions, and (3) requirements for regional offices to  report information to OSHA\u2019s national office. To determine the extent to  which OSHA complied with its procedures in approving initial and  renewing VPP participants, we reviewed OSHA\u2019s VPP files for a randomly  selected, representative sample of VPP sites in the program as of April  2008. Estimated percentages derived from this sample have confidence  intervals of no more than +/- 7 percent. The files, maintained by OSHA\u2019s  regional offices, contained reports of the regions\u2019 on-site reviews of VPP  sites. We reviewed the reports of the reviews conducted prior to the sites\u2019  initial acceptance and, if they had been in the program long enough to be  reapproved, the most recent review conducted. We reviewed the VPP files  and interviewed officials at OSHA\u2019s regional offices in Atlanta, Boston,  Dallas, New York, and Philadelphia. We selected these sites to obtain a  geographic range of regional offices with small, medium, and large  numbers of VPP sites. We interviewed officials in the five remaining  regional offices in Chicago, Denver, Kansas City, San Francisco, and  Seattle by telephone and had them send the VPP files for their sites to us  for review.", "To determine what actions OSHA took in response to fatalities at VPP  sites, we asked OSHA\u2019s national office for a list of all sites at which  fatalities occurred from January 2003 to October 2008. The national office  asked the regions to provide this information, and the national office  provided this information to us. We reviewed the inspection and VPP files  maintained by the regional offices for these sites and interviewed VPP  managers about the actions taken by the regions in response to the  fatalities. Finally, we reviewed other information provided by the regional  offices to the national office, such as data on the injury and illness rates  for each VPP site that are reported by the sites annually to OSHA and  tracked by the national office on electronic spreadsheets.", "To assess the adequacy of OSHA\u2019s efforts to assess the performance and  effectiveness of the VPP, we reviewed its policies and procedures,  performance and accountability reports, operating plans, and The Gallup  Organization\u2019s 2005 evaluation report of the VPP. We reviewed these  documents relative to the guidelines in the Government Performance and  Results Act of 1993. To verify the injury and illness rates reported by VPP  sites to OSHA\u2019s regions in the sites\u2019 annual reports, we compared the data  tracked by the national office on sites\u2019 injury and illness rates with the  rates reported in OSHA\u2019s on-site reviews for the sites in our sample of   184 sites. We assessed the Gallup study on the basis of commonly  accepted program evaluation standards.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2008 through May 2009  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
