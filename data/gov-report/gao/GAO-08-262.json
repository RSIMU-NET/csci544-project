Collaborative resource management is one such approach that communities began using in the 1980s and 1990s. A 2004 Executive Order on Cooperative Conservation encourages such efforts. GAO was asked to determine (1) experts' views on collaborative resource management, (2) how selected collaborative efforts have addressed conflicts and improved resources, and (3) challenges that agencies face as they participate in such efforts and how the Cooperative Conservation initiative has addressed them. GAO reviewed experts' journal articles, studied seven collaborative groups, and interviewed group members and federal and other public officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Experts generally view collaborative resource management that involves public and private stakeholders in natural resource decisions as an effective approach for managing natural resources. Several benefits can result from using collaborative resource management, including reduced conflict and litigation and improved natural resource conditions, according to the experts. A number of collaborative practices, such as seeking inclusive representation, establishing leadership, and identifying a common goal among the participants have been central to successful collaborative management efforts. The success of these groups is often judged by whether they increase participation and cooperation or improve natural resource conditions. Many experts also note that there are limitations to the approach, such as the time and resources it takes to bring people together to work on a problem and reach a decision. Most of the seven collaborative resource management efforts GAO studied in several states across the country were successful in achieving participation and cooperation among their members and improving natural resource conditions. In six of the cases, those involved were able to reduce or avoid the kinds of conflicts that can arise when dealing with contentious natural resource problems. All the efforts, particularly those that effectively reduced or avoided conflict, used at least several of the collaborative practices described by the experts. For example, one effort obtained broad community representation and successfully identified a common goal of using fire, after decades of suppression, to restore the health of a large grasslands area surrounding the community. Also, members of almost all the efforts studied said they have been able to achieve many of their goals for sustaining or improving the condition of specific natural resources. However, for most of these efforts no data were collected on a broad scale to show the effect of their work on overall resource conditions across a large area or landscape. Federal land and resource management agencies--the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service, and the Department of Agriculture's Forest Service--face key challenges to participating in collaborative resource management efforts, according to the experts, federal officials, and participants in the efforts GAO studied. For example, the agencies face challenges in determining whether to participate in a collaborative effort, measuring participation and monitoring results, and sharing agency and group experiences. As a part of the interagency Cooperative Conservation initiative led by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), the federal government has made progress in addressing these challenges. Yet, additional opportunities exist to develop and disseminate tools, examples, and guidance that further address the challenges, as well as to better structure and direct the initiative to achieve the vision of Cooperative Conservation, which involves a number of actions by multiple agencies over the long term. Failure to pursue such opportunities and to create a long-term plan to achieve the vision may limit the effectiveness of the federal government's initiative and collaborative efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For decades, the consumption and use of our nation\u2019s natural resources has  been a source of controversy and contention among many diverse public  and private interests. These interests range from using the resources for  various economic purposes, such as agricultural, residential, or  commercial development, mining, ranching, and logging, to recreational  uses, such as hiking, hunting, and off-road vehicle use. At the same time as  groups with these interests compete with one another to use the resources,  other groups have interests in preserving the resources in their natural  state. Demographic and economic changes across the country have caused  these competing interests to grow increasingly divergent, resulting in  controversy and sometimes litigation. Further complicating the groups\u2019 use  of these resources are ecological problems, such as invasive species, loss  of wildlife and plant diversity, and wildland fires. These problems often  cover a landscape, or a large area of land with a physical environment that  supports distinct communities of plants, animals, and other organisms;  transcend ownership boundaries; and threaten the various groups\u2019 ability  to use the resources, or the overall loss of these resources.", "A current situation, involving 11 western states, illustrates the kind of  conflicts that can occur. A surge in development for such uses as housing,  oil and gas resources, as well as continued livestock grazing, is degrading  vast areas of an important western ecosystem\u2014the sagebrush range\u2014 which supports a wide variety of wildlife species. This has led some groups  to litigate in favor of additional protection under federal law for two bird  species, the greater sage grouse and the Gunnison sage grouse. Similarly,  the effects of development in wildlife migration corridors within the  sagebrush habitat have led hunters and wildlife advocates to seek controls  on such activities in undeveloped corridors. On the other hand, some  developers, ranchers, and oil and gas companies fear that additional  protection would severely limit their activities. More specifically, greater  protection would increase the scrutiny of activities that occur in sagebrush  that have effects on species and possibly curtail development of housing  areas, limit livestock grazing, or restrict oil and gas development activities.", "From past experience, some groups have realized that litigation to resolve  competing interests over natural resource use has undesirable  consequences and may not produce the best results for the parties  involved. Some fear that the initial lawsuit and subsequent appeals can  result in impasse and delay projects or regulations from taking effect.  Moreover, some landowners have realized that, although their land  management objectives may differ from those of other landowners, they  face common ecological problems that can only be solved by working with  other landowners, either public or private. For example, landowners in an  area with an outbreak of a particular invasive species cannot eradicate or  control the species on their land without coordinating with adjacent  landowners because the species may spread from adjacent lands that a  landowner does not treat.", "To develop proactive solutions to common land and natural resource  management problems and avoid the potentially adverse consequences of  litigation, many land managers and interested parties have sought  approaches for more cooperatively resolving natural resource problems  and conflicts. One such approach described by academic, public, and  nonprofit experts is collaborative resource management. This approach  involves multiple parties\u2014including federal land and resource  management agencies, such as the Department of the Interior\u2019s (Interior)  Bureau of Land Management (BLM), National Park Service, and U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service and the Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Forest  Service\u2014joining together voluntarily to identify environmental and natural  resource problems and goals, such as improving natural resource  conditions, and to design management activities and projects to achieve  these goals.", "The collaborative resource management approach\u2014which is also called  collaborative conservation, community-based conservation, community- based initiatives, watershed management, and grassroots ecosystem  management\u2014evolved in the 1980s and 1990s when many grassroots  groups of diverse stakeholders, including federal land and resource  management agencies, organized to focus on local environmental and  natural resource problems. These grassroots initiatives coincided with an  effort by federal agencies to adopt an ecosystem management policy, an  approach that recognized that plant and animal communities are  interdependent and interact with their physical environments to form  ecosystems spanning federal and nonfederal lands. We reported on  ecosystem management as a promising approach for managing federal  lands in 1994 and identified constraints on collaboration among federal and  nonfederal parties as one of the key barriers impeding implementation of  that approach.", "In 2004, to encourage federal agencies to use collaboration and other types  of cooperative management efforts, such as partnerships, in carrying out  environmental and natural resource laws, the President issued an  Executive Order on Cooperative Conservation and designated the  Chairman of the President\u2019s Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to  gather reports on implementation of the initiative. The order also directed  the Chair of CEQ to hold a White House Conference on Cooperative  Conservation. The conference, held in August 2005, highlighted many  voluntary, collaborative groups involved in conservation activities. As a  result of the Executive Order, an interagency policy team and task force  were created; these groups helped organize the conference and respond to  suggested actions for the agencies to take related to partnering and  collaboration.", "In this context, you asked us to determine (1) experts\u2019 views of  collaborative resource management as an approach for addressing  complex natural resource management problems; (2) the extent to which  selected collaborative resource management efforts have addressed land  use conflicts and improved natural resource conditions; and (3) what  challenges, if any, federal land and resource management agencies face in  participating in collaborative resource management efforts and how the  Cooperative Conservation initiative has addressed the challenges.", "To determine experts\u2019 views of collaborative resource management as an  approach for addressing natural resource problems, we interviewed  experts and reviewed a series of journal articles on the subject and  conducted a content analysis of statements taken from the articles on  benefits, practices, and limitations associated with collaboration. To  determine the extent to which selected efforts have addressed land use  conflicts and improved natural resource conditions, we identified seven  examples of collaborative resource management efforts with different  membership, organizational structure, geographic location, and other  attributes and conducted field visits and semistructured, detailed  interviews with multiple members of the groups to gain an understanding  of each group\u2019s efforts and results. We considered conflicts to exist if two  or more participants had different interests to achieve and considered  conflicts to be reduced or averted if the group implemented a common  interest solution. The seven examples and their geographic locations are  shown in figure 1. We also obtained and reviewed any related  documentation of each group\u2019s activities and results, but did not  independently verify these data.", "Finally, we identified challenges associated with the collaborative resource  management approach from our literature review and interviews with  members of the collaborative resource management groups we studied. To  determine how efforts under the Cooperative Conservation initiative  address challenges associated with federal land and resource management  agencies\u2019 participation in collaborative resource management, we analyzed  reports summarizing the White House Conference and interviewed federal  officials, including CEQ and Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  officials. We conducted this performance audit from October 2006 through  February 2008, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Beginning in the 1960s and 1970s as  environmental concerns over species, wilderness preservation, and air and  water pollution heightened and legislation to protect different resources  followed, litigation over land and resource use became more common. In  the 1980s and 1990s, a number of factors, including court decisions and  regulatory and economic changes, resulted in decreased timber harvests  and increased scrutiny of grazing on public lands. In the 1990s, concerns  over pollution and resource problems that cross property lines\u2014such as  water quality or endangered species\u2014increased, and sometimes resulted in  litigation. Also during this time, development of private lands posed  increased threats to habitat, water quality, rural lifestyles, and wildlife,  including threatened and endangered species.", "Over the same time frame beginning in the 1970s, environmental conflict  resolution began to evolve as an alternative way of dealing with  environmental disputes outside of the courts. This approach uses  facilitation, mediation, and other methods to negotiate solutions among  disputing parties. It also involves collaborative efforts to solve problems  and conflicts before they have a chance to fully develop. In the 1990s, as  these alternatives to litigation became more established, two laws were  enacted authorizing their use by federal agencies and the U.S. District  Courts\u2014the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996 and the  Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1998. Also in 1998, legislation created  the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution, a federal institute  to assess, and assist in resolving, conflicts related to federal land, natural  resource, or environmental management.", "Throughout the 1990s, some communities facing natural resource  problems decided to use alternative approaches to solving associated  conflicts, forming grassroots groups of diverse stakeholders to discuss the  problems and develop solutions. The collaborative groups that formed  often included federal land and resource management agency  representatives as participants. Recognizing the value of these groups, the  federal land and resource management agencies began developing  programs in support of such efforts. The agencies have been working  collaboratively with communities for a long while, but placed increased  emphasis on collaboration in the 1990s. Specifically, in 1997, the Forest  Service began a partnership program to gather guidance and information  on how best to work with local communities. In 2003, Interior began an  effort to focus on working cooperatively with local communities on  conservation activities, both on public and private lands. In addition, the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has a program, called Partners for Fish and  Wildlife, to work with private landowners to provide technical and financial  assistance in protecting threatened and endangered species on their lands.", "More recently, the federal land and natural resource agencies have been  authorized by specific legislation to collaborate with nonfederal parties on  specific resource problems. For example, both BLM and the Forest Service  received authority to use stewardship contracts\u2014which allow them, for  example, to use the value of products sold, such as timber, to offset the  cost of contracted services such as removing small trees and brush from  the forest\u2014to achieve national forest land management goals that meet  local and rural community needs.", "In 2004, the President signed Executive Order 13352 introducing the  Cooperative Conservation initiative to increase the use of collaboration  and other processes for managing land, natural resource, and  environmental issues. The order directed the Secretaries of Agriculture,  Commerce, Defense, and the Interior, and the Administrator of the  Environmental Protection Agency to carry out natural resource and  environmental laws in a manner that facilitates \u201ccooperative conservation.\u201d  The order defined this as \u201cactions that relate to the use, enhancement, and  enjoyment of natural resources, protection of the environment, or both,  and involve collaborative activity among Federal, State, local, and tribal  governments, private for-profit and nonprofit institutions, other  nongovernmental entities and individuals.\u201d The Executive Order is being  carried out by CEQ, in its role coordinating federal environmental efforts  and working with agencies in the development of environmental policies  and initiatives. Also involved is OMB, in its role overseeing the preparation  of the federal budget and supervising executive branch agencies. OMB  evaluates the effectiveness of agency programs, policies, and procedures,  as well as ensuring that agency reports, rules, testimony, and proposed  legislation are consistent with the President\u2019s budget and with  administration policies. In addition, OMB oversees and coordinates the  administration\u2019s procurement, financial management, information, and  regulatory policies.", "While collaboration refers broadly to the way different groups work  together to achieve a common goal, collaborative resource management  efforts involve multiple parties joining together voluntarily to identify  environmental and natural resource problems and goals and to design  activities and projects to resolve the problems and achieve their goals. The  federal agencies work with collaborative resource management groups  using partnership tools, which are cooperative or voluntary agreements  among the federal and nonfederal groups to share resources and achieve  the objectives of all parties. Each of the four major federal land and  resource management agencies\u2014BLM, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,  National Park Service within Interior and USDA\u2019s Forest Service\u2014has a  complex mix of legislative authorities that allow it to create and fund  partnerships. In the simplest form, a partnership can exist without any  exchange of funds or items of value from the federal agency to a nonfederal  group and a memorandum of agreement or understanding is used to  describe the details of the arrangements. In cases when federal funds or  property are provided to nonfederal entities as part of a partnership, the  agencies use different instruments such as grants or cooperative  agreements to document the agreement and work to be done.", "Collaborative resource management efforts can involve any mix of the  nation\u2019s 2.3 billion acres of federal, state, local, private, or tribal land.  Historical settlement and development of the nation resulted in the  intermingling of lands among these different entities. As shown in figure 2,  about 60 percent of the nation\u2019s land, or almost 1.4 billion acres, is privately  owned and managed, while more than 27 percent, or about 628 million  acres, is managed by the four federal land and resource management  agencies. More than 43 million acres, representing almost 2 percent of the  nation\u2019s land, are owned and managed by the federal government for  purposes such as military installations and water infrastructure. About 8  percent of the nation\u2019s land, or 195 million acres, is owned and managed by  state and local governments and more than 2 percent, or about 56 million  acres, is held in trust by the federal government for Native American tribes.", "Collaborative efforts are governed by a framework of federal, state, and  local laws, as well as federal Indian law and tribal law, that determine how  management activities, including collaborative management activities, are  carried out. These efforts often involve coordinated decision making for  management activities that the collaborative groups undertake. Each land  and resource manager or landowner, including federal agencies, retains  decision-making authority for the activities that occur on their respective  lands and follow applicable requirements to implement them, although the  federal agencies may work with other group members to develop and  consider plans and gather information and community input. When  collaborative activities occur on private lands, individual landowners make  decisions about the activities that occur subject to applicable federal, state,  and local laws, and decide whether and how to share information related to  their lands with members of the group."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Laws Governing Collaborative Efforts on Federal Lands", "paragraphs": ["Collaborative management activities on federal lands are governed by  federal resource and environmental laws. Overall, the four federal land  management agencies manage their lands for a variety of purposes,  although each agency has unique authorities that give it particular  responsibilities. Specifically, both BLM and the Forest Service manage  lands under their control for multiple uses and to provide a sustained yield  of renewable resources such as timber, fish and wildlife, forage for  livestock, and recreation. On the other hand, the National Park Service\u2019s  mission is to conserve the scenery, natural and historic objects, and wildlife  of the national park system so that they will remain unimpaired for the  enjoyment of current and future generations.

The military  services\u2014the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force\u2014use their lands  primarily to train military forces and test weapon systems, but are required  under the Sikes Act of 1960 to provide for the conservation and  rehabilitation of natural resources on military lands. The power marketing  administrations\u2014which include the Western Area Power Administration,  Bonneville Power Administration, Southwestern Power Administration,  and Southeastern Power Administration\u2014sell and deliver power within the  United States on hundreds of miles of transmission lines across public and  private land using rights-of-way. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005,  transmission owners, including the power administrations, must maintain  the reliability of their transmission systems, which includes establishing  and maintaining the vegetation on these rights-of-way so that power lines  are not compromised. Lines may be at risk from trees falling on them,  electrical arcing from a power line to a tree or other objects in the right-of- way, or forest fires. Other agencies, such as the Department of  Transportation and state transportation agencies, conduct activities that  affect land and resources, and collaborate with agencies such as the U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service to manage the effects on wildlife and habitat.", "Management activities that occur on federal lands, including those  developed by a collaborative group are subject to the National  Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, and the Endangered Species Act  of 1973. NEPA requires that federal agencies evaluate the likely  environmental effects of proposed projects and plans using an  environmental assessment or, if the action would be likely to significantly  affect the environment, a more detailed environmental impact statement.  The scope of actions being analyzed under NEPA may encompass a broad  area, such as an entire national forest, or a specific project such as  treatment of invasive species on several acres of land. The federal agencies  are mandated to include the public in the NEPA process through efforts  such as providing public notice of meetings, making related environmental  documents available to the public, and considering public comments.  Under the Endangered Species Act, federal agencies are required to consult  with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to ensure that any activities they  carry out do not jeopardize the continued existence of a threatened or  endangered species or destroy or harm any habitat that is critical for the  conservation of the species."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Laws Governing Collaborative Efforts on State, Local, Private, and Tribal Lands", "paragraphs": ["Collaborative activities that occur on state, local, and private lands are  subject to state and local laws that provide authority for numerous  agencies to manage state and local lands and programs to protect and  conserve natural resources, as well as generate revenue from these  resources. Many states have trust lands that were granted to them at  statehood by the federal government. These lands, which constitute 46  million acres of the continental United States, are typically managed to  produce revenue for beneficiaries such as schools and other public  institutions. As a result, the primary uses of these state lands are activities  that may generate revenue such as livestock grazing, oil and gas leasing,  hard rock mining, and timber. In addition, states regulate land and natural  resource use through a variety of programs, such as wildlife management  or forestry programs. Each state manages fish and wildlife through various  programs, and these state wildlife programs typically manage certain  species of wildlife as game for recreation purposes. These programs may  also own and manage land with habitat particularly suited for game  species, and sometimes provide protection for particular species of  concern. State forestry agencies, which are also in every state, can manage  their state forests for uses such as timber or recreation.", "Private landowners determine how, or whether, to implement collaborative  activities on their lands, consistent with applicable federal, state, and local  laws and zoning restrictions that regulate the types of activities that can  occur on particular areas of land including open space, agricultural,  residential, commercial, and industrial lands. For example, a nonprofit  organization, such as The Nature Conservancy, can own land solely for  conservation purposes, while a timber company uses its lands to harvest  timber for profit. Private activities must also be consistent with applicable  federal environmental laws such as the Endangered Species Act. Under the  act, private landowners are not required to consult with the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service on activities they conduct on their land, but the act  prohibits them from \u201ctaking\u201d a threatened or endangered species. In  certain cases, private landowners may obtain permits for taking species if  the taking is incidental to a lawful activity. To obtain such a permit, a  landowner must submit a habitat conservation plan to the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service that specifies the likely effect of the landowner\u2019s activities  on a listed species and mitigation measures that the landowner will  implement. Landowners may also enter into voluntary safe harbor  agreements with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in which landowners  manage habitat for endangered species in return for assurances that no  additional restrictions will be imposed as a result of their conservation  actions.", "Land use activities, such as harvesting trees for timber, applying fertilizer  and pesticides for agriculture, and diverting water for irrigation or other  use, can degrade air and water quality and habitat for wildlife. However,  undeveloped lands used for forestry, livestock grazing, and agriculture\u2014in  addition to producing the nation\u2019s food and fiber\u2014are vital to the  protection of the nation\u2019s environment and natural resources. To encourage  conservation on private lands used for agricultural and natural resource  production, USDA operates approximately 20 voluntary conservation  programs that are designed to address a range of environmental  concerns\u2014soil erosion, surface and ground water quantity and quality, air  quality, loss of wildlife habitat and native species, and  others\u2014by compensating landowners for taking certain lands out of  production or using certain conservation practices on lands in production.  Among these programs, USDA\u2019s Natural Resources Conservation Service  manages the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, which promotes  agricultural production and environmental quality as compatible national  goals and provides technical and financial assistance to farmers and  ranchers to address soil, water, air, and related natural resource concerns  and to comply with environmental laws, and the Wetlands Reserve  Program, which authorizes technical and financial assistance to eligible  landowners to restore, enhance, and protect wetlands.

The experts note that successful groups that are able to achieve these  benefits use various collaborative practices. In addition, many experts cite  limitations to collaboration and others question collaborative resource  management efforts involving federally managed land, arguing that  collaborative efforts can favor local interests over national interests, be  dominated by particular interests over others, result in a \u201cleast common  denominator\u201d decision that inadequately protects natural resources, or  inappropriately transfer federal authority to local groups."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Experts View Collaboration as an Effective Approach for Improving Natural Resource Management", "paragraphs": ["Experts view collaborative resource management as an effective approach  for addressing natural resource problems compared with more traditional  approaches, such as independent and uncoordinated decision making or  litigation. They note, based on their research of many collaborative efforts,  that collaborative resource management offers several benefits, including  (1) reduced conflict and litigation; (2) better natural resource results;   (3) shared ownership and authority; (4) increased trust, communication,  and understanding among members of a group; and (5) increased  community capacity, such as fostering the ability for community members  to engage in respectful dialogue. In addition, experts say that effective  collaboration can have different structures and processes, but use similar  practices.", "According to the experts, collaboration can reduce conflict and litigation  because it provides a way for people to become directly involved in  resolving issues through face-to-face discussions and move beyond the  impasse associated with more adversarial approaches. Experts say that the  lawsuits, administrative appeals, and lobbying campaigns that have been  associated with natural resource management in the past can be expensive  and divisive and lead to delays in getting land management activities and  projects accomplished. Such was the case in the Applegate watershed in  northern California and southwestern Oregon in the early 1990s when years  of adversarial conflict between environmentalists, the timber industry, and  government agencies over forest management issues and litigation related  to these issues had resulted in policy gridlock, with neither side able to  effectively achieve its goals. In this case and in many others cited by the  experts, stakeholders were driven to try collaboration because they were  frustrated with a lack of progress through other means. Through face-to- face discussions, parties may be able to define solutions that meet their  mutual interests and avert potentially costly litigation that requires winners  and losers and, in some cases, results in delays. For example, according to  one of the participants of the Blackfoot Challenge, one of the collaborative  efforts we studied, the group was able to prevent litigation by an  environmental group over water flows in the Blackfoot River in Montana by  implementing conservation programs during drought that increased water  levels in the river for fish.", "The experts noted that, in addition to reducing conflict, collaboration can  lead to better natural resource results than traditional approaches. A  collaborative process, with a range of stakeholders\u2014from local citizens to  agency technical specialists, and from environmentalists to industry  representatives\u2014incorporates a broad array of knowledge, which may  include specialized local knowledge or technical expertise that would not  be available to particular stakeholders or agencies if they were working  alone. With input from a wide variety of stakeholders, collaborative efforts  are often able to identify creative solutions to natural resource problems  and make better, more-informed decisions about natural resource  management. Because these decisions are made collaboratively and have  concurrence from multiple affected stakeholders, solutions are frequently  easier to implement with less opposition. A second collaborative effort we  studied, the Cooperative Sagebrush Initiative, started in 2006 to involve  multiple stakeholders in developing and implementing solutions to  conserve sagebrush habitat.", "Another benefit noted by experts is that collaborative resource  management creates shared ownership of natural resource problems  among the stakeholders. The experts recognize that many of the nation\u2019s  natural resource problems that cross ownership boundaries are not  amenable to traditional centralized government solutions through  regulation and cannot be solved by single organizations. For example,  problems such as the spread of invasive species, the decline of threatened  and endangered species, the loss of open space from development and  urban sprawl across agricultural landscapes, and non-point-source water  pollution\u2014pollution from diffuse sources\u2014are just a few of the numerous  challenges resulting from the independent actions of countless individuals.  Collaborative efforts bring many of these individuals together, making  progress toward resolving the problems possible. In addition, through  collaboration, federal and state programs can be made locally relevant and  decision making and progress are able to transcend political boundaries.  Consequently, local stakeholders feel consulted and may view federal  agencies as partners, and programs encourage joint stewardship of public  lands.", "Experts also noted that collaborative resource management can increase  communication, trust, and understanding among different stakeholders.  The collaborative process can bring together stakeholders with divergent  interests who may have no prior direct experience working together or  have an adversarial relationship. As they work together to address a  particular common natural resource problem, these stakeholders often  begin to develop trust and increase communication. Furthermore, through  such communication, stakeholders can become more informed about each  other and the natural resource problem and develop an enhanced  understanding of its complexities. For example, environmental and  industry groups with divergent opinions about natural resource use may be  represented in a particular collaborative effort. Through working together  in collaborative groups and opening lines of communication, these  stakeholders may learn to appreciate each other\u2019s perspective by focusing  on interests that they have in common. Experts have noted examples in  which environmentalists learned to appreciate ranchers\u2019 needs to earn a  living through grazing livestock, timber companies acknowledge the value  of healthy ecosystems, and federal agency technical experts recognized the  importance of using traditional knowledge in land management practices.  One of the collaborative efforts we studied, the Eastern Upper Peninsula  Partners in Ecosystem Management, has shared information to improve  forested habitat, including on private timber lands.", "In addition to improving relationships within a collaborative group, experts  identify collaboration more broadly as a means to increase the social  capacity of a community. Increased community capacity can include  developing networks between the public and private sectors and enhancing  the public\u2019s engagement in issues affecting the community. The experts  note that through increasing community capacity, collaborative groups may  enable the community to deal better with future problems that arise.", "Collaborative groups that are able to achieve these benefits can be  organized differently and have different decision making and  organizational processes, but use similar practices that distinguish them  from more traditional groups and make their efforts more effective and  potentially more successful. A collaborative group can be organized  formally\u2014such as a legislatively mandated advisory group or an  incorporated nonprofit organization\u2014or less formally, with loosely  organized members and simple written agreements. Collaborative groups  may also employ a variety of processes to manage their meetings and  organizations and may strive to achieve different desired outcomes, such  as sharing information on what each member is doing, partnering on  particular management activities, or seeking agreement on how to manage  natural resource problems.", "The eastern Upper Peninsu inclde  fore tht hve hitoriclly een mged  for timer.

One expert suggested that such stakeholders may include  those affected by any sort of agreement that could be reached, those  needed to successfully implement an agreement, and those who could  undermine an agreement if not included in the process. Some experts  added that participation should be voluntary.", "Develop a collaborative process. Many experts noted that a  collaborative process should be designed by the participants to fit the  needs and circumstances of their situation. Some experts recommended  that groups employ the assistance of a neutral facilitator with  experience in building collaborative processes. According to some  experts, the process should include decision and process rules to govern  how the group operates. For example, collaborative groups may use  consensus to make decisions, described by several experts as a process  in which discussion proceeds until all viewpoints are heard and the  stakeholders, or most of the stakeholders, are willing to agree to a  conclusion or course of action. When using consensus, some experts  note that a group should agree on what consensus means and what the  responsibilities are for parties who disagree, such as providing an  alternative. In addition to establishing decision rules, one expert noted  that participants need to identify the roles and responsibilities for  implementing an agreement and obtain commitment from the  participants that an agreement will be implemented.", "Pursue flexibility, openness, and respect. According to many  experts, flexibility, transparency, and respect should be built into the  collaborative process. Flexibility is important in the process in order to  accommodate changing timetables, issues, data needs, interests, and  knowledge. Transparency and open communication are essential for  maintaining trust and can be achieved through maintaining a written  record of proceedings and decisions and ensuring that all parties have  equal access to relevant information. Having a respectful process is also  necessary to attain civil discourse in which participants listen to one  another, take each participant\u2019s perspectives seriously, and attempt to  address the concerns of each participant. Building respect and openness  involves accepting the diverse values, interests, and knowledge\u2014 including local knowledge\u2014of the parties involved.", "Find leadership. Several experts identified the need for collaborative  groups to find a credible leader who is capable of articulating a strong  vision. According to the experts, a leader should have good  communication skills, be able to work on all sides of an issue, and  ensure that the collaborative process established by the group is  followed. Experts noted that neutral facilitators can also function as  leaders for a group. In addition, experts said that it is important to build  leadership skills within the organizations participating in a group so that  these leaders can effectively represent the interests of their  organizations.", "Identify or develop a common goal. Most of the experts who wrote  about collaborative practices noted the importance of groups having  clear goals. In a collaborative process, the participants may not have the  same overall interests\u2014in fact they may have conflicting interests.  However, by establishing a goal based on what the group shares in  common\u2014a sense of place or community, mutual goals, or mutual  fears\u2014rather than on where there is disagreement among missions or  philosophies, a collaborative group can shape its own vision and define  its own purpose. When articulated and understood by the members of a  group, this shared purpose provides people with a reason to participate  in the process.", "Develop a process for obtaining information. Some experts noted  that effective collaborative processes incorporate high-quality  information, including both scientific information and local knowledge,  accessible to and understandable by all participants. As one expert  noted, conflict over issues of fact is capable of incapacitating a  collaborative process. Therefore, it is important to develop a common  factual base, which can be accomplished by all participants jointly  gathering and developing a common understanding of relevant data.  This process allows the stakeholders to accept the facts themselves,  rather than having the facts disseminated to them through experts.", "Leverage available resources. Many of the experts emphasized that  collaboration can take time and resources in order to accomplish such  activities as building trust among the participants, setting up the ground  rules for the process, attending meetings, conducting project work, and  monitoring and evaluating the results of work performed. Consequently,  it is important for groups to ensure that they identify and leverage  sufficient funding to get the group started and to accomplish the  objectives. One expert noted that many collaborative groups are  successful in attracting sufficient funding for restoration projects but  have difficulty in securing funding for administration of the group.", "Provide incentives. Some experts note that economic incentives can  help collaborative efforts achieve their goals. For example, by  purchasing conservation easements, a group can give landowners  incentives to help achieve the goal of preserving open space. A  conservation easement is a restriction placed on a parcel of land that  limits certain types of uses or prevents development from taking place  in order to protect the resources associated with the land. By  purchasing easements and thus creating an incentive for a landowner to  keep the land in its current land use, the groups are able to keep the land  from being developed, preserving open space and providing other  ecological benefits.", "Monitor results for accountability. According to many experts, to be  effective, the participants in groups need to be accountable to their  constituencies and to the process that they have established. In  addition, organizations supporting the process expect accountability for  the time, effort, money, or patience they invested in the group. As a  result, experts note the importance of designing protocols to monitor  and evaluate progress toward a collaborative group\u2019s goals, from both  an environmental and a social perspective. Some experts recommend  that collaborative groups use monitoring as a part of an adaptive  management approach that involves modifying management strategies  or project implementation based on the results of initial activities.", "While experts noted that these practices are commonly shared by  successful collaborative groups, one expert said that the use of the  collaborative practices does not guarantee a group\u2019s success. To measure  whether groups are successful, experts noted that two criteria can be used:  (1) whether the groups were able to increase participation and cooperation  and (2) whether they improved natural resource conditions. The first  criterion measures success based on organizational factors and social  outcomes, such as improved relations and trust among stakeholders. In  many instances, the groups studied by one expert identified factors such as  improved communication and understanding as their greatest success.  Factors used by some experts to evaluate success in this respect include  the perceived effects of the collaborative effort in building relationships,  the extent of agreement reached, and educating and outreaching to  members of the community. The second criterion for success is based on  whether groups have been able to improve natural resource conditions as  measured by specific indicators, such as water quality, ecosystem health, or  species recovery. Some experts note that to evaluate progress toward  improving resource conditions, monitoring needs to be performed over a  period long enough for change to occur and focus on indicators that are  associated with a group\u2019s natural resource goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Experts Identified Limitations of Collaboration and a Few Raise Questions about Using It on Federally Managed Lands", "paragraphs": ["Although collaborative resource management is generally viewed by the  experts as an effective approach for addressing natural resource problems,  many experts discussed two limitations to its use. First, the process of  collaboration, which involves bringing people together to work on a  problem and moving the group forward to reach a decision, can be difficult  and time-consuming, particularly in the initial stages when the group is  getting started, and thus require large amounts of resources, including staff  and money. Even after a group has been working together for a period of  time, there may be inefficiencies with the process as new group members  need to be brought up to speed.", "Second, collaboration does not always work in providing the solution to all  natural resource problems. In some instances, for example when there are  irreconcilable differences among group members, agreement may not be  possible. In other instances, one particular stakeholder may derail the  process by refusing to cooperate. As a result, collaborative resource  management is not applicable everywhere, and collaborative efforts may  not be replicable. For example, collaboration may not work in a community  deeply divided over a particular natural resource issue that has generated a  long history of controversy and litigation even though a collaborative effort  dealing with the same issue was successful in another community.", "Furthermore, some experts question whether collaborative resource  management groups are equitable; have balanced power; produce solutions  that are protective of the environment; and are accountable to the public,  particularly in circumstances where federally managed lands are involved.  A number of experts raised concern over the equity of collaboration, noting  that it can remove discussions from the public arena and empower those  who are involved in the group at the expense of those who cannot, or  choose not to, participate even though they have a legitimate interest. By  their nature, collaborative groups tend to be primarily made up of local  stakeholders. Yet, others who may not live in the community but have an  interest in the lands because they recreate there, use water originating  there, or value endangered species living there are sometimes left out of  the process because they are unaware it is occurring or do not have the  means or the resources to participate. For example, national environmental  organizations cannot always participate in local efforts because they may  not have people at these locations or be able to bear the expense of  traveling there.", "Some experts also question collaboration on the grounds that public  processes may be co-opted by parties with particular interests who manage  to control the agenda of the group. Many experts raising this question were  concerned about local economic interests taking over a process and,  because of their influence, overriding other interests. Yet, one expert noted  concerns that the process could also be co-opted by environmental  interests. Furthermore, some experts critical of collaborative resource  management raised concerns about the efforts focusing on reaching a  consensus decision. By trying to reach consensus, they argued,  compromises are made that can result in a \u201cleast common denominator\u201d  solution, which some may view as less protective of the natural resources.", "Finally, a few experts criticize collaborative efforts designed to make  decisions about management activities on federal lands because they  believe collaboration reduces federal agencies\u2019 accountability to the  broader public. Specifically, some of these experts say that collaboration  effectively transfers the authority to make land management decisions  from the federal land management agencies to local citizens. Consequently,  these experts argue that when collaborative groups make decisions related  to federal land, the land and resource management agencies do not carry  out their legal responsibilities to manage the public land and are not  accountable to the public.", "In response to such questions raised about collaboration, other experts  note that a well-designed and implemented collaborative process can avoid  some of the outcomes with which the critics of collaboration are  concerned. For example, a process that is inclusive will incorporate both  local and national interests, and a process that uses the leadership of a  neutral facilitator can help to ensure that all viewpoints are considered and  prevent any one group from taking over the process. Furthermore, one  expert notes that a well-designed collaborative process that includes  debate over the facts of an issue can avoid a \u201cleast common denominator\u201d  solution. Finally, according to an expert, when participating in  collaborative groups that are transparent, federal agencies can show that  they are not improperly transferring authority to local communities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Most Collaborative Efforts We Studied Reduced or Averted Resource Conflicts, Completed Projects, and Improved Natural Resource Conditions to an Extent That Could Not Be Determined", "paragraphs": ["Overall, the collaborative resource management efforts that we studied  were successful in achieving participation and cooperation among their  members and sustaining or improving natural resource conditions, the two  criteria the experts identified to gauge the success of collaborative groups.  Six of the seven collaborative efforts we studied have reduced or averted  the kinds of conflicts that often arise when dealing with contentious  natural resource problems, particularly those that cross property  boundaries, such as threatened and endangered species, lack of wildland  fire, invasive species, degraded wildlife habitat, or similar problems.  However, the extent of resource improvement across broader landscapes  that the efforts were working in was difficult to determine because the  landscape-level data needed to make such determinations were not always  gathered."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most Collaborative Resource Management Efforts Reduced or Averted Conflicts through Cooperation among Participants", "paragraphs": ["The seven efforts we studied managed natural resource problems that can  often cause conflict and controversy, and sometimes litigation. As shown in  table 1, the natural resource problems undertaken by the seven efforts we  studied ranged widely from fragmented riparian habitat for fish and lack of  wildland fire in rangeland ecosystems to predator interactions with  livestock, travel access in wilderness areas, and nature-related outdoor  activities.", "Each of the natural resource problems the efforts managed, or are  managing, involves many different interests that can potentially lead to  conflict among the different members of the group. For example, in the  Blackfoot Challenge case, federal agencies are required to protect  threatened and endangered species such as the grizzly bear and the gray  wolf, yet ranchers fear these large predators because of the harm they can  cause to livestock. Or, in the Uncompahgre Plateau example, as a result of  the Energy Policy Act of 2005, transmission line operators must ensure that  their power lines remain reliable, which traditionally involved clear cutting  the rights-of-ways involved, even on public lands. Meanwhile, natural  resource managers seek to provide habitat for lynx and deer and to prevent  large openings in the forest that may come with utility corridors. The  natural resource problems and potential or actual conflicts managed by  each of the groups are described in more detail in appendix II.", "As table 1 shows, six of the seven efforts were able to identify solutions to  their natural resource problems that met their common interests. For  example, by developing the concept of a credit system, the Cooperative  Sagebrush Initiative has identified a way to encourage\u2014and pay for\u2014 preservation and restoration of sagebrush habitat while also allowing for  the development of sagebrush in areas that are economically or otherwise  important. In another example, the Onslow Bight Forum identified lands  that were important to preserve and restore as habitat for different species  and purchased these from willing landowners. Because the groups can pool  their funds, they are able to purchase more properties and more expensive  properties, and by purchasing the land on the free market from willing  owners, the group provides the landowners with the value of their property,  thereby not harming their economic interests. While the seventh group\u2014 the Steens Mountain Advisory Council\u2014was able to provide advice on a  cooperative management plan and vegetation treatment plans, it did not  provide input on a travel management plan for the area, a key management  issue.", "All seven efforts we studied used several of the collaborative practices  identified by the experts\u2014such as seeking inclusive participation; using  collaborative processes; pursuing flexibility, openness, and respect; and  finding leadership\u2014and six of the efforts were successful in reducing or  averting conflicts. These six groups were able to cooperate and focus on  their common interests and goals, despite different perspectives and  interests among the members. In addition to identifying common goals,  several of the successful efforts were able to use other practices, such as  obtaining scientific and other information to inform their decisions,  leveraging funds, and providing incentives. The one effort that has been  less successful in dealing with conflict used several of the collaborative  practices, but does not have a common goal and does not have funding to  gather information, leverage resources, or provide incentives.", "The Steen Montin collabortive effort i  locted in theastern Oregon.

The seven groups each have members that  have multiple different perspectives such as private landowners,  conservation groups, natural resource land management agencies, and  wildlife agencies. Most of the groups include representatives from federal  agencies such as BLM, the Forest Service, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service, and several include USDA\u2019s Natural Resources Conservation  Service. All but one of the groups we studied were primarily organized  around landowners and managers who can make decisions about their  respective lands, including members of conservation-oriented groups such  as The Nature Conservancy and local conservation groups such as the  North Carolina Coastal Land Trust and North Carolina Coastal Federation.  Two groups, the Blackfoot Challenge and the Malpai Borderlands Group,  focus primarily on private lands and the surrounding public lands. On the  other hand, the Uncompahgre Plateau, Onslow Bight Forum, and the  Eastern Upper Peninsula Partners in Ecosystem Management include large  areas of public lands, with the exception of lands owned by the land  conservancy groups in North Carolina and several forest companies in  Michigan. While the groups are open to other participants such as  environmental groups, according to several participants, they may not seek  them out or the environmental groups may not participate. All but one of  the groups have self-selected membership, which means that they attract  members who are interested in working on the problems identified by the  group and are willing to find solutions to these problems, which may not be  the case with certain organizations. Only one group, the Steens Mountain  Advisory Council, is required by law to include certain members, including  representatives of the ranching and environmental communities, including  one local and one national representative from each.", "Develop a Collaborative Process. The seven groups we studied are  organized differently but are each organized to collaborate. Three of the  groups\u2014the Blackfoot Challenge, the Cooperative Sagebrush Initiative,  and the Malpai Borderlands Group\u2014have incorporated as nonprofit  organizations, each with a board of directors, and one\u2014the Uncompahgre  Plateau Project\u2014has a separate nonprofit financial management group.  According to members of one group, being incorporated allows the group  the autonomy to raise funds and complete management projects on its  own, without relying on the federal or state agencies. Also, incorporating  puts the groups on equal footing with the agencies as they identify projects  with mutual benefits. Of the remaining three groups, two are less formally  organized and one is more formally organized. The Onslow Bight Forum  and the Eastern Upper Peninsula group function as information-sharing  groups that allow the individual members to determine what actions they  will take independently. The Onslow Bight Forum uses a memorandum of  understanding to identify the role of each member and the group, while the  Eastern Upper Peninsula group does not have any organization documents  and operates informally. Finally, the last group\u2014the Steens Mountain  Advisory Committee\u2014is a legislatively organized advisory group for BLM  and has written protocols to describe its organization and processes.", "All but one of these groups uses a consensus process to make decisions.  This process involves all participants, focuses on solutions, and proceeds  until agreement is reached. For example, participants of one group, the  Blackfoot Challenge, said that its members followed the 80-20 rule\u2014they  worked on 80 percent of the items they could agree on and left the 20  percent they could not agree on at the door. The participants said that as  they worked together longer, the 20 percent of items that cause  disagreement have been reduced as well. Two groups\u2014the Onslow Bight  Forum and the Eastern Upper Peninsula group\u2014do not make formal  decisions, but use a consensus process in discussing and agreeing on a plan  of action that members can decide to take or not. One group, the Steens  Mountain Advisory Council, uses a voting process to make certain  decisions rather than a consensus process. To make a recommendation to  BLM, the advisory council is required to have 9 of its 12 members vote in  favor of it. According to the members, unfilled positions and poor  attendance at council meetings have made it difficult to achieve the  number of votes needed to make recommendations to BLM.", "Pursue Flexibility, Openness, and Respect. All but one of the groups  have flexible and open processes that allow the members to discuss their  positions. Two of the groups\u2014the Onslow Bight Forum and the Eastern  Upper Peninsula group\u2014would not likely exist without the openness that  allowed the members to retain their own missions and land management  goals rather than the group subsuming them. Several of the groups, such as  the Uncompahgre Plateau Project, use Web sites and plans to communicate  with each other and the community. On the other hand, the Steens  Mountain Advisory Council is different from the other groups in that it was  legislatively created, and the act that created both the Steens Mountain  Cooperative Management and Protection Area (CMPA) and the council  resulted from lengthy negotiations among several parties, some of whom  are, or have been, represented on the council. The group has used  facilitators to overcome some of the conflict that developed through the  negotiations, but some acknowledge that the council established by the act  has not yet resolved key conflicts over management of the area.

All of the groups have benefited from the availability of  community leaders or agency employees who could lead the group. Several  of the groups were started by local community leaders who energized and  engaged others to work with them, although the federal agency staff were  working alongside the community leaders to support the efforts. In  particular, the Blackfoot Challenge, Malpai Borderlands Group, and  Uncompahgre Plateau projects were started and sustained by community  leaders, but they recognize the important contribution of the federal  agency employees who were involved as well. On the other hand, federal  and state agency employees took the lead in starting the Eastern Upper  Peninsula group and were also important in the Cooperative Sagebrush  Initiative, and federal agency staff worked with staff from The Nature  Conservancy to start the Onslow Bight Forum. One community leader on  the Steens advisory council has attempted to focus the group on its role  and keep it on track for making recommendations to BLM.", "Identify a Common Goal. Of the seven groups we studied, six identified  and shared a common goal. For example, the Onslow Bight Forum brought  together diverse members with similar interests in preserving open space  and habitat\u2014the U.S. Marine Corps has an interest in preserving open  space around its installations for safety reasons and to help save  endangered species, and land conservation groups seek to preserve habitat  corridors and prevent development of the rural landscape. Similarly, the  Eastern Upper Peninsula group focused on the need to facilitate  complementary management of public and private lands, for all  appropriate land uses, and to sustain and enhance representative  ecosystems in the Eastern Upper Peninsula. On the other hand, the Steens  Mountain Advisory Council does not share a common goal for management  of the Steens Mountain area, with some members advocating motor vehicle  access through wilderness areas for historical uses such as livestock  grazing and others advocating for more wilderness areas to be set aside in  the planning area and greater conservation requirements instituted in those  wilderness areas already existing. The Steens Mountain act established a  cooperative management area, the purpose of which is to conserve,  protect, and manage the long-term ecological integrity of Steens Mountain  for present and future generations. To further this purpose, the act directed  BLM to manage the area to achieve five objectives.

Each of the  seven collaborative groups has established a group or process to jointly  develop and use scientific information as part of their decision making,  although some groups have done so more than others. For example, the  Malpai Borderlands Group has a scientific advisory board to develop  research projects on fire to support the group\u2019s efforts to restore fire,  which had been suppressed for decades, to the ecosystem to help restore  healthy grasslands. It also holds annual science conferences to bring  together the relevant scientific findings on rangelands, fire, threatened and  endangered species, and other issues. The group also works with USDA,  Forest Service, and university researchers on vegetation and fire studies.  On the other hand, rather than develop its own scientific information, the  Cooperative Sagebrush Initiative relied on data produced by the U.S.  Geological Survey on sagebrush habitat and studies completed by the  Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies to assess the status of  sage grouse and the sagebrush ecosystem in the 11 western states involved.  Several groups developed landscape maps to show different information.  For example, the Onslow Bight Forum used habitat and biological  information, and other information, to develop a landscape map of the key  areas for habitat and preservation purposes. Finally, some groups, such as  the Uncompahgre Plateau Project, reported that using scientific  information, including field trips to demonstrate effects of their  management activities, helped them to communicate their efforts to  outside parties who may have otherwise been critical.", "The Mlpi Borderlnd Grop collabortive  effort i locted on the order with Mexico in  thern New Mexico nd Arizon.

According to the Onslow Bight Forum, its members have raised as  much as $75 million since 2001 from state and federal funds to acquire land,  a process helped by the existence of the forum. On the other hand, the  Eastern Upper Peninsula project and the Steens Mountain Advisory  Council do not generate funding. The Eastern Upper Peninsula project  members said they did not intend to raise funds because they did not intend  to conduct joint projects, and the Steens group is not organized to raise  funds. The federal legislation that created the Steens Mountain Advisory  Council authorized $25 million to be appropriated to BLM to work with  local ranchers, landowners, and others to conduct work in the cooperative  management area; however, these funds have not been provided. Some  members said that, if provided, these funds could be used to pursue  activities such as purchasing private inholdings, which are privately owned  lands within the boundary of a national park, forest, or other land  management unit.", "The Mlpi Borderlnd Grop was initited   grop of rncher nd environmentli.

Several of the groups we studied that have dealt  successfully with conflict used different types of incentives to gain  cooperation and participation. Such incentives include conservation  easements, payments for projects or damages caused by wildlife, and  different agreements related to threatened and endangered species. The  Blackfoot Challenge, Malpai Borderlands Group, and Eastern Upper  Peninsula project have arranged, or helped arrange, conservation  easements to protect either rangeland or forested land that could have  been developed for housing, otherwise. The Malpai group also used  another type of payment to help reduce conflict over livestock losses  caused by predators, supporting a predation fund to pay ranchers when it  can be proved a predator\u2014the jaguar in New Mexico and Arizona\u2014has  killed livestock.", "A third type of incentive, safe harbor agreements and habitat conservation  plans, has been used by the Malpai Borderlands Group. Safe harbor  agreements seek to assure landowners that if they restore or enhance  habitat, they will not incur new restrictions if their actions result in a  threatened or endangered species taking up residence. In order to obtain a  permit to take a species incidental to lawful land management activities, a  landowner must complete a habitat conservation plan, which specifies  measures the landowner will undertake to minimize and mitigate the effect  on the species. These agreements encourage private landowners to  conduct projects that will protect species on their property, while also  protecting their use of the land should they \u201ctake\u201d one of the species\u2014 either by killing it or degrading its habitat. According to one group these  agreements can be complex and time-consuming to arrange, and thus, it  may be more efficient for the group to work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service through the process than for each individual landowner. In addition  to these types of arrangements, the Cooperative Sagebrush Initiative wants  to develop a related incentive, a conservation credit bank in which one  party would pay to protect sagebrush habitat, or conduct restoration of  habitat, and another party would purchase credits to develop land that  would degrade sagebrush habitat or kill a species. The group is still  considering how to measure the conservation value of different sagebrush  species and habitat they provide and how to monitor those values."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Collaborative Efforts Have Improved Natural Resource Conditions, but Determining the Extent of Improvement Was Difficult Because of Limited Landscape Data", "paragraphs": ["Through cooperating, five of the seven efforts we studied have  accomplished multiple management activities and projects that have  helped sustain or improve natural resource conditions in their areas.

The  Cooperative Sagebrush Initiative has not yet accomplished its work, as it  started in September 2006 and is just developing demonstration projects.  And, although the Steens Mountain Advisory Council has helped BLM to  develop a management plan for the Steens Mountain CMPA, it did not deal  with the most contentious issues that relate to travel access, wilderness  areas, and wilderness study areas in the plan issued in November 2007.

The groups  also accomplished numerous activities to keep landscapes open and usable  for natural resource purposes, such as grazing or timber harvesting. At the  same time, the groups worked on several projects to help conserve  threatened and endangered species habitat. The two efforts that have not  completed projects\u2014the Cooperative Sagebrush Initiative and the Steens  Mountain Advisory Council\u2014have not moved beyond planning work.", "As shown in table 2, three of the groups\u2014the Blackfoot Challenge, Malpai  Borderlands Group, and Uncompahgre Plateau Project\u2014have employed  monitoring programs that demonstrate the effect of their activities on site- level natural resource conditions. Monitoring environmental or natural  resource characteristics is typically conducted at the site level\u2014the area  involved in a management activity, such as a vegetation treatment\u2014to  determine what effect the management activity has, or at the landscape  level\u2014a broad area\u2014to determine the overall conditions across that area.  Monitoring can also be conducted over time to indicate the trend in  conditions at a site or landscape. Montana\u2019s Department of Fish, Wildlife  and Parks, one of the partners involved in the Blackfoot Challenge,  conducts fish surveys in the Blackfoot River to determine how populations  are faring. This work measures the benefits provided by the group\u2019s  riparian projects for fish populations, including endangered bull trout. The  Malpai Borderlands Group conducts range monitoring on 290 sites in its  area and conducts monitoring of some species to determine how they have  been affected by group projects. The Uncompahgre Plateau Project maps  its vegetation treatments and fires, and thus shows areas of different  vegetation ages, types, and the habitat it provides across the broad area  managed by several agencies. Because the agencies\u2019 mapping data are not  compatible, however, staff said that they had to develop ways to merge the  data, which was is time-consuming and expensive. Through January 2008,  the agencies, with the help of the group, had pulled together data for two  large watersheds and had begun working on two more. The other groups  do not conduct monitoring as a group, although the resource management  agencies do track resources in some cases.", "Two of the seven groups\u2014Blackfoot Challenge and the Uncompahgre  Plateau Project\u2014monitor the results of some of their projects across the  larger landscape to determine the effect of their work across the broad  landscapes that they are trying to affect; however, the other groups do not  conduct landscape monitoring. According to two groups, they are not able  to monitor across a larger area for two primary reasons. First, according to  participants, it is time-consuming and expensive to monitor multiple sites  regularly across a large area, and this is what is necessary to understand  the effects of multiple projects in that large landscape. For example, even  though the Malpai Borderlands Group monitors 290 sites for the effects of  grazing, climate, and other factors on the condition of the grasslands that  are useful for assessing the condition of that pasture or smaller area,  according to the group\u2019s scientists, the group does not collect comparable  data across different pastures or smaller areas that allow comparison  across the broader landscape. Data must be collected at a different,  broader scale and need to be collected consistently at specified locations to  determine the condition of the hundreds of thousands of acres of rangeland  that the group is helping to manage. Currently, the group and its scientific  advisory board are considering what data to collect.", "The second reason that the groups do not collect data is that they either  have not agreed to collect such data or they have not agreed on the work  that they will conduct and monitor. Two groups\u2014the Onslow Bight Forum  and the Eastern Upper Peninsula group\u2014do not monitor because both of  these groups organized to share information, not to develop joint projects  and monitoring. According to some Onslow Bight members, it would be  useful to track the results that individual members have accomplished with  the group\u2019s information, but the group has not decided to do this jointly or  to dedicate the resources to it. According to the members of the Eastern  Upper Peninsula group, their purpose has never been to jointly manage  projects and therefore there is no need to monitor results. The group\u2019s  purpose is to share information about natural resource problems, such as  invasive species, and effective ways to treat them, without requiring the  participants to work together. The group gives members a place to find  common problems with other agencies and then each agency or participant  can conduct its work and monitor results accordingly.", "Finally, the Cooperative Sagebrush Initiative and the Steens Mountain  Advisory Council do not conduct any monitoring because the groups are  just beginning projects that warrant monitoring. The Cooperative  Sagebrush Initiative recognizes the need for monitoring and has considered  including the cost of monitoring in each project to ensure that it is  conducted, but the group has not yet conducted any projects, nor have they  conducted pilot projects to ensure that they can correctly measure the  benefits achieved by restoration projects. At Steens Mountain, BLM has  drafted an overall monitoring plan for the Steens Mountain area that may  serve to monitor work accomplished. However, BLM has not yet conducted  some of the key work identified as needed by the Advisory Council because  the agency is still conducting studies to determine how to best clear juniper  in wilderness areas and wilderness study areas because mechanical tools\u2014 the method that has been proven effective for removing large juniper  trees\u2014cannot be used to cut down trees prior to burning."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Cooperative Conservation Policies and Actions Address Some of the Challenges Faced by Federal Agencies Participating in Collaborative Efforts, but Opportunities Exist for Further Action", "paragraphs": ["Federal land and resource management agencies face several challenges to  participating in collaborative resource management efforts, according to  the experts, federal officials, and participants in collaborative efforts we  interviewed.

The 2004 Executive Order and 2005 White  House Conference on Cooperative Conservation set in motion an  interagency initiative, including a senior policy group, an executive task  force, and working groups, to develop policies and take actions that  support collaborative efforts and partnerships.

Such skills include  improving communication, identifying and involving relevant stakeholders,  conducting meetings, resolving disputes, and sharing technical information  and making it accessible. Federal participants and others we interviewed  indicated that federal employees are often technical experts and improving  their collaborative skills may enable them to work more effectively with a  collaborative group. They indicated that such skills are important to work  effectively with neighboring landowners and community members who are  interested in the projects and lands. Many participants emphasized that  hiring new people with collaborative skills is one way to improve the level  of collaboration by federal agencies and also said that training in  collaboration for employees is important to improve skills. Some federal  agency officials said that hands-on training in collaborative efforts,  involving participants from other groups, is most helpful.", "Furthermore, to encourage the use of collaboration by federal employees,  several participants we interviewed said that management should support  field staff in their collaborative efforts. For example, one participant stated  that management needs to identify those employees with collaborative  skills and assign them according to these skills. Some participants said that  senior employees may be better at collaboration because they have  developed a relationship with the group or are more comfortable in  interpreting laws and policy to apply in specific situations that might arise.  Others said that new employees have enthusiasm and only need to be  shown how they can best work with groups. Several participants said that  federal agencies need to allow their staff to become acquainted with a  community to work better with local groups, and others said that providing  flexibility for the employees to work with the groups is needed. Finally, one  participant we interviewed said that collaborative efforts will fail if federal  management officials reverse the decisions made by the federal  representatives working with a collaborative group because the group will  no longer trust the federal agencies to do what they have agreed on."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Determining Whether to Participate in a Particular Collaborative Effort", "paragraphs": ["A second challenge agencies face in working with collaborative groups is  determining whether or not to participate in a particular group.  Collaborative efforts are commonly started by concerned citizens  interested in the management of their public lands and, as a result, the  federal agencies can choose whether to be involved and what role to play.  If they make an uninformed choice, they risk becoming involved in a group  that might take great effort and expend considerable staff resources with  few results. Various external factors affect a collaborative group\u2019s ability to  cooperate and succeed, including a community\u2019s collaborative capacity and  the amount of controversy involved. If federal agencies do not understand  these contributing factors, as well as the nature of the controversy related  to a problem, federal staff may become involved in a collaborative effort  that has little chance of working, potentially leading to increased conflict  and costs.", "Part of determining whether to be involved is what role the agencies can  play. Participants we interviewed indicated that it is important for federal  agencies to be involved in collaborative efforts because they are such large  landowners, and, in many areas, natural resource problems cross their  boundaries onto other lands. However, several participants\u2014including  federal agency officials\u2014indicated that the agencies should \u201clead from  behind,\u201d letting the group take a lead in determining what work can be  done. One participant said that by doing this, the community works out  their issues and comes to a common understanding among themselves\u2014 without the agency staff brokering the discussion. In such cases, the  agencies can help the groups by providing planning assistance, technical  information, funding, and even administrative support. In other cases, the  federal agencies may want to use a collaborative group to provide input on  a management plan or project, and in these cases, the agencies need to  determine which groups to involve and what their particular natural  resource management concerns are. Regardless of the federal role in  collaboration, experts and participants emphasized the need for federal  agencies to clarify how a group\u2019s agreed-upon ideas could affect decisions  about federal land."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sustaining Federal Participation over Time", "paragraphs": ["Once federal staff have become involved in a collaborative effort, a third  challenge becomes sustaining employees\u2019 participation over time. This is  particularly important because of limited resources available in the field  offices and the staff\u2019s limited ability to participate while also conducting  their work for the agency. Experts and participants we interviewed said  that, to be effective, federal participation should be consistent and ongoing  throughout the collaboration, which can be for many years. For example,  participants of the Blackfoot Challenge and the Malpai Borderlands Group  indicated that their groups had benefited from agency staff acting as  liaisons to the groups for several years. These groups were highly  organized in their efforts and worked with agency officials to create these  relationships. However, at many of the field offices we visited, federal  agencies were experiencing staffing limitations that made their work with  existing collaborative efforts more difficult and limited. In particular, the  federal agencies\u2019 field offices had experienced recent downsizing in the last  several years and were one or two people below their normal staffing  levels. As a result, the remaining staff members were spread thinly across  existing programs to accomplish their work and achieve targets set by the  agencies. According to the officials, these federal employees sometimes  continued to participate in collaborative efforts but devoted less time and  attention to them. For example, in North Carolina, federal officials for the  National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service refuge, and Forest  Service had been involved in the Onslow Bight Forum efforts to map key  habitat, but as their biologists left the agencies, the agencies became less  involved and attended fewer meetings.", "Another issue related to staffing and federal agency support of  collaborative efforts is the agencies\u2019 practice of transferring people  frequently from one field location to another. Participants said that  longevity and a \u201csense of place\u201d\u2014or commitment to an area\u2014is important  for collaborating with groups whose participants may have been in an area  for generations. A few participants thought that changing staff helped to  bring in new people with energy and new ideas, but, according to several  other participants, moving staff frequently creates a gap in the support for a  group, which may hinder progress if a federal participant for a project  moves at the wrong time. Some participants thought that the transition  between outgoing and new federal staff could be eased by the outgoing  staff member writing a memo to describe all the relevant details of the  group, its members, its issues, and its projects, among other things, but  others thought that it would be better to rely on the other staff in the office  or group members for knowledge about the group, community, and other  factors that would affect the agency\u2019s participation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Measuring Participation and Monitoring Results to Ensure Accountability", "paragraphs": ["Once a collaborative effort has begun, an important challenge faced by  federal agencies and the members of the group is measuring participation  and monitoring the results of the efforts. Measurement and monitoring  allow members, both federal and nonfederal, to be accountable to each  other and to the public. In the case of the federal agencies, measuring  participation and monitoring results help show how an agency\u2019s  participation in a group has helped to achieve some important resource  management goal for the agency. According to federal officials we  interviewed, agencies will be involved in collaborative efforts to the extent  that the group can help them achieve federal land management goals and  targets for work they are required to do. However, according to experts,  federal officials, and participants, it is difficult to measure the results of  collaboration because there is no direct measure or \u201cwidget\u201d produced  from participating or collaboration. For example, according to one  participant, counting the number of meetings held does not measure  collaboration, and, in fact, the number of meetings needed for a well-run  group may decrease over time. Participants also said that it may take a few  years to build a group and relationships before any work is accomplished,  which may not fit with agency performance targets that are set annually.", "Moreover, experts said that monitoring the natural resources results of  collaborative management is also difficult because of the long-term nature  of ecological change. For example, it can take several years before the  results of a management project can be seen or measured; at the same time,  natural fluctuation in drought, vegetation, and species can mask the effects  of management actions. To counter these difficulties, according to some  participants we interviewed, groups need to have an overall plan for the  improvements in natural resources they are working to achieve and  monitor according to those goals. Even then, as the examples we studied  show, collaborative groups have a difficult time monitoring because of the  time and cost involved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sharing Agency and Group Experiences with Collaboration", "paragraphs": ["A fifth challenge that the federal agencies face in participating in  collaborative efforts involves sharing agency and group experiences with  collaboration.

Some participants who had been involved in the White House Conference  on Cooperative Conservation and other conferences stated that such  forums are useful for giving groups the opportunity to share practical  experiences of working together and with federal agencies. The types of  lessons include the fact that groups can benefit from paid staff, even part- time, or a director to keep the group organized between meetings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Working within the Framework of Federal Statutes and Agency Policies to Support Collaboration", "paragraphs": ["Finally, agencies face the challenge of collaborating within the existing  framework of federal statutes and agency policies that establish a  management culture within each agency. In addition to the framework of  natural resources and environmental laws and policies described above,  agencies have a set of laws and policies for working with nonfederal  entities or groups, including the Federal Advisory Committee Act, policies  on ethics related to working with groups, and financial assistance  requirements. Some experts and participants in collaborative groups  identified aspects of federal laws and agency policies as being inconsistent  with collaboration. However, aspects of the policies reflect processes  established to support good government practices such as transparency  and accountability. The federal agencies have not, in all cases, evaluated  the laws and policies involved to determine how best to balance  collaboration with the need to maintain good government practices. A  short description of these laws and policies follows.", "Federal Advisory Committee Act: Some experts and collaborative  groups assert that the Federal Advisory Committee Act inhibits  collaborative management by imposing several requirements on interaction  between federal and nonfederal participants. For example, the act requires  that all committees have a charter, and that each charter contain specific  information, including the committee\u2019s scope and objectives, a description  of duties, the period of time necessary to carry out its purposes, the  estimated operating costs, and the number and frequency of meetings. The  act generally requires that agencies announce committee meetings ahead  of time and give notice to interested parties about such meetings. With  some exceptions, the meetings are to be open to the public, and agencies  are to prepare meeting minutes and make them available to interested  parties. By making the process bureaucratic, some experts and others say  that the act limits groups\u2019 abilities to work together spontaneously to solve  problems or get work done. USDA officials indicated that they have a  budget limit on what they can spend on groups working under the act.  Some participants of collaborative groups we interviewed said that the fact  that the act\u2019s requirements do not apply to privately led efforts is one  reason for communities to lead collaborative efforts with assistance from  federal agencies. Other participants said that the act\u2019s requirements caused  their groups to focus their goals solely on information sharing, because the  group\u2019s purpose would not be to offer advice regarding agency decisions,  and therefore the group would not be subject to the act.", "Ethics rule: USDA and Interior implement federal ethics\u2019 rules on federal  employees\u2019 participation on the board of directors of an outside  organization differently, resulting in their staff members participating in  different capacities on a group\u2019s nonprofit board. The ethics rules generally  prevent a federal employee from serving as a board member while serving  in an official capacity for the federal agency because of concerns over  conflicts of interest. Waivers may be granted under limited circumstances;  however, according to USDA and Interior officials, USDA rarely grants  waivers, while Interior has granted some waivers. As a result of different  implementation of the rule, in the Blackfoot Challenge case, a Forest  Service member serves as a nonvoting board member, while BLM and the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service members serve as voting members. Several  of the participants of the group expressed confusion and some distrust  over the different federal agency interpretations, saying that they raised  some questions about the Forest Service\u2019s commitment to participate.  Other groups that form nonprofit boards may face this same inconsistency.", "Financial requirements: Some groups receive federal grants or  cooperative agreements that enable them to conduct activities that provide  for a public purpose. Nonfederal participants in collaborative efforts  identified federal agency financial procedures for these grants and  cooperative agreements that make it difficult for them to work  collaboratively with the agencies. For example, some grants require that  any interest earned be returned to the federal government, others require  the group to raise funds to meet a share of costs, or others do not allow the  group to be paid up front, which is difficult for small organizations without  much funding. In addition, several participants indicated that it is difficult  to pull together funding over the long term from the numerous sources  available\u2014foundations, agencies, and fundraising activities\u2014and that this  is an ongoing struggle for groups. However, because federal agencies need  to seek competing offers or applications for many types of grants and  agreements, the agencies may not be able to provide stable funding to  groups for very long. For example, the participants of one group we  interviewed recently learned that they would have to compete with others  to renew their agreement, even though the group has ongoing management  plans and projects with BLM and other agencies to provide long-term  vegetation management across the agencies\u2019 lands. The result of this action  is that the group was uncertain if they would be able to carry out these  long-term plans and projects because they rely on this stream of funding to  pay for part-time staff to organize the group and provide support for  planning projects and reporting the results.", "One specific type of funding agreement that can help make collaboration  work, identified by some federal officials we interviewed, is the watershed  restoration and enhancement agreement. Under this authority the Forest  Service can use appropriated funds to enter into agreements with other  federal agencies; states, tribal, and local governments; or private entities to  protect, restore, and enhance fish and wildlife habitat and other resources  on public or private land. However, the authority that allows this for the  Forest Service\u2014the Wyden Amendment\u2014is set to expire in 2011. In  addition, Interior officials stated that they do not have general authority to  use their funds to restore or enhance resources on nonfederal land;  however, they indicated that BLM, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and  the National Park Service can fund projects on nonfederal land related to  reducing the risk of damage from wildland fire. The agency officials that  discussed these funding sources said that the ability to spend some of their  funds on nonfederal lands enhances\u2014or would enhance\u2014their ability to  work with partners in the community.", "Endangered Species Act requirements for listing species:  Participants in the Cooperative Sagebrush Initiative identified several  aspects of the Endangered Species Act that make collaboration difficult for  them. They have identified and proposed areas where they believe  Endangered Species Act policies could be made more consistent with their  collaborative effort. In particular, the group is planning to conduct  restoration projects for sagebrush habitat, but, according to one  participant, these restoration projects are scrutinized as much as a  destructive project is in terms of the effect the project may have on a  potentially endangered species such as the sage grouse. The group has  proposed to Interior that the policy for listing species as endangered\u2014the  Policy for Evaluating Conservation Efforts\u2014would apply to their  restoration actions because such actions might make listing unnecessary,  or listing requirements might be less restrictive. This policy identifies  criteria the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will use in determining whether  formalized conservation efforts that have yet to be implemented or to show  effectiveness contribute to making listing a species as threatened or  endangered unnecessary. The group has also proposed other changes to the  Endangered Species Act regulations and policies that they say would  support collaboration and their particular effort. For example, under  current policies, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service treats the two types of  species (threatened and endangered) in the same manner with regard to  prohibitions on the taking of a species. The group has proposed that  Interior relax the prohibition on the taking of threatened species, arguing  that the Endangered Species Act allows for threatened species to be  treated in a different manner from endangered species.", "National Environmental Policy Act: Experts and participants have  stated that NEPA hinders collaboration by essentially duplicating the  public participation that occurs through collaborative efforts.  Collaborative groups may develop a plan or project that they would prefer.  For federal projects having a significant environmental effect, NEPA  requires the development and analysis of a reasonable range of alternative  actions, including the agency\u2019s preferred alternative action, in an  environmental impact statement. It also requires public participation in the  development of the environmental impact statement. Because  collaborative groups often include many of those interested in the natural  resources or management being conducted, several participants said that  the collaborative group provides the agencies with its preferred alternative  and a good sense of the public\u2019s opinion of the project.

After the White House  Conference, a report entitled Supplemental Analysis of Day Two  Facilitated Discussion Sessions (Day 2 report) was written summarizing  the comments of numerous participants in collaborative groups and  highlighting actions that the federal agencies could take to improve  cooperation and partnerships. In response to the Day 2 report, a senior  policy team\u2014composed of the Chairman of CEQ, Director of OMB, and  selected Deputy Secretaries of the departments\u2014identified issues to be  further addressed by an executive task force and working groups. The  task force formed\u2014or incorporated\u2014working groups to address several  overall themes identified in the Day 2 report: personnel competencies,  training and development, legal authorities for cooperative conservation,  conflict resolution, the Federal Advisory Committee Act, education, federal  financial assistance, measuring and monitoring, volunteers, engaging the  public, and Web site development.

Through 2007,  with the input of the Office of Personnel Management, this working group  developed a set of collaborative behaviors for federal employees that some  of the agencies have made part of their strategies to hire and train  employees to improve their collaborative skills. According to Interior and  Forest Service officials, senior executive service managers in the agencies  are already rated on their ability to collaborate and collaborative behaviors.  Interior agencies are now considering how to incorporate these into  personnel rating systems for other federal officials and staff, and the Forest  Service has revised its employee rating system and incorporated the  collaborative competencies into the new system for both managers and  employees. In addition, the training and development working group  identified and published appropriate training courses offered by each of the  land and resource management agencies. For example, BLM and the Forest  Service offer a series of courses that include collaborative behavior, and  BLM offers one course that visits a community and trains community and   agency members on how to work as a group. According to a member of  the working group, the idea of an experience-based training, in which staff  would visit and work with an experienced group, has been developed but  none of the agencies have adopted this at the time of our review.  Furthermore, in 2005, CEQ and OMB issued joint guidance, developed by a  broad interagency task force convened by the U.S. Institute for  Environmental Conflict Resolution, to encourage agencies to use  collaborative problem-solving and elaborate on the principles of  collaboration. According to officials, the institute also offers a series of  courses on collaboration that federal agencies can take.", "The twin challenges of determining (1) whether to participate in a  particular collaborative effort and (2) how to sustain federal employees\u2019  participation over time have not been addressed by policies or actions of  the task force or its working groups. However, BLM published a  collaborative guidebook in 2007 that includes a discussion of factors to  consider in determining whether to collaborate. Similarly, the Forest  Service\u2019s Web site links to various partnership assessment tools created by  the Natural Resources Conservation Service and private companies. In  addition, the Forest Service developed an assessment document that  guides an office through an analysis of its workload and how much time it  can devote to a collaborative effort. The results of this analysis can help  determine whether an office will be able to sustain their participation in a  group. Finally, the Forest Service has adopted a tool developed with the  Collaborative Action Team, called a transition memo, which allows an  employee transferring locations to leave detailed documentation about the  community, groups, leaders, and other information for the person coming  into the position. While these separate tools are available to the individual  agency that developed them, they have not been shared or adopted more  broadly among the federal agencies to help them in making decisions  whether and how much to participate in particular collaborative efforts.  Without tools to assess these aspects of collaboration, particularly as the  agencies increase their ability and efforts to participate in collaborative  efforts, agencies may be more likely to get involved in unsuccessful efforts.", "The challenge of measuring participation and monitoring results of  collaborative efforts, as shown in table 3, has been partly addressed by the  measuring and monitoring working group. Through September 2007, the  working group gathered, reviewed, and analyzed tools that measure and  monitor how cooperative conservation activities help achieve  environmental protection and natural resource management goals. For  example, the working group discussed different means to demonstrate the  leveraging power of partnerships and collaboration. Some of these tools  can also help people engaged in partnerships and collaborative efforts  monitor how they are doing and improve their efforts during the process. In  addition, the working group identified a few resources that discuss, in  general, monitoring of natural resource conditions. In October 2007, the  group posted a variety of tools on the Cooperative Conservation Web site,  which is an initial step to address this challenge. However, actions that  would more fully address natural resource monitoring\u2014the Day 2 report  indicated that project monitoring protocols would be useful\u2014have not  been taken by the task force or working groups. CEQ officials indicated  that an ongoing effort on key national indicators might help to address this  aspect of the challenge. However, until guidance or protocols on natural  resource monitoring for collaborative groups is provided, federal agencies  and groups will be unable to track and relate their progress to Congress,  the communities, or other interested parties.", "The challenge of sharing experiences among agencies and groups has been  partly addressed through the actions of the outreach working group, which  has developed an official Web site and examples of collaborative  experiences. In addition, in 2007, the Collaborative Action Team started  WestCAN, facilitating the development of a network of people familiar with  cooperative conservation. Other actions identified in the Day 2 report that  could be taken and would address this challenge include organizing and  supporting annual conservation conferences. As of October 2007, the  agencies had held nationwide listening sessions, but had not held or  proposed any further conferences on cooperative conservation either  nationally or regionally. Federal officials indicated that such meetings can  be expensive and time-consuming to organize and that they would like  others to take the lead in organizing them. They also indicated that it is  important to have clear goals and objectives for such meetings and that the  meetings should lead progressively to achieving these goals and objectives.  Individual agencies have held conferences in the past; they also meet  regularly with nonprofits interested in the collaborative approach through  the Collaborative Action Team. However, these meetings and tools may not  provide the opportunity for the different agencies and groups to meet and  share information and possible solutions, or the face-to-face experiences  that participants in the conference found valuable. Without such meetings,  it would be difficult for the groups to be able to meet periodically to  generate ideas and share information or develop a cooperative  conservation network.", "The challenge of working within the agencies\u2019 legal framework is being  addressed, as shown in table 3, by several actions. At a broad level, the  legal authorities working group worked with the agencies to publish a  compendium, for each department, of the authorities that allow and  support collaboration, which will help agency staff who are working with  collaborative groups to understand the requirements that they face. More  specifically, the status of actions to resolve perceived inconsistencies  between the authorities and collaboration include the following:  The Federal Advisory Committee Act working group is streamlining  requirements for federal advisory groups, which is one of the primary  pieces of legislation that agencies and participants in collaborative  efforts have identified as inconsistent with collaboration. According to  CEQ officials, the Federal Advisory Committee Act team has determined  that flexibility exists within the current law and policy for groups and is  developing the best way to share this information with agency staff and  group participants, such as training.", "A legal analysis of the incentives and disincentives affecting  collaborative groups\u2014particularly those associated with the  Endangered Species Act and NEPA\u2014was an action proposed by the Day  2 report that has not been addressed by the task force or working  groups. In addition, USDA\u2019s and Interior\u2019s different implementation of  ethics rules resulted in inconsistent decisions regarding federal  employees serving on nonprofit boards. While no specific actions have  been taken by the task force, Interior is evaluating regulatory and policy  changes to the Endangered Species Act in response to the concerns  raised during listening sessions held in 2006, and by the Cooperative  Sagebrush Initiative. As of October 2007, Interior had not proposed any  regulatory or policy changes to the Endangered Species Act. Also, in  October 2007, CEQ issued guidance on collaboration within the NEPA  process that discusses using a collaborative group\u2019s option as the  preferred alternative in a NEPA analysis. The guidance resulted from  the recommendation of a federal task force in 2003 and followed the  issuance in 2005 of a report by the National Environmental Conflict  Resolution Advisory Committee concluding that one way to achieve  NEPA goals is for the federal agencies to use environmental conflict  resolution practices, including collaboration. However, no evaluation  or action has occurred as of October 2007 to resolve the inconsistent  application by USDA and Interior of federal ethics rules.", "While these actions are addressing the Federal Advisory Committee Act,  Endangered Species Act, and NEPA, the federal financial assistance  working group did not complete its task of evaluating the extent to which  cooperative funding authorities could be enhanced to better assist  collaboration. Because of the number and complexity of funding  authorities, the working group determined that each department should  undertake an analysis of its own financial assistance to collaborative  groups. Through December 2007, Interior was considering its use of  cooperative agreements and whether they can be used to support partners  to conduct work that is mutually beneficial to the group and Interior  agencies. In such situations, both the partners and the federal agencies  bring resources to the table and both sides benefit from the work jointly  conducted. However, an Interior official noted that laws related to federal  contracting may limit the agencies\u2019 ability to use these agreements in the  absence of specific statutory authority to do so. In September 2007, an  Interior official stated that the type of authority needed is reflected in  authorities provided to the Natural Resources Conservation Service and  other agencies that allow them to work with partners on mutually  beneficial activities. Through September 2007, the Forest Service had  authority to use cooperative agreements with private and public  organizations, including nonprofit groups, to perform forestry protection  activities and other types of cooperative projects that provide mutual  benefits other than monetary considerations to both parties. In addition,  the agency has authority to work on mutually beneficial restoration  projects under the Watershed Enhancement and Restoration Act or Wyden  authority, but this authority is not permanent, extending only to 2011.", "In late December 2007, Congress passed, and the President signed, the  Consolidated Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2008, which included two  provisions related to the agencies and cooperative agreements. The first  provision authorizes Interior to enter into cooperative agreements with  state or local governments, or not-for-profit organizations, if the agreement  will (1) serve a mutual interest of the parties to the agreement in carrying  out Interior\u2019s programs and (2) all parties will contribute resources. The  second provision extended through 2010 the Forest Service\u2019s authority to  enter into cooperative agreements with state, local, and nonprofit groups if  the agreement serves the mutual benefit (other than monetary  consideration) of the parties carrying out programs administered by the  Forest Services and all parties contribute resources. However, the overall  problem of facilitating collaborative partnership projects for collaborative  groups and partners\u2014in terms of interest, cost share, and other  administrative matters\u2014remains. For this reason, an overall evaluation of  federal funding assistance and tools available for collaborative groups  could help to identify the situations across agencies that hinder  collaboration and the potential legal and policy changes that could be  made.", "Overall, the working groups and agencies have made some progress in  developing policies and taking actions that address the challenges they face  in working with collaborative groups. However, these challenges will not  be fully addressed or solved in the short term. As indicated in the Day 2  report, the actions to be taken by federal agencies would require a  sustained effort and a senior policy team with an overall strategy to  sequence the many actions that need to be taken by multiple different  federal agencies. While the Cooperative Conservation initiative is being  coordinated by a task force and working groups, both are temporary,  formed by federal agency personnel interested in the cooperative approach  but who, for the most part, have other full-time responsibilities. Because of  this, the structure and direction\u2014which includes goals, actions, time  frames, and responsibilities\u2014of the initiative as it moves forward are  uncertain. According to CEQ and agency officials, the task force working  groups were organized to propose actions that could be taken in the short  term; CEQ officials said that the senior policy team would meet to assess  the status of actions and progress toward the vision laid out for the  Cooperative Conservation initiative. As of December 2007, the policy team  had not met, but CEQ officials expected they would meet after the issuance  of the second annual report on the implementation of the Cooperative  Conservation initiative. Currently, the task force is developing the report,  which was expected to be issued in January 2008."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Collaborative resource management offers federal land and resource  management agencies a promising tool with which to approach the ongoing  and potential conflicts that arise in managing the nation\u2019s land and  resources. Compared with the alternatives\u2014such as litigation or individual  landowners making independent, potentially conflicting decisions about  their separate parcels of land\u2014collaboration provides groups a way to  integrate multiple interests and achieve common goals. To date, federal  land and resource management agencies have had some success in  working with collaborative efforts. Moreover, the policies put in place  through the Cooperative Conservation initiative move the federal  government and agencies forward in supporting collaborative resource  management efforts. However, based on the challenges that the agencies  face in working with collaborative efforts, additional opportunities exist to  enhance and effectively manage federal agencies\u2019 participation in and  support of ongoing and future collaborative efforts. Specifically, because  federal agencies have limited resources and time, yet at the same time have  multiple opportunities to collaborate, they need to be judicious in their  decisions about collaborating with particular efforts and could benefit from  guidance on how this can be done. This would involve dissemination of  tools that already exist for field offices to assess a community\u2019s capacity for  collaborating, and the federal ability to participate. In addition, because the  agencies are accountable to Congress and the public for achieving their  land and resource management goals, it is important for them to be able to  demonstrate the results that have been accomplished through collaborative  efforts. This means that agencies and groups should be able to measure  participation and monitor their progress, including monitoring the broader  landscape-level effects that result from their collaborative efforts and  projects.", "Furthermore, collaborative resource management is just beginning to  emerge as one approach for federal land and resource agencies to work  with local groups in ways that can reduce conflict and improve resources.", "In addition to developing capability among agency personnel, federal  agency support for this approach entails helping to create networks,  identifying best practices, and generating new ideas. These outcomes can  be achieved though facilitating the exchange of information and lessons  learned among collaborative groups, as was done at the White House  Conference. Federal support also involves an ongoing commitment to  identify practicable legal and policy changes that could enhance  collaboration. In particular, CEQ, OMB, and other federal agencies can  evaluate and identify possible changes to federal financial assistance  authorities and policies that make it difficult to work with partners. Also,  USDA and Interior can identify a way to achieve more consistent results in  determining participation by USDA and Interior employees on nonprofit  boards. In the future, as the agencies participate in different collaborative  efforts, additional situations may arise in which agencies need to seek ways  to implement laws or policies in a manner that enhances collaboration.", "Finally, because collaborative resource management involves multiple  departments and agencies facing common challenges and will take a  sustained effort to implement, it is important that the effort has structure  and long-term direction to ensure that it is ongoing and completed.  Structure could be provided by continuing such an interagency effort as the  Cooperative Conservation task force and its working groups. One way this  could be accomplished would be by developing a memorandum of  understanding between participating agencies. Long-term direction to  address common challenges could be provided by the memorandum of  understanding, or through another organizational document or plan that  will steer the task force, working groups, and agencies toward realizing the  vision of the initiative."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To enhance the federal government\u2019s support of and participation in  collaborative resource management efforts, we recommend that the  Chairman of CEQ, working with the Secretaries of Agriculture and the  Interior, direct the interagency task force to take the following actions: 1.

To  identify relevant articles in the literature, we first interviewed experts who  have studied collaborative resource management. Following GAO\u2019s  methodology for identifying experts, we started with knowledgeable  individuals and agency personnel and asked them for referrals to experts.  In an iterative process, we contacted these experts and asked them for  nominations of other knowledgeable individuals. We interviewed over 20  individuals who could be considered experts, based on the nominations of  others in the field. We asked these experts for references to articles on the  collaborative resource management approach. We also identified articles  through a search of four academic databases including Agricola, a database  of articles relating to aspects of agriculture, forestry, and animal science;  ProQuest Science Journals, a database of science and technology journals  that includes literature on biology and earth science; ECO, a database of  scholarly journals; and BasicBIOSIS, a database of biology and other life  science-related journals. We searched these databases using the terms  \u201cecosystem management policy\u201d and \u201ccollaborative resource management  policy,\u201d which produced over 950 articles in the four databases.

This process yielded over 130  articles (the full article was used, not just the abstract).", "To perform the literature review, one of two analysts (A, B) read and  reviewed each of the articles and indicated whether or not the contents  included themes related to our objectives, that is, the common practices,  benefits, limitations, and critiques of collaboration. The analysts  summarized information from the articles that was relevant to these  themes and recorded it as statements in a database. To verify that the two  analysts were extracting similar information from the articles, the analysts  randomly selected 10 percent (13) of the total articles. For each of these 13  articles, if Analyst A had originally summarized and categorized relevant  information in the article, then Analyst B independently performed the  same tasks. Similarly, Analyst A reviewed the articles originally reviewed  by Analyst B. For each article, the verification work was compared with the  original and it was determined whether both analysts agreed or disagreed  on the presence of information in the article related to each theme. This  analysis indicated that the two analysts were extracting comparable  information from the articles.", "A content analysis was then performed on the statements. Each analyst  classified the statements from the articles read as a benefit, limitation, or  critique associated with collaborative resource management. The analysts  then exchanged data and examined the other analyst\u2019s categorizations to  determine whether there was agreement on classifying each statement  from the literature review into the benefits, limitations, and critiques  categories. The two analysts reviewed the statements they had placed into  these categories and either concurred with the classification or noted the  basis of disagreement.

However, some ranchers are hesitant about making  improvements or working with federal agencies.

Local landowners are concerned about increased human and livestock  interaction with such species. The Challenge began a Carcass Pick-Up  Program in conjunction with the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife  and Parks; the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Partners Program; local ranchers;  and a waste service to remove dead livestock from ranches to deter  bears from searching for such remains.

First, the  Initiative views the creation of a conservation credit trading system as a  potentially significant economic incentive for landowners to engage in  voluntary conservation efforts. This system would allow landowners or  others to earn credits by implementing sagebrush conservation activities.  These credits could then be sold to energy companies or others who may  desire them for a variety of purposes, including mitigating the effect of  development projects elsewhere in sagebrush habitat. The concepts behind  the conservation credit trading system are currently in development and  many of the participants acknowledge that there are significant inherent  difficulties in designing such a system, particularly one that will stand up to  scientific scrutiny. For example, the sagebrush ecosystem is highly  heterogeneous, with varying levels of habitat quality across the range.

Over  time, the group evolved into an information-sharing group to coordinate  land management, but has been relatively inactive in recent years.  Members of the group include state and federal government agencies, a  conservation organization, and industrial (timber) landowners who  together manage two-thirds of the four million acres of the eastern Upper  Peninsula. This area includes the 895,000-acre Hiawatha National Forest,  95,000-acre Seney National Wildlife Refuge, 73,000-acre Pictured Rocks  National Lakeshore, state land, and privately owned land.", "Historically, much of the eastern Upper Peninsula was managed for timber  harvest and most of the region was cut by the early 1900s. In the 1800s,  loggers harvested pine and shifted to hardwoods in the 1900s as pine trees  were cut over. The eastern Upper Peninsula is once again largely forested  with second-growth forests including aspen, white birch, and jack pine. In  recent years, many of the timber companies have been selling their lands.", "Natural Resource Problems  According to group members, there are few contentious issues causing  conflict among land managers and owners in the eastern Upper Peninsula,  but the group saw an opportunity among the large landowners to cooperate  in a manner that could enhance ecosystems across the landscape. Many  members note that the primary outcomes of the group have been educating  partners with information that they can use in their management, sharing  information among the partners, and building relationships. Some of the  particular examples of the Eastern Upper Peninsula group\u2019s coordinated  efforts include the following:   Most of the eastern Upper Peninsula is second-growth forest, with trees  of similar age. Some members of the group sought to establish a mix of  trees of different age classes across the landscape to provide healthy  habitat for species, in particular, neotropical bird species such as the  golden-winged warbler, that use the forests. However, the forest  companies that owned land in the eastern Upper Peninsula were  focused on commodity production rather than habitat health. The  Eastern Upper Peninsula group provided opportunities to educate the  industrial landowners that accommodating neotropical birds on their  land could be done without affecting their financial bottom line. By  coordinating with neighboring landowners to obtain a mix of vegetation  over a larger area, the need for any one landowner to achieve all habitat  objectives on his or her land alone was reduced.", "To support efforts to manage their land in a complementary manner,  members of the group recognized the need for broad-scale mapping that  could be used in looking at the overall landscape. As a result, the group  coordinated to map and categorize land units in the region into areas  with similar physical and biological characteristics, called land type  associations. The land type associations have been used to varying  extent by the partners as a planning tool and for some decision making.  The group was able to reach consensus on the descriptions of the land  classifications, but was unable to agree on the management implications  of the ecological descriptions such as the need to use fire to attain a  particular age variation in the trees. The partners were concerned that  documenting management implications would constrain the activities  they could conduct on their land.", "Many of the Eastern Upper Peninsula group partners have worked together  on individual efforts to enhance their positive effects on the landscape,  discuss compatible management, or preserve land. Examples of such  efforts include the following:  Through the relationship built with the Eastern Upper Peninsula group,  The Nature Conservancy and a timber company were able to reach  agreement on access and save a wetland area from being built over by a  road. The timber company wanted to gain access across a nature  preserve owned by The Nature Conservancy. The Nature Conservancy  originally denied access and the timber company threatened to build a  road across a wetland on its land.

The group began in the late  1990s in response to a decline in the mule deer population on the plateau  that was observed by wildlife officials and hunters. After recognizing that  the mule deer decline was an indicator of a larger ecosystem problem, the  group broadened its focus to restoring and sustaining the ecological, social,  cultural, and economic values of the plateau. The group, which includes  federal agencies, a community group, a state wildlife agency, and utility  companies, has developed a plan, the Uncompahgre Plateau Project Plan,  to guide its efforts.", "Historically, the Uncompahgre Plateau, 75 percent of which is managed by  the BLM, the Forest Service, and the Colorado Division of Wildlife  (CDOW), has had multiple uses including logging, ranching, and recreation  and provides habitat for many wildlife species, including game species.  Commercial logging has occurred on Forest Service land for over a century,  but in recent decades the Forest Service has decreased timber harvest on  the plateau and current logging operations are limited to small sales of logs  and firewood. Both the Forest Service and BLM manage grazing allotments  on the plateau that are tied to privately owned ranches. Recreational use of  the plateau has steadily increased and includes fishing, off-highway vehicle  use, snowmobiling, mountain biking, camping, and cross-country skiing. In  addition, CDOW manages two areas on the plateau for deer and elk  hunting.

According to  natural resource managers, this condition resulted from certain  activities on the plateau such as fire suppression and grazing practices.  The Uncompahgre Plateau Project has initiated landscape-level  planning and restoration efforts across jurisdictional boundaries to  achieve more heterogeneous vegetation across the plateau and bring  vegetation structure, age, condition, and spatial patterns in line with the  habitat needs of wildlife species. The group\u2019s initial planning and  restoration efforts have focused on two watersheds covering over  220,000 acres of BLM, Forest Service, state, and private land and has  included a variety of vegetation treatments such as roller chopping\u2014 using a large round drum to crush the shrubs\u2014and prescribed burning.  As of May 2007, the Uncompahgre Plateau Project completed over 100  restoration projects, covering over 50,000 acres.", "The Uncompahgre Plateau has had problems with invasive species on  both public and private lands. Invasive species alter the ecology in an  area by crowding out native species, changing fire regimes, or altering  hydrologic conditions. To facilitate cooperation among land managers  and private landowners in efforts to manage invasive species, the  Uncompahgre Plateau Project has initiated a program to map, monitor,  control, and prevent invasive species within designated weed  management areas on over 350,000 acres.", "The Uncompahgre Plateau is a key location for east to west  transmission lines connecting Rocky Mountain power sources with  western markets such as Los Angeles. As a result of the Energy Policy  Act of 2005, transmission line operators must ensure that their power  lines remain reliable. Forested rights-of-way pose threats to reliability  because of the potential for tall trees to fall on the lines, arcing from the  power line to trees, and forest fires. Traditionally, power line rights-of- way have been clear-cut to remove tall trees underneath and adjacent to  the power lines, which has historically generated conflict between  utilities and land managers, according to a utility official. While this  practice removes the threat to power lines directly posed by these trees,  it can damage habitat and ecosystem health and the risk from forest  fires still remains. Through the Uncompahgre Plateau Project, the utility  companies and land management agencies have worked together to  treat vegetation outside of the utility rights-of-way in order to reduce the  risk of forest fires and threats to the power lines in a manner that  creates more natural openings that are friendly to wildlife. This is  accomplished through means such as creating undulating boundaries  between treated and untreated vegetation, instead of straight lines.  According to a group member, these treatment techniques are being  used as a model for other utilities across the country.", "When conducting restoration projects, land managers working on the  Uncompahgre Plateau want to replant with vegetation that is native to  the plateau because it is better adapted to the local conditions and can  improve the success of restoration projects. However, there is not a  sufficient supply of native seeds available on the commercial market for  large-scale restoration projects on the Uncompahgre Plateau. In  response, the Uncompahgre Plateau Project initiated a native plant  program to collect, study, and produce native seeds that can be used to  facilitate restoration projects. According to a group member, it has  gathered native seeds for over 50 plants and developed methods for  propagating these.
