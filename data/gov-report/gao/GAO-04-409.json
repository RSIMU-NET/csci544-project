In 2002 two key events transformed DOD's approach in this area: (1) the Secretary of Defense consolidated existing missile defense elements into a single acquisition program and placed them under the management of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and (2) the President directed MDA to begin fielding an initial configuration, or block, of missile defense capabilities in 2004. MDA estimates it will need $53 billion between fiscal years 2004 and 2009 to continue the development, fielding, and evolution of ballistic missile defenses. To fulfill a congressional mandate, GAO assessed the extent to which MDA achieved program goals in fiscal year 2003. While conducting this review, GAO also observed shortcomings in how MDA defines its goals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["MDA accomplished many activities in fiscal year 2003--such as software development, ground and flight testing, and the construction of facilities at Fort Greely, Alaska--leading up to the fielding of the initial block of the Ballistic Missile Defense System. During this time, however, MDA experienced schedule delays and testing setbacks, resulting in the fielding of fewer components than planned in the 2004-2005 time frame. For example, delays in interceptor development and delivery have caused flight tests (intercept attempts) of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) element to slip over 10 months. In flight tests conducted during fiscal year 2003, MDA achieved a 50 percent success rate in intercepting target missiles. While MDA is increasing the operational realism of its developmental flight tests--e.g., employing an operational crew during its late 2003 ship-based intercept attempt--the GMD element has not been tested under unscripted, operationally realistic conditions. Therefore, MDA faces the challenge of demonstrating whether the capabilities being fielded, consisting primarily of the GMD element, will perform as intended when the system becomes operational in 2004. Finally, MDA's cost performance during fiscal year 2003 was mixed. The prime contractors of four system elements completed work at or near budgeted costs during this time, but prime contractors for two system elements overran budgeted costs by a total of about $380 million. GAO found that program goals do not serve as a reliable and complete baseline for accountability purposes and investment decision making because they can vary year to year, do not include all costs, and are based on assumptions about performance not explicitly stated. For example, between its budget requests for fiscal years 2004 and 2005, MDA revised its estimated cost for the first fielded block of missile defense capability. This first block is costing $1.12 billion more and consists of fewer fielded components than that planned a year earlier. In addition, MDA's acquisition reports for Congress do not include life-cycle costs, which normally provide explicit estimates for inventory procurement, military construction, operations, and maintenance. Finally, MDA does not explain some critical assumptions-- such as an enemy's type and number of decoys--underlying its performance goals. As a result, decision makers in DOD and Congress do not have a full understanding of the overall cost of developing and fielding the Ballistic Missile Defense System and what the system's true capabilities will be."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) has been making significant  investments in the development of ballistic missile defenses for decades.

It estimates that it will need $53 billion between fiscal years  2004 and 2009 to continue the development, fielding, and evolution of  ballistic missile defenses.", "During the past 2 years, DOD significantly transformed the approach it  takes in acquiring ballistic missile defenses. In January 2002, the Secretary  of Defense refocused the ballistic missile defense program into a broad- based research and development effort managed by the Missile Defense  Agency (MDA). The Secretary granted MDA flexibility to employ a  \u201ccapability-based,\u201d evolutionary approach for the development of these  defenses. Under this new approach, MDA defines, develops, and fields  operational capabilities\u2014in 2-year blocks\u2014of a single, multilayered,  overarching system referred to as the Ballistic Missile Defense System  (BMDS). The system has no fixed design or final architecture. The  Secretary of Defense also gave MDA management responsibility over the  existing ballistic missile defense programs already under development by  the military services.

IDO is  expected to provide the United States protection against limited long-range  ballistic missile attacks from Northeast Asia. MDA will enhance this  capability to complete the first increment of the BMDS\u2014known as the  Block 2004 defensive capability\u2014by the end of December 2005.

The act also directed us to assess, at the conclusion of  each of fiscal years 2002 and 2003, the extent to which MDA achieved the  goals it established. Because the agency had not established goals in fiscal  year 2002, we were unable to assess its progress for that year. However,  MDA did establish schedule, testing, performance, and cost goals for its  Block 2004 program and submitted them to Congress in February 2003 with  its fiscal year 2004 budget and in April 2003 with its Selected Acquisition  Report for the BMDS. The goals describe the composition of the block  configuration under development; provide the costs and schedule  associated with developing, testing, and fielding the Block 2004 BMDS; and  summarize the performance capabilities that MDA expects to achieve with  the Block 2004 defensive capability.", "To fulfill the congressional mandate in the Authorization Act, we addressed  the following question in this report: To what extent has MDA and its  elements progressed in achieving stated goals through their fiscal year 2003  activities?

We compared each element\u2019s actual cost,  completed activities, demonstrated performance, and test results with their  internal fiscal year 2003 cost, schedule, performance, and testing goals.", "To assess progress toward program schedule goals, we examined, for each  element, prime contractor Cost Performance Reports, the Defense  Contract Management Agency\u2019s analyses of these reports, System Element  Reviews, and other agency documents to determine whether key activities  scheduled for the fiscal year were accomplished as planned. We also  developed a data collection instrument to gather additional, detailed  information on completed program activities, including tests, design  reviews, prime contracts, and estimates of element performance.", "Because MDA allocates a large percentage of its budget to fund prime  contractors that develop system elements, and because MDA\u2019s cost goal did  not apply to fiscal year 2003 expenditures, we limited our review of cost- related matters to assessments of prime contractor cost performance. To  make these assessments, we applied earned value analysis techniques to  data captured in contractor Cost Performance Reports. We compared the  cost of work completed with the budgeted costs for scheduled work for the  fiscal year 2003 period. Results were presented in graphical form to  determine fiscal year 2003 trends.

Estimated costs for Block 2008 decreased by $8.33 billion, from $16.27  billion to $7.93 billion.

That is, DOD is required only to operationally test a major defense  acquisition program such as the ballistic missile defense system to assist in  the decision as to whether to enter full-rate production. However, because  of the capability-based structure under which MDA is operating, the  decision to enter full-rate production will not be made in the foreseeable  future and, in fact, may never occur. Given that significant resources have  already been expended to procure inventory and field the system, and  given that decision makers are continually being asked to invest further in  the system, we believe DOD should provide evidence from independent,  objective testing that the system will protect the United States as intended  in an operationally representative environment.", "In not concurring with our first recommendation, DOD also stated that  MDA is attempting to incorporate operational test objectives into  developmental tests. For example, MDA conducted an Aegis BMD intercept  test in December 2003 that included some conditions likely to be  encountered during an armed conflict. However, as noted in our recent  report on missile defense testing, MDA has not yet begun to incorporate  operational realism on tests of the GMD element, which provides the bulk  of the initial BMDS capability. GMD flight tests leading up to IDO are  constrained by range limitations, are developmental in nature and,  accordingly, are executed with engagement conditions that are repetitive  and scripted. It is unlikely that MDA will be able to make developmental  tests completely operationally realistic. Developmental tests are, by  definition, conducted under controlled conditions so that the cause of  design problems can be more easily identified and fixed and the  achievement of technical performance specifications can be verified.  Additionally, because operational test conditions are more stressing,  operational testing provides an opportunity to identify problems or  deficiencies that might not be revealed in developmental tests but need to  be addressed in subsequent BMDS blocks.", "In not concurring with our second recommendation, DOD stated that  DOT&E already has statutory responsibility for reviewing and approving  operational test plans but is prohibited from approving plans for  developmental testing. However, our recommendation is based on our view  that the block configurations being fielded should be operationally tested.  These tests would not be the developmental tests for which DOT&E is  prohibited from approving.

In responding to this recommendation, DOD cited the existing  statutory reporting requirements for DOT&E, under which it has assessed  the MDA test program. However, for the reasons cited above, we continue  to believe that operational tests of the BMDS configurations being fielded  are needed. The statutory requirement for operational testing and for  DOT&E\u2019s reporting responsibilities is not clearly triggered by the fielding of  block configurations that do not involve a full-rate production decision.  Also, although we recognize that DOT&E is providing an annual  assessment of the BMDS to defense committees each year, we believe this  assessment is limited.

The plan allows  the contractor to earn up to 50 percent of a potential cost under-run if it can  deliver the two satellites (1) up to 6 months early, (2) for less than the  negotiated cost, and (3) meeting all orbit performance requirements. As a  direct result of this incentive, the contractor elected to implement a  performance measurement baseline that reflected a 6-month accelerated  schedule.
