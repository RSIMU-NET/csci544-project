Recognizing this, DHS's fiscal year 2006 appropriations act required its Chief Information Officer (CIO) to submit a report to congressional appropriations committees that includes, among other things, an IT human capital plan, and the act directs GAO to review the report. GAO's review addressed (1) whether the IT human capital plan is consistent with federal guidance and associated best practices and (2) the status of the plan's implementation. In performing its review, GAO compared DHS's plan and supporting documentation with 27 practices in the Human Capital Assessment and Accountability Framework of the Office of Personnel Management, and examined plan implementation activities at three DHS component agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DHS's IT human capital plan is largely consistent with federal guidance and associated best practices; however, it does not fully address a number of important practices that GAO examined. Specifically, the plan and supporting documentation fully address 15 practices; for example, they provide for developing a complete inventory of existing staff skills, identifying IT skills that will be needed to achieve agency goals, determining skill gaps, and developing plans to address such gaps. They also provides for involving key stakeholders--such as the CIO, the Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO), and component agency CIOs and human capital directors--in carrying out the skill gap analyses and other workforce planning activities. Nevertheless, elements of 12 of the 27 practices are not included in the plan or related documentation. For example, although the plan and supporting documents describe the department's IT human capital goals and steps necessary to implement them, most steps do not include associated milestones. In addition, although the plan and supporting documents provide for involving key stakeholders, they do not specifically assign these stakeholders responsibility and accountability for carrying out planned activities. These and other missing elements of the practices are important because they help ensure that the plan is implemented efficiently and effectively. DHS officials provided various reasons why the missing practices were omitted, including uncertainty surrounding the source of resources for implementing the plan and the demands of other IT priorities, such as consolidating component agency data centers. To date, DHS has made limited progress in implementing the plan, according to officials from the offices of the department's CIO and CHCO and three DHS agencies (the Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency). These officials said that they are nonetheless following several of the practices because they are required to report quarterly to the Office of Management and Budget on progress in meeting such human capital goals as filling mission-critical positions and delivering key IT training. DHS officials stated that the department's limited progress in implementing the plan was due to its focus on other priorities, and ambiguity surrounding plan implementation roles and responsibilities. Until DHS has a complete plan that fully addresses all practices and the department and components implement the plan, DHS will continue to be at risk of not having sufficient people with the right knowledge, skills, and abilities to manage and deliver the IT systems that are essential to executing the department's mission and achieving its transformation goals."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Information technology (IT) is a critical tool in the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) quest to transform 22 diverse and distinct  agencies into 1 cohesive, high-performing department.

For fiscal year   2008 alone, the department is requesting almost $4 billion in IT budgetary  authority. The department\u2019s ability to effectively and efficiently invest  these funds and deliver IT systems and infrastructure that perform as  intended depends in large part on the capabilities of its IT human capital.  As we have reported, DHS and the other federal agencies historically have  been challenged in their ability to strategically manage human capital.

More  specifically, the management directive of the DHS Office of the CIO\u2019s  states that the office is responsible for leveraging the best available  technologies and applying proven IT management and human capital  practices to provide shared services, coordinate acquisition strategies,  maintain an enterprise architecture, and advocate and enable business  transformation, among other things. To assist in managing these matters,  DHS established the DHS CIO Council made up of the CIOs from each of  DHS\u2019s component organizations. The council identified eight priorities,  including IT human capital, and for each priority, it assigned an executive  sponsor that is responsible for overseeing the department\u2019s efforts in that  area. The council also established the IT Human Capital Resource Center  (formerly called the IT Human Capital Center of Excellence) to support  the council and the executive sponsor responsible for IT human capital. In  short, the center is responsible for setting a DHS-wide vision and strategy  for IT human capital and the functions that IT staff perform. The center is  staffed by the component CIO organizations and, among other things, is  responsible for coordinating the implementation of the department\u2019s IT  human capital initiatives. Figure 1 shows a simplified and partial DHS  organizational structure, including the CIO IT human capital-related  entities.", "According to the DHS overall strategic human capital plan, which covers  IT and non-IT personnel, the Office of the CHCO is responsible for  implementing initiatives to achieve strategic human capital goals in  support of the department\u2019s mission. With regard to IT, this includes  planning and managing human capital to meet current and future mission  needs, recruiting a high-quality workforce, developing a strong and  capable workforce, motivating and retaining high performers, and  fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement. It also  includes applying human capital best practices in carrying out these  responsibilities.", "Each of the department\u2019s component agencies has its own CIO and human  capital director to, among other things, manage the implementation of  their respective IT human capital initiatives.

This need is compounded by the fact that the  department faces major near-term IT human capital challenges. For  example, DHS estimates that between 2005 and 2010, approximately   35 percent of its IT workforce will be eligible for retirement. Moreover, it  reports that in light of the continued growth in demand of experienced IT  professionals and the high rate of turnover experienced thus far, the  department faces significant risk of critical skill shortages, which could  hamper its mission imperatives.", "During the last 3 years, we have reported on the importance of DHS  adopting a strategic approach to addressing its IT human capital  challenges. For example, in August 2004, we reported that DHS had  begun strategic planning for IT human capital at the headquarters level,  but it had not yet systematically gathered baseline data about its existing  workforce. We also reported on CIO staffing concerns and slow progress  in this area. Accordingly, we recommended that the department analyze  whether it had appropriately allocated and deployed IT staff with the  relevant skills to obtain its institutional and program-related goals. In  response, the DHS CIO approved funding for the IT Human Capital  Resource Center in July 2004. Among other things, the center subsequently  began work to complete an IT human capital plan. Consistent with our  recommendation, the center was to ensure that the completed plan  provided for an analysis of IT workforce skill sets. In May 2005, the DHS  CIO issued a draft version of the IT human capital plan. This draft version  was sent to the Senate and House Appropriations Committees on August  30, 2006, as part of the CIO\u2019s report pursuant to requirements in DHS\u2019s  fiscal year 2006 appropriations act.

We noted that DHS had undertaken a  departmentwide human capital initiative, MAXHR, which was to provide  greater flexibility and accountability in the way employees are paid,  developed, evaluated, afforded due process, and represented by labor  organizations. Part of this initiative involved the development of  departmentwide workforce competencies. We testified that the  department had intended to implement MAXHR in the summer of 2005 but  had encountered delays. More recently, DHS officials stated that MAXHR  had been canceled and is to be replaced by another initiative called the  Human Capital Operational Plan. In May 2007, we reported that while  DHS continues work to develop and implement departmentwide human  capital initiatives, its overall progress in managing its IT and non-IT human  capital had been limited.", "Since 2002, we have also reported on human capital management  weaknesses associated with key DHS IT programs. For example:  In September 2005, we reported that the program office for the Atlas  program was not adequately staffed. Accordingly, we recommended that  the Atlas program conduct a staffing needs assessment to determine the  positions and the level of staffing needed for all Atlas projects, and that it  develop a human capital strategy for meeting its staffing needs. DHS  agreed with our recommendations and has since completed a needs  assessment, developed a human capital strategy, and used it to staff the  program office and projects.", "In February 2006, we reported that the US-VISIT program had developed  a human capital strategy, as we had recommended 2 years earlier, and  had begun implementing it. However, we also reported that several  activities in the plan had not been implemented, such as assessing the  extent of current employees\u2019 competency gaps and developing a listing of  competency-based training courses. To address this shortfall, among other  things, the program recently developed a new human capital plan. We have  not yet reviewed the new plan.", "In May 2006, we reported that the Automated Commercial Environment  (ACE) program had yet to develop and implement a human capital  management strategy, as we had recommended several years earlier.  Instead, program officials told us that they were following a less formal  approach to bolstering ACE\u2019s workforce.

More specifically, the plan identifies  such IT human capital goals as meeting current and future mission needs,  recruiting a high-quality IT workforce, and motivating and retaining high  performers. The plan further states that IT human capital programs and  initiatives should produce performance outcomes that support the overall  DHS strategic goal of operational excellence. In addition, the plan calls for  involving key stakeholders\u2014such as the CIO, the CHCO, and their  component agency counterparts\u2014in carrying out a range of workforce  planning activities, such as conducting a workforce analysis, developing  an inventory of current staff skills, and identifying the future skills that are  needed for mission-critical positions. By addressing these key practices,  the plan helps set the overall direction and tone for strategic management  of IT human capital and lays a foundation for demonstrating management  commitment and promoting buy-in across the organization.", "However, the plan and related documentation do not fully satisfy other  key practices. For example, they do not include specific milestones for  when most defined activities and steps are to be completed. This is a  serious limitation because milestones help to ensure that resources  needed to execute plans are allocated, and they provide a basis for  measuring progress. In addition, although the plan provides for involving  key stakeholders, it does not assign stakeholders responsibility and  accountability for specific activities. Without fully addressing these  practices, the plan does not provide an adequate basis for promoting  accountability for results, and thus ensuring that the plan will be  effectively implemented.", "Workforce planning and deployment. The plan and related documentation  satisfy a number of key practices in this standards area, including  provision for incentives for new recruits, training for existing staff, and an  exchange program to draw on private sector personnel with necessary  skills. This is important because such practices are essential ingredients to  acquiring, training, and deploying an effective workforce. However, the  plan does not provide for regular collection and analysis of data on  promotions, conversions, separations, and retirements to show an  understanding of trends and related indicators of performance. Without  this information, DHS will be limited in its ability to know whether the  techniques being employed are effective, and thus performance results and  accountability goals are being met.", "Leadership and knowledge management. DHS\u2019s plan and supporting  documentation provide for a number of leadership and knowledge  management practices. For example, DHS planning documents (e.g., DHS  Succession Management Plan FY 2006\u20132009) supporting the IT human  capital plan describe and encourage leadership development across all  DHS components through application of the department\u2019s Leadership  Competency Framework and succession approach to workforce planning  efforts. The plan also identifies succession planning goals and objectives,  implementation strategies, and program evaluation critical success factors  to achieve expected leadership outcomes. These efforts are important  because they show how the department and components plan for and  minimize the impact of changes to its leadership team arising from  retirements and separations.", "However, the plan does not address how these activities are to be linked  to and reflected in department annual performance plans and budgets.  Having performance plans and budgets that address the IT human capital  goals is vital to ensuring that the plan is properly funded to ensure  implementation.", "Results-oriented performance culture. DHS\u2019s plan and supporting  documentation satisfy key practice elements under this standards area,  such as identifying outcome-based human capital goals for its IT  workforce and linking these goals to departmental strategic plans.  However, the plan does not address linking each work unit\u2019s efforts and  performance to these goals. Linking the work units to goals is important  because it provides a framework for setting performance expectations,  determining whether expectations are met, and establishing  accountability, each of which is critical to effective and efficient plan  implementation.", "Talent management. DHS\u2019s plan addresses important practices related to  talent management, including documenting mission-critical occupations,  strategizing how to reduce competency gaps between the workforce\u2019s  current skills and those needed to achieve mission goals, and tracking  efforts to implement strategies. In particular, it provides for a monthly  forum hosted by the IT Human Capital Resource Center for DHS  components to share ideas and strategies for recruitment, retention, and  training of their workforces. These initiatives are important because they  provide a disciplined and systematic approach to identifying and reducing  organizational skill shortfalls, and thus contribute to better ensuring that  DHS has the right people with the right skills. However, neither the plan  nor supporting documents fully provide for measuring whether its  recruitment and training efforts are closing competency gaps. Such  performance measurement is vital to effective plan implementation  because it provides feedback on the effectiveness of efforts and the need  for corrective action.", "Accountability. The plan addresses the key practice for establishing and  using applicable merit principles and standards in appraising IT staff  performance, and for establishing a process for employee grievances to be  considered and addressed. However, the plan does not fully address other  accountability-related practices. For example, it does not provide for  proactively identifying where the department is at risk with regard to  attaining its IT human capital goals and developing initiatives to mitigate  any high risks. This is a significant omission because proactively managing  risks is a proven means for avoiding problems before they can occur.", "According to DHS officials responsible for developing the plan, the 12 key  practices were not fully addressed for several reasons. Specifically, they  stated that uncertainty surrounding the source of resources for  implementing the plan led to a lack of a clear definition of stakeholder  roles and responsibilities, which in turn made setting realistic milestones  impractical. They added that a number of other IT priorities that were  competing for resources, such as consolidation of data centers, also  contributed to the 12 practices not being addressed, while other omissions  were purely an unintended oversight, such as not addressing central  management of risks. According to the officials, the next version of the  plan, which is tentatively scheduled to be released in the second quarter of  fiscal year 2008 based on the assumption that resources are made  available, is to address all of these omissions.", "Without a comprehensive IT human capital plan, DHS does not have an  effective means for ensuring that it has the right people in the right place  at the right time to achieve the department\u2019s mission-related IT goals.

In particular, the  plan itself is in large part silent on implementation roles and  responsibilities as well as implementation accountability mechanisms.  Moreover, as we have previously noted, the plan does not address  important aspects of OPM\u2019s key practices that are implementation related.  To help clarify the plan, including implementation roles and  responsibilities, the DHS CIO Council\u2019s Human Capital Resource Center  developed an implementation briefing and provided it to the CIO Council  members in November 2005. However, the briefing does not assign  specific implementation activities to specific organizations. Rather, it  groups implementation activities into solution sets and then broadly  assigns these sets to department and component agency CIOs, CHCOs,  and human capital directors. As a result, department and component  agency officials told us that they were not clear on who was responsible  for what, particularly with regard to the sources of funding and staff.  Moreover, as we have previously noted, officials for at least one  component agency were not even aware that they were required to  implement it, or what their roles and responsibilities were relative to  implementation.", "The lack of implementation progress can also be attributed to resources  being assigned to competing IT initiatives that were judged to be higher  priorities. According to DHS CIO officials, including the CIO Council  senior executive leading the effort, when it came time to fund  implementation of the plan, the department and components decided to  fund other priorities, such as DHS\u2019s effort to consolidate multiple  component data centers and create a unified departmental network.  Furthermore, the IT Human Capital Resource Center program manager  responsible for implementing the plan resigned in January 2006, and his  replacement left in November 2006. According to DHS CIO and CHCO  officials, the department has not provided funding to fill the position,  which still remains vacant.", "Department and component officials agreed that the IT human capital plan  is largely not implemented. However, they stated that they are nonetheless  following many of the OPM framework practices in the plan as a by- product of fulfilling their periodic reporting requirements to OMB on the  President\u2019s Management Agenda human capital initiatives. Specifically,  the department and its components are required to report quarterly to  OMB on progress in meeting certain human capital goals, such as filling  mission-critical positions and delivering training to strengthen key IT  knowledge, skills, and abilities.

Our analysis showed that efforts related to  this reporting requirement align with about 12 of the 27 practices that we  examined. DHS officials did not disagree with this analysis.

Central to creating and sustaining such a workforce is  developing a comprehensive IT human capital plan that reflects relevant  guidance and best practices, and ensuring that the plan is effectively  implemented. While much of such a plan has been developed, and thus a  planning foundation exists upon which to build, this plan is nevertheless  lacking with respect to relevant guidance and best practices aimed at,  among other things, ensuring that the plan is effectively implemented.  Moreover, actual implementation of the plan to date has been limited, with  much remaining to be accomplished by the department CIO and CHCO  organizations as well as their DHS component agency counterparts. The  status of the plan and its implementation is largely attributable to the lack  of clarity surrounding implementation roles and responsibilities, and the  lack of priority being given to the plan\u2019s implementation relative to  competing IT priorities at the department and component agency levels.  Until DHS has a comprehensive plan and follows through to ensure that it  is effectively implemented departmentwide, it will remain challenged in its  ability to have sufficient people with the right knowledge, skills, and  abilities to effectively leverage technology in support of transformation  and mission goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen DHS\u2019s management of IT human capital, we recommend  that the Secretary of Homeland Security direct the Under Secretary for  Management and the head of each DHS component agency to instruct  their respective CIOs and human capital directors to make development  and implementation of a comprehensive IT human capital plan an  imperative within each organization. In this regard, we recommend that  the Secretary direct the Under Secretary and the component agency heads  to ensure that (1) IT human capital planning efforts fully satisfy relevant  federal guidance and related best practices, (2) roles and responsibilities  for implementing the resulting IT human capital plan and all supporting  plans are clearly defined and understood, (3) resources needed to  effectively and efficiently implement the plans are made available, and  (4) progress in implementing the plans is regularly measured and  periodically reported to DHS leadership and Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, signed by the Director,  Departmental GAO/Office of Inspector General Liaison and reprinted in  appendix III, the department stated that it agreed with our  recommendations.

We evaluated this plan and supporting  documentation against selected practices in the Office of Personnel  Management\u2019s (OPM) Human Capital Assessment and Accountability  Framework. We used this framework because it is the federal guidance  that DHS used in developing its plan, and because the framework reflects  the human capital best practices in GAO\u2019s strategic human capital model.  In addition, this framework provides a method for assessing the adequacy  of a human capital plan. In applying this method, we focused on 27  practices in the framework that are essential to a well-defined and useful  plan and that span the six standards areas in the framework. We also  validated our use of the 27 practices with OPM.", "Using the framework\u2019s method, we compared the DHS IT human capital  plan and supporting documentation with each of the elements comprising  the 27 practices.

In performing our comparative analysis, we determined if  the practice was fully satisfied, partially satisfied, or not satisfied. For  purposes of this review, we defined \u201cfully satisfied\u201d to mean that the  agency demonstrated, through verifiable evidence, that it had addressed  all aspects of the key practice; \u201cpartially satisfied\u201d to mean that such  evidence showed that some, but not all, aspects of the key practice had  been addressed; and \u201cnot satisfied\u201d to mean that such evidence showed  that none of the aspects of the key practice had been addressed.", "In addition, we shared all of our preliminary determinations with officials  from the DHS CIO Council and the DHS Office of the CHCO and provided  them with an opportunity to comment on these determinations.
