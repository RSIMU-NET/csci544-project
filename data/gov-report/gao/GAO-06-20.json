However, this estimate is not a measure of the number of pending cases older than 6 months--the definition of backlog used by the Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvements Act of 2000. USCIS's current data systems cannot provide precise data on the age of all application types. A proposed technology transformation offers an opportunity to develop a case management system with this capability. USCIS has reduced its backlog mainly by increasing and realigning staff. To prevent future backlogs, USCIS will rely on additional staffing reallocation and technology transformation. However, the technology plan is in the early planning stages, and USCIS has not finalized its estimated cost or identified the gains it could yield. Despite progress, it is unlikely that USCIS will completely eliminate the backlog by the 2006 deadline. While it met fiscal year 2006 targets for half of the 15 backlogged application types, USCIS may have difficulty eliminating its backlog for two complex application types that constitute nearly three-quarters of the backlog. A backlog may also remain in offices where the volume of cases exceeds adjudicator staff capacity. Other factors, such as lengthy background checks, could also hinder USCIS's ability to achieve and maintain its backlog elimination goals. USCIS officials noted that its current plan is premised on current legislation and would be affected by proposed legislative changes that could impose additional demands on the agency. Aside from regular supervisory review, USCIS operates two programs to ensure the quality of its postadjudication decisions, yet neither program provides a systematic and inclusive review of all application types. One program reviews adjudicators' compliance with standard processes for two application types, and the other evaluates compliance with standard processes and the reasonableness of decisions rendered, but only for selected applications processed in four centers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2004 nearly 6 million applications were filed by those seeking  an immigration benefit\u2014permission for an alien to live in and in some  cases work either permanently or on a temporary basis in the United  States or to become a citizen. Most immigration benefits can be classified  into one of two major categories, family-based and employment-based.  Family-based requests for benefits are filed by U.S. citizens or permanent  resident aliens to establish their relationships to certain alien relatives  such as spouses, parents, children, or siblings who wish to immigrate to  the United States. Employment-based petitions include petitions filed by  employers for aliens to come to the United States temporarily to perform  services or labor or to receive training and for alien workers to become  permanent residents in the United States. Petitions can be filed on behalf  of aliens outside of the United States who wish to enter the country and on  behalf of aliens already in the United States who wish to change from one  immigration status to another, such as from a visitor to a temporary  worker. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS),  within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), collects fees for  processing most types of applications and petitions.", "In the past we have reported that some applications and petitions\u2014benefit  applications\u2014have taken 2 years or longer to process, resulting in  backlogs of pending applications. Recurring backlogs of benefit  applications have been a long-standing problem for the former  Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) whose benefit adjudication  functions are now the responsibility of USCIS. USCIS inherited this  backlog problem which has created hardships for immigrants, their  families, and prospective employers seeking immigrant workers. Families  are kept apart and businesses are denied the expertise of skilled workers  when applicants are subjected to long application-processing wait times.  Moreover, critics have suggested that large backlogs of benefit  applications create incentives for individuals and businesses to  circumvent established legal procedures.", "In past years, INS allocated a portion of its appropriation to agency  initiatives to reduce the backlog of pending benefit applications. The funds  for this effort included $176 million in fiscal year 1999, $124 million in  fiscal year 2000, and $35 million in fiscal year 2001, in addition to the fees  it was authorized to collect for processing benefit applications. Further, in  October 2000, the Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvements  Act of 2000 mandated INS to develop a plan to eliminate its backlog of  benefit applications. The act defines backlog as the period of time in  excess of 180 days (6 months) that an immigration benefit application has  been pending before the agency\u2014that is, the backlog consists of  applications that have not been adjudicated within 6 months of filing.  Beginning in fiscal year 2002, the administration sought and received  appropriations sufficient to fund a 5-year, $500 million initiative to obtain a  universal 6-month processing standard for all immigration benefit  applications and petitions. At the end of 2003, USCIS still had over 6  million immigration benefit applications awaiting adjudication\u2014which  included about 3.7 million applications reported as backlog. In March 2002  USCIS published a plan (which was updated in June 2004) to eliminate its  backlog by the end of fiscal year 2006. USCIS officials noted that this plan  is based on the assumption that the agency will continue to operate under  current laws and that if any new legislation, such as a proposed guest  worker program, is enacted before the end of fiscal year 2006 without  provisions for resources to carry out new responsibilities, the agency\u2019s  ability to eliminate the backlog could be compromised. In addition to  presenting strategies for backlog elimination, the plan acknowledged the  importance of balancing its focus on reducing the backlog with its efforts  to ensure adjudicative quality, stating that it is imperative that the integrity  of the process not be compromised by efforts to stimulate productivity.", "You asked us to review USCIS\u2019s implementation of its backlog elimination  efforts, including the current status and size of the backlog, and the  agency\u2019s actions and plans to address the backlog while ensuring  consistent and high-quality adjudication decisions. This report addresses  the following questions:    What is the current status of USCIS\u2019s backlog of unadjudicated  applications for immigration benefits?", "What actions has USCIS taken to eliminate the backlog by September  30, 2006, and prevent future backlogs?", "Is USCIS likely to eliminate the backlog by September 30, 2006?", "How does USCIS ensure the quality and consistency of adjudicator  decisions while eliminating the backlog?", "To determine the status of USCIS\u2019s backlog, we interviewed agency  officials and reviewed USCIS\u2019s backlog elimination plans and updates  along with the agency\u2019s supporting analyses and compared them with the  statutory definition of backlog in the Immigration Services and  Infrastructure Improvements Act of 2000. To identify actions USCIS has  taken to eliminate the backlog, we interviewed USCIS officials in  headquarters and 10 field offices that were selected generally on the basis  of workload volume, staffing levels, and backlog levels. Because we  selected a nonprobability sample of field offices to visit, the results from  our interviews with USCIS officials in these offices cannot be generalized  to USCIS offices nationwide. Where possible, we corroborated their  responses with agency data that we assessed for reliability and determined  were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We also collected information  on USCIS\u2019s efforts to prevent future backlogs from USCIS\u2019s planning  documents on staffing, budget, and information technology modernization.  To estimate the likelihood that USCIS would eliminate the backlog on  time, we tracked and compared the agency\u2019s progress in reducing its  workload with the targets USCIS established and identified factors that  could affect USCIS\u2019s ability to complete all applications within 6 months  or less. To determine how USCIS ensures the quality and consistency of  adjudicator decisions, we examined USCIS\u2019s two quality assurance  programs and resulting outcomes, and we reviewed the findings and  recommendations of an independent study of USCIS\u2019s quality assurance  programs.

USCIS carries out its service  function through a network of field offices consisting of a National  Benefits Center, which serves as a central processing hub for certain  benefit applications and utilizes secured depositories in Chicago, Illinois,  and Los Angeles, California, to collect fees; 4 service centers, which  generally adjudicate applications that do not require interviews with the  applicants; 78 district and local offices; 31 international offices and 8  asylum offices, which generally adjudicate applications that require  interviews; and 129 application support centers, which collect and process  biometric information. Appendix II contains a detailed discussion of  USCIS\u2019s organizational structure. USCIS\u2019s application-processing  procedures vary by application type and by office. Figures 1 and 2 depict  the agency\u2019s process for adjudicating naturalization and adjustment of  status applications\u2014its two most common and complex application types.", "In general, the following tasks are involved in application processing: (1)  collect and deposit application fees and issue receipts to applicants; (2)  create or request existing alien files; (3) enter applicant data into an  automated system; (4) take applicants\u2019 fingerprints and send them to the  Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for a criminal history check,  including a criminal history check based on the applicant\u2019s name (if  required by the type of application); (5) review application, and other  supporting documents, such as FBI fingerprint check results, marriage  certificates, or court dispositions of an arrest; (6) interview applicants (if  required by the type of application); (7) administer naturalization tests (for  those applying for naturalization); (8) approve or deny cases; (9) notify  applicants of USCIS\u2019s decisions; or (10) issue a Notice to Appear placing  applicant in removal proceedings; and (11) update USCIS\u2019s automated  systems.", "Although USCIS processes about 50 types of immigration benefit  applications, its backlog elimination efforts have focused on the 15  application types that make up about 94 percent of its workload. Table 1  lists these 15 application types and their purposes.", "In October 2000, the Immigration Services and Infrastructure  Improvements Act mandated INS, the agency previously responsible for  USCIS\u2019s functions, to develop a plan to eliminate its backlog of benefit  applications. The act defines backlog as the period of time in excess of 180  days (6 months) that an immigration benefit application has been pending  before the agency. Moreover, in February 2001, in the President\u2019s fiscal  year 2002 budget, the Administration proposed a universal 6-month  standard for completing adjudication of immigration applications and  supported a 5-year, $500 million initiative to meet this standard. The  President reiterated this goal during a naturalization ceremony on July 10,  2001, saying, \u201cToday, here\u2019s the goal for the INS: a six-month standard  from start to finish for processing applications for immigration. It won\u2019t be  achievable in every case, but it\u2019s the standard of this administration and I  expect the INS to meet it.\u201d", "In May 2001, we reported on the difficulties INS had in managing its  workload, resulting in ever-growing backlogs of applications, despite  growth in staff and budget. For example, although the agency\u2019s efforts to  meet production goals for processing naturalization and adjustment of  status applications did help reduce backlogs in those areas, backlogs for  other application types increased.", "Under a 5-year plan starting in March 2002, INS intended not only to  eliminate the immigration benefit application backlog, but also to achieve  a 6-month processing standard for all applications in every office. The  original plan was to eliminate the backlog in 2 years, with the remaining  years used to invest in information technology in order to prevent future  backlogs. However, in part because of events following the September 11,  2001, terrorist attacks, including attention to national security priorities  and agency reorganization, INS\u2019s resources were diverted from backlog  elimination efforts. For example, adjudicators assumed responsibility for  registering and fingerprinting nationals already living in the United States  from countries identified as potential threats and for overseeing the  student immigration tracking system\u2014functions that have since been  transferred to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) bureau  within DHS. In June 2004, the newly formed USCIS issued a revised  backlog elimination plan that proposed to eliminate the backlog of benefit  applications by September 30, 2006, and to reduce application completion  times to no more than 6 months."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USCIS Estimated a Backlog of About 1.2 Million Unadjudicated Applications as of June 30, 2005", "paragraphs": ["As of June 30, 2005, USCIS estimated it had about 1.2 million cases  remaining in its backlog, down from 3.7 million at the end of fiscal year  2003. However, USCIS\u2019s operational definition of backlog is different than  the definition contained in the Immigration Services and Infrastructure  Improvements Act of 2000, and its count is not a precise reflection of the  number of cases that have been pending for more than 6 months. USCIS  defines its backlog generally in terms of its pending workload\u2014that is, the  number of applications it has on hand minus the number of applications it  has received during a specified period of time, which is 6 months or less,  depending on the type of application. It has established targets for each  fiscal year for reducing its pending workload, by application type, based  upon its estimate of how much time is required to complete each type.  Table 2 shows these workload targets by application type and fiscal year.", "According to USCIS, the data management systems it currently uses to  manage its backlog elimination efforts cannot comprehensively produce  data to measure and track the time that all applications have been  pending, and therefore the agency cannot readily retrieve information on  the number of applications that have been pending for more than 180 days,  as specified in the definition of backlog in the Immigration Services and  Infrastructure Improvements Act of 2000. Instead, USCIS estimates its  backlog based on the number of pending applications in excess of the  applications it received during the past 6 months. For example, if the  agency had received 100,000 applications for benefits in the most recent 6  months and currently had 120,000 cases awaiting adjudication, it would  report a backlog of 20,000 cases. The agency\u2019s rationale for using this  proxy is that by consistently completing more applications than are filed  each month, the agency should gradually reduce its pending workload of  applications to a level at which it can complete all incoming applications  within the workload targets established for each application type.  Eventually, according to the agency\u2019s backlog elimination plan, as long as  USCIS is processing all applications received within the past 6 months (or  less, depending on the application type\u2019s workload target) there should be  no backlog because those applications awaiting adjudication should be  completed before they become part of the backlog count of applications  pending longer than 6 months. However, USCIS\u2019s definition of backlog  does not guarantee that every applicant requesting a benefit will receive a  decision within 6 months of filing.", "In our previous work on the benefit applications backlog, we noted that  the agency\u2019s automated systems were not complete and reliable enough to  determine how long it actually takes to process specific benefit  applications or to determine the exact size of its backlog. Therefore, we  recommended that the former Immigration and Naturalization Service  develop the capability and begin to calculate and report actual processing  times for applications as soon as reliable automated data are available.  USCIS has agreed that ideally it would prefer to base its backlog  calculations on the actual age of each pending application. However, the  data management system USCIS is currently using to manage its backlog  elimination efforts does not have this capability for most application  types. Since our recommendation, USCIS has identified requirements for  transforming its information technology systems to address deficiencies in  its capabilities. Starting in fiscal year 2002, INS and subsequently USCIS  invested about 2 percent ($10.5 million) of its funds allocated for backlog  elimination in planning for technology improvements. Table 3 shows  USCIS\u2019s annual expenditures from its backlog elimination funds.", "Included in USCIS\u2019s technology transformation effort is the design and  implementation of a new, integrated case management system that should  provide the agency with the capability to produce management reports on  the age of all pending benefit applications. USCIS considers this new case  management system to be one of the most critical components of its  technology transformation and plans to begin implementation in fiscal  year 2006. However, this information technology transformation effort is  still in the early stages of planning, and USCIS does not expect these  systems, including the new case management system, to be fully deployed  before fiscal year 2010.

In addition, USCIS began to implement longer-term strategies to eliminate  the backlog, such as reallocating staff and reprioritizing the order in which  the agency adjudicates petitions for alien relatives. The agency also has  revised its guidance to increase the efficiency of application processing  and has proposed related changes to its regulations. Finally, it has  experimented with different processes to expedite application  adjudication and is considering adopting best practices identified from  those pilot programs. In addition to its efforts to reduce the backlog by  September 30, 2006, the agency has developed a staffing allocation model  and is planning a major transformation of its information technology  systems to prevent future backlogs.

Another approach has been to temporarily detail  adjudicators from overstaffed offices to understaffed offices. For example,  as of September 2005, USCIS officials said that about 50 adjudicators from  central and western region district offices had been detailed to the New  York district office and the Garden City, New Jersey suboffice. In addition,  another 40 adjudicators were detailed to the Atlanta and Miami district  offices.", "USCIS has also reprioritized the order in which it adjudicates petitions for  alien relatives. Because these relatives are subject to annual limits on the  number of available immigration visas, even if USCIS were to find an alien  relative eligible to immigrate, that alien could not immigrate if a visa were  not available. Therefore, in July 2004, USCIS decided to focus its efforts on  adjudicating only those petitions for alien relatives where a visa was  immediately available. According to USCIS, by setting aside those  petitions for which a visa was not immediately available, the agency has  been able to concentrate its efforts on those petitions for alien relatives  who can immigrate immediately. Therefore, USCIS officials say, this  approach has enabled the agency to increase its meaningful completions  of petitions for alien relatives.

In the summer of 2005, USCIS reviewed an  informal sample of pending applications filed at the National Benefits  Center to determine the percentage of adjustment applications that met  the criteria for an interview waiver and found that about 20 percent met  the criteria. In July 2005, USCIS began directing adjustment of status  application packages that met the interview waiver criteria to the  California service center for adjudication.

Currently, federal regulations require USCIS to  issue an RFE when initial evidence or eligibility information is missing  from an application or petition, and in each case, USCIS is required to  provide applicants with 12 weeks to respond. USCIS also has the  discretion to issue an RFE for additional evidence and must give  applicants 12 weeks to respond. Additionally, in some cases, federal  regulations require USCIS to issue a NOID before denying benefits. These  regulations normally require that applicants be given 30 days to respond to  a NOID. In November 2004, a proposed rule was published in the Federal  Register that would generally give USCIS discretion to issue an RFE or  NOID and would allow USCIS to determine whether additional  information is required to decide cases. Additionally, the rule proposes to  replace the current 12-week response period with a more flexible  approach that would allow USCIS to set deadlines based on factors such  as type of benefit requested or type of application or petition filed. USCIS  officials expect that reducing the number of RFEs and NOIDs required to  be issued will reduce the average case-processing time by reducing the  time a case is held awaiting decision and decreasing administrative  burden. However, in commenting on the proposed rule, the American  Immigration Lawyers Association expressed concern that USCIS is placing  a higher priority on streamlining processes than on maintaining due  process protections for applicants. In its comments, the association said  that the proposed rule has no safeguards for ensuring that cases will be  fairly adjudicated and that denying applications instead of giving  applicants an opportunity to submit additional evidence results in a  significant growth of arbitrary and capricious decisions.

Among issues covered in this guidance are  appropriate circumstances to approve and deny benefits without issuing  an RFE or NOID and how to choose between RFEs and NOIDs. Further,  the guidance included instructions to limit RFEs and NOIDs to specific  items of missing evidence.

Each sought to streamline and  accelerate application processing by shifting aspects of processing  responsibility from the National Benefits Center to the district offices.  Besides reducing the backlog, one of the advantages of the ability to  process adjustments of status within 90 days is reducing issuance of  interim documents such as travel documents and employment  authorizations. USCIS is generally required by regulation to grant interim  employment authorization documents to applicants whose adjustment of  status applications have not been adjudicated within 90 days.

The New York pilot also placed particular emphasis on fraud  deterrence. USCIS ultimately determined that the New York pilot was  unsuccessful and terminated it, because, among other things, it failed to  facilitate the adjudication of the majority of applications within 90 days  and presented a fairness issue for earlier-filed cases.", "The Dallas pilot employed an up-front processing model that allowed  applicants to be interviewed on the same day the application was filed.  Data from Dallas showed that adjustment of status applications were  completed, on average, within 90 days in 58 percent of cases where  applications were processed using this up-front processing model.  Moreover, according to the June 2005 CIS Ombudsman report, during the  last weeks reported, the Dallas office was processing 71 percent of  applications within 90 days, using the up-front processing model. Further,  the Ombudsman\u2019s report indicated that USCIS issued fewer interim  benefits using the up-front processing model\u2014approximately 20 percent  of cases compared with approximately 85 percent nationally. Although the  Dallas pilot showed improvements in adjustments of status within 90 days  using the up-front model, USCIS raised several concerns during its  evaluation, including concerns that (1) some inefficiencies resulted from  the fact that information required to process applications was sometimes  incomplete, as was the case when criminal history checks were not  complete; (2) the pilot could not meet the Department of the Treasury\u2019s  regulations requiring fees to be deposited within 24 hours; and (3) there  were equity concerns because the pilot involved processing recently  received applications before those filed earlier.", "Despite concerns USCIS raised in evaluating the Dallas pilot project,  beginning in April 2005, USCIS began a phased implementation of up-front  processing through its National Benefits Center central processing hub.  Using elements of processes tested in the Dallas and New York pilot  projects, USCIS has implemented up-front processing at three district  offices\u2014San Diego, San Antonio, and Buffalo\u2014that did not have a backlog  of adjustment of status applications when implemented. USCIS anticipates  expanding the number of offices on a quarterly basis as they become  current in their processing so that applicants with pending applications  are not disadvantaged. The pilot in Dallas will also continue as long as  USCIS determines that additional information may be gleaned and until  the district office becomes current in processing applications.", "In March 2004, a third adjustment of status pilot for employment-based  applications was implemented at the California service center. The focus  was to adjudicate within 75 days petitions for immigrant workers with  advanced degrees concurrently with the associated applications for  adjustment of status. Included among the pilot\u2019s objectives were to (1)  reduce the issuance of interim benefits to ineligible applicants, (2) identify  frivolous and fraudulent filings designed to obtain interim benefits, and (3)  reduce the number of additional background checks required for  adjudication. This pilot identified eligible applications and initiated  security checks as applications were filed. According to the pilot\u2019s  subsequent evaluation report, when security checks were complete and no  adverse information was detected, USCIS ordered permanent resident  cards for these applicants. During this pilot, USCIS processed about 30  percent of immigration petitions and 25 percent of adjustment of status  applications within the target time frame. As with the other pilots,  processing newly filed petitions and applications before those filed earlier  was a concern. Additionally, USCIS expressed concern about the amount  of time and resources required to manage the pilot, as well as the length of  time it took the FBI to conduct background checks for aliens in certain  high-tech occupations. Ultimately, USCIS deemed the pilot inefficient and  adverse to the service center backlog elimination goals because resources  were diverted from addressing backlogged cases.", "Among the recommendations proposed in its 2005 annual report to  Congress, the CIS Ombudsman advocated that USCIS adopt the up-front  processing model piloted in Dallas for all adjustment of status  applications. The Ombudsman report states that overall the pilots show  that up-front processing does work and is preferable to USCIS\u2019s current  business processes because it can reduce workload, improve completion  rates, enhance customer satisfaction and reduce issuance of interim  benefits. However, according to USCIS officials, the report did not address  the inefficiencies resulting from the delay of required information, the  inability to meet the Department of the Treasury\u2019s deposit regulations, and  the inequity of processing newer applications before those filed earlier  that USCIS identified during the pilot. Moreover, USCIS officials said the  agency does not plan to implement the up-front processing model at  district offices with a backlog of adjustment of status applications,  because of these concerns.", "The 2005 Ombudsman report also noted the indirect effect that reducing  the backlog could have on the fee revenue on which USCIS services are  based. For example, USCIS is required to provide an interim work permit  to applicants whose applications for adjustment of status have not been  adjudicated within 90 days. These interim work permits are valid for 240  days. At their expiration, the applicant must apply, and pay a fee, for a  renewal permit. This process could be repeated if the underlying  application for adjustment of status continues unadjudicated. To the  extent, however, that USCIS efforts are successful in reducing the time for  adjudicating adjustment of status applications, the need for interim work  permits will be correspondingly reduced, as will the fee revenue resulting  from them. The Ombudsman\u2019s report does not estimate the extent of this  lost revenue, but it does estimate that in fiscal year 2004, fee revenue from  all work permit applications (not just interim permit applications) filed in  connection with applications for adjustment of status totaled $135 million,  approximately 10 percent of total USCIS revenue in that year.", "USCIS acknowledges that some revenue loss will result from its backlog  elimination efforts. On the other hand, it expects that elimination of the  backlog will reduce the need for staff assigned to this effort and  consequently result in savings. As applications for interim benefits decline,  savings in processing costs will be realized, although it is unknown  whether they would be commensurate with the loss in revenue.  According to USCIS, revenue loss estimates are under review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USCIS Developed a Staffing Model to Help Prevent Future Backlogs", "paragraphs": ["In May 2005, USCIS finalized a staffing allocation model that addresses  how many and where staff are needed to better match projected  workloads.

As previously discussed, USCIS\u2019s distribution of  adjudicators across field offices does not match the distribution of the  workload across field offices. To rectify this staffing imbalance, USCIS  finalized a staffing allocation model in May 2005 that addresses how many  and where staff are needed to better match projected workloads. For  example, because district offices in the eastern region have the smallest  proportion of staff to workload, the staffing allocation model calls for  about 37 percent of the total needed permanent positions (about 170) to  be filled there. Figure 4 shows the distribution of adjudicator staff in the  regions and the service centers as of January 2005 compared with the  proposed distribution that USCIS believes is required through fiscal year  2007 to maintain productivity and prevent future backlogs.", "This kind of planning is consistent with the principle of integration and  alignment that we have advocated as one of the critical success factors in  human capital planning. As we have previously reported, workforce  planning that is linked to strategic goals and objectives can help agencies  be aware of their current and future needs such as the size of the  workforce and its deployment across the organization. In addition, we  have said that the appropriate geographic and organizational deployment  of employees can further support organizational goals and strategies.", "USCIS has used a significant portion of its funds for backlog elimination  efforts to hire and pay temporary adjudicators. According to USCIS\u2019s  budget director, the agency\u2019s projected fee revenues and spending  authority in fiscal year 2006 are sufficient to absorb the cost of additional  permanent adjudicators called for in the staffing allocation model.  Finally, USCIS officials said that the need for future staffing adjustments  could be offset by future efficiencies gained during its transition to more  robust information technology capabilities. We have previously reported  that leading organizations consider how new initiatives, such as new  technologies, affect human capital in their strategic workforce  documents.

In March 2005, the  Director of USCIS approved the agency\u2019s mission needs statement (MNS),  and in April 2005, the DHS Joint Requirements Council approved the  MNS, which outlines the purpose of technology transformation and the  requirements to address deficiencies in its current information technology  capabilities. The MNS focuses on three modernization efforts: (1)  upgrading information technology infrastructure\u2014including improved  desktops, servers and network computers; (2) creating an integrated  foundation to support data management and business processes among  multiple systems; and (3) developing new business processes\u2014for  example, the ability to adjudicate cases electronically. We have long been  proponents of federal agencies having a strong Chief Information Officer  (CIO) to address information and technology management challenges, and  the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 requires agency heads to designate CIOs to  lead technology reforms. In April 2004, USCIS established an Office of the  Chief Information Officer and in June 2005 began the process of aligning  information technology under the CIO\u2019s authority.", "According to the MNS, the plan to transform USCIS\u2019s information  technology will address several deficiencies in the agency\u2019s current  information technology environment, including (1) inadequate ability to  meet changing business requirements, (2) need for improved efficiency to  maintain processing time goals and prevent the occurrence of backlogs,  (3) inadequate information technology oversight and governance, (4)  inconsistent access and data integrity controls, and (5) paper records  systems that are not cost-effective and do not comply with the paperwork  reduction act. Moreover, the MNS outlines several ways in which  information technology transformation is intended to support the DHS  strategic goals of prevention, service, and organizational excellence. For  example, according to the MNS, by upgrading the technical infrastructure,  USCIS can leverage the improved security features available in newer  operating systems, thereby supporting the objective of the DHS prevention  goal, which aims to ensure the security and integrity of the immigration  system.", "According to the MNS, implementation of the information technology  infrastructure is scheduled to be complete by fiscal year 2011. Prior to the  proposed information technology program, USCIS had begun developing  several information systems to enhance its information technology  capabilities, which are reflected in the MNS. Among the systems are the  Background Check Service, the Biometric Storage System, and an  integrated case management system. These systems are designed to  manage and automate security check information, to store and retrieve  biometric data, and to manage case data in a paperless environment.", "The MNS does not include consideration of whether and to what extent  the proposed technology transformation would be expected to have an  effect on staffing levels and use.

In addition, we have reported that high-performing, client- focused organizations must take into account relationships among people,  processes, and technology. Further, significance in resource  administration is one of the early-stage approval criteria listed in DHS\u2019s  management directive on technology investments.

However, the distribution of adjudicators across field  offices does not match the current distribution of the workload across  field offices. A reason for this staffing imbalance, according to USCIS  officials, is that the agency hired temporary adjudicators for all district  offices to concentrate on adjudicating forms in the backlog while  permanent adjudicators could focus attention on adjudicating new  petitions for alien relatives and prospective spouses and related  applications for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident under  the Legal Immigration Family Equity (LIFE) Act.

The FBI results either indicate no record  of a criminal history or provide the applicant\u2019s criminal history record.", "However, FBI name checks can be far more involved and take more than 6  months to complete. For example, when an applicant\u2019s name matches the  name or alias of someone with a criminal history, the FBI is to perform a  secondary check of multiple databases, which can take up to a month to  complete. A small percentage of cases have to be subjected to a more  intensive file review, which can take more than 6 months.

In addition, USCIS officials said  that it often takes a long time (as much as 4 to 6 months) to clear the  names of immigrant workers with high-tech backgrounds who are  applying to change their status to lawful permanent resident, because,  since September 11, the FBI has become especially interested in carefully  vetting aliens with such backgrounds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Visa Limitations for Immigrants", "paragraphs": ["The availability of visas issued by the Department of State will not affect  the backlog as defined by USCIS because USCIS excludes from its count  of backlog those cases for which a visa is not available. However, it may  result in some applicants having to wait much longer than 6 months before  their benefit is adjudicated. In order to initiate a visa request to have an  alien relative or prospective employee immigrate to the United States, a  qualifying relative or employer must file a petition with USCIS on behalf of  the immigrant. Section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act sets  effective annual limits of 226,000 visas for family-sponsored immigrants  and approximately 148,000 visas for employment-based immigrants. In  addition, the act sets preference levels for both family-based and  employment-based immigrants, which further determine which applicants  receive priority for a visa. Further, section 203(e) of the act states that  family-sponsored and employment-based preference visas should be  issued to eligible immigrants in the order in which a petition on behalf of  each was filed with USCIS. There are also annual numerical limitations  on the number of visas that can be allocated per country under each of the  preference categories. Thus, even if the annual limit for a preference  category has not been exceeded, visas may not be available to immigrants  from countries with high rates of immigration to the United States, such as  China and India, because of the per country limits. Table 6 lists the types  and allocation limits of visas for family- and employer-sponsored  immigrants.", "Until an alien obtains an immigrant visa and enters the United States, or an  alien already in the United States is able to adjust his or her status, the  immigrant will not be able to become a lawful permanent resident.

However, USCIS may not adjudicate any  pending applications for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident  (I-485) when visa numbers have been exhausted for the particular  preference category or country. Since visas must be issued on a first-come,  first-served basis within each priority category, applicants may be inclined  to file an application to adjust status knowing they may remain ineligible  for a benefit for many years. For example, in September 2005, the  Department of State was issuing, under the general family-based  preference limits, visas for unmarried sons and daughters of citizens  whose petitions were filed with USCIS on or before April 15, 2001, and for  brothers and sisters of adult citizens whose petitions were filed with  USCIS on or before December 15, 1993.

The quality  assurance review of naturalization applications covers critical processes  and non-critical processes. Critical processes are generally those that  relate to security procedures, for example documenting fingerprints, IBIS  checks, and name checks. Non-security-related processes such as marking  approved applications with an approval stamp are generally considered  noncritical processes. Figure 9 shows that for the sample of naturalization  applications that were reviewed during fiscal year 2004 and the first and  second quarters of fiscal year 2005, USCIS exceeded the critical and  noncritical processing accuracy goals of 99 percent and 96 percent  respectively.", "The review of adjustment of status applications, like the review of  naturalization applications, includes security system checks and checks on  adjudication processes, but only reports an overall processing accuracy  rate, not the processing accuracy rates for critical processes. USCIS\u2019s  quality assurance reviews reported an overall agencywide processing  accuracy rate of 98.5 percent for the sample of cases examined for the  period January 2005 through March 2005. A study conducted by an  independent management consultant, using sampling methods similar to  those USCIS uses to assess adjudicator compliance with standard  processes, produced similar results as USCIS for naturalization and lower  results for adjustment of status applications. For example, the consultant  found that the overall processing accuracy rate for naturalization  applications was over 98 percent for the cases reviewed at selected district  offices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USCIS\u2019s Service Center Quality Assurance Program Tracks Process Compliance and Evaluates Reasonableness of Adjudication Decisions", "paragraphs": ["Since April 2002, USCIS\u2019s Service Center Operations Division has  performed quality assurance reviews designed to evaluate the quality and  correctness of adjudicative decisions for selected benefit applications filed  exclusively at service centers. This quality assurance review uses the same  guidance as the agencywide program to select cases to review. In general  the number of cases sampled depends upon the number of applications  processed in a given month, and a sample of cases is chosen from the  applications that are available. Two application types were selected for the  initial review\u2014first, applications for adjustment of status and, 6 months  later, applications to extend or change nonimmigrant status. Subsequently,  the service center added other application types to its review including  petitions for alien relatives and petitions for nonimmigrant workers.", "For this review, a sample of case files is selected and independently  reviewed by the quality assurance unit. The review selects cases based on  three types of adjudicative decisions: (1) approvals, (2) denials, and (3)  requests for evidence. Each case file is evaluated for compliance with  processes and procedures and completeness of the administrative actions.  In addition, the reviewer evaluates the reasonableness of the decision  outcome\u2014that is, whether he or she would have made the same decision  given the evidence provided. The Service Center Operations Division has  developed a series of standardized checklists that is used for reporting  purposes. When errors are detected in the review, such as when an IBIS  check is marked as valid on the checklist when in fact the IBIS check had  expired, service center guidance indicates that corrective actions should  be taken. For example, if an erroneous decision was identified during the  review of an approved case, the corrective action could result in the cases  being reopened and the benefit being rescinded. The guidance further  indicates that after the initial quality assurance reviews, a small sample of  previously reviewed cases should be checked a second time by a separate  reviewer to validate the initial results.", "The Service Center Operations Division develops a quality level indicator  by calculating the number of correct decisions identified among the total  number of cases reviewed. According to USCIS, the emphasis of the  program is on using trend analyses to identify and address weaknesses in  administrative decision making rather than meeting a specific  performance target. In fiscal year 2004, the Service Center Operations  Division reviewed three forms\u2014employment-based applications for  adjustment of status, applications to extend or change nonimmigrant  status, and petitions for alien relatives. The rates of correct decisions for  the forms reviewed were 94.3 percent, 95.7 percent, and 93.5 percent  respectively. In the first two quarters of the fiscal year 2005, in addition to  continuing the reviews of adjustments of status and petitions for alien  relatives, USCIS added petitions for nonimmigrant workers.

In addition it recommended that that USCIS focus fewer  resources on naturalization applications in offices that consistently meet  the quality goal and spend resources on the new adjustment of status  application review because the review shows compliance was lower for  this application. According to USCIS guidance, the agency planned to  progressively include other application types and operations in its quality  assurance approach, but the agency has not established specific strategies  and timelines for doing so.

USCIS\u2019s proposed technology transformation  should have the capability to provide information about the actual number  of applications that have been pending for more than 6 months so that the  agency is able to define its backlog consistently with the statutory  definition of any application pending adjudication for more than 180 days.", "USCIS has made substantial progress toward its goal of reducing its  backlog of benefit applications and may eliminate much of the backlog by  September 30, 2006. In addition to efforts to eliminate the current backlog,  it is important for the agency to take steps to prevent future backlogs. The  agency\u2019s ambitious technology transformation plan promises to meet this  need by moving the agency from a manual, paper-driven process to an  automated, paperless adjudication environment. As USCIS strives to  become a high-performing, client-focused organization, it must take into  account relationships among people, processes, and technology. For  example, one of the assumptions underlying technology transformation is  that it will facilitate more efficient, streamlined processes, which in turn  could yield productivity gains, thus allowing more work to be  accomplished without added staff resources. The agency has not identified  these potential effects in its staffing and technology plans. Considering  these relationships and including them in operational and strategic plans  would give USCIS a sound basis for making strategic decisions regarding  resource allocation. Without such information, Congress cannot be  assured that the agency\u2019s investments in information technology will  contribute to maximizing productivity and preventing future backlogs.", "At present, USCIS\u2019s quality assurance efforts do not comprehensively  assess the adjudicative process and its outcomes, nor do they address all  benefit application types.
