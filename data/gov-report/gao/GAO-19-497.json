NAVSEA  estimators took the following steps to develop the Columbia lead  submarine estimate:  In general, heavier ships cost more to construct, so NAVSEA cost  estimators calculated a weight-adjusted estimate based on Virginia  class labor hours to account for the heavier weight of the Columbia  class. This resulted in an initial estimate of 14.5 million touch labor  hours for the lead submarine.", "NAVSEA cost estimators then made numerous adjustments in the  cost estimate that reduced the expected number of labor hours based  on multiple assumptions that differences in the design and  construction process would lead to more efficient construction of  Columbia class submarines than previous submarine classes.

NAVSEA cost estimators calculated a  learning curve of 88.9 percent for Columbia class submarines. A learning  curve indicates that as the number of units doubles, unit cost decreases  by a constant percentage. In this case, the cost estimate assumed that  the fourth submarine would require only 88.9 percent the amount of labor  to build the second submarine.", "NAVSEA\u2019s assumption may overstate the potential learning rate that  Columbia can expect to achieve. The first four Virginia class submarines,  hull numbers SSN 774 through 777, incorporated modular construction  techniques where submarines were built in 10 modules. The next six  Virginia class submarines, hull numbers SSN 778 through 783, were  constructed using four modules. As a result of the improvements in the  modular construction process, construction across the first ten  submarines was not consistent, which is a condition that is necessary to  determine the learning curve rate. Therefore, there is no way to determine  what share of the labor hour reduction on later submarines was due to  learning or process improvements. Rather, SSN 778, the first Virginia  class submarine to use the four modular construction approach is a better  starting point to determine the shipbuilder\u2019s capacity for learning. The  Navy\u2019s independent assessment included a separate learning curve  analysis for Virginia class submarine hulls SSN 778 through 791 and  calculated a potential learning curve rate of 93.9 percent.

In the case of the Columbia program, the rate will apply to  the second through twelfth submarines. Figure 12 shows how the  difference in the learning curve rate can affect the estimated labor hours  for follow-on submarines.", "Therefore, a small change in the assumed learning curve rate can have a  significant effect on the cost estimate for follow-on submarines.

Additionally, a risk-adjusted cost estimate is consistent with federal internal control  standards, which indicate that risk mitigation efforts should be selected to  sufficiently respond to risks.

As a result, the program office estimate represents the program  manager\u2019s cost goal for the Columbia program, rather than the risk- adjusted estimate. Even if the Navy were to achieve the full anticipated  $1.9 billion savings, these savings represent only 1.5 percent of program  costs. Such cost savings are unlikely to cover program cost overruns for a  high-risk program, such as Columbia, given that historically shipbuilding  programs experience 27 percent cost growth.

Therefore, this report omits sensitive information  about the Navy\u2019s development of critical technologies for the Columbia  class program, including specific details about the technologies.

To  evaluate the shipbuilder\u2019s progress in maturing the Columbia class  design, we reviewed the Navy\u2019s plans for design management and  completion, evaluated the shipbuilder\u2019s design schedule, and compared  them against design progress reports to identify any delays. To evaluate  the Navy\u2019s plans for advance construction, we analyzed metrics reported  in Navy and shipbuilder documents, briefing slides, and other  documentation including key dates and estimated construction plans. We  compared design knowledge on the Columbia class program to our prior  work on shipbuilding best practices. We reviewed ongoing development  efforts and schedules for the Columbia class program\u2019s critical  technologies to determine remaining risks to their development and  integration. We also reviewed the matrices submitted by the Navy to  Congress in February and October 2018, to determine the status of the  program and identify any changes to the Navy\u2019s design and construction  goals for the program since our last report in December 2017. We also  analyzed available documentation related to the status of the nuclear  reactor and integrated power system.

We met with  Navy officials who were responsible for developing the cost estimate to  understand the processes used by the cost estimators, to clarify  information, and to allow the Navy to provide additional documentation on  the data and methodologies used in the estimate. We also observed  portions of the Columbia class program\u2019s cost model during a  presentation and discussion with Navy cost estimators. We also reviewed  the matrices submitted by the Navy to Congress to identify any changes  to the Navy\u2019s cost goals and reported information.

We determined that the  Columbia class cost estimate substantially met one, and partially met  three of the four characteristics of a reliable cost estimate, shown in figure  16. We determined the overall assessment rating by assigning each  individual rating a number: Not Met = 1, Minimally Met = 2, Partially Met =  3, Substantially Met = 4, and Met = 5.

DOD also stated that  GAO or other stakeholders did not identify any errors. This is  incorrect. While the Navy allowed us to observe the model, we did not  independently check the accuracy of the calculations because Navy  officials stated that the cost model, which contains the cost  calculations, could not be released. We informed the Navy that this  would affect parts of our assessment. After we provided a draft of the  report, the Navy provided a briefing summarizing the results of a  program office cost checkpoint conducted in September 2018. At the  briefing, we received information on updates that the Navy made to  the program cost estimate. As a result, we updated our assessment to  reflect that the Navy substantially met the best practice to regularly  update the cost estimate to reflect significant changes.

The Navy has made updates to the program cost  estimate based on a 2018 checkpoint review and stated that the cost  risk analysis has been updated and program costs are less than  originally estimated. The Navy provided us with a high-level brief of  these updates. However, due to the timing of this report, we were not  able to fully assess the update to the cost model. Given the size and  complexity of the Columbia class program, we continue to believe that  the program\u2019s cost estimate does not adequately account for program  risks.", "In paragraph 3, page 1, DOD stated that our findings were largely  informed by an assessment conducted by the Naval Center for Cost  Analysis (NCCA). However, our process for assessing program cost  estimates is based on the extent to which the estimate met best  practices outlined in GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide.

We also relied  on prior experience examining and reporting on the cost performance  of Navy shipbuilding programs, issuing 26 reports over the past 10  years.
