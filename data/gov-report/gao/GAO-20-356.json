The Navy plans to acquire a  fleet of 23 VH-92A helicopters to replace the Marine Corps\u2019 existing fleet  of VH-3D and VH-60N helicopters. The Navy's acquisition strategy is to  integrate mature technologies and an executive interior into an existing in- production commercial helicopter while minimizing modifications to avoid  the technical challenges and cost overruns that led to the termination of  its predecessor program in 2009.

These data were contained in defense acquisition  executive summary reports, selected acquisition reports, and briefings  provided by the program office and Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, a  Lockheed Martin company (the prime contractor for the program). We  also examined and analyzed key acquisition documents, including  contractor monthly status reports and Defense Contract Management  Agency reports. We interviewed officials from the Office of Cost  Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE), the Navy\u2019s Presidential  Helicopter Program Office to discuss the methodology used to develop  the independent cost estimate, and component cost position,  respectively. We also compared CAPE\u2019s independent cost estimate to the  Navy\u2019s component cost estimate to identify differences in the estimates.", "To assess the challenges GAO previously identified and those recently  experienced in developmental testing and steps taken to address those  challenges, we examined May 2019 operational assessment reports on  the VH-92A Program prepared by the Navy\u2019s Commander, Operational  Test and Evaluation Force and the Director, Operational Testing and  Evaluation; and contractor and Defense Contract Management Agency  status reports. We also interviewed representatives from the Navy\u2019s  Presidential Helicopter Program office in Patuxent River, Maryland;  Sikorsky\u2019s program office in Stratford, Connecticut; the Defense Contract  Management Agency; the Navy\u2019s Commander, Operational Test and  Evaluation Force; and the offices of the Director, Operational Testing and  Evaluation, and Director, Developmental Test and Evaluation. To assess  whether the program is achieving schedule goals, we compared program  milestones established at the start of the program in April 2014 to the  program\u2019s October 2019 Integrated Master Schedule.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2019 to April 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Marine Corps\u2019 Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) currently  uses a fleet of 23 helicopters to support the President in the national  capital region, the continental United States and overseas. In April 2002,  the Navy began developing a replacement helicopter later identified as  the VH-71. Schedule delays, performance issues, and a doubling of  estimated acquisition costs from $6.5 billion to $13 billion prompted the  Navy to terminate the VH-71 program in 2009. Our prior work found that  the VH-71 program\u2019s failure to follow acquisition best practices was a  critical factor in the program\u2019s poor performance that led to its ultimate  termination. In the case of the VH-71, the Navy had a faulty business  case, did not perform appropriate systems engineering analysis to gain  knowledge at the right times, and failed to make necessary trade-offs  between resources and requirements even after years of development.  Because of these failures, the program was unable to achieve a stable  design and experienced significant cost growth and schedule delays.", "Although the prior replacement program was terminated, the need for a  replacement helicopter remained. As a result, the Navy initiated a follow- on replacement program in 2010. In April 2012, the Secretary of Defense  approved the Navy\u2019s plan based on the modification of an in-production  helicopter to meet Navy requirements. The VH-92A is expected to provide  improved performance, survivability, and communications capabilities,  while offering increased passenger capacity when compared to legacy  helicopters.", "In May 2014, the Navy competitively awarded a contract to Sikorsky to  develop the VH-92A, which included options for production. The $2.7  billion contract includes a fixed-price incentive (firm target) Engineering  and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase and a firm-fixed price  production phase with options for three lots for 17 helicopters, spares and  support equipment. Under the EMD phase, Sikorsky has delivered two  development test helicopters which were used in an operational  assessment that was completed in April 2019. Additionally, Sikorsky has  delivered three of four System Demonstration Test Article (SDTA)  production representative helicopters that are being used in  developmental testing and that will also be used to evaluate the VH-92A\u2019s  operational effectiveness and suitability during the program\u2019s Initial  Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E). The fourth SDTA helicopter is  to be delivered in May 2020 and will also be used to conduct IOT&E.", "In June 2019, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Research,  Development and Acquisition (RD&A) approved the program to begin  low-rate initial production of the helicopters and authorized the program to  exercise the contract options for the first two low-rate production lots.  Shortly thereafter, the Navy exercised the Lot l option for 6 helicopters,  initial spares, and support equipment for $542 million. Those helicopters,  initial spares and support equipment are all to be delivered in calendar  year 2021. In February 2020, the Navy exercised the Lot ll option for $471  million for 6 additional helicopters and associated support equipment. All  of these helicopters and support equipment will be delivered in calendar  year 2022.", "The Navy had planned for two years of low-rate initial production of 6  helicopters each year followed by one year of full-rate production for the  remaining 5 helicopters. The Navy\u2019s acquisition strategy in support of the  production decision included a change in that plan with the re-designation  of full-rate production as a third lot of low-rate production. A key reason  for the change is that the planned full-rate production run of 5 helicopters  was too small to achieve the potential cost benefits of full-rate production,  which typically involves purchasing a sufficient number of helicopters to  decrease unit cost. This revised strategy would also enable the Navy to  award the third production lot seven months earlier than the originally  planned May 2021. Before obligating the funding available for the second  lot, the program office had to brief the Assistant Secretary of the Navy  (RD&A) on various elements of the VH-92A\u2019s performance. The program  office is required to obtain approval from the Assistant Secretary of the  Navy (RD&A) for the procurement of the last lot (Lot lll) with a decision  brief that includes, among other things, the status of IOT&E.", "Building a VH-92A helicopter involves work at three facilities. To begin the  production process, Sikorsky takes an S-92A helicopter from its  commercial production line in Coatesville, Pennsylvania and flies it to a  dedicated VH-92A modification facility in Stratford, Connecticut. Once  there, Sikorsky removes some components, such as circuit breaker  panels, engines, and main and tail rotor blades and replaces them with  VH-92A components. Additionally, Sikorsky modifies the helicopter to  accommodate VH-92A specific subsystems, including racks and wiring for  a Navy-developed mission communications system (MCS). Sikorsky then  flies the helicopter to a dedicated facility in Owego, New York where it  integrates the MCS, installs the executive cabin interior, paints the  helicopter, and conducts final testing before delivering the helicopter to  the government.

For  example, our 2011 report found that while the replacement program was  early in its development cycle, the Navy\u2019s initial efforts appeared to reflect  the intent to pursue a best practices aligned knowledge-based  acquisition.", "Following the program\u2019s entry into the EMD phase of acquisition in April  2014, we found that the Navy\u2019s reliance on mature technologies, selection  of an existing helicopter for use in the program, and award of a fixed-price  incentive type contract reduced risk. As to be expected with a major  system development effort, however, we found the program still faced a  number of technical challenges. In four reports issued from 2016 to 2019,  we found that the Navy continued making progress in developing the VH- 92A helicopter while managing design, integration and technical  challenges.

For example, the Navy has not added any key performance  requirements to the fixed-price incentive contract since it was awarded in  2014. The Navy has, however, implemented a small number of design  changes to add an additional cockpit display and increase the height of  the upper portion of the forward aircraft door. Previously, we found that  cost saving initiatives included leveraging the Federal Aviation  Administration\u2019s airworthiness certification process, optimizing work  processes, and reducing the movement of helicopters between contractor  sites.", "In addition, the Navy attributes the reduction in cost to support the VH- 92A fleet to using a planned maintenance interval concept as the basis  for its April 2019 cost estimate. Program officials explained that the April  2014 baseline estimate was based on the approach used to maintain the  current fleet of VH-3D and VH-60N presidential helicopters. For these  helicopters, the contractor carries out depot-level maintenance by  disassembling, inspecting, and reassembling them at its maintenance  depot. However, for the VH-92A, the Navy intends to perform depot-level  maintenance itself through scheduled inspections at its own presidential  helicopter support facility, which was designed to support this approach.  As a result, the Navy expects to be able to support the VH-92A fleet in a  more cost-effective manner while ensuring the availability of the  helicopter to perform its mission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Upcoming Initial Operational Test and Evaluation Will Demonstrate Extent to Which Technical Issues Have Been Addressed as Program Approaches End of Development", "paragraphs": ["The program has made progress addressing technical risks and  performance challenges we discussed in prior reports and deficiencies  confirmed during the April 2019 operational assessment.

The program is pursuing  options to achieve landing zone suitability that include possible changes  in operational procedures, helicopter design, and lawn surface  treatments. If design modifications are required, they will not be  implemented until after IOT&E. As a result, the Navy may not be able to  fully demonstrate that the VH-92A helicopter meets all its key  requirements until after the test program is complete. Further, IOT&E  results may also identify additional issues that may require additional  design or software changes.

For example, according to program  documents, the program has mitigated the risk in the following areas:  helicopter start procedures, electromagnetic environment effects/  electromagnetic pulse and cybersecurity. The Navy assessed these  capabilities during earlier developmental test and during the operational  assessment, which concluded in April 2019; subsequently, the Navy  approved the program to enter into production. However, the operational  assessment confirmed other known performance shortfalls\u2014specifically  those associated with the MCS\u2014that, if not corrected, could prevent the  program from meeting certain operational requirements.", "The MCS replaces the communications suite currently used by the in- service fleet and provides VH-92A passengers, pilots, and crew with  simultaneous short- and long-range secure and non-secure voice and  data communications capabilities. As such, its performance is critical for  the VH-92A to meet its mission. To conduct its operational assessment,  the Navy used two development test helicopters and a developmental  version of MCS software with known performance and capability  limitations. The operational assessment confirmed these MCS-related  performance limitations, including dropped communication connections.  Navy officials noted that these and other MCS-related performance  shortfalls could, if not addressed, reduce the helicopter\u2019s availability to  perform its transport mission and lower overall reliability, among other  operational requirements.", "Overall, the operational assessment confirmed 24 MCS-related  performance limitations. According to program officials, they have  incorporated or identified fixes to 22 of the 24 issues, which they are now  testing on SDTA helicopters. In turn, these fixes are expected to be  incorporated into MCS software that will be tested during IOT&E.  According to program officials, the remaining two MCS issues are related  to bandwidth and an unreliable off-aircraft network configuration affecting  on-aircraft system performance. According to those officials, the VH-92A  is already equipped with a wide-band line-of-sight system that provides  high bandwidth, though with coverage limitations. The program is  conducting market research on how to provide the helicopter with  increased bandwidth with increased coverage.", "The remaining two issues were assessed earlier as having a serious (but  not critical) impact to mission accomplishment. In addition to the MCS  deficiencies, the helicopter experienced problems with other components  during the April 2019 operational assessment. For example, the mission  and maintenance data computer repeatedly sent out false warning  alarms/notifications, which affected the reliability and required the aircrew  to spend extra time troubleshooting or switch to a backup helicopter. A  software update to help address this issue is planned for the computer  prior to IOT&E.", "The program is also still working to demonstrate the ability of the  helicopter to meet a key system capability requirement to land the  helicopter without damaging landing zones (including the White House  South Lawn). For landing zone suitability, the program\u2019s objective has  been to assess the downwash and exhaust effects on the landing zone.  In a September 2018 training event, the Navy found that VH-92A\u2019s  exhaust damaged a landing zone. Program officials stated that the  training event did not represent a typical operational scenario since the  lawn was exposed to the helicopter\u2019s exhaust for a longer period than it  would be under normal operating conditions. The program is studying  solutions to minimize risk of landing zone damage including possible  changes in operational procedures, helicopter design, and lawn surface  treatments. For example, the contractor developed a prototype design  change to the helicopter\u2019s auxiliary power unit to deflect exhaust. Flight  testing of the prototype design change was conducted in March 2020 with  analysis of the results expected in April 2020. Navy officials stated the  contractor is also conducting testing to determine if changes in helicopter  and/or engine operating procedures can mitigate the risk of landing zone  damage.

As such, IOT&E will  be conducted about 3 months later than we reported in 2019, but is  expected to be completed by the threshold (latest acceptable) date in the  Navy\u2019s April 2014 baseline. Program officials attributed the 3-month delay  to the need to develop MCS hardware and software changes that are  currently being tested. Should IOT&E demonstrate that efforts to address  the MCS performance issues or other previously identified issues are  insufficient\u2014or if the testing identifies new issues that result in the  program being unable to meet its operational requirements\u2014then the  program may need to identify, test and incorporate changes into the VH- 92A\u2019s design and into the helicopters already in production, further  delaying the program and increasing associated costs.

In turn, the program  may need to keep certain staff in place longer than originally planned,  potentially increasing program costs. However, program officials told us  that the program can cover any additional costs with existing funding.  Further, Navy officials stated that should IOC be delayed, the Navy will  continue to use its existing fleet of presidential helicopters as the VH-92A  transitions into the HMX-1 fleet.
