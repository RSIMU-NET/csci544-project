GAO was asked to develop criteria and strategies for establishing and implementing COO/CMO positions in federal agencies.

These criteria include the history of organizational performance, degree of organizational change needed, nature and complexity of mission, organizational size and structure, and current leadership talent and focus. Depending on these five criteria, there could be several types of COO/CMO positions, including: (1) the existing deputy position could carry out the integration and business transformation role--this type of COO/CMO might be appropriate in a relatively stable or small organization; (2) a senior-level executive who reports to the deputy, such as a principal under secretary for management, could be designated to integrate key management functions and lead business transformation efforts in the agency--this type of COO/CMO might be appropriate for a larger organization; and (3) a second deputy position could be created to bring strong focus to the integration and business transformation of the agency--this might be the most appropriate type of COO/CMO for a large and complex organization undergoing a significant transformation to reform long-standing management problems. Because each agency has its own set of characteristics, challenges and opportunities, the implementation of any approach should be determined within the context of the agency's specific facts and circumstances. Once the type of COO/CMO is selected, six key strategies can be useful in implementing such positions in federal agencies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As agencies across the federal government embark on large-scale  organizational change needed to address 21st century challenges, there is  a compelling need for leadership to provide the continuing, focused  attention essential to completing these multiyear transformations. At the  same time, many agencies are suffering from a range of long-standing  management problems that are undermining their abilities to efficiently,  economically, and effectively accomplish their missions and achieve  results. One proposed approach to address these systemic federal  governance and management challenges involves the creation of a senior- level position\u2014a chief operating officer (COO)/chief management officer  (CMO)\u2014in selected federal departments and agencies to help elevate,  integrate, and institutionalize responsibility for key management functions  and focus concerted attention on long-term business transformation  efforts. We have long advocated the need for a COO/CMO at the  Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS). As you know, legislation has been introduced to create a CMO  position at DOD, and recently the Undersecretary for Management  position at DHS became the CMO in an effort to advance management  integration and business transformation in those departments.", "Although these senior-level positions can operate under a variety of job  titles, the principal goal of establishing and implementing a COO/CMO  position is to provide the sustained management attention essential for  addressing key stewardship responsibilities in an integrated manner while  helping to facilitate the business transformation process within an agency.  These long-term responsibilities are professional and nonpartisan in  nature, and cover a range of \u201cgood government\u201d responsibilities that are  fundamental to effectively executing any administration\u2019s program and  policy agenda. Responsibilities under the purview of a COO/CMO could  include strategic planning, financial management, communications and  information resources management, human capital strategy, acquisition  management, and change management. The top leadership attention of a  COO/CMO could help to bolster an agency\u2019s efforts to overcome the  natural resistance to change, marshal the resources needed to implement  change, and build and maintain an organizationwide commitment to new  ways of doing business.", "As agreed with your offices, this report identifies (1) criteria that can be  used to determine the type of COO/CMO or similar position that ought to  be established in federal agencies and (2) strategies for implementing  COO/CMO positions to elevate, integrate, and institutionalize key  management functions and business transformation efforts in federal  agencies. To develop these criteria and strategies, we (1) gathered  information on the experiences and views of officials at four organizations  with COO/CMO-type positions and (2) convened a forum to gather insights  from individuals with experience and expertise in business  transformation, federal and private sector management, and change  management. The four organizations included in our review are three  federal agencies and one nonprofit organization: the Department of the  Treasury (Treasury), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Department  of Justice (Justice), and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  We selected the four organizations because each has a senior-level official  who is responsible for integrating key management functions, including, at  a minimum, human capital, financial management, information  technology, and acquisition management. At the headquarters of these  four organizations, we interviewed senior officials and we collected and  reviewed documents related to the COO/CMO position. These COO/CMO  positions\u2014Assistant Secretary for Management at Treasury, Deputy  Commissioner for Operations Support at IRS, Assistant Attorney General  for Administration at Justice, and Executive Vice President at MIT \u2014have  primary responsibility for many of the mission-support functions of their  respective organizations but generally do not have direct responsibility for  the mission programs and policies of their organizations. Our organization  selection process was not designed to identify examples that could be  considered representative of all COO/CMO-type positions. Furthermore,  we did not assess the effectiveness of each COO/CMO serving in these  respective organizations, nor did we determine whether any specific  COO/CMO position directly resulted in a higher level of organizational  performance. Rather, our focus was to identify the experiences and views  of officials in carrying out the COO/CMO position.", "The Comptroller General also hosted a forum on April 24, 2007, to bring  together former and current government executives and officials from  private business and nonprofit organizations to discuss when and how a  COO/CMO or similar position might effectively provide the continuing,  focused attention essential for integrating key management functions and  undertaking multiyear organizational transformations. This forum was  designed for the participants to discuss these issues openly and without  individual attribution. Forum participants were selected for their expertise  but also to represent a variety of perspectives. The conclusions drawn in  this report do not necessarily represent the views of any individual  participant or the organizations that these participants represent. In  addition, we reviewed our prior work related to the COO/CMO concept  and business transformation and management integration issues at DOD  and DHS. We also interviewed officials from the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) to discuss the establishment and implementation of  COO/CMO positions in federal departments and agencies.", "We conducted our review from August 2006 through July 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. See  appendix I for a detailed discussion of our objectives, scope, and  methodology, including additional information on our selection process  for organizations to include in the case-study review.

In  addition, a list of related GAO products is included at the end of this  report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The concept of establishing a position to integrate management functions  within federal departments can be traced back to the first Hoover  Commission, which was charged by Congress with reviewing and  recommending ways to improve the organization and operation of federal  agencies. The commission, which lasted from 1947 to 1949, proposed  numerous recommendations to strengthen departmental management  leadership, including the creation through statute of the position of  assistant secretary for administration in each executive department. This  senior-level official was to be selected from the career civil service and  would direct crosscutting administrative activities, such as budget,  finance, human resources, procurement, management analysis, and  support services. The commission\u2019s recommendation was subsequently  adopted and these assistant secretaries for administration, positions filled  by career appointees, were established in many of the executive  departments throughout the 1950s and 1960s.", "The more recent concept of the COO/CMO position largely came out of the  creation of performance-based organizations (PBO) in the federal  government in the late 1990s and early 2000. During that time, the  administration and Congress renewed their focus on the need to  restructure federal agencies and hold them accountable for achieving  program results. To this end, three PBOs were established, which were  modeled after the United Kingdom\u2019s executive agencies. A PBO is a  discrete departmental unit that is intended to transform the delivery of  public services by having the organization commit to achieving specific  measurable goals with targets for improvement in exchange for being  allowed to operate without the constraints of certain rules and regulations  to achieve these targets. The clearly defined performance goals are to be  coupled with direct ties between the achievement of the goals and the pay  and tenure of the head of the PBO, often referred to as the COO. The COO  is appointed for a set term of typically 3 to 5 years, subject to an annual  performance agreement, and is eligible for bonuses for improved  organizational performance.", "With the backdrop of these PBOs and an ongoing focus on transforming  organizational cultures in the federal government, the Comptroller General  convened a roundtable of government leaders and management experts on  September 9, 2002, to discuss the COO concept and how it might apply  within selected federal departments and agencies. The intent of the  roundtable was to generate ideas and to engage in an open dialogue on the  possible application of the COO concept to selected federal departments  and agencies. The participants at the roundtable offered a wide range of  suggestions for consideration as the executive branch and Congress were  seeking to address the federal government\u2019s long-standing management  problems and the need to move to a more responsive, results-oriented, and  accountable federal government. Nonetheless, there was general  agreement on the importance of the following actions for organizational  transformation and management reform:    Elevate attention on management issues and transformational  change. Top leadership attention is essential to overcome organizations\u2019  natural resistance to change, marshal the resources needed to implement  change, and build and maintain the organizationwide commitment to new  ways of doing business.", "Integrate various key management and transformation efforts.", "There needs to be a single point within agencies with the perspective and  responsibility\u2014as well as authority\u2014to ensure the successful  implementation of functional management and, if appropriate,  transformational change efforts.", "Institutionalize accountability for addressing management issues  and leading transformational change. The management weaknesses in  some agencies are deeply entrenched and long-standing, and it can take at  least 5 to 7 years of sustained attention and continuity to fully implement  transformations and change management initiatives.", "Still, it was generally agreed at this roundtable discussion that the  implementation of any approach should be determined within the context  of the specific facts and circumstances that relate to each individual  agency.", "In the time since the 2002 roundtable, the COO concept has evolved into  the COO/CMO concept with a focus on business transformation, and has  received even greater attention within the federal government. Legislative  proposals have been introduced in Congress to establish CMO positions at  DOD and DHS to help address transformation efforts at the two  departments, both of which are responsible for various areas identified on  our biennial update of high-risk programs. These legislative proposals  differ somewhat in content but would essentially create a senior-level  position to serve as a principal advisor to the secretary on matters related  to the management of the department, including management integration  and business transformation. Some of these legislative proposals also  include specific provisions that spell out qualifications for the position,  require a performance contract, and provide for a term appointment of 5  or 7 years. In August 2007, the proposal to create a CMO in DHS at an  Executive Level II, but without a term appointment, was enacted into law.  In 2000, Congress created a Deputy Secretary for Management and  Resources position at the Department of State; however, the  administration opposed the creation of a second deputy position, and the  position has never been filled. Therefore, at the present time, no federal  department has a COO/CMO-type position with all these characteristics.  However, the heads of federal departments and selected agencies  designate a COO, who is usually the deputy or another official with  agencywide authority, to sit on the President\u2019s Management Council. The  council was created by President Clinton in 1993 in order to advise and  assist the President and Vice President in ensuring that management  reforms are implemented throughout the executive branch. The Deputy  Director for Management of OMB chairs the council, and the council is  responsible for  improving overall executive branch management, including  implementation of the President\u2019s Management Agenda (PMA);   coordinating management-related efforts to improve government  throughout the executive branch and, as necessary, resolving specific  interagency management issues;   ensuring the adoption of new management practices in agencies  throughout the executive branch; and  identifying examples of, and providing mechanisms for, interagency  exchange of information about best management practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Specific Criteria Can Help in Assessing the Type of COO/CMO Position Needed in a Federal Agency", "paragraphs": ["Ascertaining which criteria might be relevant for a particular agency  would assist in determining the type of COO/CMO position that might best  be established in the agency.

Agencies with programs and functions that we  designate as high risk, like DOD, would be especially appropriate  candidates for such positions. Our interviews with officials at the four  case-study organizations reinforced that an agency\u2019s overall performance  should be considered when assessing the type of COO/CMO that might be  needed. For example, an official in one of the agencies commented that a  COO/CMO position might be needed if an agency has a high degree of  material and financial weaknesses. Another agency official said that an  additional factor to consider is whether the organization has had many  large projects fail, a likely indicator that the agency has not placed  sufficient attention on integration. In a discussion of the importance of  establishing measures to assess organizational performance, a department  official commented that the integration of management functions is often  not measured within federal agencies and that in order for full integration  to occur, it must be stimulated and given a timeline."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Degree of Organizational Change Needed", "paragraphs": ["We have previously suggested that agencies engaged in major  transformation efforts and those agencies experiencing particularly  significant challenges in integrating disparate organizational cultures, such  as DHS, could be also good candidates for having COO/CMO-type  positions in place. Our interviews with officials at the case-study  organizations confirmed that the degree of organizational change needed  should be a criterion to consider when assessing the need for a COO/CMO.  For example, an agency official we interviewed commented that an agency  undergoing significant transformation might benefit from a COO/CMO  position in place in order to focus principally on correcting weaknesses  and exploring new approaches for meeting mission needs. Another agency  official pointed out that the organizational culture of the agency should be  considered, and he noted that a strong esprit de corps in an agency could  affect the decision of whether a COO/CMO position is advisable. As we  have previously reported, overcoming inertia and cultural resistance to  change can be a significant challenge within agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nature and Complexity of Mission", "paragraphs": ["The nature and complexity of mission, including the range, risk, and scope  of an agency\u2019s mission, is another factor that should be considered in the  assessment for a COO/CMO position. For example, a department official  we interviewed said that the complexity of an agency\u2019s mission should be  considered when assessing the need for a COO/CMO, regardless of the size  of the agency. Another agency official commented that an organization  with a single mission focus might not need a COO/CMO position. A forum  participant noted that implementing change at an organization such as  DHS can be challenging because the department does not have one single  mission (i.e., emergency and nonemergency operations). In suggesting that  a wide range of organizational missions should be a factor when  considering the type of COO/CMO, a departmental official we interviewed  pointed out that Treasury manufactures currency, collects taxes, manages  the national debt, and provides the Director of National Intelligence with  information on terrorist financing activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Organizational Size and Structure", "paragraphs": ["Officials frequently cited the size of an organization as an important factor  to consider when reviewing the type of COO/CMO position. For example, a  case-study official suggested that a COO/CMO position would not be  necessary in an organization with only 50 people whereas an organization  with 2,000 employees could need such a position to oversee and integrate  the management functions. He said that as organizations become larger,  they are more likely to need coordinating structures to help with  integration and coordination because communication can easily break  down. Another official added that a COO/CMO position might work best  for a large decentralized organization, where it is more difficult to enforce  policy and where there is no entity to oversee and integrate the various  functions. Some forum participants concluded that for smaller agencies,  the deputy could carry out the COO/CMO role. Another case-study official  remarked that a COO/CMO-type position might be relevant for a smaller  organization if there were a high degree of risk and grave consequences  for poor communication and coordination, such as with the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration. However, another department  official suggested that the size of the organization might not be highly  relevant when considering the establishment of a COO/CMO position  because every agency needs to have a consolidation point in the flow of  information to minimize disjointed communication and a lack of  coordination.", "Organizational structure was also suggested by officials as a factor to  consider in determining the type of COO/CMO position. For example, a  department official suggested that a COO/CMO position should be  established in agencies with a wide geographic dispersion of personnel  and facilities. Another agency official commented that an additional factor  to consider is the degree to which the organization\u2019s activities are  duplicative or stovepiped. Still another official offered that the number of  management layers in the organization and the existing span of control for  managers should be a factor in assessing the type of COO/CMO.

Some forum participants noted that  management execution and integration require a long-term focus, and that  under the existing system, agency senior leaders may not likely stay in  their positions for the long term.

Depending on these five criteria, there could  be several types of COO/CMO positions, including the types shown below.", "The existing deputy position could carry out the integration and business  transformation role.

For a large and complex  organization undergoing a significant transformation to reform long- standing management problems, this might be the most appropriate type  of COO/CMO.", "A number of forum participants and officials we interviewed, including  OMB\u2019s Deputy Director for Management, said that the deputy position  should generally carry out the role of integrating key management  functions and transformational efforts in agencies rather than establishing  a separate COO/CMO position. At the same time, given the competing  demands on deputy secretaries in executive branch departments across  the federal government to help execute the President\u2019s policy and program  agendas, a number of agency officials argued that it is not practical to  expect that the deputy secretaries will be able to consistently undertake  this vital integrating responsibility. Moreover, while many deputy  secretaries may be appointed based in part on their managerial  experience, it has not always been the case, and not surprisingly, the  management skills, expertise, and interests of the deputy secretaries have  always varied and will continue to vary.

By their very nature, the  problems and challenges facing agencies are crosscutting and hence  require coordinated and integrated solutions. Thus, the COO/CMO  essentially serves as a bridge between the agency head, functional chiefs,  and mission-focused executives. The COO/CMO provides leadership and  vision, bringing greater integration and increased attention to the agency\u2019s  management functions in order to enable agency employees to accomplish  their missions more efficiently and effectively. The COO/CMO would offer  the benefit of increased opportunities to coordinate and identify  crosscutting issues that are fundamental to effectively executing any  administration\u2019s program agenda yet do not generally entail program  policy-setting authority. The COO/CMO would also bolster the agency\u2019s  efforts to overcome the natural resistance to change, challenging  conventional approaches and developing new methods and systems for  implementing business transformation in a comprehensive, ongoing, and  integrated manner.", "We have previously suggested that in crafting an approach for any specific  agency, Congress could make clear in statute the broad responsibilities for  the senior official tasked with management integration and business  transformation. Congress has taken this approach with other similar  senior-level positions that can serve as illustrative models. For example, in  2003 Congress created the position of Deputy Architect of the  Capitol/COO, responsible for the overall direction, operation, and  management of that organization. Under the statute, besides developing  and implementing a long-term strategic plan, the Deputy Architect/COO is  to propose organizational changes and staffing needed to carry out the  organization\u2019s mission and strategic and annual performance goals. In  addition, Congress has articulated positional responsibilities in important  governmentwide management legislation. For example, the Chief  Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act), which requires 24 federal  agencies to have CFOs, clearly lays out the CFOs\u2019 responsibilities,  including developing and maintaining integrated accounting and financial  management systems; directing, managing, and providing policy guidance  and oversight of all financial management personnel, activities, and  operations; and approving and managing financial management systems  design and enhancement projects. By establishing such responsibilities in  statute, Congress created clear expectations for the positions and  underscored its desire for employing a professional and nonpartisan  approach in connection with these positions. (App. III provides a summary  of the key responsibilities for statutory chief officer positions in the  federal government.)", "Each of the four organizations in our study\u2014Treasury, IRS, Justice, and  MIT\u2014has a senior-level official responsible for integrating the key  management functions of human capital, financial management,  information resources management, and acquisition management.  Examples of other functional responsibilities of the case-study COO/CMOs  include strategic planning, program evaluation, facilities and installations,  and safety and security. The COO/CMOs of the four case-study  organizations are also directly responsible for leading many of the  business transformation efforts in their respective organizations. At IRS,  for example, both the COO/CMO and the senior executive of the mission  side of the agency are heavily involved in managing change efforts, but the  COO/CMO has primary responsibility for spearheading business  transformation initiatives that cut across mission-support programs and  policies.", "The case-study officials we interviewed and the participants of the April  2007 forum generally agreed that a senior-level official should be  responsible for carrying out the COO/CMO role of integrating key  management functions in the organization. For example, an official from  one of the federal agencies noted that without someone in the agency  devoted to management functions, the focus of the agency\u2019s senior leaders  will remain on the policy side of the agency. One of the COO/CMOs of the  four organizations commented that there is a benefit in having the mission- support activities in an organization grouped together under one senior  leader so as to support the common interests of these mission-support  activities. Another COO/CMO told us that his role was to \u201cmake life easier\u201d  for the mission side of the organization. Another official echoed these  sentiments in that the COO/CMO needs to be viewed by the mission side of  the organization as adding value as opposed to simply promulgating rules.  Several case-study officials and forum participants also stressed that the  COO/CMO must have an authoritative role in the overseeing the agency\u2019s  budget in order to be effective in the position.", "The roles and responsibilities of the COO/CMO related to business  transformation were also widely discussed in our case-study interviews  and at the forum. For example, a forum participant said that the senior  official leading transformation within an agency needs to be in an  operational role rather than a policy role. Another forum participant  stressed that although the COO/CMO is a management and  transformational position, the roles and responsibilities of the position can  differ depending on the extent to which the agency is undergoing  transformation. Accordingly, when significant transformation is the goal,  the role of the COO/CMO should be focused on breakthrough  improvements to achieve this goal. The COO/CMO at one case-study  agency said that when organizations carry out these transformation  efforts, managers throughout the organization will often try to accelerate  decision making and the execution of change, which can be quite  detrimental. He noted that in order to prevent these types of problems, a  federal agency needs the COO/CMO with a role and associated  responsibilities that allow for directing the speed of change  implementation while also controlling the level of detail and personal  involvement in the change. The COO/CMO at another agency remarked  that in order for an agency to be successful in carrying out any  transformation process, experienced agency managers need to be involved  at the beginning of the process and thus the roles and responsibilities of  the COO/CMO should complement those of other managers in the agency.", "Several agency officials and forum participants told us that it is also  important to avoid being overly restrictive in specifying the roles and  responsibilities for the COO/CMO position. For example, a forum  participant said that Congress should not legislate details of how to carry  out the responsibilities of a COO/CMO position because legislation is  geared to the present whereas the agency and the environment in which it  operates can change over time. Another forum participant echoed that any  legislation to establish a COO/CMO position should not contain detailed  roles and responsibilities because it could hinder effectiveness in the  position. Another forum participant added that the roles and  responsibilities should be broadly defined, allowing flexibility from agency  to agency. Another forum participant suggested that the agency head  could specify the responsibilities of a COO/CMO in formal terms, such as  in a \u201ctasking memo.\u201d Nonetheless, a number of agency officials we  interviewed stressed the importance of communicating to employees  throughout the agency the specifics of the COO/CMO\u2019s actual role in the  organization. We have previously noted the importance of ensuring that all  agency employees are fully aware of the duties and key areas of  responsibilities for executives in charge of major activities or functions in  the agency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ensure That the COO/CMO Has a High Level of Authority and Clearly Delineated Reporting Relationships", "paragraphs": ["The COO/CMO concept is consistent with the governance principle that  there needs to be a single point within agencies with the perspective and  responsibility to ensure the successful implementation of functional  management and business transformation efforts. The organizational level  and span of control of the COO/CMO position is crucial in ensuring the  incumbent\u2019s authority and status within the organization. We have  previously argued that the COO/CMO position should be part of an  agency\u2019s top leadership, for example, a deputy secretary for management.  At the same time, however, the placement of the COO/CMO position needs  to take into account existing positions and responsibilities to avoid  additional layers of management that are unnecessary. Regardless of how  the position is structured in an agency, it is critical that the individuals  appointed to these positions be vested with sufficient authority to be able  to integrate management functions and achieve results.", "For the four organizations included in our review, the COO/CMOs either  reported to the organization head (i.e., second-level reporting position) or  reported to an individual who reports to the organization head (i.e., third- level reporting position). Specifically, the IRS COO/CMO reports to the  Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the MIT COO/CMO reports to the  President of the university, and the COO/CMOs at Treasury and Justice  report to the respective deputy positions in those departments. (See fig. 1  for simplified organizational charts showing the reporting relationships of  the four COO/CMO positions.) The COO/CMOs for the four organizations  told us that they had the necessary and appropriate level of authority at  their respective levels within their organizations.", "The case-study officials and the forum participants broadly recognized  that a COO/CMO should have a high enough level of authority to ensure  the successful implementation of functional management and  transformational change efforts in the agency. However, the officials and  participants had mixed views as to the most appropriate organizational  level for a COO/CMO position. Some interviewees and forum participants  told us that the COO/CMO position should report to the head of the agency  (i.e., second-level reporting relationship). A department official said, for  example, that having a COO/CMO position on par with the deputy  secretary would demonstrate that management issues are viewed as  important in the agency. Another agency official commented that a  COO/CMO reporting to the agency head would more likely be involved in  key decision making within the organization. Still other interviewees and  forum participants said that the COO/CMO should report to an individual  who reports to the organization head (i.e., third-level reporting  relationship). For example, a department official told us that the  COO/CMO should be at the under secretary level in any department, yet  stressed that the organizational level itself would not guarantee success in  the COO/CMO position. A forum participant said that a COO/CMO position  should be placed at a high level within the organization, but cautioned that  a COO/CMO position with a deputy secretary as peer would create  confusion within the organization if responsibility and accountability are  not clearly defined.", "Some of the agency officials and forum participants said that the  COO/CMO\u2019s level on an organizational chart is not as critical as the level of  authority and executive-level attention that is given to the COO/CMO  position. For example, a department official told us that regardless of  where the COO/CMO position is placed on the organizational chart, the  COO/CMO must have a close relationship with and be a trusted advisor to  the agency leadership. Another official added that the effectiveness of a  COO/CMO does not always depend on where he or she is on the  organizational chart, but mostly on the personality and abilities of the  individual. A forum participant commented that the reporting relationship  of the COO/CMO should depend primarily on the agency\u2019s agenda and  mission.

However, these functional management  chiefs could report to a COO/CMO who was given the responsibility for  integrating the organization\u2019s management functions.

For example, in July 2004, we reported on the status of CIO  roles, responsibilities, and challenges (among other things) at 27 major  agencies. Nineteen of the CIOs in our review stated that they reported  directly to the agency head in carrying out their responsibilities. In the  other 8 agencies, the CIOs stated that they reported instead to another  senior official, such as a deputy secretary, under secretary, or assistant  secretary. In addition, 8 of the 19 CIOs who said they had a direct  reporting relationship with the agency head noted that they also reported  to another senior executive, usually the deputy secretary or under  secretary for management, on an operational basis. Only about a third of  those who did not report to their agency heads expressed a concern with  their reporting relationships. For the July 2004 report, we also held two  panels of former agency senior executives responsible for information  technology who had various views on whether it was important that the  CIO report to the agency head. For example, one former executive stated  that such a reporting relationship was extremely important, another  emphasized that organizational placement was not important if the CIO  had credibility, and others suggested that the CIO could be effective while  reporting to a COO.", "Unlike for CFOs and CIOs, the reporting relationships of CHCOs and CAOs  are not prescribed in federal statute and are at the discretion of the agency  head.

At that  time, we noted that more than half (15 of 24) of the CHCOs reported  directly to the agency head, with the remainder reporting to another  agency official. Some CHCOs who reported directly to the agency head  told us that this reporting relationship gives them an important \u201cseat at the  table\u201d where key decisions are made. However, some CHCOs who did not  report to their agency head said having all or most of the agency chief  management positions as direct reports to the agency heads may impede  efficient management coordination within the agency.

Some interviewees raised concerns about where a  COO/CMO position might be created in the agency and the resulting  changes in the level of authority and reporting relationships related to the  functional management chiefs. For example, an official at one of the case- study agencies said that if a COO/CMO position were established in an  agency and this change in effect resulted in moving the functional  management chiefs down a level on the organizational chart, some  functional chiefs might view this change as a demotion because they  would no longer have a direct line to the deputy.

In addition, some  interviewees told us that it was not necessary to have extensive  experience with each key management function but having broad  knowledge of at least one of them would be helpful for a COO/CMO.

For example, a forum  participant, referring to the job qualifications for the CFO positions as  spelled out in the CFO Act, said that over time the individuals selected for  CFO positions increasingly matched the statutory job qualifications.  Disadvantages of formalized qualifications included unnecessarily  screening out talented persons who could effectively carry out the  position and overlooking that the job could change over time depending  on the needs of the agency and the focus and talent of other senior agency  managers. For example, a department official said that formalizing specific  qualifications in statute does not provide enough flexibility in hiring the  right person for the job, and another official added that the head of the  agency should determine the qualifications needed for the COO/CMO  position based on the strengths and weaknesses of current senior leaders  and the overall needs of the agency.

Further, the COO\u2019s  progress in meeting these goals is to form the basis of a possible  performance bonus of up to 50 percent of base pay, as well as any  decisions by the Secretary to remove or reappoint him or her.

In previous testimony, we have suggested that the  individual serving in a COO/CMO position be selected without regard to  political affiliation.", "At the time of our review, the individuals in the COO/CMO positions at the  three federal case-study agencies served under varying types of  appointments, including both career and noncareer. As the COO/CMO at  Treasury, the Assistant Secretary for Management was a presidentially  appointed, Senate-confirmed position. As the COO/CMO at Justice, the  Assistant Attorney General for Administration was a career SES position,  but appointment to the position is subject to the approval of the President  but not subject to Senate confirmation. As the COO/CMO at IRS, the  Deputy Commissioner for Operations Support was also a career SES  position.", "The case-study officials and forum participants offered a range of insights,  views, and examples from their experiences regarding the issue of  promoting continuity in the COO/CMO position by using career  appointments. Several officials we interviewed at the case-study  organizations told us that career appointments for COO/CMO-type  positions in federal departments and agencies would provide a number of  benefits over political appointments. These interviewees said that career  SES personnel are more likely to help ensure continuity in the position,  are generally more familiar with federal management issues, and can be  easily reassigned to another position if they are not effective in the  COO/CMO role. A department official also told us that another advantage  in serving as a career COO/CMO is the degree of independence that can be  brought to important decisions under consideration at an agency. Some  forum participants agreed that career senior executives were the best  option for filling COO/CMO positions because career executives could  offer continuity and experience as administrations come and go. A  participant remarked that because political appointees currently fill many  of the executive-level administrative management positions that in the  past were filled by career executives, a loss of continuity and experience  has resulted.", "Some agency officials and forum participants raised concerns about filling  COO/CMO positions with career civil servants. The challenges cited  include the view that there might not be enough qualified career applicants  for these positions and restrictions on the administration\u2019s ability to select  individuals for these positions. For example, one forum participant said  that the President and Secretary should have latitude in determining who  fills the COO/CMO position because the relationship is crucial. There was  also discussion on whether the senior management official in an agency  should be a presidential appointment requiring Senate confirmation, while  Senate confirmation would not be required of those officials who lead  specific management functions (for example, financial management,  information technology, or human capital) and who report to that senior  management official. Forum participants differed in their views on the  appropriate appointment type for the COO/CMO. During the forum, the  Comptroller General suggested that some COO/CMO positions could be  presidential appointments with Senate confirmation and others could be  appointments without Senate confirmation."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given the long-standing management challenges faced by many  government agencies, as well as the organizational transformation now  taking place across government in response to a post-9/11 environment  and other changes, new leadership models are needed to help elevate,  integrate, and institutionalize business transformation and management  reform efforts. A COO/CMO, given adequate authority, responsibility, and  accountability, could provide the leadership necessary to sustain  organizational change over a long term.", "While they may share a number of common circumstances, each  department and agency in the federal government nevertheless faces its  own unique set of characteristics and challenges in attempting to improve  and transform its business operations. Yet as we learned from our case  study and forum discussion, a number of common criteria can be used to  determine the type of COO/CMO that would be appropriate in a federal  agency. Once such a determination is made, a number of common  strategies can be adopted to put such a position into place and to help  ensure that it will work effectively. The strategies underscore the  importance of clearly identified roles and responsibilities, good working  relationships, inclusive decision-making structures and processes, and  solid accountability mechanisms.", "As Congress considers COO/CMO positions at selected federal agencies,  the criteria and strategies we identified should help to highlight key issues  that need to be considered, both in design of the positions and in  implementation. While Congress is currently focused on two of the most  challenging agencies\u2014DOD and DHS\u2014the problems they face are, to  varying degrees, shared by the rest of the federal government. Each  agency, therefore, could consider the type of COO/CMO that would be  appropriate for its organization and adopt the strategies we outline to  implement such a position. Because it is composed of the senior  management officials in each department and agency, the President\u2019s  Management Council, working closely with OMB, could play a valuable  role in leading such as assessment and helping to ensure that due  consideration is given to how each agency can improve its leadership  structure for management.

We also collected and  analyzed organizational charts of the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act  federal agencies as well as those federal agencies required to report under  the President\u2019s Management Agenda. We also consulted with various  nonprofit organizations with experience in federal and state/local  government. We sought to identify organizations that had senior-level  officials with responsibility for integrating key management functions,  including, at a minimum, human capital, financial management,  information technology, and acquisition management, and who generally  did not have direct responsibility for the mission programs and policies of  their organizations.

At the  headquarters of these four organizations, we interviewed senior officials  and we collected and reviewed documents related to the COO/CMO  position. We conducted semistructured interviews with the individuals  serving in the COO/CMO positions (Acting Assistant Secretary for  Management at Treasury, Deputy Commissioner for Operations Support at  IRS, Assistant Attorney General for Administration at Justice, and  Executive Vice President at MIT) as well as those managers who reported  directly to the COO/CMOs. These interviews focused on how the  COO/CMO position functioned in their respective organizations as well as  the officials\u2019 views and insights on issues such as roles and  responsibilities, reporting relationships, accountability mechanisms, and  decision-making structures and processes. In carrying out our work at  these four organizations, we did not assess the effectiveness of each  COO/CMO serving in these respective organizations nor did we determine  whether any specific COO/CMO position directly resulted in a higher level  of organizational performance.
