At the foundation of this process, Corps policy establishes two categories of costs to calculate overhead--general and administrative overhead expenses associated with district administrative offices, such as resource management, and technical overhead expenses associated with district technical offices, such as engineering. Using these two categories as a starting point, the Corps next calculates overhead rates as part of its annual budget process. Specifically, each district administrative and technical office develops operating budgets with overhead estimates, which are then consolidated and routed through district and division management, resulting in a final division-wide operating budget and overhead rates. The Corps then bills projects for overhead costs based on the number of hours its staff charge to projects. Overhead charges are not applied to hours worked by contracted labor, which represent a substantial amount of work. The Corps reports that it contracts out most of its design work and all of its construction work to private sector entities, such as architectural and engineering firms and construction companies. Finally, the Corps periodically monitors overhead costs and makes any necessary adjustments such as changing overhead rates, reducing expenditures, or providing rebates to customers. The Corps is able to monitor overhead because it tracks overhead costs separately from other project costs in its financial management system through specific overhead accounting codes.", "Corps customers' views varied on whether overhead information is accessible and understandable. Half of the 16 highest paying customers GAO interviewed said overhead information is generally accessible and understandable. For example, one federal customer said that the Corps provides overhead information in monthly bills, and the information is understandable. One of the 16 highest paying customers said overhead information is not accessible and understandable. For example, this nonfederal customer and the Corps could not agree on whether overhead information requested by the customer had been provided, leaving the customer unable to understand Corps costs, including overhead information. The remaining 7 highest paying customers had no opinion on accessibility and/or understandability. While offering no opinion on one aspect of overhead information, such as accessibility, they generally offered a positive opinion on the other aspect, understandability. For example, one federal customer had no opinion on whether the information was accessible but said that the information was understandable because the Corps explains how it builds overhead into its projects during project meetings. Conversely, a nonfederal customer told GAO that he has requested and received overhead information from the Corps--stating that overhead information is accessible, but he offered no opinion on understanding it. Among customers GAO interviewed, there were common views about overhead information. Specifically, some customers indicated that overhead information is important, but that overall project costs are more important than overhead costs. They also said that good communication is important to understanding overhead information."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) is responsible for  investigating, developing, and maintaining water resource projects and  spends billions of dollars annually on a variety of projects in its Civil  Works program.

Each district office  is headed by a district commander, who is also a military officer, and each  district has a number of administrative and technical offices.  Administrative offices, such as resource management, security, and  general counsel, provide general administrative support.

The Corps receives an appropriation that covers  overhead expenses incurred by the Corps\u2019 headquarters and divisions.

In this way, the  revolving fund, which maintains a number of accounts to which district  staff charge their time, allows the financing of agency activities because  the Corps charges for services and uses the proceeds to finance its  spending, usually on a self-sustaining basis. Corps-wide policy includes a  goal that each division\u2019s overhead account achieve a balance of zero at  the end of each fiscal year. Corps policy states that a balance within plus  or minus 1 percent of actual expenses is considered the equivalent of a  zero balance and, therefore, acceptable.", "The Corps receives the bulk of its funding from Congress. The Corps\u2019  fiscal year 2012 appropriations for the Civil Works program totaled about  $6.7 billion\u2014about $5 billion in regular appropriations and about $1.7  billion in disaster appropriations.

These two categories serve as  the foundation for building district overhead into projects. Corps policy  defines G&A overhead as costs of a general or administrative nature, and  all G&A overhead charges are based on a single rate per division.", "Examples of G&A overhead include costs to run the district resource  management or security offices, such as employee salaries and benefits  and utilities. Corps policy defines technical overhead as costs within a  technical office\u2014such as engineering or construction\u2014that cannot be  directly identified as part of or readily chargeable to a specific program or  project. Examples of technical overhead are the hours spent by the head  of the engineering office providing general supervision to engineering  staff and the prorated portion of rent for the office space of the  engineering staff. All technical overhead charges are based on four  different rates per division\u2014consolidated technical overhead, emergency  management, operations, and regulatory. Corps headquarters officials  said that the four technical overhead rates reflect four distinct types of  services rendered as follows:", "Consolidated technical overhead: This rate applies to state, local, and  tribal governments working with the Corps to build new water  resource projects.", "Emergency management: This rate applies to services rendered to  the Federal Emergency Management Agency and state and local  emergency management entities.", "Operations: This rate applies to state, local, and tribal governments  receiving Corps services for the operation and maintenance of  existing water resource projects.", "Regulatory: This rate applies to customers seeking Corps\u2019 permits to  build on lands that might impact a wetland.", "Using calculations based on the G&A rate and the applicable technical  rates, districts build overhead costs into projects. This multistep process  is outlined in fig. 2.", "Using the two categories of overhead defined in Corps policy as its  starting point, each district administrative and technical office\u2014with  assistance from district budget staff\u2014develops its own operating budget  with estimated overhead for the year. For administrative offices, officials  estimate annual expenses, and most of their employees\u2019 time is charged  as G&A overhead. For technical offices, officials estimate annual  revenues and expenses and also calculate the portion of technical office  labor costs that will be charged directly to projects and the portion that will  be charged to overhead. For example, a district\u2019s construction office  operating budget might estimate that a project manager would spend 85  percent of his/her time charging directly to projects and spend the  remaining 15 percent of the time charging to overhead for activities such  as attending training and staff meetings. The administrative and technical  offices\u2019 operating budgets also include costs for centrally provided  services, such as information technology, as well as certain expenses  with imposed caps, such as employee awards.", "Once each district administrative and technical office completes its  operating budget, the offices forward them to the district resource  manager\u2014who essentially serves as the chief financial officer for the  district. The district resource manager reviews and verifies information  from each office and then consolidates the submissions into a single  district operating budget. A district advisory committee\u2014known as the  Program Budget Advisory Committee\u2014reviews and recommends the  budget to the district commander for approval. District operating budgets  include proposed G&A and technical overhead rates for the district. Each  overhead rate is determined by dividing the total estimated overhead  costs for the category of overhead, such as G&A, by the total estimated  direct labor expected to be charged to projects. For example, if a division  estimated that the total G&A costs for all of its districts would be $200  million and estimated that the total district labor charges expected to be  directly billed to projects would be $1 billion, then the division\u2019s G&A rate  would be .20 ($200 million/$1 billion).", "Once district commanders approve their district\u2019s operating budget, the  district resource manager submits it to the division\u2019s resource manager  who reviews and verifies information and then consolidates all of the  district operating budgets into a division-wide operating budget with a  proposed single set of G&A and technical overhead rates for the division.  As is the case with the districts, a division advisory committee\u2014known as  the Regional Program Budget Advisory Committee\u2014reviews and  recommends the budget to the division commander for approval. With  limited exceptions, each division and district carries out this process  annually, with the result being a single set of G&A and technical overhead  rates charged each year for each Corps division. Overhead rates may  vary from division to division due to a number of factors, such as cost of  living (e.g., rent is higher for the San Francisco District than the  Albuquerque District) and composition of the workforce (e.g., a district  with more senior level staff has higher salaries than a district with more  junior level staff)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Corps Bills Projects for Overhead Costs Based on the Hours Charged by Corps Staff for Work Performed", "paragraphs": ["Once overhead rates have been calculated in the budget process, district  staff perform their work and charge their time to various project and  overhead revolving fund accounts.

Corps guidance calls for reviews of expenses and income no less than  quarterly to determine whether budget projections and the existing  overhead rates are on track. Corps officials told us that district staff,  including those from resource management and budget, meet at least  quarterly to review their actual expenditure of funds under a given budget.  Corps officials further stated that division resource management and  other officials meet at least quarterly with district staff to help ensure that  actual expenses align with budgeted amounts.

The names of the 16 customers we  interviewed are listed in table 2. Our questions covered the importance  customers place on obtaining overhead information, availability of and  access to such information, and the extent to which the overhead  information they receive is understandable. A detailed list of structured  interview questions is presented in appendix II. The structured interview  results are not generalizable to all Corps civil works customers but  provide illustrative examples for the 16 customers. We conducted  structured phone interviews from January 2013 to March 2013, and we  completed 16 of 16 interviews. Prior to interviewing the 16 customers, we  pretested the structured interview with two customers to ensure that the  questions were relevant, free of bias, clearly stated, and easy to  understand and, based on those results, made adjustments to the  structured interview as necessary. To ensure tabulated responses were  accurate, we checked data recorded during structured interviews. We  also spoke with Corps officials regarding customer views on the  accessibility and understandability of overhead information.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2012 to June 2013 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Structured Interview Administered to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 Customers", "paragraphs": ["We conducted structured interviews with 16 Corps customers that the  Corps identified as the highest paying federal and highest paying  nonfederal customers in fiscal year 2012\u2014one in each category from all  eight Corps divisions.
