Section 7602 of the Internal Revenue Code defines an audit as an examination of a taxpayer\u2019s books and records for the purpose of determining the correct tax liability. To better use audit resources, IRS attempts to identify and audit returns with the greatest likelihood of noncompliance, while seeking a minimum degree of audit coverage for each type of taxpayer to advance voluntary compliance.", "Compared to the 1960s and 1970s, the audit rate\u2014the annual percentage of individual tax returns that IRS has audited of the total number of individual tax returns filed\u2014has dropped, falling below 1 percent in fiscal year 1993. Although IRS believes that its audits induce voluntary taxpayer compliance, no one knows the actual impact, particularly given a decreasing audit rate. Data are available, however, to analyze both the trends in audit rates across the country and the results of these audits, such as the type of tax returns being audited and the productivity of the audits, measured by additional taxes recommended per return and per direct audit hour.", "This report responds to your request that we provide information on (1) the trend in IRS\u2019 audit rates for individual returns and (2) the overall results of IRS\u2019 most recent audits of individual returns. We analyzed the most recent years of available IRS data, including fiscal years 1988 through 1995 for the trend in audit rates, and fiscal years 1992 through 1994 for the overall audit results. We did not attempt an in-depth analysis to identify the reasons for the audit trends and results; however, we obtained the views of IRS Examination Division officials concerning these trends and results."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["IRS believes that taxpayers are more likely to voluntarily comply with the tax laws if they believe that their return may be audited and unpaid taxes identified. In concert with audits, IRS uses other enforcement and nonenforcement methods. For example, IRS uses computers to match information returns filed by banks and other third parties with individual tax returns so it can identify unreported income. In recent years, IRS has also emphasized taxpayer education and assistance to encourage voluntary compliance.", "As part of its audit approach, IRS has established 10 audit classes for individual returns based on taxpayer income\u20145 involving returns without business income, and 5 involving returns with business income from self-employment. IRS tracks audit results by these audit classes and also by various audit sources\u2014programs and techniques used to select potentially noncompliant returns for audit. Audit sources include, among others, suspected tax shelters, IRS and non-IRS referrals, compliance projects, and computer matches of third party information. One of the major audit sources\u2014discriminant function (DIF)\u2014 involves returns selected solely because of a computer score designed to predict individual tax returns most likely to result in additional taxes if audited. This scoring provides an objective way to select returns and has helped IRS avoid burdening potentially compliant taxpayers with an audit.", "Traditionally, IRS has done two types of face-to-face audits from its district offices to review taxpayers\u2019 books and records in support of a filed return: (1) field audits, in which an IRS revenue agent visits an individual taxpayer who has business income or a very complex return and (2) office audits, in which a tax auditor at an IRS office is visited by an individual taxpayer who has a less complex return. Tax examiners at IRS service centers also review returns and third-party information, and contact taxpayers concerning potential discrepancies on their returns. These discrepancies include such items as unreported income, as well as unallowable credits, such as the Earned Income Credit (EIC).", "Starting in fiscal year 1994, IRS decided to include all service center contacts by tax examiners as audits. IRS attributed this change to the fact that such contacts are part of its overall efforts to correct inaccurate returns. Unlike traditional field or office audits, these contacts usually involve a single tax issue on the return and do not involve a face-to-face audit. IRS is also counting other nontraditional types of work as audits, such as recent reviews of nonfilers done by district office auditors.", "After reviewing a taxpayer\u2019s support for the return, IRS auditors decide whether to recommend changes to tax liability. If a tax change is recommended, the taxpayer has the right to either agree with the recommended tax change or to appeal it through IRS\u2019 Office of Appeals or the courts. Depending on the outcome of such appeals, additional recommended tax revenue may or may not ultimately be assessed and collected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objectives were to provide information on the overall trend in IRS\u2019 individual audit rates and on the overall results of IRS\u2019 most recent individual audits. We did the audit rate analysis for fiscal years 1988 through 1995 because published data were readily available for this period. We did the audit results analysis for fiscal years 1992 through 1994 because this was the most recent readily available data.", "To determine the trend in IRS\u2019 audit rates, we reviewed IRS\u2019 annual reports for fiscal years 1987 through 1994 as well as unpublished data for fiscal year 1995. We collected information on the overall annual audit rates by type of taxpayer. We also collected information on the number of returns filed and the number of returns audited each year by IRS\u2019 regions and by the district offices within those regions. We reviewed this information to identify IRS\u2019 overall published audit rates for fiscal years 1988 through 1995, which included a combination of district office audits and service center contacts. To show what the overall rates would have been based solely on traditional district office audits, we recalculated these rates excluding service center contacts. We also used this information to calculate regional audit rates, both including and excluding service center contacts, as well as audit rates for each district office.", "To determine the specific results of IRS\u2019 audit efforts for fiscal years 1992 through 1994, we analyzed IRS Audit Information Management System (AIMS) data. IRS uses AIMS to track its audits of tax returns, including the resources used and any additional taxes recommended. We obtained copies of AIMS tapes for each year from fiscal year 1992 through 1994 and did various analyses to generate overall results for each year by (1) 10 individual audit classes, (2) 15 major audit sources, (3) 3 types of audit staff, and (4) 4 broad categories of audit closures. For each of these analyses, we determined the number and percentage of audited returns as well as the total direct hours and the total additional tax recommended for each year. From this information, we computed the direct hours per return, the taxes recommended per return, and the taxes recommended per direct hour for each year.", "Other than reconciling totals from the AIMS database to IRS\u2019 annual reports, we did not verify the accuracy of the AIMS data. Nor did we attempt an in-depth analysis to identify the reasons for the audit rate trends and audit results. Rather, we asked IRS Examination officials at the National Office to review our analysis of the audit rate trends and the audit results and provide explanations. We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. On March 26, 1996, several IRS Examination Division officials, including the Acting Assistant Commissioner (Examination); Director, Management and Analysis; and, Team Leader, Management and Analysis, as well as a representative from IRS\u2019 Office of Legislative Affairs, provided us with both oral and written comments.

During fiscal years 1994 and 1995, the audit rate increased, reaching 1.67 percent by 1995. IRS officials told us they attributed this increase to the involvement of district office auditors in pursuing nonfiler cases and the increasing number of EIC claims reviewed by service center examination staff.", "Starting in fiscal year 1994, IRS decided to include all service center contacts by tax examiners in its audit rates. As a result, when the annual statistics for fiscal years 1993 and 1994 were published, IRS also recomputed its audit rates for fiscal years 1988 through 1992 to include all service center contacts. Counting such work as part of the audit rate, coupled with IRS recent nonfiler and EIC emphasis, tended to produce higher audit rates, as most of this work takes less time to do than traditional face-to-face audits.

As shown in figure 2, two of these\u2014returns selected because of DIF or potential tax shelters\u2014declined by at least half, while the other two\u2014returns involving potential nonfilers or unallowable items\u2014at least tripled.

IRS Examination Division officials told us that these trends were consistent with TCMP data, which showed higher taxpayer noncompliance in IRS\u2019 Western and Southwest Regions and lower taxpayer noncompliance in its Central and Midwest Regions. With few exceptions, these regional patterns largely held true from fiscal years 1988 through 1995. (See table I.1 for our analysis of regional audit rates.)

Our analysis focused on individuals who reported significant amounts of business income and individuals who did not report such income, (i.e., nonbusiness), particularly those that were in the lowest- and highest-income groups. Figure 4 shows that the IRS reported audit rates from fiscal years 1988 to 1995 (1) increased in the last 2 fiscal years among those in the lowest-income group (less than $25,000), particularly for business individuals, for whom the rate more than doubled, and (2) decreased among those in the highest-income group ($100,000 or more), particularly for nonbusiness individuals, for whom the fiscal year 1995 rate dropped to about one-fourth of what it had been in fiscal year 1988. IRS Examination Division officials said they attributed the increase in audit rates for the lowest-income groups, which generally occurred in fiscal years 1994 and 1995, to the nonfiler initiative and the recent emphasis on EIC. They said the decrease in audit rates for the highest-income nonbusiness individuals was due to an overall reduction in examination staffing coupled with an increase in the number of returns filed for this income group.

In general, audits of the highest-income groups resulted in as much as 4 to 5 times more additional tax recommended per return\u2014for both nonbusiness and business individuals\u2014than did audits of the lowest-income groups. As figure 5 shows, from fiscal year 1992 to fiscal year 1994, additional taxes recommended per return (1) decreased among business individuals for the lowest-income group and increased for the highest-income group and (2) increased among nonbusiness individuals for the lowest-income group and decreased for the highest-income group. IRS Examination officials said the increases or decreases in additional taxes recommended from fiscal years 1992 to 1994 for both the highest-income business and nonbusiness individuals were affected by the small number of individual tax returns that IRS audited as part of its Coordinated Examination Program. This program is designed to audit the largest corporations; individual taxpayers audited under this program are usually corporate officers or shareholders.", "Another measure of audit productivity is the amount of additional taxes recommended for each direct audit hour used to complete the audit. Whereas from fiscal years 1992 to 1994, the amount of additional taxes recommended per direct hour was similar to the amount of additional taxes recommended per return for nonbusiness individuals; however, these amounts differed for business individuals. As figure 6 shows, from fiscal years 1992 to 1994, taxes recommended per direct hour (1) among business individuals increased for both the lowest- and highest-income groups and (2) increased among nonbusiness individuals for the lowest-income group and decreased for the highest-income group.
