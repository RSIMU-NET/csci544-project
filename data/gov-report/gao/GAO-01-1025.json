It also requires the Service to provide adequate and reasonable pay differences between clerks and carriers and their supervisors, such as postmasters, although the act does not specify what constitutes adequate and reasonable differences. Furthermore, the act requires the Service to consult with supervisor and postmaster organizations when planning and developing pay policies and other programs affecting their members. Since the mid-1970s, two postmaster organizations have voiced concerns that adequate and reasonable pay differences do not exist between postmasters and the clerks and carriers they supervise. Recently, the organizations took their concerns to Congress. The resulting Postmasters' Fairness and Rights Act would make substantive changes in the way postmasters' pay is determined. Most postmasters are now paid under the Service's Executive and Administrative Schedule (EAS), which is the salary schedule that applies to nearly all supervisory and management employees. Generally, postmaster pay consists of basic pay; pay-for-performance; lump-sum merit awards; and supplemental pay, such as overtime. In 1996, the Service lowered the minimum basic pay of the 26 EAS grades. This resulted in the minimum basic pay of EAS-15 and EAS-16 supervisors being less than the maximum basic pay of a grade 5 clerk, which was the most populated grade and pay level of the largest bargaining unit. Because of this and the 1970 Act's requirement that an adequate and reasonable pay difference be maintained, the Service established a Supervisory Differential Adjustment (SDA) policy for EAS-15 and above supervisors who are not eligible to receive overtime pay. This policy provides that these supervisors will be paid no less than five percent more than the maximum basic pay of a grade 5 clerk. GAO's analyses showed that two craft employees earned more in basic pay than did their local postmasters in 1999, and about one-half of one percent of craft employees earned more in gross pay than did their local postmasters. The five organizations that GAO selected to discuss pay practices had pay policies to minimize instances of craft employees earning more than their supervisors. These organizations indicated that craft employees only occasionally earned more than their supervisors."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report responds to your request for information on the U.S. Postal  Service\u2019s (Service) pay practices for postmasters who supervise craft  employees, including information on the Service\u2019s use of a Supervisory  Differential Adjustment (SDA) that the Service applies to the pay of first- line supervisors to help ensure that they earn more than their craft  employees.  As you know, the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 (1970  Act) requires that the Service pay wages comparable to the private sector.   It also requires that the Service provide adequate and reasonable pay  differences between clerks and carriers and their supervisors, such as  postmasters, although the 1970 Act does not specify what constitutes  adequate and reasonable differences.

Officials from the  organizations stated that they have long sought changes to increase the pay  difference and modify the consultation process.  They said they were  particularly concerned about extensive changes the Service made in 1996  to their pay and benefits, including the implementation of the SDA policy,  and the Service\u2019s nonacceptance of many of the recommendations the  organizations made during the consultations.  Recently, the organizations  took their concerns to the Congress.  As a result, Senator Daniel Akaka and  Representative Constance Morella introduced legislation\u2014the  Postmasters\u2019 Fairness and Rights Act (H.R. 250 and S. 177)\u2014to make  substantive changes in the way postmasters\u2019 pay is determined.", "To assist you in your consideration of this issue, we agreed with your office  to address the following objectives:  Describe the Postal Service\u2019s pay practices for postmasters, including  how the Service determines and applies its SDA.", "Determine whether any craft employees earned more than their local  postmasters during 1999 and, if so, why and to what extent.", "Determine other organizations\u2019 practices for establishing pay for  supervisors whose craft employees can earn more than they do, as well  as determine prevalent industry practices.", "We have also included information in this report (1) comparing the Postal  Reorganization Act of 1970 to proposed legislative changes in the  Postmasters\u2019 Fairness and Rights Act and (2) describing the Service\u2019s and  the postmaster organizations\u2019 views on the proposed act.", "On June 11, 2001, we briefed representatives from your office and others on  the preliminary results of our work.

Appendix III contains a detailed comparison of the current law  with the proposed Postmasters\u2019 Fairness and Rights Act, as well as the  views of the Service and the postmaster organizations on the proposed act.", "In completing our work, we reviewed the Postal Reorganization Act of  1970, its legislative history, and legal decisions regarding postmasters\u2019 pay.   We discussed pay practices for supervisors with officials from the Service,  postmaster organizations, and other selected organizations\u2014the Federal  Aviation Administration, Federal Express, the Tennessee Valley Authority,  United Parcel Service, and the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority.   Additionally, because the Service did not have data on whether, or to what  extent, craft employees earned more than their postmasters, we obtained  the Service\u2019s payroll files for 1999, the most recent year for which data  were available when we started our review.  These files contained the  biweekly pay records of over 1 million employees.  We focused our work on  443,942 full-time permanent postmasters, clerks, city carriers, and rural  carriers who had not been detailed to other jobs or changed their duty  stations during 1999.  We then eliminated those clerks and carriers whom  we could not match with their local postmasters, as well as postmasters  whose locations did not match with at least one clerk or carrier.  This  created a study group of 201,871 employees, consisting of 191,694 clerks  and carriers and the 10,177 postmasters who supervised them.  The 1970  Act did not specify whether basic or gross pay should be used in  determining adequate and reasonable differences in pay between clerks  and carriers and their supervisors.  As a result, we computed both basic  and gross pay for the employees in our study group to determine if any  clerks or carriers earned more than their local postmasters.  For purposes  of this report, we defined gross pay as all pay received during calendar year  1999, excluding severance payments, settlements, prior years\u2019 pay  adjustments, annual leave sell-back payments, and terminal leave  payments.  Basic pay was salaries and wages paid directly for duties  performed during the regular workweek.

The few remaining postmasters were covered by the Postal Career  Executive Service pay schedule, which is comparable to the Civil Service\u2019s  Senior Executive Service.   The Postal Service classified a little more than  half of its postmasters as nonexempt from the requirements of the Fair  Labor Standards Act and, as such, they are eligible for overtime pay at time- and-one-half.  The remaining postmasters were classified as exempt  employees and thus not eligible for overtime pay at time-and-one-half.   According to the Service, these postmasters were classified as exempt  because, among other things, they supervised two or more craft employees.", "During 1999, postmaster pay had four major components\u2014basic pay,  variable pay, merit awards, and premium pay.  Basic pay consisted of  salaries and wages paid directly for duties performed during the regular  workweek.  Variable pay\u2014Economic Value Added (EVA)\u2014was pay-for\u2013 performance cash rewards for achieving specific organizational goals and  targets.  Merit awards were lump-sum payments to recognize achievements  beyond what was normally expected.  Premium pay was supplemental pay  for overtime, nights, and holidays worked.  Basic pay, variable pay, and  merit awards and/or premium pay made up about 95 percent, 4 percent,  and 1 percent, respectively, of postmasters\u2019 gross pay.", "Using the results of a 1995 Hay Management report that compared EAS  and private sector compensation, the Service said that in 1996 it made  substantive changes to EAS pay.  Among other changes, the Service  lowered the basic pay minimums of the 26 EAS grades.  This change  resulted in the basic pay minimums of EAS-15 and EAS-16 exempt  supervisors being less than the basic pay maximum of a grade 5 clerk,  which was the most populated grade and pay level of the largest bargaining  unit.  To compensate for this lack of a pay difference and comply with the  requirement of the 1970 Act to provide adequate and reasonable pay  differences, the Service established an SDA policy for its EAS-15 exempt  supervisors and above.  The Service stated that it chose grade EAS-15  exempt supervisors as the starting point of eligibility for the SDA because  most exempt first-line supervisors were in grades EAS-15 and EAS-16.   (There were no EAS-16 postmasters, only supervisors.)  The SDA policy  provided that EAS-15 exempt supervisors and above were to be paid no  less than 5 percent more than the basic pay maximum of a grade 5 clerk.", "The Hay Management report indicated that of the private sector companies  that maintained a formal salary differential between supervisors and their  subordinates, the salary differential typically ranged from 10 to 15 percent.   The Service said it made a management decision to set the SDA at 5 percent  because it believed this amount would provide a visible difference between  the minimum pay of supervisors and the maximum basic pay of a grade 5  clerk.

No city carriers earned  more in basic pay than their local postmasters.  From a gross pay  perspective, 727 of the 191,694 craft employees (about one-half of 1  percent) earned more than their local postmasters.  These craft employees  earned, on average, about $2,400 more than their local postmasters.   Overtime paid to clerks and city carriers was the primary reason why they  earned more than their local postmasters.  According to the Service, the  inclusion of overtime in rural carriers\u2019 basic pay was the most probable  reason why they earned more.

As a general guide for determining supervisory pay scales, the  organizations relied heavily on surveys of prevailing salaries and other  compensation practices used by other organizations in similar markets.   According to the consulting firm Watson Wyatt, most private sector  companies use a market-based approach to set basic pay and other  compensation policies.  Watson Wyatt reported that about one in three  companies it surveyed (about 30 percent) had policies in place to help  ensure that supervisors earn more than their employees.

In  1996, the Service lowered the basic pay minimums of the EAS and  established an SDA of 5 percent to provide a pay difference for certain  postmasters and other supervisors in order to address this statutory  requirement.  However, since implementing the SDA, the Service had not  fully evaluated the impact of the differential on postmasters and other  supervisors.  Our review showed that in 1999, very few craft employees  earned more than their postmasters did in basic pay.  However, for gross  pay, about 12 percent of the postmasters we studied supervised craft  employees who either earned more than they did or earned within 5  percent of what they earned, apparently due to overtime.   Our review also  showed that most postmasters who earned less than their craft employees  were lower graded postmasters and not eligible for the SDA.", "Given the lack of specificity in the 1970 Act, we are not in a position to  conclude whether or not the results we found represent an adequate and  reasonable outcome regarding the pay differences for postmasters.   However, prior to our providing the results of our review to the Service, it  had only limited data to evaluate the impact of its SDA policy on  postmasters, including which postmasters should be eligible for, and the  amount of, the SDA.

Conversely, the presidents of the  postmaster organizations believed that the findings supported their  contention that adequate and reasonable differences do not exist.   Specifically, the President of the League stated that although the Congress  did not legislate the amount of the differential, the Congress considered a  25-percent differential to be reasonable and adequate.", "We continue to believe that given the lack of specificity in the 1970 Act, we  are not in a position to conclude whether or not the results we found  represent an adequate and reasonable outcome for postmasters.  With  respect to the League president\u2019s comment that the Congress considered a  25-percent differential to be reasonable and adequate, we did not find any  support for that view.  Although the legislative history indicated that the  Congress considered establishing a specific pay difference, the history also  indicated that the Congress chose not to do so because it did not want to  bind the Service to a fixed difference to be maintained in the future.  We  also note that a comment that there should be a minimum differential of at  least 25 percent was made by a former Assistant Postmaster General for  Personnel at a public hearing before enactment of the 1970 Act, not by the  Congress.", "The President of the League also expressed three concerns regarding the  data, methodology, and analyses used in our work.  First, he said the 1999  payroll data that we used in our analyses were outdated and did not  accurately reflect current pay conditions.  Second, the president was  concerned that we, for various reasons, excluded over 200,000 craft  employees and postmasters from our study group.  Third, the president was  concerned that we did not perform a thorough analysis of the earnings of  certain lower graded postmasters and their craft employees.  Specifically,  he noted that the lack of pay difference was most prevalent for EAS-15  postmasters and below.  He stated that we diminished the seriousness of  the pay inadequacies experienced by these lower graded postmasters when  we combined their earnings with those of higher graded postmasters to  create various statistics.  He said that a study of the pay differential should  be limited to EAS-18 postmasters and below and their craft employees.  He  went on to say that the magnitude of the lack of an adequate pay  differential cannot be accurately determined without comparing the pay of  all craft employees, including rural carriers, and postmasters.", "We agree with the President of the League that it would be helpful to have  more current data and additional analyses of the data, but this was not  possible to do in our review.  First, we used calendar year 1999 payroll data  because, at the time we started our work, these data were the most current  available.  Second, in order to have a level-playing field for our analyses, we  excluded certain craft employees and postmasters from our study group  for the following reasons.  As stated in the letter, we excluded all  employees who were not postmasters, clerks, city carriers, or rural  carriers.  We also excluded those clerks, carriers, and postmasters who  were not full-time permanent employees for the entire year, or were  detailed to other jobs or changed their duty stations during 1999.  Next, we  eliminated those clerks and carriers whose locations did not match with a  postmaster.  Also, we eliminated those postmasters whose locations did  not match with at least one clerk or carrier.  Third, due to complexities  associated with the payroll file and because of time constraints, we were  unable to do a more exhaustive analysis.  Finally, we were asked to review  the pay of all postmasters and not just EAS-18 postmasters and below.  We  recognize that combining the earnings of various grades of postmasters  does not provide specific data by grade; however, we believe that the data  that we do provide offer some insight into the pay of postmasters that was  not previously available.

Without such information, the Service was not in the best possible position to factually assess the adequacy and reasonableness of the Service\u2019s SDA policy or other pay differences."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions (cont.)", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Now that some data are available and an approach has been", "paragraphs": ["developed to analyze the Service\u2019s payroll data, the Service should be in a better position to make fact-based decisions on the adequacy and reasonableness of its SDA policy and pay differences."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to be in a better position to evaluate its SDA policy and the pay differences between postmasters and their craft employees, we recommend that the Postmaster General use postal payroll and any other comparable data to periodically:  determine the extent to which clerks and carriers may be earning more than their local postmasters, and the reasons why, if applicable; and reassess the adequacy and reasonableness of the pay differences between postmasters and the clerks and carriers they supervise."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comparison of Current Law to the Proposed Postmasters\u2019 Fairness and Rights Act and Views on the Proposed Act", "paragraphs": ["Under the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, the Service is required to  provide a program of consultation with organizations representing  supervisors and postmasters under which the organizations are entitled to  participate directly in the planning and development of pay policies and  schedules, fringe benefits, and other programs relating to their members  (39 U.S.C. 1004(b)).  Under this act, the Service must discuss its proposed  policies with postmaster organizations before they go into effect; and such  discussions must be conducted in a meaningful, good faith manner.   However, the Service cannot be forced to accept the postmaster  organizations' proposals on polices or even be compelled to negotiate  those policies with them.", "As a result of amendments to section 1004 in 1980, organizations  representing supervisors are entitled to additional protections and  procedures regarding the planning and development of pay policies and  other programs affecting their members.  For example, unless otherwise  mutually agreed to by both the Service and the organizations, the Service is  required to provide monthly meetings regarding the planning and  development of pay and benefit programs to organizations representing  supervisors.  In addition, if organizations representing supervisors are not  satisfied with the Service\u2019s decisions, they may request the Federal  Mediation and Conciliation Service to convene a fact-finding panel to  consider the matter.  Organizations representing postmasters are not  entitled to these protections and procedures.", "The Postmaster Fairness and Rights Act (the proposed act), H.R. 250 and S.  177, introduced in the 107th Congress, would provide new rights to  organizations representing postmasters with regard to the consultation  process.  Most notably, if the Service and postmasters were unable to  resolve any differences they might have regarding proposals on pay  policies or other programs, either party could refer the dispute to binding  arbitration.", "We requested the views of the Service and the postmaster organizations on  the proposed act.  The Service is opposed to the proposed act and believes  that it is unnecessary and will do irreparable damage to the Service\u2019s  mission.  The Service believes that the proposed act will create a labor  union relationship with supervisory and managerial employees, which is  inconsistent with the intent of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970.   According to the Service, supervisory unions are also inconsistent with the  intent of the National Labor Relations Act, which is the foundation for  union-management relations in the United States.", "The National League of Postmasters of the United States (the League)  strongly supports enactment of the proposed act and participated in its  development. The League told us that over the last several years,  postmasters have seen a continuous erosion of pay and benefits, including  diminished pay differentials, the loss of cost-of-living adjustments, and  reductions in convention and administrative leave.  According to the  League, under the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, postmasters have no  recourse when consultations with the Service produce unsatisfactory  results.  The League believes that the proposed act will help restore equity  to the pay and benefits of postmasters and will encourage fair and true  negotiation.", "The National Association of Postmasters of the United States (NAPUS) also  participated in developing the proposed act.  According to NAPUS, in  recent years, postmasters have been denied the ability to play a  constructive and productive role in discussions with senior postal  management over compensatory and programmatic issues.  NAPUS  believes that the proposed act will provide a more level playing field.  It  pointed out that in a number of instances outside the Service, management- level personnel are afforded opportunities to participate in a more  equitable discussion over pay and program issues.  According to NAPUS,  school administrators in a number of states and municipalities and airline  pilots are provided with these opportunities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the U.S. Postal Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the National Association of Postmasters of the United States", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the National League of Postmasters of the United States", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, exists to  support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities and to help improve  the performance and accountability of the federal government for the American  people.
