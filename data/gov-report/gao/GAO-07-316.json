LNG--a supercooled form of natural gas--currently accounts for about 3 percent of total U.S. natural gas supply, with an expected increase to about 17 percent by 2030, according to the Department of Energy (DOE). With this projected increase, many more LNG import terminals have been proposed. However, concerns have been raised about whether LNG tankers could become terrorist targets, causing the LNG cargo to spill and catch on fire, and potentially explode. DOE has recently funded a study to consider these effects; completion is expected in 2008. GAO was asked to (1) describe the results of recent studies on the consequences of an LNG spill and (2) identify the areas of agreement and disagreement among experts concerning the consequences of a terrorist attack on an LNG tanker. To address these objectives, GAO, among other things, convened an expert panel to discuss the consequences of an attack on an LNG tanker."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The six unclassified completed studies GAO reviewed examined the effect of a fire resulting from an LNG spill but produced varying results; some studies also examined other potential hazards of a large LNG spill. The studies' conclusions about the distance at which 30 seconds of exposure to the heat (heat hazard) could burn people ranged from less than 1/3 of a mile to about 1-1/4 miles. Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia) conducted one of the studies and concluded, based on its analysis of multiple attack scenarios, that a good estimate of the heat hazard distance would be about 1 mile. Federal agencies use this conclusion to assess proposals for new LNG import terminals. The variations among the studies occurred because researchers had to make modeling assumptions since there are no data for large LNG spills, either from accidental spills or spill experiments. These assumptions involved the size of the hole in the tanker; the volume of the LNG spilled; and environmental conditions, such as wind and waves. The three studies that considered LNG explosions concluded explosions were unlikely unless the LNG vapors were in a confined space. Only the Sandia study examined the potential for sequential failure of LNG cargo tanks (cascading failure) and concluded that up to three of the ship's five tanks could be involved in such an event and that this number of tanks would increase the duration of the LNG fire. GAO's expert panel generally agreed on the public safety impact of an LNG spill, but believed further study was needed to clarify the extent of these effects, and suggested priorities for this additional research. Experts agreed that the most likely public safety impact of an LNG spill is the heat hazard of a fire and that explosions are not likely to occur in the wake of an LNG spill. However, experts disagreed on the specific heat hazard and cascading failure conclusions reached by the Sandia study. DOE's recently funded study involving large-scale LNG fire experiments addresses some, but not all, of the research priorities identified by the expert panel. The leading unaddressed priority the panel cited was the potential for cascading failure of LNG tanks."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Worldwide, over 40,000 tanker cargos of liquefied natural gas (LNG) have  Worldwide, over 40,000 tanker cargos of liquefied natural gas (LNG) have  been shipped since 1959, and imports of LNG are projected to increase  been shipped since 1959, and imports of LNG are projected to increase  over the next 10 years.

At these terminals, the liquid is  reconverted into natural gas and then injected into the pipeline system for  consumers. Currently, the United States has a total of five LNG import  terminals\u2014four are considered onshore terminals, that is, they are located  within 3 miles of the shore; one is an offshore terminal located 116 miles  off the Louisiana coast in the Gulf of Mexico.", "The United States imports about 3 percent of its total natural gas supply as  LNG in recent years, but by 2030, LNG imports are projected to account  for about 17 percent of the U.S. natural gas supply, according to the  Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Energy Information Administration. To  meet this increased demand, energy companies have submitted 32  applications to build new terminals for importing LNG in 10 states and five  offshore areas.

In addition, the Coast Guard contributes to FERC\u2019s  review of onshore LNG facilities by reviewing and validating an applicant\u2019s  Waterway Suitability Assessment (WSA) and reaching a preliminary  conclusion as to whether the waterway is suitable for LNG operations with  regard to navigational safety and security considerations. The WSA  includes a security risk assessment to evaluate the public safety risk of an  LNG spill from a tanker following an attack. The security risk assessment  analyzes potential types of attacks, their probability, and the potential  consequences. The WSA also identifies appropriate strategies that can be  used to reduce the risk posed by a terrorist attack on an LNG tanker,  either by reducing the probability of an attack, or by reducing its  consequences. If the WSA deems the waterway suitable for LNG tanker  traffic, the Coast Guard provides FERC with a \u201cLetter of  Recommendation,\u201d which describes the overall risk reduction strategies  that will be used on LNG tankers traveling to the proposed terminal. The  Coast Guard is the lead federal agency for ensuring the security of active  LNG import terminals and tankers traveling within U.S. ports.", "As figure 1 shows, six new facilities have been proposed for the  northeastern United States, a region that faces gas supply challenges. The  Northeast has limited indigenous supplies of natural gas, and receives  most of its natural gas either through pipelines from the U.S. Gulf Coast or  Canada, or from overseas via tanker as LNG. The pipelines into the  Northeast currently run at or near capacity for much of the winter, and  demand is projected to significantly increase over the next 5 years,  exceeding available supply by 2010. To meet the increasing demand, new  supplies of natural gas must reach the Northeast by expanding existing  pipeline capacity, constructing new pipelines, or constructing new LNG  terminals\u2014all of which have risk associated with them. Difficulties siting  LNG facilities in the Northeast could lead to higher natural gas prices  unless additional supply can be brought into the region via new, or  expansion of old, pipelines.", "Scientists and the public have raised concerns about the potential hazards  that an LNG spill could pose. When LNG is spilled from a tanker, it forms a  pool of liquid on the water. Individuals who come into contact with LNG  could experience freeze burns. As the liquid warms and changes into  natural gas, it forms a visible, foglike vapor cloud close to the water. The  cloud mixes with ambient air as it continues to warm up and eventually  the natural gas disperses into the atmosphere. Under certain atmospheric  conditions, however, this cloud could drift into populated areas before  completely dispersing. Because an LNG vapor cloud displaces the oxygen  in the air, it could potentially asphyxiate people who come into contact  with it. Furthermore, like all natural gas, LNG vapors can be flammable,  depending on conditions. If the LNG vapor cloud ignites, the resulting fire  will burn back through the vapor cloud toward the initial spill. It will  continue to burn above the LNG that has pooled on the surface\u2014this is  known as a pool fire. Experiments to date have shown that LNG fires burn  hotter than oil fires of the same size. Both the cold temperatures of spilled  LNG and the high temperatures of an LNG fire have the potential to  significantly damage the tanker, causing multiple tanks on the ship to fail  in sequence\u2014called a cascading failure. Such a failure could increase the  severity of the incident. Finally, concerns have been raised about whether  an explosion could result from an LNG spill.", "Although LNG tankers have carried over 40,000 shipments worldwide  since 1959, there have been no LNG spills resulting from a cargo tank  rupture. Some safety incidents, such as groundings or collisions, have  resulted in small LNG spills that did not affect public safety. In the 1970s  and 1980s, experiments to determine the consequences of a spill examined  small LNG spills of up to 35 meters in diameter. Following the terrorist  attacks of September 11, 2001, however, many experts recognized that an  attack on an LNG tanker could result in a large spill\u2014a volume of LNG up  to 100 times greater than studied in past experiments. Since then, a  number of studies have reevaluated safety hazards of LNG tankers in light  of a potential terrorist threat. Because a major LNG spill has never  occurred, studies examining LNG hazards rely on computer models to  predict the effects of hypothetical accidents, often focusing on the  properties of LNG vapor fires. The Coast Guard uses one of these studies,  conducted in 2004 by Sandia National Laboratories, as a basis for  conducting the security risk assessment required in the WSA for proposed  onshore LNG facilities. Access to accurate information about the  consequences of LNG spills is crucial for developing accurate risk  assessments for LNG siting decisions. While an underestimation of the  consequences could expose the public to additional risk in the event of an  LNG spill, an overestimation of consequences could result in the use of  inappropriate and costly risk mitigation strategies. DOE recently funded a  new study\u2014to be completed by Sandia National Laboratories in 2008\u2014 that will conduct small- and large-scale LNG fire experiments to refine and  validate existing models (such as the one used by Sandia National  Laboratories in their 2004 study) that calculate the heat hazards of large  LNG fires.", "In this context, you asked us to (1) describe the results of recent  unclassified studies on the consequences of an LNG spill and (2) identify  the areas of agreement and disagreement among experts concerning the  consequences of a terrorist attack on an LNG tanker.", "To address the first objective, we identified eight unclassified, completed  studies of LNG hazards and reviewed the six studies that included new,  original research (either experimental or modeling) and clearly described  the methodology used. While we have not verified the scientific modeling  or results of these studies, the methods used seem appropriate for the  work conducted. We also interviewed agencies responsible for LNG  regulations and visited all four onshore LNG import facilities and one  export facility. To address the second objective, we identified 19  recognized experts in LNG hazard analysis and convened a Web-based  expert panel to obtain their views on LNG hazards and to get agreement  on as many issues as possible. In selecting experts for the panel, we  sought individuals who are widely recognized as having experience with  one or more key aspects of LNG hazard analysis. We sought to achieve  balance in representation from government, academia, consulting,  research organizations, and industry. Additionally, we ensured that our  expert panel included at least one author from each of the six unclassified  studies of LNG hazards.

When natural gas is  cooled to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit at atmospheric pressure, the gas  becomes a liquid, known as LNG, and it occupies only about 1/600th of the  volume of its gaseous state. Since LNG is maintained in an extremely  cooled state\u2014reducing its volume\u2014there is no need to store it under  pressure. This liquefaction process allows natural gas to be transported by  trucks or tanker vessels. LNG is not explosive or flammable in its liquid  state. When LNG is warmed, either at a regasification terminal or from  exposure to air as a result of a spill, it becomes a gas. As this gas mixes  with the surrounding air, a visible, low-lying vapor cloud results. This  vapor cloud can be ignited and burned only within a minimum and  maximum concentration of air and vapor (percentage by volume). For  methane, the dominant component of this vapor cloud, this flammability  range is between 5 percent and 15 percent by volume. When fuel  concentrations exceed the cloud\u2019s upper flammability limit, the cloud  cannot burn because too little oxygen is present. When fuel concentrations  are below the lower flammability limit, the cloud cannot burn because too  little methane is present. As the cloud vapors continue to warm, above  minus 160 degrees Fahrenheit, they become lighter than air and will rise  and disperse rather than collect near the ground.", "If the cloud vapors ignite, the resulting fire will burn back through the  vapor cloud toward the initial spill and will continue to burn above the  LNG that has pooled on the surface. This fire burns at an extremely high  temperature\u2014hotter than oil fires of the same size. LNG fires burn hotter  because the flame burns very cleanly and with little smoke. In oil fires, the  smoke emitted by the fire absorbs some of the heat from the fire and  reduces the amount of heat emitted. Scientists measure the amount of heat  given off by a fire by looking at the amount of heat energy emitted per unit  area as a function of time. This is called the surface emissive power of a  fire and is measured in kilowatts per square meter (kW/m). Generally, the  heat given off by an LNG fire is reported to be more than 200 kW/m. The heat from fire can be felt far away from the fire  itself. Scientists use heat flux\u2014also measured in kW/m can cause second degree burns after about 30 seconds of exposure  to bare skin. This heat flux can be compared with the heat from a candle\u2014 if a hand is held about 8 to 9 inches above the candle, second degree burns  could result in about 30 seconds. A heat flux of about 12.5 kW/m can damage steel structures.", "Four types of explosions could potentially occur after an LNG spill: rapid  phase transitions (RPT), deflagrations, detonations, and boiling-liquid- expanding-vapor-explosions (BLEVE). More specifically:    An RPT occurs when LNG is warmed and changes into natural gas nearly  instantaneously. An RPT generates a pressure wave that can range from  very small to large enough to damage lightweight structures. RPTs strong  enough to damage test equipment have occurred in past LNG spill  experiments on water, although their effects have been localized at the site  of the RPT.", "Deflagrations and detonations are explosions that involve combustion  (fire). They differ on the basis of the speed and strength of the pressure  wave generated: deflagrations move at subsonic velocities and can result  in pressures (overpressures) up to 8 times higher than the original  pressure; detonations travel faster\u2014at supersonic velocities\u2014and can  result in larger overpressures\u2014up to 20 times the original pressure.  Methane does not detonate as readily as other hydrocarbons; it requires a  larger explosion to initiate a detonation in a methane cloud.", "A BLEVE occurs when a liquefied gas is heated to above its boiling point  while contained within a tank. For instance, if a hot fire outside an LNG  tanker sufficiently heated the liquid inside, a percentage of the LNG within  the tank could \u201cflash\u201d into a vapor state virtually instantaneously, causing  the pressure within the tank to increase. LNG tanks do have pressure relief  valves, but if these were inadequate or failed, the pressure inside the tank  could rupture the tank. The escaping gas would be ignited by the fire  burning outside the tank, and a fireball would ensue. The rupture of the  tank could create an explosion and flying debris (portions of the tank).", "World natural gas reserves are abundant, estimated at about 6,300 trillion  cubic feet, or 65 times the volume of natural gas used in 2005. Much of this  gas is considered \u201cstranded\u201d because it is located in regions far from  consuming markets. Russia, Iran, and Qatar combined hold natural gas  reserves that represent more than half of the world total. Many countries  have imported LNG for years. In 2005, 13 countries shipped natural gas to  14 LNG-importing countries. LNG imports, as a percentage of a country\u2019s  total gas supply, for each of the importing countries ranged from 3 percent  in the United States to nearly 95 percent in Japan. In 2005, LNG imports to  the United States originated primarily in Trinidad and Tobago (70  percent), Algeria (15 percent), and Egypt (11 percent). The remaining 4  percent of U.S. LNG imports came from Oman, Malaysia, Nigeria, and  Qatar.", "LNG tankers primarily have two basic designs, called membrane or Moss  (see fig. 2). Both designs consist of an outer hull, inner hull, and cargo  containment system. In membrane tank designs, the cargo is contained by  an Invar, or stainless steel double-walled liner, that is structurally  supported by the vessel\u2019s inner hull.

The  results\u2014size of the LNG pool, the duration of the fire, and the heat hazard  distance for skin burn\u2014varied in part because the studies made different  assumptions about key parameters of LNG spills and also because they  were designed and conducted for different purposes. Key assumptions  made included the following:    Hole size and cascading failure. Hole size is an important parameter for  modeling LNG spills because of its relationship to the duration of the  event\u2014larger holes allow LNG to spill from the tanker more quickly,  resulting in larger LNG pools and shorter duration fires. Conversely, small  holes could create longer-duration fires. Cascading failure is important  because it increases the overall spill volume and the duration of the spill.", "Waves and wind. These conditions can affect the size of both the LNG  pool and the heat hazard zone. One study indicated that waves can inhibit  the spread of an LNG pool, keeping the pool size much smaller than it  would be on a smooth surface, and thereby reducing the size of the LNG  pool fire. Wind will tend to tilt the fire downwind (like a candle flame  blowing in the wind), increasing the heat hazard zone in that direction  (and decreasing it upwind).", "Volume of LNG spilled. The amount of LNG spilled is one of the factors  that can affect the size of the pool.", "Surface emissive power of the fire. While the amount of heat given off by  a large LNG fire is unknown, assumptions about it directly affect the  results for the heat hazard zone. It is expected that the surface emissive  power of LNG fires will be lower for large fires because oxygen will not  circulate efficiently within a very large fire. Lack of oxygen in the middle  of a large fire would lead to more smoke production, which would block  some of the heat from the fire.", "The LNG spill consequence studies\u2019 key assumptions and results are  shown in table 1.", "In terms of the studies\u2019 results, we identified the following three key  results:    Pool size describes the extent of the burning pool\u2014and can help people  understand how large the LNG fire itself will be.", "Heat hazard distance describes the distance at which 30 seconds of  exposure could cause second degree burns.", "Fire duration of the incident describes how long people and  infrastructure will be exposed to the heat from the fire.

Three of the six studies\u2014Quest,  Sandia, and Pitblado\u2014specifically addressed the consequences of LNG  spills caused by terrorist attacks. Two of these three studies\u2014Quest and  Sandia\u2014were commissioned by DOE. The Quest study, begun in response  to the September 11, 2001, attacks, was designed to quantify the heat  hazard zones for LNG tanker spills in Boston Harbor. Only the Quest study  examined how wind and waves would affect the spreading of the LNG on  the water and the size of the resulting LNG pool. The Quest study based its  wind and wave assumptions on weather data from buoys near Boston  Harbor. The Quest study found that, while the waves would help reduce  the size of the LNG pool, the winds that created the waves would tend to  increase the heat hazard distance downwind. To simplify the modeling of  the waves, the Quest study considered \u201cstanding\u201d waves (rather than  moving waves) of various heights and, therefore, did not consider the  impact of wave movement on LNG pool spreading. The ABSC study  expressed concern that Quest\u2019s standing wave assumption resulted in pool  sizes that were too small because wave movement might help spread the  LNG.", "The 2004 Sandia study was intended to develop guidance on a risk-based  analysis approach to assess potential threats to an LNG tanker, determine  the potential consequences of a large spill, and review techniques that  could be used to mitigate the consequences of an LNG spill. The  assumptions and results in table 1 for the Sandia study refer to the  scenarios Sandia examined that had terrorist causes. According to Sandia,  the study used available intelligence and historical data to develop  credible and possible scenarios for the kinds of attacks that could breach  an LNG tanker. Sandia then modeled how large a hole each of the weapon  scenarios could create in an LNG tanker. Two of these intentional breach  scenarios included cascading failure of three tanks on an LNG tanker. In  these cases, the LNG spill from one tank, as well as the subsequent fire,  causes the neighboring two tanks to fail on the LNG tanker, resulting in  LNG spills from three of the five tanks on the tanker. After considering all  of its scenarios, Sandia concluded that, as a rule-of-thumb, 1,600 meters is  a good approximation of the heat hazard distance for terrorist-induced  spills. However, as the table shows, one of Sandia\u2019s scenarios\u2014for a large  spill with cascading failure of three LNG tanks\u2014found that the distance  could exceed more than 2,000 meters and that the cascading failure would  increase the duration of the incident.", "Finally, the stated purpose of industry\u2019s Pitblado study was to develop  credible threat scenarios for attacks on LNG tankers and predict hazard  zones for LNG spills from those types of attacks. The study identified a  hole size smaller than the other studies that specifically considered  terrorist attacks.", "The other studies we reviewed examined LNG spills regardless of cause.  FERC commissioned the ABS Consulting study to develop appropriate  methods for estimating heat hazard zones from LNG spills. FERC uses  these methods, in conjunction with the Sandia study, to examine the  public safety consequences of tankers traveling to proposed onshore LNG  facilities before granting siting approval. The two scenarios in the ABSC  study illustrate how small holes could result in longer fires, which have a  higher potential to damage the tanker itself. One scenario used a hole size  of 0.79 square meters and the other a hole size of about 20 square meters.  The difference in duration is striking\u2014it takes 51 minutes and 4.2 minutes,  respectively, for the fire to consume all the spilled LNG.", "Finally, the Lehr and Fay studies compared the fire consequences of LNG  spills with known information about oil spills and fires. Although most  studies made similar assumptions about the volume of LNG spilled from  any single LNG tank, Lehr examined a much smaller spill volume\u2014just 500  cubic meters of LNG, compared with a range of 12,500 to 17,250 cubic  meters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Studies Examined Other Potential Hazards and Identified Their Impact on Public Safety", "paragraphs": ["Three of the studies also examined other potential hazards of an LNG spill,  including LNG vapor explosions, other types of explosions, and  asphyxiation.", "LNG vapor explosions. Three studies\u2014Sandia, ABSC, and Pitblado\u2014 examined LNG vapor explosions, and all agreed that it is unlikely that LNG  vapors could explode and create a pressure wave if the vapors are in an  unconfined space. Although the three studies agreed that LNG vapors  could explode only in confined areas, they did not conduct modeling or  describe the likelihood of such confinement after an LNG spill from a  tanker. The Sandia study stated that fire will generally progress through  the vapor cloud slowly and without producing an explosion with damaging  pressure waves. The study did suggest, however, that if the LNG vapor  cloud is confined (e.g., between the inner and outer hull of an LNG  carrier), it could explode but would only affect the immediate surrounding  area. The ABSC study and the Pitblado study agreed that a confined LNG  vapor cloud could result in an explosion.", "Other types of explosions. Three studies\u2014Sandia, ABSC, and Pitblado\u2014 examined the potential for RPTs.

Sandia also noted  that RPTs are not likely to cause structural damage to the vessel. The  ABSC study noted that their literature search suggested that damage from  RPT overpressures would be limited to the immediate vicinity, though it  noted that the literature did not include large spills like those that could be  caused by a terrorist attack. Only one study, Pitblado, discussed the  possibility of a BLEVE. According to our discussions with Dr. Pitblado, an  LNG ship with membrane tanks could not result in a BLEVE, but he said  that Moss spherical tanks could potentially result in a BLEVE. A BLEVE  could result because it is possible for pressure to build up in a Moss  tanker.

Three experts  emphasized in their comments that the vapor cloud is unlikely to penetrate  very far into a populated area before igniting. Expanding on this point, one  expert noted that any injuries from a vapor cloud fire would occur only at  the edges of a populated area, for example, along beaches. One expert  disagreed, arguing that a vapor cloud fire is unlikely to cause significant  secondary fires because it would not last long enough to ignite other  materials.", "Experts agreed that the main hazard to the public from a pool fire is the  heat from the fire but emphasized that the exact hazard distance depends  on site-specific and scenario-specific factors. Furthermore, a large,  unconfined pool fire is very difficult to extinguish; generally almost all the  LNG must be consumed before the fire goes out. Experts agreed that three  of the main factors that affect the amount of heat from an LNG fire are the  following:    Site-specific weather conditions. Weather conditions, such as wind and  humidity, can influence the heat hazard distances. For example, more  humid conditions allow heat to be absorbed by the moisture in the air,  reducing heat hazard distances.", "Composition of the LNG. The composition of the LNG can also affect the  distance at which heat from the fire is felt by the public. In small fires,  methane, which comprises between 84 percent and 97 percent of LNG,  burns cleanly, with little smoke. Other LNG components\u2014propane and  butane\u2014produce more smoke when burned, absorbing some of the fire\u2019s  heat and reducing the hazard distance. As the fire grows larger, the  influence of the composition of LNG is hypothesized to be less  pronounced because large fires do not burn efficiently.", "Size of the fire. The size of the fire has a major impact on its surface  emissive power; the heat hazard distance increases with pool size up to a  point but is expected to decrease for very large pools, like those caused by  a terrorist attack.", "Experts also discussed the following hazards related to an LNG spill:    RPTs.

Experts were split on  the likelihood of a confined deflagration occurring after a terrorist attack:  eight thought it was unlikely, four thought it likely, and five thought  neither likely nor unlikely.

Specifically, 7 of 15 experts thought Sandia\u2019s heat hazard  distance was \u201cabout right,\u201d and the remaining 8 experts were evenly split  as to whether the distance was \u201ctoo conservative\u201d (i.e., larger than needed  to protect the public) or \u201cnot conservative enough\u201d (i.e., too small to  protect the public). Experts who thought the distance was too  conservative generally listed one of two reasons. First, the assumptions  about the surface emissive power of large fires were incorrect because the  surface emissive power of large fires would be lower than Sandia  assumed. Second, Sandia\u2019s hazard distances are based on the maximum  size of a pool fire. However, these experts pointed out that once a pool fire  ignites, its diameter will begin to shrink, which will also reduce the heat  hazard distance. Experts who thought Sandia\u2019s heat hazard distance was  not conservative enough listed a number of concerns. For example,  Sandia\u2019s distances do not take into consideration the effects of cascading  failure. One expert suggested that a 1-meter hole in the center tank of an  LNG tanker that resulted in a pool fire could cause the near simultaneous  failure of the other four tanks, leading to a larger heat hazard zone.", "Officials at Sandia National Laboratories and our panel of experts  cautioned that the hazard distances presented cannot be applied to all  sites. According to the Sandia study authors, their goal was to provide  guidance to federal agencies on the order of magnitude of the hazards of  an LNG spill on water. As they pointed out in interviews and in their  original study, further analysis for specific sites is needed to understand  hazards in a particular location. Six experts on our panel also emphasized  the importance of site-specific and scenario-specific factors. For instance,  one expert explained that the 5kW/m hazard distance depends on the size  of the tanker and the spill scenario, including factors such as wind speed,  timing of ignition, and the location of the hole. Other experts suggested  that key factors are spill volume and the impact of waves. Additionally,  two experts explained that there is no \u201cbright line\u201d for hazards\u2014that is,  1,599 meters is not necessarily \u201cdangerous,\u201d and 1,601 meters is not  necessarily \u201csafe.\u201d", "Only 9 of 15 experts agreed with Sandia\u2019s conclusion that only three of the  five LNG tanks on a tanker would be involved in cascading failure. Five  experts noted that the Sandia study did not explain how it concluded that  only three tanks would be involved in cascading failure. Three experts said  that an LNG spill and subsequent fire could potentially result in the loss of  all tanks on board the tanker.", "Twelve of 16 experts agreed, however, with Sandia\u2019s conclusion that  cascading failure events are not likely to greatly increase (by more than 20  to 30 percent) the overall fire size or heat hazard ranges. The four experts  who disagreed with Sandia\u2019s conclusion about the public safety impact of  cascading failure cited two main reasons: (1) Sandia did not clearly  explain how it reached that conclusion and (2) the impact of cascading  failure will partly depend on how the incident unfolds. For instance, one  expert suggested that cascading failure could include a tank rupture,  fireball, or BLEVE, any of which could have direct impacts on the public  (from the explosive force) and which would change the heat hazard zones  that Sandia identified.", "Finally, experts agreed with Sandia\u2019s conclusion that consequence studies  should be used to support comprehensive, risk-based management and  planning approaches for identifying, preventing, and mitigating hazards  from potential LNG spills."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Experts Suggest Future Research Priorities to Determine the Public Safety Impact of an LNG Spill", "paragraphs": ["In the second iteration of the Web-based panel, we asked the experts to  identify the five areas related to the consequences of LNG spills that need  further research.

Experts believe this research is needed to establish the relationship  between large pool fires and the surface emissive power of the fire.  Experts recommended new LNG tests for fires between 15 meters and  1,000 meters. The median suggested test size was 100 meters. Some  experts also raised the issue of whether large LNG fires will stop behaving  like one single flame but instead break up into several smaller, shorter  flames. Sandia noted in its study that this behavior could reduce heat  hazard distances by a factor of two to three.", "Experts also ranked research into cascading failure of LNG tanks second  in the list of priorities. Concerning cascading failure, one expert noted  that, although the consequences could be serious, there are virtually no  data looking at the hull damage caused by exposure to extreme cold or  heat.", "As table 2 shows, DOE\u2019s recently funded study involving large-scale LNG  fire experiments addresses some, but not all, of the research priorities  identified by the expert panel.

Sandia  will validate the existing 35-meter data and then conduct similar tests for  pool sizes up to 100 meters. The goal of this fire testing is to document the  impact of smoke on large LNG pool fires. Sandia suggests that these tests  will create a higher degree of knowledge of large-scale pool fire behavior  and significantly lower the current uncertainty in predicting heat hazard  distances.", "According to researchers at Sandia National Laboratories, some of the  research our panel of experts suggested may not be appropriate. Sandia  indicated that comprehensive modeling, which allows various complex  processes to interact, would be very difficult to do because of the  uncertainty surrounding each individual process of the model.
