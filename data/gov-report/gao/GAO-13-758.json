With no dedicated funding, GAT Board plans are incremental and leverage ongoing agency initiatives designed to improve existing business processes as well as improve data transparency. These initiatives are in an early stage, and some progress has been made to bring greater consistency to award identifiers. The GAT Board's mandate is to provide strategic direction, not to implement changes. Further, while these early plans are being developed with input from a range of federal stakeholders, the GAT Board and OMB have not developed mechanisms for obtaining input from non-federal fund recipients.", "Lessons from implementing the transparency objectives of the Recovery Act could help inform these new initiatives:", "Standardize data to integrate systems and enhance accountability . Similar to the GAT Board's current focus on standardization, the Recovery Board recognized that standardized data would be more usable by the public and the Recovery Board for identifying potential misuse of federal funds. However, reporting requirements under the Recovery Act had to be met quickly. Because agencies did not collect spending data in a consistent manner, the most expedient approach was to collect data from fund recipients, even though similar data already existed in agency systems. Given the longer timeframes to develop current transparency initiatives, OMB and the GAT Board are working toward greater data consistency by focusing on data standards. Their plans, however, do not include long-term steps, such as working toward uniform award identifiers that would improve award tracking with less burden on recipients.", "Obtain stakeholder involvement as reporting requirements are developed . During the Recovery Act, federal officials listened to the concerns of recipients and made changes to guidance in response, which helped ensure they could meet those requirements. Without similar outreach under current initiatives, reporting challenges may not be addressed, potentially impairing the data's accuracy and completeness, and increasing burden on those reporting.", "Delineate clear requirements and lines of authority for implementing transparency initiatives . Unlike the present efforts to expand spending transparency, the Recovery Act provided OMB and the Recovery Board with clear authority and mandated reporting requirements. Given this clarity, transparency provisions were carried out successfully and on time.

Within the last decade, Congress and the  administration have taken several steps to improve the transparency of  federal spending data, including the passage of two statutes intended to  expand public access to information on federal programs. The first, the  Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA),  required the establishment of an information website on grant and  contract awards and subawards. Today, this federal agency and  subrecipient information is available at www.USAspending.gov. The  second, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery  Act), required that recipients\u2019 reports on award and spending data be  made available on a website.

At present, USAspending.gov  only provides data on funds awarded; the site does not include  information on disbursements. In terms of data collection, federal  agencies and recipients report to various systems, sometimes with the  same information and, as a result, direct unnecessary time and resources  to administrative activities. In addition, the lack of consistent data  structures prevents easy aggregation of data at the government-wide  level, hampering the ability to link existing financial, award, and  procurements systems. It also increases the cost of government  transactions and the burden on federal fund recipients. And, as we have  reported previously, the accuracy and reliability of the data needs to be  improved. Emerging transparency efforts include specific changes in  data collection under consideration by the Government Accountability and  Transparency Board (GAT Board), newly-created under a June 2011  Executive Order.

We also interviewed officials at the  General Services Administration (GSA), the agency that manages  USAspending.gov. To get their perspectives on lessons learned from both  the operation of existing transparency systems and federal efforts under  way to improve data transparency, we spoke with officials from  organizations representing federal fund recipients and government reform  organizations. We also conducted seven focus groups with federal fund  recipients representing state and local governments, nonprofit  organizations, higher education research institutions, and private  businesses who receive grants from, or contracted with, the federal  government. Finally, we reviewed our previous work on the reporting  successes and challenges experienced by both agencies and federal  fund recipients. This step allowed us to identify lessons learned from  those experiences that should be considered as new approaches to data  transparency are developed.

Both acts mandated the creation of public-access websites, which  involved a broad range of data-collection and data-reporting activities,  and required OMB and federal agencies, among others, to address  multiple levels of accountability and transparency. The passage of FFATA  was part of a series of legislative and executive branch efforts to make  comprehensive data on federal awards available to the public. Congress  passed FFATA in 2006 to increase the transparency of and accountability  for the more than $1 trillion in contracts and financial assistance awarded  annually by federal agencies. Among other things, the act required OMB  to establish a free, publicly accessible web site containing data on federal  awards (e.g., contracts, loans, and grants) no later than January 1, 2008.  In addition, the act required OMB to include data on subawards by  January 1, 2009 and authorized OMB to provide guidance and instruction  to agencies to ensure the existence and operation of the website, and  required agencies to comply with that guidance.

As a result, the board\u2014 while continuing to maintain its Recovery Act fraud-prevention efforts\u2014  has expanded its joint efforts with inspectors general and law  enforcement agencies.", "As discussed above, the GAT Board had previously identified data  standardization, including moving agencies toward a universal,  standardized identification system for all federal awards, as a critical step  for increased transparency. However, the degree to which data will be  standardized across the federal government is still the subject of some  debate among Board members. The recent OMB guidance requiring a  unique, but not uniform, grant identifier will result in a less standardized  approach for grants than contracts. Further, citing agency budgetary  constraints and the potential of emerging technologies for extracting non- standard data elements from disparate systems, GAT Board members  are taking incremental steps toward increasing data standardization. For  example, as the lead agency for the GAT Board\u2019s Grants Data  Standardization and Integrity Working Group, OMB asked HHS to  analyze the existing level of standardization among grant making  agencies, and assess the feasibility and cost of increasing data  standards. This analysis examined more than 1,110 individual data  elements from more than 17 different sources. It found that there was  widespread variation in terminology and associated definitions that  impacted how spending was captured, tracked, and reported. In addition,  through its work with the GAT Board, Treasury is assessing the potential  for implementing new technologies that would allow non-standardized  data to be accessed by tagging and linking it to source systems, rather  than collecting and warehousing data in a separate system.", "A lack of uniform standards could also increase the burden on federal  fund recipients. Federal fund recipients with whom we spoke told us that  the lack of consistent data standards and commonality in how data  elements are defined places undue burden on fund recipients because it  can result in them having to report the same information multiple times via  disparate reporting platforms. Fund recipients also told us that lack of  consistent data standards can impact the accuracy of data reported. For  example, one higher education official noted that increasing data  standardization and reporting consistency across the federal government  would eliminate the need for \u201chuman intervention\u201d or manual data entry  which can impact the accuracy and the timeliness of the data reported.  Moreover, collecting data that already exists in agency award systems is  also inefficient and burdensome to recipients. Federal fund recipients we  spoke to expressed concern about the number of disparate agency and  program-specific requirements that obligate them to report the same data  multiple times or to report data that should have come from federal  sources. These recipients offered a number of suggestions for minimizing  reporting redundancy, including limiting data collected from recipients to a  small number of essential elements that can only be obtained from  recipients, pre-populating electronic reporting forms with data available  from agency sources, and using data multiple times rather than requiring  that recipients report the same data multiple times."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lesson Two: Involve Stakeholders in the Development of Reporting Requirements and Guidance", "paragraphs": ["Another key lesson learned from the implementation of Recovery Act  reporting requirements was the importance of obtaining and considering  the input of stakeholders\u2014federal agencies, recipients, and  subrecipients\u2014early in the development of both the reporting system and  its procedures. Given the daunting task of rapidly establishing a system to  track billions of dollars in Recovery Act funding, OMB and the Recovery  Board implemented an iterative process. This process allowed many  stakeholders to provide insight into the challenges that could impede their  ability to report Recovery Act expenditures. Throughout the development  of guidance and in the early months of implementing recipient reporting  provisions, OMB and the Recovery Board provided several opportunities  for two-way communication with recipients. For example, OMB and the  Recovery Board held weekly conference calls with state and local  representatives to hear their comments and suggestions, and address  their concerns. As a result of these efforts, federal officials changed their  plans and related guidance. For example, initial guidance in February  2009 began to lay out information that would be reported on  Recovery.gov, and the steps needed to meet reporting requirements,  such as including recipient reporting requirements in grant awards and  contracts. In response to requests for more clarity, OMB, with input from  an array of stakeholders, issued more guidance in June 2009. The  guidance clarified requirements on reporting jobs, such as which  recipients were required to report, and how to calculate jobs created and  retained.", "During this current phase of developing transparency efforts, OMB and  the GAT Board have implemented a structure to obtain input from a  variety of federal stakeholders representing the procurement, grants, and  financial management communities. However, mechanisms for obtaining  input from non-federal stakeholders are limited to the public rule-making  process. The GAT Board\u2019s work groups consist of representatives from  select federal agencies, OMB, and interagency forums. The work groups  are designed to leverage the expertise of federal officials with in-depth  knowledge of federal procurement, grant-making, and financial  management operations. The Board does not have any formal  mechanisms, other than the federal rule-making process, to obtain input  from federal fund recipients. An OMB official told us that OMB is  leveraging pre-existing personal contacts made during the Recovery Act  to obtain feedback from state officials. Further, this official said that OMB  had conducted extensive outreach with non-federal stakeholders in  seeking their input on OMB\u2019s grants reform proposal. These outreach  efforts included discussions on standardizing financial information  collected during the pre-award and post-award phases of the grant  process. However, state officials we spoke with expressed interest in  providing additional input into expanding reporting requirements through  more formal mechanisms, such as focus or advisory groups. Without a  systematic approach for receiving and processing recipients\u2019 input, such  as the conference calls held for the Recovery Act, issues that could affect  recipients\u2019 ability to meet new reporting requirements could go  unaddressed, compromising the ability of recipients to provide accurate  data.", "Non-federal stakeholders have been involved in the limited GRIP pilot  project discussed above. Recovery Board officials sought feedback from  the participating states, a locality, and institutions of higher education  throughout the duration of the project through a series of webinars and  teleconferences. An online help desk was also established to assist the  recipients through the process. At the conclusion of the study, participants  were surveyed. They expressed approval for several of the project\u2019s  aspects, including data standardization, the inclusion of an error-checking  feature, and the use of a single central portal for reporting expenditures.  Although a Recovery Board official told us that they gained valuable  insight from stakeholders through the pilot, they reported that the more  inclusive networked community of state and local officials that they  established during the Recovery Act implementation had not been  sustained.", "Federal fund recipients we spoke with underscored the importance of the  maintaining the connections they established with federal officials during  the implementation of the Recovery Act. They also stressed the  importance of having a formal mechanism to provide feedback to the  federal government as guidance is crafted and before new transparency  reporting requirements are established. Federal fund recipients said that  they need clear and understandable guidance to ensure that the data  they report are accurate, on time, and minimally burdensome. Officials  from organizations representing fund recipients as well as the fund  recipients themselves told us that the interactions between OMB and fund  recipients during Recovery Act implementation were extremely effective.  They noted the frequent communication with OMB staff members who  listened to their concerns, addressed questions, and made adjustments to  guidance, made it easier for them to report accurate spending data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lesson Three: Delineate Clear Requirements and Lines of Authority for Implementation Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Need for Clear Guidance  \u201cGuidelines need to be clear and  uncomplicated so that people can follow them  without having to refer to multiple different  sources. You will not get the same level of  compliance and enthusiasm and you will  produce some degree of frustration if people  do not understand the requirements and have  limited resources to work with.\u201d\u2014 An official  from an association representing federal fund  recipients.", "Under the Recovery Act, specific requirements and responsibilities for  transparency were clearly laid out in the law, which helped to ensure that  transparency requirements were implemented within tight time frames,  and thereby provided unprecedented transparency. The Recovery Act  specified the timing of reporting, including its frequency and deadlines,  and the items that needed to be included in the reporting. The Recovery  Board reported that the concrete deadlines imposed by the Recovery Act  motivated OMB and the Recovery Board to take action. The Recovery Act  required the Recovery Board to conduct and coordinate oversight of the  funds provided under the Recovery Act to prevent waste, fraud and  abuse, which the Recovery Board accomplished, acting together with  OMB, at the federal level to implement the transparency requirements. To  implement the recipient reporting requirements, OMB worked with the  Recovery Board to deploy a data-collection system at  FederalReporting.gov and a public-facing website at Recovery.gov.  Further, OMB provided centralized guidance that defined the reporting  requirements and the agencies\u2019 role in ensuring the quality of data  recipients provided. An official from one association representing  recipients commented that having information come from one centralized  agency, such as OMB, helped assure recipients that their questions were  addressed correct. The Recovery Act also provided funding for the  Recovery Board, which was used to provide staff and resources for  developing and operating its data collection system, website, and data  analytic activities.", "In contrast, authority for implementing the current transparency initiatives  is not as clearly defined. Authority for expanding transparency is centered  in an executive order rather than legislation. As we have previously  reported, given the importance of leadership to any collaborative effort,  transitions and inconsistent leadership, which can occur as  administrations change, can weaken the effectiveness of any  collaborative efforts, and result in a lack of continuity. According to  chairman of the GAT Board, the Board\u2019s vision for comprehensive  transparency reform will take several years to implement. Therefore,  continuity of leadership becomes particularly important. Going forward,  changes in the administration and GAT Board membership could hamper  the success of future reform efforts if requirements and authorities for  implementing reforms are not clearly defined in statute. Moreover, the  executive order that establishes the GAT Board provides it with a role of  setting strategic direction, but not for implementation. As we have  previously reported, interagency collaboration on a project, such as  expanding transparency, is facilitated when one agency is designated to  be accountable, and there are clear roles and responsibilities. This  centralizes accountability and can speed decision making in an  organization. While there are many officials working together\u2014the GAT  Board, work groups led by agency officials, interagency forums such as  the Chief Acquisition Officers Council, Council on Financial Assistance  Reform and Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency,  and OMB\u2014it is not clear where responsibility for implementing the  initiatives lies. In oral comments provided on our draft report, OMB staff  said that the administration, through its fiscal year 2014 budget proposal,  has taken steps to delineate authority by seeking $5.5 million for Treasury  to operate and improve the USAspending.gov web site. They believe that  this proposal will establish Treasury as single implementing entity for  operationalizing transparency reforms.", "The lack of clearly delineated authority for implementing initiatives could  result in multiple projects working at cross-purposes, overlapping, or  missing opportunities to improve transparency consistently. The following  represents examples that we gleaned from our interviews and focus  groups:", "The GAT Board\u2019s Data Analytics work group has been examining  approaches to expanding the availability of data to help the oversight  community detect and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in federal  programs. Similarly, the Recovery Board\u2019s ROC has developed a set  of assessment tools that can search large amounts of data from  multiple sources to detect fraudulent spending in federal programs.  Although the GAT Board\u2019s mandate includes a requirement for it to  work with the Recovery Board to apply the approaches developed by  the latter across the federal government, the extent to which the work  of the ROC is being incorporated into the GAT Board\u2019s effort to  develop approaches for using data analytics to improve oversight is  unclear.", "The GAT Board and the Recovery Board have similar projects under  way to standardize grants data elements and procedures. The GAT  Board\u2019s Grants Data Standardization and Integrity Working Group is  identifying approaches to standardize key data elements to improve  the accuracy of grants award data. The Recovery Board\u2019s GRIP pilot  examined whether a uniform award identification number could be  used to track grants expenditures throughout the grant life cycle.  However, it is unclear whether the study\u2019s results will be incorporated  into the work of the Grants Data Standardization and Integrity Working  Group, which could lead to inefficiencies caused by duplicated efforts.", "Moreover, without operational authority, the GAT Board must leverage  the authorities and networks of its individual members. Thus, the  successful implementation of transparency initiatives depends on the  willingness and capacity of individual members\u2019 agencies to drive this  change, and may not be sustainable. For example, the GAT Board  chairman used his position on the FAR Council to have it consider and  vote on a proposed rule that will require all federal agencies to use a  uniform procurement identification number for all of its solicitations and  awards. The GAT Board chairman drove this initiative based on his  capacity as Director of the Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy  Office at DOD. However, the extent to which this governance structure  will be effective or sustainable over time is limited to and dependent upon  those existing connections.", "Unlike under the Recovery Act, these transparency initiatives are being  funded through existing agency resources using agency personnel, as  separate funding is unavailable. While the GAT Board lacks funding of its  own, it relies on agencies to develop approaches to improve data  transparency. Agency officials we spoke with said they expect that  automation and standardization mechanisms embedded in transparency  initiatives now under way could help federal agencies to more efficiently  and effectively manage their activities and programs. Efficiencies and  economies generated by these initiatives might have the potential to save  money, and thereby lessen the need for appropriations or other forms of  dedicated funding. In the short term, the GAT Board believes it can  continue to make incremental changes by leveraging ongoing agency  initiatives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Ensuring the transparency of more than $3.7 trillion in federal spending  annually, including more than $1 trillion awarded through contracts,  grants, and loans, and an additional $1 trillion in forgone revenue from tax  expenditures is an important national goal. Efforts to improve  transparency of spending data continue to involve multiple federal  entities, under the strategic leadership of the GAT Board and OMB.  Meanwhile, the Recovery Board continues to play a role in evaluating  new approaches to collecting data and maintaining systems to use the  data for ensuring accountability. However, roles and responsibilities for  the effort are not clearly delineated. For example, under the Recovery  Act, authority to mandate requirements was centered in OMB and the  Recovery Board, and was clearly delineated and funded, whereas under  the current transparency initiatives, the leadership for implementing  actions is spread across several agencies, knitted together loosely under  the GAT Board\u2019s strategic direction. Given the importance of clear  requirements and consistent leadership for ensuring recommended  approaches are institutionalized across the federal government and  progress is sustained over the long-term, the present governance  structure for transparency efforts could hamper planned advancements.  Having clear requirements and implementation authority, particularly  through legislation, will help ensure effective and sustained  implementation of transparency efforts across the federal government.", "While the transparency initiatives under way represent a promising start,  insights could be gleaned from lessons learned from the operation of  Recovery.gov. Such insights would ensure that new approaches are  implemented consistently across the federal government, and progress  toward strategic goals can be sustained long term. As OMB and the GAT  Board take incremental steps to improve data transparency and expand  oversight of federal spending, it will be important to develop a long-term  vision and concrete plan for improving transparency, and ensure its  implementation. For example, a key lesson learned from the  implementation of the Recovery Act was the importance of data  standards, including a universal award identifier to enable the tracking of  Recovery Act spending, and a uniform numbering system for identifying  federal awards would improve the tracking of all federal spending.  Moreover, by listening to stakeholders during Recovery Act  implementation, OMB and the Recovery Board heard concerns and made  changes to plans and guidance accordingly. As new transparency  initiatives are developed, the input of all stakeholders, including  nonfederal entities such as state and local governments, would help OMB  and the GAT Board to identify approaches that minimize the burden on  those doing the reporting, and address reporting challenges.

Regarding our recommendation  for developing a long-term plan for implementing data standards, OMB  staff agreed that the GAT Board\u2019s plan provides an initial strategy and  added that multiple initiatives are under way. One of these initiatives is  the administration\u2019s fiscal year 2014 budget proposal that would  operationalize comprehensive transparency through the transfer of  USAspending.gov from GSA to Treasury. We have provided additional  information on this in the report. For our recommendation on increasing  efforts to obtain stakeholder input as transparency initiatives are  developed, OMB staff agreed that increasing efforts to obtain stakeholder  input was important and pointed to their outreach to date particularly in  seeking stakeholder comments on the grants reform process, which they  said included discussions on standardizing financial information collected  from recipients during the pre-award and post-award phases of the grant  process. We have provided additional information in this report on this as  well. We continue to believe, however, that as specific proposals for  transparency initiatives are being developed, additional mechanisms  need to be in place to provide two-way communication to ensure that  reporting challenges are addressed without unduly increasing reporting  burden. OMB generally agreed with our matter for congressional  consideration on legislating transparency requirements, but noted that the  Congress has provided a robust statutory framework through legislation,  such as FFATA and the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, and therefore  additional legislation is unnecessary.
