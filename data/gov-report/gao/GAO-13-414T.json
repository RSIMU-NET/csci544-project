At the end of fiscal year 2011, DHS had about 41,400 personnel assigned to air, land, and sea POEs and along the border, at a cost of about $11.8 billion. DHS has reported that this stronger enforcement presence was one of several reasons why fewer people were attempting to illegally cross the border. However, challenges remain in securing the border. In recent years, GAO has reported on a variety of DHS border security programs and operations. As requested, this statement addresses some of the key issues and recommendations GAO has made in the following areas: (1) DHS's efforts to secure the border at and between POEs; (2) DHS interagency coordination and oversight of border security information sharing and enforcement efforts; and (3) DHS management of infrastructure, technology, and other assets used to secure the border. This statement is based on prior products GAO issued from January 2008 through February 2013, along with selected updates conducted in February 2013.

For example, since fiscal year 2011, DHS has used the number of apprehensions on the southwest border between ports of entry (POE) as an interim measure for border security. GAO reported in December 2012 that apprehensions decreased across the southwest border from fiscal years 2006 to 2011, which generally mirrored a decrease in estimated known illegal entries in each southwest border sector. CBP attributed this decrease in part to changes in the U.S. economy and increased resources for border security. Data reported by CBP's Office of Border Patrol (Border Patrol) show that total apprehensions across the southwest border increased from over 327,000 in fiscal year 2011 to about 357,000 in fiscal year 2012. It is too early to assess whether this increase indicates a change in the trend. GAO reported in December 2012 that the number of apprehensions provides information on activity levels but does not inform program results or resource allocation decisions. Border Patrol is in the process of developing performance goals and measures for assessing the progress of its efforts to secure the border between POEs, but it has not identified milestones and time frames for developing and implementing them, which GAO recommended that it do. DHS agreed and said that it plans to set a date for establishing such milestones and time frames by November 2013.", "DHS law enforcement partners reported improvements in interagency coordination and oversight of intelligence and enforcement operations, but gaps remain. GAO reported in November 2010 that information sharing and communication among federal law enforcement officials had increased; however, gaps remained in ensuring law enforcement officials had access to daily threat information. GAO recommended that relevant federal agencies determine if more guidance is needed for federal land closures and that they ensure interagency agreements for coordinating information and integrating operations are further implemented. These agencies agreed and in January 2011, CBP issued a memorandum affirming the importance of federal partnerships to address border security threats on federal lands. While this is a positive step, to fully satisfy the intent of GAO's recommendation, DHS needs to take further action to monitor and uphold implementation of the existing interagency agreements.", "Opportunities exist to improve DHS's management of border security assets. For example, DHS conceived the Secure Border Initiative Network as a surveillance technology and deployed such systems along 53 miles of Arizona's border. In January 2011, in response to performance, cost, and schedule concerns, DHS canceled future procurements, and developed the Arizona Border Surveillance Technology Plan (Plan) for the remainder of the Arizona border. GAO reported in November 2011 that in developing the new Plan, CBP conducted an analysis of alternatives, but it had not documented the analysis justifying the specific types, quantities, and deployment locations of technologies proposed in the Plan, which GAO recommended that it do.

Border  Patrol headquarters officials stated that until recently, each Border Patrol  sector decided how it would collect and report turn back and got away  data, and as a result, practices for collecting and reporting the data varied  across sectors and stations based on differences in agent experience and  judgment, resources, and terrain. Border Patrol headquarters officials  issued guidance in September 2012 to provide a more consistent,  standardized approach for the collection and reporting of turn back and  got away data by Border Patrol sectors. Each sector is to be individually  responsible for monitoring adherence to the guidance.

Since  fiscal year 2011, DHS has used the number of apprehensions on the  southwest border between ports of entry as an interim performance goal  and measure for border security as reported in its annual performance  report. Prior to this, DHS used operational control as its goal and outcome  measure for border security and to assess resource needs to accomplish  this goal. Operational control\u2014also referred to as effective control\u2014was  defined as the number of border miles where Border Patrol had the  capability to detect, respond to, and interdict cross-border illegal activity.  DHS last reported its progress and status in achieving operational control  of the borders in fiscal year 2010. At that time, DHS reported achieving  operational control for 1,107 (13 percent) of 8,607 miles across U.S.  northern, southwest, and coastal borders. Along the southwest border,  DHS reported achieving operational control for 873 (44 percent) of the  about 2,000 border miles. At the beginning of fiscal year 2011, DHS  transitioned from using operational control as its goal and outcome  measure for border security. We testified in May 2012 that the interim  goal and measure of number of apprehensions on the southwest border  between POEs provides information on activity levels but does not inform  program results or resource identification and allocation decisions, and  therefore until new goals and measures are developed, DHS and  Congress could experience reduced oversight and DHS accountability.  Further, studies commissioned by CBP have found that the number of  apprehensions bears little relationship to effectiveness because agency  officials do not compare these numbers with the amount of cross-border  illegal activity.", "Border Patrol officials stated that the agency is in the process of  developing performance goals and measures, but has not identified  milestones and time frames for developing and implementing them.  According to Border Patrol officials, establishing milestones and time  frames for the development of performance goals and measures is  contingent on the development of key elements of its new strategic plan,  such as a risk assessment tool, and the agency\u2019s time frames for  implementing these key elements\u2014targeted for fiscal years 2013 and  2014\u2014are subject to change. We recommended that CBP establish  milestones and time frames for developing a performance goal, or goals,  for border security between ports of entry that defines how border security  is to be measured, and a performance measure, or measures, for  assessing progress made in securing the border between ports of entry  and informing resource identification and allocation efforts.

In fiscal year 2012, CBP  inspected about 352 million travelers and over 107 million cars, trucks,  buses, trains, vessels, and aircraft at over 329 air, sea, and land POEs.  We have previously identified vulnerabilities in the traveler inspection  program and made recommendations to DHS for addressing these  vulnerabilities, and DHS implemented these recommendations. We  reported in January 2008 on weaknesses in CBP\u2019s inbound traveler  inspection program, including challenges in attaining budgeted staffing  levels because of attrition and lack of officer compliance with screening  procedures, such as those used to determine citizenship and admissibility  of travelers entering the country as required by law and CBP policy.  Contributing factors included a lack of focus, complacency, lack of  supervisory presence, and lack of training. We recommended that CBP  enhance internal controls in the inspection process, implement  performance measures for apprehending inadmissible aliens and other  violators, and establish measures for training provided to CBP officers  and new officer proficiency. DHS concurred with these recommendations  and has implemented them. Specifically, in January 2008, CBP reported,  among other things, that all land port directors are required to monitor and  assess compliance with eight different inspection activities using a self- inspection worksheet that is provided to senior CBP management. At that  time, CBP also established performance measures related to the  effectiveness of CBP interdiction efforts.

For example, we examined CBP\u2019s  results of covert tests of document fraud detection at POEs conducted  over more than 2 years and found weaknesses in the CBP inspection  process at the POEs that were tested. In response to these tests, CBP  developed a \u201cBack to Basics\u201d course in March 2010 for incumbent  officers, but had no plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the training.  Additionally, CBP had not conducted an analysis of all the possible  causes or systemic issues that may have contributed to the test results.  We recommended in December 2011 that CBP evaluate the \u201cBack to  Basics\u201d training course and analyze covert tests, and DHS concurred with  these recommendations. In April 2012, CBP officials notified GAO that it  had completed its evaluation of the \u201cBack to Basics\u201d training course and  implemented an updated, subsequent training course. In November 2012,  CBP officials stated they had analyzed the results of covert tests prior to  and since the implementation of the subsequent course. GAO is currently  reviewing CBP\u2019s analysis of the covert test results and other  documentation CBP has provided to determine the extent to which CBP  has addressed this recommendation. Further, in July 2012 CBP  completed a comprehensive analysis of the results of its document fraud  covert tests from fiscal years 2009 to 2011. In addition, we reported that  CBP had not conducted a needs assessment that would identify any gaps  between identified critical skills and incumbent officers\u2019 current skills and  competencies. We recommended in December 2011 that CBP conduct a  training needs assessment. DHS concurred with this recommendation. In  January 2013, CBP notified GAO it had developed a survey of incumbent  officers to seek feedback on possible gaps in training. CBP is currently  analyzing the survey results and preparing a report, which will  recommend a path forward to address training needs.

Through this initiative, DHS planned to  develop a comprehensive border protection system using technology,  known as the Secure Border Initiative Network (SBInet), and tactical  infrastructure\u2014fencing, roads, and lighting. Under this program, CBP  increased the number of southwest border miles with pedestrian and  vehicle fencing from 120 miles in fiscal year 2005 to about 650 miles  presently. We reported in May 2010 that CBP had not accounted for the  impact of its investment in border fencing and infrastructure on border  security. Specifically, CBP had reported an increase in control of  southwest border miles, but could not account separately for the impact of  the border fencing and other infrastructure. In September 2009, we  recommended that CBP determine the contribution of border fencing and  other infrastructure to border security. DHS concurred with our  recommendation and, in response, CBP contracted with the Homeland  Security Studies and Analysis Institute to conduct an analysis of the  impact of tactical infrastructure on border security. CBP reported in  February 2012 that preliminary results from this analysis indicate that an  additional 3 to 5 years are needed to ensure a credible assessment.", "Since the launch of SBI in 2005, we have identified a range of challenges  related to schedule delays and performance problems with SBInet.  SBInet was conceived as a surveillance technology to create a \u201cvirtual  fence\u201d along the border, and after spending nearly $1 billion, DHS  deployed SBInet systems along 53 miles of Arizona\u2019s border that  represent the highest risk for illegal entry. In January 2011, in response to  concerns regarding SBInet\u2019s performance, cost, and schedule, DHS  canceled future procurements.

In developing  the Plan, CBP conducted an analysis of alternatives and outreach to  potential vendors. However, CBP did not document the analysis justifying  the specific types, quantities, and deployment locations of border  surveillance technologies proposed in the Plan. Specifically, according to  CBP officials, CBP used a two-step process to develop the Plan. First,  CBP engaged the Homeland Security Studies and Analysis Institute to  conduct an analysis of alternatives beginning with ones for Arizona.  Second, following the completion of the analysis of alternatives, the  Border Patrol conducted its operational assessment, which included a  comparison of alternative border surveillance technologies and an  analysis of operational judgments to consider both effectiveness and cost.  While the first step in CBP\u2019s process to develop the Plan\u2014the analysis of  alternatives\u2014was well documented, the second step\u2014Border Patrol\u2019s  operational assessment\u2014was not transparent because of the lack of  documentation. As we reported in November 2011, without  documentation of the analysis justifying the specific types, quantities, and  deployment locations of border surveillance technologies proposed in the  Plan, an independent party cannot verify the process followed, identify  how the analysis of alternatives was used, assess the validity of the  decisions made, or justify the funding requested. We also reported that  CBP officials have not yet defined the mission benefits expected from  implementing the new Plan, and defining the expected benefit could help  improve CBP\u2019s ability to assess the effectiveness of the Plan as it is  implemented.", "In addition, we reported that CBP\u2019s 10-year life cycle cost estimate for the  Plan of $1.5 billion was based on an approximate order-of-magnitude  analysis, and agency officials were unable to determine a level of  confidence in their estimate, as best practices suggest. Specifically, we  found that the estimate reflected substantial features of best practices,  being both comprehensive and accurate, but it did not sufficiently meet  other characteristics of a high-quality cost estimate, such as credibility,  because it did not identify a level of confidence or quantify the impact of  risks. GAO and OMB guidance emphasize that reliable cost estimates are  important for program approval and continued receipt of annual funding.  In addition, because CBP was unable to determine a level of confidence  in its estimate, we reported that it would be difficult for CBP to determine  what levels of contingency funding may be needed to cover risks  associated with implementing new technologies along the remaining  Arizona border.", "We recommended in November 2011 that, among other things, CBP  document the analysis justifying the technologies proposed in the Plan,  determine its mission benefits, and determine a more robust life cycle  cost estimate for the Plan.

OAM issued various  plans that included strategic goals, mission responsibilities, and threat  information. However, we could not identify the underlying analyses used  to link these factors to the mix and placement of resources across  locations. OAM did not have documentation that clearly linked the  deployment decisions in the plan to mission needs or threats. For  example, while the southwest border was Border Patrol\u2019s highest priority  for resources in fiscal year 2010, it did not receive a higher rate of air  support than the northern border. Similarly, OAM did not document  analyses supporting the current mix and placement of marine assets  across locations. OAM officials said that while they generally documented  final decisions affecting the mix and placement of resources, they did not  have the resources to document assessments and analyses to support  these decisions.

Additionally, DHS shares overstay  information among its components through various mechanisms, such as  alerts that can inform a CBP primary inspection officer at a POE of a  nonimmigrant\u2019s history as an overstay violator, at which point the officer  can refer the nonimmigrant to secondary inspection for a more in-depth  review of the alien\u2019s record and admissibility. Furthermore, ICE\u2019s  Counterterrorism and Criminal Exploitation Unit uses data provided by  US-VISIT and various databases to identify leads for overstay cases, take  steps to verify the accuracy of the leads, prioritize leads to focus on those  identified as most likely to pose a threat to national security or public  safety, and conduct field investigations on priority, high-risk leads. From  fiscal years 2006 through 2010, ICE reported devoting a relatively  constant percent of its total field office investigative hours to  Counterterrorism and Criminal Exploitation Unit overstay investigations,  ranging from 3.1 to 3.4 percent.", "We reported in April 2011 that DHS was creating electronic alerts for  certain categories of overstays, such as those who overstay by more than  90 days, but was not creating alerts for those who overstay by less than  90 days to focus efforts on more egregious overstay violators, as  identified by CBP. We recommended in April 2011 that DHS assess the  costs and benefits of creating additional alerts, and DHS concurred with  this recommendation. DHS has since reported that it would begin creating  additional alerts, which could improve the chance that these individuals  are identified as overstays during subsequent encounters with federal  officials. We have additional work ongoing for congressional requesters in  this area regarding DHS\u2019s identification of and enforcement actions  against overstays and expect to issue a report with our final results in the  summer of 2013.", "This concludes my statement for the record."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["For further information about this statement, please contact Rebecca  Gambler at (202) 512-8777 or gamblerr@gao.gov.
