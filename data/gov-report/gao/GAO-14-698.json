As  shown in table 1, Ally Financial\u2019s tier 1 capital ratio increased from  2009 to 2010 but has declined slightly since 2011.

In 2013, Ally Financial reported that the tier 1  capital ratio declined, in part, because of the repurchase of Treasury\u2019s  mandatory convertible preferred shares, which qualified as tier 1  capital.

Generally, a larger tier 1  leverage ratio indicates that a company is less risky because it has  more equity to absorb losses in the value of its assets. As shown in  table 1, Ally Financial\u2019s leverage ratio has been reduced by 20  percent since 2009 but remains well above the regulatory minimum  guideline of 3 or 4 percent, depending on the bank holding company\u2019s  composite rating.", "12 C.F.R. 225, Appendix D, \u00a7 II. profitability, including net income (loss), net interest spread, return on  assets, and nonperforming asset ratio.", "Net income (loss): Ally Financial suffered a net loss in 2009 of $10  billion, but has reported net income for 4 of the last 5 years.

Ally Financial\u2019s net interest  spread increased from a reported 0.31 percent at the end of 2009 to  1.75 percent at the end of 2013, meaning that Ally Financial is earning  more interest on its assets than it is paying interest on its liabilities  (see table 2).", "Return on assets (ROA): ROA is calculated by dividing a company\u2019s  net income by its total assets.

However, according to Ally Financial representatives, the  company is the only automotive finance company that offers a suite of  products to dealers (financing, insurance, and auction services) and as a  result, the company expects to continue to be competitive in this  segment. Moreover, Ally Financial representatives told us that the  company has been focusing more on increasing profitability than on  market share\u2014consistent with its goals as a publicly held company,  which include maximizing return to shareholders. Company  representatives also have said in public statements that Ally Financial has  been focusing on reducing its noninterest expenses and lowering its cost  of funds.", "Ally Financial also faces competition from other large bank holding  companies in consumer automobile financing. We compared the amount  of Ally Financial consumer automobile financing with that of four large  bank holding companies (Bank of America Corporation, Capital One  Financial Corporation, JPMorgan Chase & Company, and Wells Fargo &  Company) that reported consumer automobile loans. These data do not  include all types of automobile financing, such as automobile leasing and  dealer financing, but only retail consumer automobile loans for the time  period.lending exceeded that of Ally Financial (see fig 5). The dollar amount of  consumer automobile loans that Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and  Capital One made increased from March 2011 through March 2014, while  the dollar amount of Ally Financial financing has declined since the fourth  quarter of 2012.

Using the AIFP program data, we analyzed Treasury\u2019s  equity ownership and recovery of funds in Ally Financial for the time  period from January 2009 through June 2014. We have previously  assessed the reliability of the AIFP program data from Treasury. For  example, we tested the Office of Financial Stability\u2019s internal controls over  financial reporting as they related to our annual audit of the office\u2019s  financial statements and found the information to be sufficiently reliable  based on the results of our audit of the TARP financial statements for  fiscal years 2009\u20142013.

We also reviewed  reports by several credit rating agencies on how they rate Ally Financial\u2019s  financial strength.
