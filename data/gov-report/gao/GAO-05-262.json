For example, SEC operating personnel did not consistently configure  password parameters securely, and users sometimes created easy-to-guess  passwords. User accounts and passwords for privileged network and  database administrator accounts were inappropriately stored in clear text,  increasing the likelihood of their disclosure and unauthorized use to gain  access to server resources.

Often segregation of computer functions is achieved by dividing  responsibilities among two or more organizational groups. Dividing duties  among two or more individuals or groups diminishes the likelihood that  errors and wrongful acts will go undetected because the activities of one  individual or group will serve as a check on the activities of the others.  Inadequate segregation of computer functions increases the risk that  erroneous or fraudulent transactions could be processed, improper  program changes implemented, and computer resources damaged or  destroyed.", "Although computer functions were generally properly segregated at SEC,  we identified instances in which functions were not adequately segregated.  For example, the commission did not sufficiently separate incompatible  system administration and security administration functions of computer  operating personnel on its key financial applications. To illustrate, the  individuals responsible for performing system support were also  responsible for setting security and audit parameters, reviewing user  access privileges, and adding and deleting system users. Similarly, SEC  assigned one individual to perform both security and software change  management functions. Yet SEC did not provide supervisory oversight or  establish other mitigating controls to ensure that this individual performed  only authorized functions.", "These conditions existed, in part, because SEC lacked implementing  guidelines for separating incompatible functions among personnel  administering its computer applications environment.

SEC\u2019s goal that only 90 percent of employees and  contractors complete security awareness training was not consistent with  information security laws that mandate training for all employees and  contractors. In addition, more than 100 staff and contractors serving in  positions that provide network operation oversight and other services that  provide access to system assets had not received specialized security  training."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Testing and Evaluating the Effectiveness of Controls", "paragraphs": ["Another key element of an information security program is ongoing testing  and evaluation to ensure that systems are in compliance with policies and  that policies and controls are both appropriate and effective. This type of  oversight is a fundamental element because it demonstrates management\u2019s  commitment to the security program, reminds employees of their roles and  responsibilities, and identifies and mitigates areas of noncompliance and  ineffectiveness. Although control tests and evaluations may encourage  compliance with security policies, the full benefits are not achieved unless  the results improve the security program. Analyzing the results of  monitoring efforts, as well as security reviews performed by external audit  organizations, provides security specialists and business managers with a  means of identifying new problem areas, reassessing the appropriateness  of existing controls, and identifying the need for new controls.", "SEC had not established a comprehensive program to test and evaluate the  effectiveness of information system controls. SEC had efforts under way to  test and evaluate controls, including limited ongoing tests of its computer  network. Also, SEC had initiated a formal IT certification and accreditation  program using contractor support to certify and accredit the commission\u2019s  major systems. However, at the completion of our review, none of the  commission\u2019s seven major applications and general support system had  been certified and accredited. Further efforts are still needed to fully  implement an ongoing program of tests and evaluation. Missing is an  ongoing program that targets the key control areas of physical and  electronic access, segregation of computer functions, application and  system software, and service continuity. An effective program of ongoing  tests and evaluations can be used to identify and correct information  security weaknesses such as those discussed in this report.", "Based on the results of tests and evaluations that have been conducted by  agencies, including OIG and external audit groups, FISMA requires that  agencies develop corrective action plans (e.g., plans of action and  milestones). However, in its latest FISMA report, OIG stated that SEC does  not have a comprehensive process that monitors and prioritizes all  identified information security weaknesses. In addition, it noted that all  information security weaknesses were not included in corrective action  plans. Without adequate corrective action plans, the results of tests and  evaluations may not be effectively used to improve the security program  and correct identified weaknesses.", "In response to identified weaknesses in SEC\u2019s information security  program, the CIO said that the commission would develop policies and  procedures to define the roles and responsibilities of its central security  group. These procedures would include coordination of responsibilities  between security individuals and functions. In addition, the commission  would develop a risk assessment framework to address the need to  perform periodic risk assessments and to conduct these assessments when  significant changes occur. SEC also intends to develop comprehensive  security policies, including security plans for all major applications and  general support systems. In addition, the commission plans to enhance its  requirements for security awareness training and expects to develop and  implement an ongoing security oversight program to include provisions for  monitoring compliance with established procedures and testing the  effectiveness of its controls."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Information systems controls were not effective at SEC. We identified  numerous weaknesses in electronic access controls and other information  system controls. As a result, financial and sensitive information was at  increased risk of unauthorized disclosure, modification, or loss, and  operations at risk of disruption. A key reason for SEC\u2019s weaknesses in  information system controls is that it has not yet fully developed and  implemented a comprehensive agency information security program to  ensure that effective controls are established and maintained and that  information security receives sufficient attention. Effective  implementation of such a program provides for an ongoing cycle of  periodically assessing risks, establishing appropriate policies and  procedures, promoting security awareness, and establishing an ongoing  program of tests and evaluations of the effectiveness of policies and  controls to ensure that they remain appropriate and accomplish their  intended purpose. Such a program is critical to providing SEC with a solid  foundation for resolving existing information security problems and  continuously managing information security risks. SEC has taken some  action to improve security management, including establishing a central  security management function, appointing a senior information security  officer to manage the program, and initiating actions to correct the specific  weaknesses summarized in this report. However, until it fully implements  an agency-wide information security program, SEC will have limited  assurance that its financial and sensitive information are adequately  protected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the SEC chairman direct the CIO to take the following  six actions to fully develop and implement an effective agency-wide  information security program: 1. Clearly define the roles and responsibilities of the central security  group. 2. Designate individual security staff to provide security oversight at  SEC\u2019s 11 field offices. 3. Develop a process for assessing information security risks, including  when significant changes are made to SEC facilities or computer  systems. 4. Establish and implement comprehensive information security policies  and procedures by addressing security requirements for key control  areas and developing and implementing security plans for general  support systems and major applications.  5.
