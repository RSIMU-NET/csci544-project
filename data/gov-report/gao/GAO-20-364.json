The insurance market would be significantly disrupted without a loss-sharing program such as that established under TRIA. Specifically, insurers generally would not have to offer terrorism risk coverage and likely would charge higher premiums in the absence of a loss-sharing arrangement and cap on losses, according to GAO's review of policies and interviews with industry stakeholders, including insurers and insurer associations. Without access to affordable coverage, new building ventures could be delayed and employers could struggle to find affordable workers' compensation coverage.", "Treasury has processes for certifying terrorist events and fulfilling claims under the program, but a lack of communication about aspects of Treasury's certification process could pose challenges for insurers.", "Some industry stakeholders, such as insurers and representatives of insurer associations, raised issues about Treasury communications on certification. They cited confusion over why the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing was not certified when they clearly viewed it as a terrorist attack. These industry stakeholders also expressed concern that Treasury never communicated whether it was reviewing the event for certification or its reasons for not certifying it. Most insurers GAO interviewed said such lack of communication by Treasury again could lead to uncertainty about whether to pay claims, putting them at risk of violating state laws and their policyholder agreements.", "TRIA regulations on certifying acts of terrorism include some public notification requirements but do not require Treasury to communicate when it is considering reviewing an event for certification.", "One purpose of TRIA is to stabilize the insurance market after a terrorist attack.

In addition, workers\u2019 compensation risks are  greater in large, metropolitan, more densely populated areas, and there  are higher aggregation risks for insurers in large metropolitan areas,  particularly for events involving NBCR weapons.

One insurer said that premiums likely would go up  significantly, although rate increases are subject to state limits. According  to another insurer, reinsurance coverage for terrorism risk likely would  become more limited, and be provided at notably higher rates. Insurers  that are public companies may be able to increase capital through the  stock market to build loss-absorbing capacity to help mitigate their  increased loss exposures if TRIA expired. However, mutual insurers are  not owned by shareholders and therefore cannot raise capital through the  sale of shares; instead, they would have to rely on other ways of building  capital.", "Several industry stakeholders pointed to particular challenges for certain  insurers and lines of coverage if TRIA expired and Congress did not  establish another loss-sharing program.", "Small insurers. Small insurers may be particularly vulnerable, facing  ratings downgrades or otherwise being forced to exit the market for  terrorism risk coverage, according to industry stakeholders.

AM Best identified 30 insurers (of about 230 with  significant terrorism risk exposure) that failed stress tests, but said in  October 2019 that implementation of plans established by these  insurers would mitigate concerns about insolvency in the event TRIA  expired and a terrorist attack occurred. The 30 insurers generally  were small or midsize insurers.", "Captive insurers. Captives (entities that businesses set up to self- insure) generally require private reinsurance to insure against  terrorism risk, and it is unclear if there would be sufficient capacity in  the reinsurance market to obtain this coverage without TRIA. Captives  tend to insure against a broader range of risks, including NBCR and  cyber risks, when that coverage is unavailable or unaffordable in the  market. One industry association representing captive insurers noted  that captive insurance likely would become a more common way to  insure against terrorism risk without a federal loss-sharing program.  However, it warned that captive insurers may lack the capacity to  ramp up operations quickly enough or secure the necessary  reinsurance to fully absorb the risk of increased losses.", "NBCR coverage. Coverage for terrorism attacks involving NBCR  weapons, which is already limited, would be further limited without a  federal loss-sharing program, according to industry stakeholders. One  industry association of insurance agents said that insurers\u2019 capacity to  absorb losses from such an attack would be a challenge without a  backstop, as it was during the aftermath of the September 11 attacks,  when there was very little capital devoted to coverage for terrorism  risk. The representatives said this capacity would be even more  limited for an NBCR attack, as losses could be significantly greater  and few insurers offer NBCR coverage.", "Workers\u2019 compensation coverage. The cost of coverage for  workers\u2019 compensation likely would increase significantly and  availability likely would decrease without a federal loss-sharing  program, according to researchers. Insurers have less flexibility to  control terrorism exposure in workers\u2019 compensation coverage,  relative to other TRIA-eligible lines, according to Treasury. As noted  earlier, state laws require employers to have the coverage and  prohibit insurers from excluding terrorism risk, including NBCR risks,  from workers\u2019 compensation policies, according to Treasury. Insurers  might respond to the absence of a federal loss-sharing program by  not providing workers\u2019 compensation coverage to employers,  particularly those near high-risk targets in major metropolitan areas,  according to a 2014 RAND Corporation policy brief issued before  TRIA\u2019s 2014 expiration. The brief added that this would force high-risk  employers in these areas to obtain the required coverage from the  residual market (state-run insurers or mechanisms of last resort), in  which premiums are higher.", "In addition, the absence of a loss-sharing program could disrupt  policyholders and the greater economy by stalling new building projects.  Some stakeholders noted concerns that new building projects might be  stalled if the law expired, similar to concerns in the weeks and months  following the September 11 terrorist attacks. At that time, policymakers  were concerned that the reduction in coverage by insurers uncertain of  future losses would render commercial developers in high-risk areas  unable to finance their projects, according to a report by the  Congressional Budget Office.

For insurers to receive  support from this federal backstop, they must  offer insurance for \u201cacts of terrorism\u201d defined  in a manner consistent with the law, which  requires certification by the Secretary of the  Treasury. A certification determination affects  policyholders differently, depending on if they  purchased or declined terrorism coverage.  Specifically, insurers would pay claims from  policyholders that purchased terrorism  coverage in the event of a certified act of  terrorism, whereas insurers would not pay  claims from policyholders that declined  terrorism coverage. Insurers could face  uncertainty about whether to pay claims on  both policy types, however, if the Secretary of  the Treasury does not make a certification  determination. This is because the definition  of an act of terrorism in insurance policies for  both policy types is often linked to  certification.", "Industry stakeholders and insurers we interviewed said they need to know  whether Treasury is considering certifying an event to help provide  certainty in paying policyholder claims and receiving reinsurance  payments (see sidebar).", "Policyholder claims. Industry stakeholders and four of five insurers  we interviewed said Treasury\u2019s lack of communication about an  event\u2019s potential certification can lead to uncertainty about whether to  pay claims on policies\u2014both those that include and exclude terrorism  coverage. Delays in paying claims while waiting for communication  about certification put them at risk of violating their agreements with  policyholders and state laws, they said. Insurance policies typically  have timeline requirements for the insurer to investigate and pay  claims, and some state laws require insurers to pay claims by a  certain date, according to NAIC. Treasury officials said state  requirements to pay claims by a certain date may receive extensions  under state regulation when uncertainty requires that a claim  investigation continue. One insurer with which we met said that a  statement from Treasury when it was considering an event would help  them determine whether to pay claims or not.", "Reinsurance. Industry stakeholders said uncertainty would delay  reinsurance coverage. If insurers delayed paying policyholder claims  because of uncertainty about certification of a terrorist attack,  reinsurers also might delay payments to insurers. Reinsurance  payments are often triggered by the insurer\u2019s payment of a claim to  the policyholder. Additionally, some reinsurance contracts may define  terrorism specifically as a Treasury-certified act of terrorism, and may  be contingent on Treasury making a certification determination.", "The goals of TRIA are to foster market stability and to protect consumers  by addressing market disruptions.
