Aware of such promotions, the Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance, raised concerns about whether Medicare could be vulnerable to overbilling for CORF services. In this report, focusing our review on Florida, we (1) compared Medicare's outpatient therapy payments to CORFs in 2002 with its payments that year to other facility-based outpatient therapy providers and (2) assessed the program's effectiveness in ensuring that payments to CORFs complied with Medicare rules."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In Florida, CORFs were by far the most expensive type of outpatient therapy provider in the Medicare program in 2002. Per-patient payments to CORFs for therapy services were 2 to 3 times higher than payments to other types of facility-based therapy providers. Higher therapy payments were largely due to the higher volume of services--more visits or more intensive therapy per visit--delivered to CORF patients. This pattern of relatively high CORF payments was evident in each of the eight metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) of the state where nearly all Florida CORFs operated and the vast majority of CORF patients were treated. A consistent pattern of high payments and service levels was also evident for patients in each of the diagnosis categories most commonly treated by CORFs. Differences in patient characteristics--age, sex, disability, and prior inpatient hospitalization--did not explain the higher payments that Florida CORFs received compared to other types of outpatient therapy providers. Steps taken by Medicare's claims administration contractor for Florida have not been sufficient to mitigate the risk of improper billing by CORFs. After examining state and national trends in payments to CORFs in 1999, the contractor increased its scrutiny of CORF claims to ensure that Medicare payments made to CORFs were appropriate. It found widespread billing irregularities in Florida CORF claims, including high rates of medically unnecessary therapy services. Since late 2001, the contractor has intensified its review of claims from new CORF providers and required medical documentation to support certain CORF services considered at high risk for billing errors. It has also required that supporting medical records documentation be submitted with all CORF claims for about 650 beneficiaries who had previously been identified as receiving medically unnecessary services. The contractor's analysis of 2002 claims data for this limited group of beneficiaries suggests that, as a result of these oversight efforts, Florida CORFs billed Medicare for substantially fewer therapy services than in previous years. However, our analysis of all CORF therapy claims for that year indicates that the contractor's program safeguards were not completely effective in controlling per-patient payments to CORFs statewide. With oversight focused on a small fraction of CORF patients, CORF facilities continued to provide high levels of services to beneficiaries whose claims were not targeted by the contractor's intensified reviews."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Outpatient therapy services are a covered benefit under Medicare\u2014the  federal program that finances health services for approximately 40 million  elderly and disabled individuals. Each year, about 9 percent of Medicare  beneficiaries use outpatient therapy services\u2014defined by the Medicare  program as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language  pathology services\u2014to improve mobility and functioning. To qualify for  coverage of outpatient therapy services under Medicare, beneficiaries  must be referred by a physician, have a written treatment plan that is  reviewed periodically by a physician, and need therapy for rehabilitation  rather than maintenance purposes. Several types of facility-based  providers offer outpatient therapy services, including outpatient  departments (OPD) at hospitals and skilled nursing facilities (SNF), and  rehabilitation agencies. These providers deliver services in ambulatory  settings such as clinics and community hospital outpatient departments.", "In many states, therapy services are also available through Comprehensive  Outpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (CORF). In 1980, Congress recognized  CORFs as potential Medicare participating providers to allow beneficiaries  access to both physician and therapy services in one stand-alone  outpatient facility. CORFs are different from other types of Medicare- certified outpatient therapy providers in that, in addition to physical  therapy, regulations require that they offer psychological or social services  and the services of a physician who specializes in rehabilitation medicine.  They are also unique in their authority to provide a variety of nontherapy  services\u2014such as respiratory treatment or nursing care\u2014as medically  necessary in the context of a patient\u2019s rehabilitation therapy treatment  plan. In general, services must be provided on the CORF premises at a  single, fixed location. However, physical therapy, occupational therapy,  and speech-language pathology services may be provided in places other  than the CORF\u2019s main location, such as in a patient\u2019s home. Back  disorders, arthritis, soft tissue injuries (such as joint sprains and strains),  and neurologic disorders (such as concussion) are common conditions  treated at CORFs.", "In recent years, CORF marketing consultants have actively promoted the  establishment of CORFs as lucrative business opportunities for investors.

The CORF industry in Florida continued to grow in 2003,  reaching 220 facilities by year\u2019s end, of which 96 percent were for profit.  The growth in Florida CORFs came after a period of substantial turnover  among CORF owners (many closures and new entrants).", "From 1999 to 2002, Medicare payments to Florida CORFs rose  substantially and far outpaced growth in the number of beneficiaries that  used CORFs. The number of Medicare beneficiaries receiving services  from CORFs grew 13 percent, increasing from 33,653 in 1999 to 38,024 in  2002. However, during the same time period, Medicare expenditures for  services billed by CORFs rose significantly, with total payments increasing  61 percent, from $48.1 million to $77.4 million.

For those that do, only a small proportion of Medicare  payments are accounted for by these services. In 2002, 98 percent of  Medicare payments to Florida CORFs went to furnish physical and  occupational therapy or speech-language pathology services. The mix of  services reimbursed by Medicare was very different in 1999, when such  therapy accounted for 68 percent of all payments, and the remainder paid  for nontherapy services, such as pulmonary treatments and psychiatric  care.", "In recent years, payments to Florida CORFs have increasingly shifted  toward those made for patients with back and musculoskeletal conditions.  Most notably, patients who presented with back disorders accounted for  16 percent of all Medicare payments to Florida CORFs in 1999 and 29  percent of payments in 2002. In addition, payments for treating patients  diagnosed with soft tissue injuries increased from 8 percent of Florida  CORF payments in 1999 to 24 percent in 2002. One diagnosis group for  which there was a notable decrease in the proportion of Medicare  payments was pulmonary disorders, which fell from 30 percent of all  payments in 1999 to 2 percent in 2002.", "In 2002, most of the 191 CORFs in Florida were small, with the median  CORF in the state treating 150 beneficiaries.

In a few areas, however, CORFs represented a substantial  share of the outpatient therapy market, particularly in south Florida.

As  shown in table 4, for all four leading diagnosis categories, CORF Medicare  patients received far more units of therapy, on average, than Medicare  patients treated by other outpatient therapy providers. Differences across  provider types were particularly pronounced for Medicare patients with  arthritis. CORFs furnished an average of 100 units of therapy to  beneficiaries treated for arthritis.

After conducting  additional reviews of a sample of paid claims from these CORFs, it found  that 82 percent of payments made were inappropriate, largely due to  questions about medical necessity. As a result, the contractor required  these CORFs to repay Medicare approximately 1 million dollars and  referred some of the CORFs to CMS and the HHS OIG for further  investigation.", "In late 2001, the Florida claims administration contractor implemented  additional claim review strategies targeting CORF claims.

While Medicare rules do  not prohibit beneficiaries from receiving services from multiple providers  in a single year, this occurs much more frequently among Florida CORFs  than among CORFs in other states. Specifically, in the five other states  with the greatest numbers of CORFs at the end of 2001 (Alabama,  California, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Texas), fewer than 4 percent of  beneficiaries received services from more than one CORF during 2002, and  in most of these states, the rate was 1 percent or less.", "Although many CORFs treated a few patients who received services from  multiple providers during 2002, a small group of Florida CORFs had very  high rates of \u201cshared\u201d patients that year\u2014suggesting that some CORFs  may have continued to operate in the patterns first detected by the Florida  contractor during its 2001 review.

However, three Florida CORFs received payments  exclusively for nontherapy services\u2014such as pulmonary treatment and  oxygen saturation tests\u2014in 2002.
