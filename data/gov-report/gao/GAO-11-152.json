GAO interviewed Labor officials, representatives from contractor associations and unions, contractors, and researchers; conducted site visits to three Labor regional offices; and analyzed data from Labor's wage survey database."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Recent efforts to improve the Davis-Bacon wage survey have not addressed key issues with timeliness, representativeness, and the utility of using the county as the basis for the wage calculation. Labor has made some data collection and processing changes; however, we found some surveys initiated under the new processes were behind Labor's processing schedule. Labor did not consult survey design experts, and some criticisms of the survey and wage determination process have not been addressed, including the representativeness and sufficiency of the data collected. For example, Labor cannot determine whether its wage determinations accurately reflect prevailing wages because it does not currently calculate response rates or analyze survey nonrespondents. And, while Labor is required by law to issue wage rates by the \"civil subdivision of the state,\" the goal to issue them at the county level is often not met because of insufficient survey response. In the published results for the four surveys in our review, Labor issued about 11 percent of wage rates for key job classifications (types of workers needed for one or more of Labor's construction types) using data from a single county. The rest were issued at the multi-county or state level. Over one-quarter of the wage rates were based on six or fewer workers. Little incentive to participate in Labor's Davis-Bacon wage surveys and a lack of transparency in the survey process remain key issues for stakeholders. Stakeholders said contractors may not participate because they lack resources, may not understand the purpose of the survey, or may not see the point in responding because they believe the prevailing wages issued by Labor are inaccurate. While most stakeholders said the survey form was generally easy to understand, some identified challenges with completing specific sections. Our review of reports by Labor's contracted auditor for four published surveys found most survey forms verified against payroll data had errors in areas such as number of employees and hourly and fringe benefit rates. Both contractor association and union officials said addressing a lack of transparency in how the published wage rates are set could result in a better understanding of the process and greater participation in the survey. GAO suggests Congress consider amending its requirement that Labor issue wage rates by civil subdivision to allow more flexibility. To improve the quality and timeliness of the Davis-Bacon wage surveys, GAO recommends Labor obtain objective expert advice on its survey design and methodology. GAO also recommends Labor take steps to improve the transparency of its wage determinations. Labor agreed with the second recommendation, but said obtaining expert survey advice may be premature given ongoing changes. We believe obtaining expert advice is critical for improving the quality of wage determinations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Procedures for determining Davis-Bacon prevailing wage rates, which  must be paid to workers on certain federally funded construction projects,  have long been an issue for Congress, employers, and workers. Concerns  have focused on the Department of Labor\u2019s (Labor) procedures for  determining prevailing wages and their vulnerability to the use of  inaccurate data. In the 1990s, we issued two reports that found process  changes were needed to increase confidence that wage rates were based  on accurate data. A third report, issued in 1999, found changes planned by  Labor, if successfully implemented, had the potential to improve the  survey process used to determine local prevailing wages. However, in  2004, Labor\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) found Labor\u2019s approaches  had not resolved past concerns, and wage data errors and the timeliness of  surveys continued to be issues. More recently, the passage of the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act)  focused attention on the need for accurate and timely wage  determinations, with more than $300 billion estimated to come from  Division A of the act which provides substantial funding for, among other  things, federally funded building and infrastructure work potentially  subject to Davis-Bacon wage rates.", "To address these issues, you asked us to examine Labor\u2019s current  implementation of the Davis-Bacon Act. We assessed (1) the extent to  which Labor has addressed concerns regarding the quality of the Davis- Bacon wage determination process and (2) additional issues identified by  stakeholders regarding the wage determination process.", "To assess the extent to which Labor has addressed concerns regarding the  quality of the wage determination process, we reviewed relevant federal  laws and regulations, interviewed Labor officials, and reviewed agency  documents on current survey practices and compared them with guidance  on data quality and survey design from the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) and Labor. OMB designed its guidance on data quality to  ensure agencies meet basic information quality standards for objectivity,  utility, and integrity of information before it is disseminated. We  conducted site visits to three of Labor\u2019s five regional offices that process  Davis-Bacon wage surveys\u2014Northeast region (Philadelphia), Southeast  region (Atlanta), and Southwest region (Dallas)\u2014to interview regional  staff who, Labor officials said, were conducting surveys under Labor\u2019s  recently revised processes. In addition, we conducted a site visit to the  Construction Industry Research and Policy Center (CIRPC) at the  University of Tennessee, which is contracted by Labor to estimate the  potential number of construction projects to be included in a specific  survey and conduct some aspects of the survey process. We also  compared 12 surveys for specific types of construction projects performed  under Labor\u2019s new processes against its revised processing timelines to  assess whether the surveys were on schedule. Further, we analyzed data  from Labor\u2019s Automated Survey Data System (ASDS) for wage rates from  the 2005 surveys of Florida and Maryland and the 2006 surveys of  Tennessee and West Texas Metropolitan. We selected these surveys  because results were recently published (in 2009 or 2010) and they  represented geographic diversity to the extent possible. We conducted  analyses on the geographic level at which rates were issued (i.e., county,  group, supergroup, or statewide) and the number of workers used to  calculate wage rates. In addition, we analyzed data from Labor\u2019s Wage  Determination Generation System to determine the proportion of union- prevailing to nonunion-prevailing wage rates and the age of currently  published wage rates. We assessed the reliability of the data we used by  reviewing pertinent system and process documentation, interviewing  knowledgeable officials, and conducting electronic testing on data fields  necessary for our analysis. We found the data we reviewed reliable for the  purposes of our analysis.", "To assess what additional issues were concerns for stakeholders, we  conducted approximately 30 interviews with a nonprobability selection of  representatives from academia, contractor associations, contractors, and  unions and performed a content analysis of their responses. For more  information on our scope and methodology, see appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2009 through  March 2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Davis-Bacon Act was enacted in 1931, in part, to protect communities  and workers from the economic disruption caused by contractors hiring  lower-wage workers from outside their local area, thus obtaining federal  construction contracts by underbidding competitors who pay local wage  rates. Davis-Bacon generally requires employers to pay locally prevailing  wages and fringe benefits to laborers and mechanics employed on  federally funded construction projects in excess of $2,000. The Recovery  Act requires all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors and  subcontractors on projects funded directly or assisted by the federal  government through the Recovery Act also be paid at least the prevailing  wage rate under Davis-Bacon. Our previous work found 40 programs,  such as the Weatherization Assistance Program, newly subject to Davis- Bacon requirements as a result of the Recovery Act\u2019s prevailing wage  provision. Of these, 33 programs existed prior to the Recovery Act but  were subject to the Davis-Bacon requirements for the first time, and 7  were newly created programs. In 2009, federally funded construction and  rehabilitation, including projects funded through the Recovery Act, totaled  about $220 billion.", "Labor administers the Davis-Bacon Act through its Wage and Hour  Division, which conducts voluntary surveys of construction contractors  and interested third parties on both federal and nonfederal projects to  obtain information on wages paid to workers in each construction job  classification by locality. It then uses the data submitted on these survey  forms to determine local prevailing wage and fringe benefit rates. In 2002,  Labor began conducting simultaneous statewide surveys for all four of its  construction types: highway, residential, building, and heavy. Labor  describes highway construction as the construction, alteration, or repair of  roads, streets, highways, runways, alleys, trails, parking areas, and other  similar projects not incidental to building or heavy construction.  Residential construction includes single-family homes and apartment  buildings that are not more than four stories. If a structure that houses  people is over four stories or if it houses machinery, equipment, or  supplies, it is considered building construction. Heavy construction  generally includes any project that does not fall into the other three  categories\u2014for example, dam and sewer projects.", "Labor determines which states it will survey each year based on a variety  of factors, including the date of a state\u2019s most recent survey, planned  federal construction, and complaints or requests from interested parties  on current wage determinations. The calculated wage and fringe benefit  rates that result from the surveys are posted online in wage  determinations and used by contractors working on federal construction  projects to prepare bids and pay workers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Past Concerns and Efforts to Improve the Wage Determination Process", "paragraphs": ["Both GAO and the Labor OIG have reported concerns with Labor\u2019s wage  determination process. In 1996, we found Labor had internal control  weaknesses that contributed to lack of confidence in the wage  determinations, including limitations in Labor\u2019s verification of wage and  fringe benefit data, its computer capabilities, and an appeals process that  was difficult for interested parties to access. In 1997, the OIG found  much of the data it examined to be inaccurate and potentially biased due  to weaknesses in survey methodology.", "For fiscal year 1997, Congress directed $3.75 million toward improvements  to the wage determination process. Using five criteria\u2014feasibility/viability,  timeliness, accuracy, completeness, and cost\u2014Labor evaluated two options:    Reengineering: Apply new technologies and processes to the existing  Davis-Bacon survey program to increase participation in and improve the  accuracy and timeliness of the surveys.", "Reinvention: Use existing Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data,  specifically data from BLS\u2019s Occupational Employment Statistics survey  and National Compensation Survey, as the primary basis for Davis-Bacon  wage determinations.", "In 1999, as Labor was evaluating these options, we again reviewed the  wage determination process and found, in response to a directive from a  congressional committee and our recommendation, Labor had  implemented a program to verify a sample of wage survey data, including  verifying data on site using employer payrolls. However, we agreed with  the OIG that verification efforts be viewed as temporary steps until more  fundamental reforms could be made to Labor\u2019s survey methodology. We  also found that reengineering or reinvention had the potential to improve  the accuracy and timeliness of the wage determination process.", "In January 2001, Labor reported to Congress it would pursue  reengineering. Labor concluded that reinvention (using BLS data) would  have the benefits of accuracy and timeliness, but presented challenges,  including difficulty in determining fringe benefits and in producing wage  estimates for a broad range of construction job classifications.  Reengineering, which included improvements to the wage survey form  (including a scannable form and online version) and a computer system to  assist with data clarification and analysis, would make it feasible to survey  every area of the country for all four construction types no less than every  3 years, Labor concluded.", "In 2004, the Labor OIG found Labor\u2019s reengineering had not resolved past  concerns. In a sample of wage survey forms (known as WD-10s) from  before and after reengineering, the OIG found errors in almost 100 percent  of verified survey forms. The OIG said these errors occurred even with a  revised WD-10, the introduction of an online WD-10, and efforts by Labor  analysts to review and correct data. Mistakes in survey data included  respondents using incorrect peak weeks, miscounts in the number of  workers in each job classification, and misreporting of wage rates\u2014for  example, reporting one wage rate for a job classification when two or  more wage rates existed. In addition, the OIG reported concerns about  bias because only contractors with the personnel to complete WD-10s may  respond and some may not participate to avoid involvement with the  government. The OIG also found that higher participation by either unions  or nonunion contractors could potentially weight the wage and benefit  rates in their favor. Finally, the OIG noted there had been little  improvement since its 1997 review in the time required to issue wage  determinations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Survey Process", "paragraphs": ["The current survey process, which conducts statewide surveys for all  construction types, consists of five basic phases (see fig. 1).", "Prior to the start of a survey, Labor identifies the state, construction types,  and survey time frame\u2014the time period in which a construction project  needs to be active to meet survey criteria\u2014and requests that CIRPC provide  a report on active construction projects for the identified time frame,  construction type, and geographical area. F.W. Dodge Reports for those  projects are then ordered and reviewed to ensure they meet the basic  criteria of the survey. Once a survey is scheduled, Labor usually conducts  pre-survey briefings for interested parties to clarify survey procedures and  provide information on how data should be submitted. Labor then sends  surveys to general contractors identified through the Dodge Reports and  relevant interested parties in the area to be surveyed. (See app. II for a copy  of the wage survey.) It also requests information from federal agencies on  construction projects that meet survey criteria. A follow-up letter is sent to  general contractors who do not respond. Subcontractors, identified by the  general contractors, are also sent an initial letter with a survey and a follow- up letter if they do not respond. Completed wage survey forms are returned  by either contractors or interested parties and are reviewed, under a  contract with Labor, by CIRPC, which matches submitted information with  its construction project and forwards it to the appropriate Labor regional  office. The regional offices clarify missing, ambiguous, or inconsistent  information to the extent possible, and pull random samples of wage survey  forms to verify by phone or on site. Officials request that supporting payroll  documentation be sent to the regional office. For on-site verification, Labor  contracts with a private accounting firm whose auditors review payroll  records. Any discrepancies between the wage survey form and the  contractor\u2019s payroll records are reviewed and corrected in the survey data  by Labor regional staff. Contractors selected for verification, who are not  able or willing to provide payroll records, can still be included in the survey  in most cases. See appendix III for a more detailed description of the wage  determination process.", "Labor uses several procedures to calculate wage rates and determine if it has  sufficient information from collected and verified surveys to issue a wage  determination\u2014a compilation of prevailing wage rates for multiple job  classifications in a given area. In determining a prevailing wage for a specific  job classification, Labor considers sufficient data to be the receipt of data on  at least three workers from two different employers in its designated area  who have that job. Then, in accordance with its regulations, Labor uses a \u201c50- percent rule\u201d to calculate the prevailing wage. The 50-percent rule states the  prevailing wage is the wage paid to the majority (over 50 percent) of workers  employed in a specific job classification on similar projects in the area. If the  same rate is not paid to a majority (over 50 percent) of workers in a job  classification, the prevailing wage is the average wage rate weighted by the  number of employees for which that rate was reported. In cases where the  prevailing rate is also a collectively bargained, or union, rate, the rate is  determined to be \u201cunion-prevailing.\u201d According to Labor\u2019s policy, union- prevailing wage rates in wage determinations can be updated when there is a  new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) without Labor conducting a new  survey. Nonunion-prevailing wage rates are not updated until a new survey is  conducted. To issue a wage determination for a construction type in a given  area, Labor must, according to its procedures, also have sufficient data to  determine prevailing wages for at least 50 percent of key job classifications.  Key job classifications are those determined necessary for one or more of the  four construction types.", "By statute, Labor must issue wage determinations based on similar projects  in the \u201ccivil subdivision of the state\u201d in which the federal work is to be  performed. Labor\u2019s regulations state the civil subdivision will be the  county, unless there are insufficient wage data. When data from a county  are insufficient to issue a wage rate for a job classification, a group of  counties is created by combining a rural county\u2019s data with data from one or  more contiguous rural counties. A metropolitan county\u2019s data are combined  with data from other counties in the state within the metropolitan statistical  area (MSA). If data are still insufficient to issue a wage rate, a supergroup is  created by combining a rural county\u2019s data with data from additional  contiguous rural counties, or a metropolitan county\u2019s data are combined  with county data from other MSAs or the consolidated MSA counties.  Finally, if this supergroup still does not provide sufficient wage data to issue  a wage rate for a job classification, a statewide rate is created by combining  data for all rural counties or all metropolitan counties in the state. Counties  are combined based on whether they are metropolitan or rural, and cannot  be mixed. Once wage determinations are issued, an interested party may  seek reconsideration and review through an appeals process. See figure 2  for an example of how wage data from Miami-Dade County, Florida, are  combined, as needed, with data from other counties to create group,  supergroup, and state wage rates."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Recent Efforts to Improve Data Collection and Processing Have Not Yet Addressed Key Issues with Survey Quality", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Labor\u2019s Changes to Survey Data Collection and Processing May Not Achieve Expected Results", "paragraphs": ["Labor has taken several steps over the last few years to address issues  with its Davis-Bacon wage surveys, including completing a number of  open surveys and changing how it collects and processes some survey  data in its efforts to improve timeliness and accuracy. However, these  efforts may not achieve Labor\u2019s desired results. We found some surveys  initiated under the new process are behind schedule and some published  wage rates are based on outdated data.", "In 2007, Labor officials decided not to initiate any new surveys in order to  finalize and publish results from 22 open surveys, which accumulated after  Labor began conducting statewide surveys in 2002. Regional office  officials said it was difficult and time-consuming to clarify and verify data  in these surveys because contractors often did not have easy access to  records for survey data which, in some cases, had been submitted several  years earlier. As of September 1, 2010, results from 20 of the 22 surveys  were published and results from the remaining 2 were in the process of  being published. Officials said once results from all 22 surveys are  published, they will be able to focus on more recent surveys, which will  reduce delays in processing and increase accuracy because more recently  collected information is easier and less time-consuming to clarify and  verify with contractors.", "Labor also changed how it collects survey data for its four construction  types after it conducted an informal review in 2009. Labor officials said  they had been using a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to surveys and were not  accounting for differences in types of construction activity, the  demographic characteristics of a given state, and available sources of  wage data. To address these differences, Labor began surveying some of  its four construction types separately instead of surveying all construction  types simultaneously in a given state. Labor also began using certified  payrolls as the primary data source for highway surveys. Labor officials  said most highway construction has a federal component and certified  payrolls provide accurate and reliable wage data. Officials also said using  certified payrolls eliminates the need for on-site verification of reported  wage data, although Labor continues to survey interested parties.  Officials estimate these efforts will reduce processing time for highway  surveys by more than 80 percent, or from about 42 months to 8 months.", "Labor adjusted its survey processes for residential, building, and heavy  construction types as well. For surveys of residential construction, Labor  plans to phone contractors and unions and visit contractor associations to  increase a historically low response. Officials said these collection  methods will be possible because of the small number of residential  projects compared to other construction types. Labor began conducting a  new residential survey in 2010. For building and heavy construction, Labor  started a pilot with five surveys in 2009, adjusting survey time frames\u2014 the time period in which a construction project has to be active for it to  meet survey criteria\u2014to better manage the quantity of data received.  Labor found its previous 1\u2013year survey time frame produced, in some  cases, too many or too few responses for building and heavy surveys.  Instead, by adjusting the survey time frame to account for the number of  projects in a particular region (with shorter time frames for areas in which  there are many active projects), Labor expects to reduce the time needed  to process surveys and determine prevailing wages. Overall, Labor  estimates these changes will reduce processing time for building and  heavy surveys by approximately 54 percent, or from about 37 months to 17  months.", "Labor also revised its approach to processing data for all surveys. Labor\u2019s  regional offices began reviewing and analyzing survey forms when they  are received rather than waiting until a survey closes. Labor officials said  this processing of data in \u201creal time\u201d will improve timeliness and accuracy  because survey respondents will be better able to recall the submitted  information when contacted by regional office staff for clarification and  verification.", "While it is too early to fully assess the effects of Labor\u2019s 2009 changes, our  review found timeliness is still an issue and improvements expected from  processing changes may not be fully realized. Of the 16 surveys started  under Labor\u2019s new processes at the time of our review, we were unable to  analyze the timeliness of 4\u20143 highway surveys and 1 building and heavy  survey\u2014because of unclear dates in Labor\u2019s data. A senior Labor official  said regional offices differed as to when they recorded dates for key  survey activities, and we found some recorded dates were out of sequence.  During the course of our review, the senior Labor official said regional  offices will consistently enter key dates for future surveys, which will  allow Labor to better assess whether new processes are improving  timeliness.", "Of the remaining 12 surveys for which we were able to assess timeliness, 8  were highway surveys for which Labor requested certified payrolls. Of  those 8, we found 6 were behind schedule, 1 was on schedule, and 1 had  not started as of September 1, 2010 (see fig. 3). A senior Labor official  said staff did not immediately start processing all certified payrolls\u2014 requested for all federal projects within a specific 1-year period\u2014when  they were received because of regional office workloads. As a result, some  certified payroll data were months old before Labor surveyed interested  parties. For example, as of September 1, 2010, certified payroll data for the  Florida 2009 highway survey were 8 months old, though Labor had not yet  surveyed interested parties. Moreover, processing certified payrolls may  be labor-intensive and time-consuming. A senior Labor official said the  agency cannot predict how many certified payrolls will be submitted by  state departments of transportation and often receives boxes of  documents for each survey. Some regional office officials said extracting  information from certified payrolls is difficult because of inconsistent  formats and frequently requires clarification with contractors. To address  these potential delays, a senior Labor official said they are considering  collecting certified payrolls monthly from states with upcoming surveys,  and processing the payrolls as they are received.", "The remaining 4 surveys were building and heavy surveys and all were  behind schedule as of September 1, 2010 (see fig. 4).", "In conducting a \u201cuniverse\u201d or \u201ccensus\u201d survey of all active construction  projects within a designated time frame and area, Labor accepts data from  a variety of sources, including contractors and interested parties. As a  result, the number of returned survey forms and the time required to  clarify data can vary widely. For example, for 14 surveys conducted under  past processes, the number of survey forms received for each ranged from  less than 2,000 to over 8,000, and the average processing time for data  clarification and analysis ranged from 10 months to more than 40. After  the 2009 changes, Labor estimates survey data clarification and analysis  will take about 1 to 7 months, depending on construction type. Some of  the anticipated time savings, particularly for building and heavy surveys, is  based on managing fewer forms because of its focus on the number of  projects in a particular region rather than a 1-year time frame. However, by  accepting data submitted by contractors and interested parties on any  relevant project as part of its universal survey approach, Labor is limited  in its ability to predict how many forms will be returned and the time  needed to process them. The more time required, the more likely wage  rates will be outdated when published in wage determinations. In addition,  Labor cannot entirely control when it receives survey forms. Though  Labor officials said processing survey forms as they are received will  improve timeliness, some regional office officials told us this \u201creal time\u201d  processing approach has a limited effect because the bulk of the forms are  returned on the last day of a survey. Additionally, officials in two of the  three regional offices we visited said this new approach is not  substantially different from their previous procedure. Since our site visits,  a senior Labor official said analysts at regional offices have noticed a  difference between processing forms in \u201creal time\u201d and their previous  procedure, and that increased use of online submissions is expected to  help reduce last-minute survey returns. To address such challenges, OMB  guidance suggests agencies consider the benefits and costs of conducting  a sample survey instead of a census survey. According to OMB, a sample  can be used to ensure data quality in a way that is often more efficient and  economical than a census.", "The fact that Labor is behind schedule on surveys even with the new 2009  processes may affect the agency\u2019s ability to update the many published  nonunion-prevailing wage rates, which are several years old. Labor\u2019s fiscal  year 2010 performance goal was for 90 percent of published wage rates for  building, heavy, and highway construction types to be no more than 3  years old. Our analysis of published rates for these three construction  types found 61 percent were 3 years old or less as of November 12, 2010.  However, this figure is somewhat misleading because it includes both  union-prevailing and nonunion-prevailing wage rates, which differ in how  they are updated. Union-prevailing rates, which constitute almost two- thirds of the over 650,000 published building, heavy, and highway rates,  may be updated when new CBAs are negotiated, and we found almost 75  percent of those rates were 3 years old or less as of November 12, 2010.  However, 36 percent of nonunion-prevailing rates, which are not updated  until Labor conducts a new survey, were 3 years old or less, and almost 46  percent were 10 or more years old. One regional office official and two  stakeholders we interviewed said Labor, in some cases, has had to update  nonunion-prevailing rates without a new survey because they no longer  complied with the federal minimum wage. Moreover, wage rates at the  time of publication may reflect wage data from several years prior due to  processing delays. For example, of the 20 open surveys for which Labor  had published results as of September 1, 2010, 9 published in 2009 or 2010  were based on data 5 or more years old at the time of publication and, of  those, 3 were based on data 7 or more years old. Though these survey  results were only recently published, the age of the wage data they contain  means those states will likely need to be resurveyed soon.", "Several of the union and contractor association officials we interviewed  said the age of the Davis-Bacon nonunion-prevailing rates means they  often do not reflect actual prevailing wages. As a result, they said it is  more difficult for both union and nonunion contractors to successfully bid  on federal projects because they cannot recruit workers with artificially  low wages but risk losing contracts if their bids reflect more realistic  wages. Labor officials said the only way to correct the age disparity  between union- and nonunion-prevailing rates is to conduct surveys more  frequently; however, some regional office officials said the goal to survey  each area every 3 years is not feasible with current processes. Those who  said it is feasible cited the need for adequate technology and staffing,  which they said is not in place in all regional offices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Critical Problems with Labor\u2019s Wage Survey Methodology Still Hinder Quality", "paragraphs": ["Although Labor has made recent changes to data collection and  processing, some critical problems with its survey methodology have not  been addressed.

Rather than  conducting a formal evaluation of the wage survey process and consulting  with experts in survey design and methodology, a senior Labor official  said the agency based changes on an informal review that drew on staff  experiences. While our prior work has shown it is reasonable and  desirable to obtain input from knowledgeable staff, technical guidance  from experts is considered critical to ensure the validity and reliability of  survey results.", "Labor cannot determine whether its Davis-Bacon survey results are  representative of prevailing wage rates because it does not currently  calculate response rates or conduct a nonresponse analysis. According to  OMB, response rate calculation and nonresponse analysis are important  because a low response rate may mean survey results are misleading or  inaccurate if those who respond to a survey differ substantially and  systematically from those who do not respond. A Labor official said that  when the agency started conducting statewide surveys in 2002, it stopped  calculating overall response rates because of the large volume of data  received and challenges in tracking who submitted specific information. In  addition, the official said Labor could not collect enough data to meet its  then-standard of data on at least six workers from three different  employers for each job classification, so it changed the standard to its  current three workers from two employers. This standard can be met  using data from a single county, multiple counties within a state, or  statewide. Also, aside from a second letter sent automatically to survey  nonrespondents, Labor does not currently have a program to  systematically follow up with or analyze all nonrespondents. Labor\u2019s own  procedures manual recognizes nonresponse as a potential source of  survey bias and indicates there is a higher risk nonrespondents will be  nonunion contractors because they may have greater difficulty in  compiling wage information or be more cautious about reporting wage  data. Despite this guidance, regional office officials said they spend the  bulk of their time clarifying data received. Of Labor\u2019s published wage rates  as of November 12, 2010, about 63 percent were union-prevailing; in  contrast, about 14 percent of construction workers nationwide were  represented by unions in 2010, according to BLS figures. Several of the  stakeholders we interviewed said the fact that Labor does not ensure the  representativeness of the survey responses reduces the accuracy of the  published wage rates. In addition, some regional office officials said  statistical sampling may make wage rates more accurate, although they  cautioned that some contractors or interested parties may not support a  change to sampling if it meant they would be excluded from participating  in the survey.", "During the course of our review, a senior official said Labor is taking steps  to again calculate response rates, beginning with updates to the survey  database and changes to the survey form, which will more clearly identify  who submitted wage information.

In the  results from the four surveys we reviewed\u2014Florida 2005, Maryland 2005,  Tennessee 2006, and West Texas Metropolitan 2006\u2014Labor issued about 11  percent of wage rates for key job classifications using data from a single  county (see fig. 5). About 22 percent of the wage rates were issued at the  group level (combined data from a group of counties within the same state)  and about 20 percent at the supergroup level (combined data from other  groups of counties within the same state). Almost 40 percent of the wage  rates were issued at the statewide level incorporating data from either all  metropolitan or all rural counties in the state. The remaining 7 percent  were issued for combined counties for which the geographic calculation  level was not available. (For more information on how the geographic level  of issued wage rates varied by construction type and by metropolitan and  rural rates, see app. I.)", "In 1997, Labor\u2019s OIG reported that issuing rates by county may cause wage  decisions to be based on an inadequate number of responses. In our  review of the four surveys, we found one-quarter of the final wage rates for  key job classifications were based on wages reported for six or fewer  workers (see fig. 6). (For more information on how the number of workers  used to determine rates varied by construction type and by metropolitan  and rural rates, see app. I.)", "In the surveys we reviewed, we also found Labor sometimes determined  prevailing wages based on small amounts of data even in metropolitan  areas. For example, in the 2005 survey of building construction in Florida,  the prevailing wage rate for a forklift operator in Miami-Dade County was  based on wages reported for five workers statewide.", "The statutory requirement to issue Davis-Bacon prevailing wages based on  a \u201ccivil subdivision of the state\u201d also limits Labor\u2019s options to address  inadequate data. For example, Labor is not able to augment its survey data  with data from other sources because those sources may draw from other  geographic areas, such as MSAs, which are not the same as civil  subdivisions. Officials from Labor\u2019s survey contractor, CIRPC, said one  way to improve accuracy is to survey areas other than counties. CIRPC  officials said the current wage survey uses arbitrary geographic divisions,  in contrast to other groupings, such as the economic areas used by the  Bureau of Economic Analysis, which are based on relevant regional  markets that frequently cross county and state lines. These groupings,  they said, are more reflective of area wage rates. Some stakeholders said  the focus on county-level wage rates results in the publication of illogical  rates. One contractor association representative said metropolitan  statistical areas would be more appropriate in New York, for example,  because there is a larger difference in wages between upstate and  downstate New York than between the counties containing the cities of  Rochester, Syracuse, and Buffalo. Another contractor association  representative said the geographic divisions used by Labor for prevailing  wages are illogical for projects not confined to a single county, offering the  example of a contractor paving a road that crossed a county line and who  was forced to pay workers different wage rates based on which side of the  line they worked."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Little Incentive to Participate and Lack of Transparency Remain Key Issues for Stakeholders", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Many Stakeholders Reported Contractors Lack Incentive to Participate in Davis-Bacon Surveys", "paragraphs": ["In our interviews with stakeholders about additional issues with Labor\u2019s  wage determination process, they provided several reasons why contractors  have little or no incentive to participate in the Davis-Bacon wage survey.  First, 19 of 29 stakeholders said contractors may not have the time or  resources to respond. An employee for one contractor said she had  returned the wage survey but might not have had she known it was  voluntary because her company was short-staffed. Other stakeholders said  contractors might not see the survey as a priority. Second, 16 stakeholders  said contractors either may not understand the purpose of the survey or do  not see the point in responding because they believe the prevailing wages  issued by Labor are inaccurate. Third, 10 stakeholders said contractors may  be reluctant to provide information to the government because they view it  as proprietary or fear that doing so will subject them to audits. Finally, 8  stakeholders said contractors who do not work on public projects may not  understand the survey is soliciting wage data from private as well as public  projects so they do not think they need to respond. For instance,  representatives from one state contractor association said some contractors  believe the wage survey only serves to perpetuate established rates because  wage surveys sent by Labor may have the names of projects subject to  Davis-Bacon already entered on the form.", "Officials we interviewed in Labor regional offices echoed many of these  concerns. They said contractors either think their survey responses will  not make a difference in the determination of prevailing wages or are  unaware they are being asked to submit information on private projects. A  contributing factor, one official said, is that the survey announcement  letter may not clearly communicate it is soliciting information on both  public and private construction. In our review of the contractor  announcement letter, we found it states that requested information will be  used to set prevailing wages and asks the contractor to fill out the wage  survey for the construction project listed on the form and any additional  projects that fit survey criteria. But the letter does not specifically state  that Labor is soliciting data for both public and private projects. (See app.  IV for copies of the survey announcement letters sent to contractors and  interested parties.) Additionally, some regional office officials said larger  contractors may be more likely to respond because they have more  resources, including administrative personnel, to complete the survey  form. They said contractors also may not respond because they find the  form complicated or do not understand its importance. Yet if contractors  call the regional office and Labor staff have an opportunity to explain the  reason for the survey and answer questions, many of those callers seem  more receptive to participating, some regional office officials said.", "A lack of survey participation by those on private construction projects could  result in Labor having to use data from federal projects, which are already  paying Davis-Bacon wages, to set prevailing wages for building and  residential construction. Per its regulations, Labor uses federal project data in  all highway and heavy surveys, but it only uses federal project data in building  and residential surveys when it lacks sufficient data from nonfederal  projects. In the results from the four surveys we reviewed, almost one- quarter of the building wage rates and over two-thirds of the residential rates  for the 16 key job classifications, such as carpenter and common laborer,  included federal data.

For example, five stakeholders said it is difficult to  know which job classification applies to their workers. Representatives  from one national contractor association said they had previously  informed Labor the survey form does not reflect nonunion industry  practices and contractors may not track data in a way that makes it easy to  fill out the form. As a result, they said most nonunion contractors opt not  to return the wage survey rather than attempt to break down their data to  fit its format. Other state contractor association representatives said  workers on some construction sites today perform tasks across multiple  job classifications; for example, a carpenter may also perform some tasks  of a laborer. Yet the survey form asks contractors to provide wages for a  worker by a single job classification. In addition, officials from one state  local union said, to assist contractor participation in the survey, they  created and distributed their own spreadsheet for contractors to fill out  because they thought it would be more easily understood than Labor\u2019s  wage survey form.", "Labor reported to Congress in 2006 that use of the scannable survey form  resulted in submission of more complete data, but our analysis of reports  for four state surveys found most verified forms still had errors. During on- site verification, Labor\u2019s contracted accounting firm compares clarified  wage survey data to a sample of contractor payroll records and reports any  discrepancies. These auditor reports show mistakes occurred most often in  the number of employees reported in each job classification, listed hourly  and fringe benefit wage rates, and project dollar value, some of which were  also issues in the 2004 Labor OIG report. A senior Labor official said one  reason contractors make errors on the form may be because they fill it out  from memory rather than consulting their payroll records. Officials said they  expect such errors to decrease under the new survey processes as Labor  analysts clarify contractor-submitted data sooner.", "Some of these errors may be due to the fact that Labor did not pretest its  current survey form with respondents. Officials said they are planning  another update to address portions of the form that consistently confuse  respondents. These include not having a place to note an \u201cinterested  party,\u201d rather than a \u201ccontractor\u201d or \u201csubcontractor,\u201d is filling out the  survey form, as well as improvements to the section on job classifications  and fringe benefits. Labor officials said they have solicited input on  potential revisions from CIRPC; their on-site verification contractor; the  U.S. Census Bureau, which is contracted to mail out the survey forms for  Labor; and their regional offices. During our interviews, a Labor official  said the agency would like to solicit input on proposed changes from  survey respondents, but could not provide specifics. Although part of  Labor\u2019s on-site verification process is to ask contractors questions about  using the current form, Labor needs feedback on proposed changes to  assess whether they will accomplish the goals of eliminating confusion  and reducing errors. OMB guidance states that careful questionnaire  design and pretesting can reduce measurement error and provide insights  into how alternative wording can affect survey respondents\u2019 answers.  Pretesting the new survey form with respondents to ensure changes  achieve the desired results will be particularly important given that a  Labor official said changing the form is a major undertaking.", "Labor officials did not have a specific time frame for implementing the  new form because they said they are waiting for upgrades to the wage  survey data system and their first priority is improving the online version  of the form. Planned improvements to the online version include allowing  respondents to save information rather than having to complete a survey  before exiting.

While 6 of 27  stakeholders we interviewed said the general contractor provided the  necessary wage information or they found the online wage determinations  relatively easy to use, others reported problems. For example, while OMB  and Labor guidance on data quality states that \u201cinfluential\u201d financial  information provided by the agency should include a high level of  transparency on data and methods, 15 stakeholders said there is a lack of  transparency in the wage determinations because key information is not  available or hard to find. In addition, both union and nonunion  stakeholders said Labor\u2019s wage determination Web site should more  clearly present information on the number of workers and wage rates used  to calculate prevailing wages for each job classification. Labor currently  makes some of this information available in a report known as a WD-22.  The printed WD-22 provides, for each job classification, information on the  final prevailing wage and fringe benefit rates, the total number of workers  reported, and the method of rate calculation\u2014for example, whether the  rate was based on a majority or an average (see fig. 7). A WD-22 is created  for each state survey by construction type, but this information is not  available on Labor\u2019s wage determination Web site. A senior Labor official  said the WD-22 information is currently available upon request; though,  the agency is considering posting it online along with other information  used to determine wage rates.", "In the listing above, the \"SU\" designation means that rates  listed under the  identifier do not reflect collectively bargained wage and  fringe benefit  rates.  Other designations indicate unions whose rates have  been determined  to be prevailing.", "Labor also changes the date at the top of a wage determination each  calendar year in a \u201croll-over\u201d process. Officials said the date is changed to  inform users the posted wage rates are valid for the current year, but the  wage rates contained in the determination are not necessarily updated. In  the Florida example (see fig. 8), the date at the top of the wage  determination is October 8, 2010, but wage rates associated with the \u201cSU,\u201d  or survey, designator on the lower half of the page are from May 22, 2009,  the publication date of the survey used to set those rates.", "A senior Labor official was not aware of users confusing the roll-over date  on the wage determination with the survey publication date. However,  OMB guidance states that when disseminating information products to  users, key variables should be defined and the time period covered by the  information and the date last updated should be provided. Not clearly  explaining each of these dates within the wage determination reduces the  transparency of when the last survey was conducted for an area, especially  if many years have passed. Additionally, if the wage determination only  contains union-prevailing rates, it does not contain any information about  when the area was last surveyed.", "Finally, 9 of 27 stakeholders said missing wage rates are also a challenge.  Specific job classifications may be missing from a wage determination if  Labor received insufficient survey data. If job classifications are missing,  contractors do not know what to bid on federal projects because they do  not know what they will have to pay some workers, workers do not know  what pay they will receive, and federal contracting agencies cannot  accurately estimate costs. When a wage rate for a job classification is  missing from the wage determination, it must be requested from Labor  through a conformance process. While federal projects have contracting  officers who typically request the conformance on behalf of the contactor,  eight stakeholders said the contracting officers may not be familiar with  the prevailing wages or the conformance process. Representatives from  one national contractor association said the difficulty of bidding on  projects when wage rates are missing, and then having to file a  conformance request in order to know what to pay, can deter smaller  contactors who might otherwise be interested in federal work. A Labor  official said the rates issued via conformance requests\u2014an average of over  3,000 per year were filed in fiscal years 2007, 2008, and 2009\u2014are only  good for the specific project on which they are issued and many are  repeated requests for job classifications for workers who operate specific  pieces of highway construction equipment.

While the official said there  is no required number of pre-survey briefings, regional office officials said  they ranged from one briefing for two states to five briefings within one  state for recent surveys depending on a state\u2019s size and characteristics.  Officials said they generally hold separate briefings for unions and  nonunion contractors/contractor associations. The presentation includes  information on how wage and fringe benefit data are obtained and  compiled, sufficiency requirements for issuing rates and wage  determinations, and the process for filing conformances and wage  determination appeals.

In response to those  criticisms, Labor has improved its process, most recently seeking out new  data sources for some construction types and adjusting the data collection  and processing time frames. Yet without clear tracking of key survey dates  and the time spent in various processing activities, Labor cannot assess if  its changes are improving survey timeliness and thus the accuracy of  published wage rates. Additionally, these efforts do not effectively address  some key issues with how data are collected. Because Labor has not  conducted checks over the past several years on the representativeness of  the data it receives, it cannot have high confidence its results accurately  reflect prevailing wages, no matter how diligently its staff work to clarify  and verify submitted data. If the resultant prevailing wage rates are too  high, they potentially cost the federal government and taxpayers more for  publicly funded construction projects or, if too low, they cost workers in  compensation. While Labor officials rightly used experience and corporate  knowledge in designing recent changes to survey methodology, they did  not enlist objective survey expertise to ensure methods were sound and in  accordance with best practices. Survey methodology that does not follow  best practices lowers confidence in the process and puts participation by  private contractors at risk.", "Labor\u2019s regulatory goal to issue wage rates at the county level may also  limit its ability to improve survey representativeness and timeliness. Labor  often must combine data from multiple counties to meet its own relatively  low sufficiency standards to publish wage rates for specific job  classifications which, in the end, may reflect the wages for as few as three  employees from two contractors for an entire state. The statutory  requirement to issue prevailing wages by \u201ccivil subdivision of the state\u201d  limits Labor\u2019s ability to account for relevant regional markets that cross  county or state boundaries or to tap into data based on other geographic  groupings. Use of other data sources to augment Davis-Bacon survey data  could shorten the time needed to publish wage rates and reduce the  number of conformances that contractors must file for missing wage rates.", "Given the voluntary nature of the survey, participants who take the time to  respond should have confidence their information will be considered in  determining prevailing wages.

Labor agreed with our recommendation to improve the transparency of  the wage determinations and indicated it is taking steps to do so. However,  the agency said our recommendation to obtain objective expert advice on  its survey design and methodology may be premature because additional  changes are currently being implemented or will be implemented based on  a 2004 review of the program by McGraw-Hill Construction Analytics. The  McGraw-Hill review was a process evaluation that assessed many aspects  of the wage survey; however, Labor officials did not indicate during our  interviews that the results of that evaluation were serving as the  foundation for their recent changes nor was the evaluation referred to in  documentation Labor provided regarding its recent changes. Moreover,  the McGraw-Hill report did not address certain issues related to the  survey\u2019s design and methodology. Therefore, we continue to believe that  Labor should have an independent statistical organization provide advice  on survey methods for the following reasons:    Labor cites examples of improvements to its processes and information  technology systems so that surveys can be completed and published in a  more timely manner. We also cited many of these data collection and  processing changes in our report along with the agency\u2019s expected  reduction in processing times for highway, building, and heavy surveys.  The survey timelines, which we used to assess whether surveys conducted  under new processes were on schedule, were provided to us by the agency  and included reductions in and elimination of various survey steps. Yet  according to those agency timelines, many of the surveys were behind  schedule. Labor commented it has reduced the time to publish survey  results for building and heavy construction from several years to an  average of 2 years. However, we believe it may face challenges staying on  schedule if it cannot more accurately predict how many survey forms it  will receive and the time required to process them. Possibilities to better  predict the number of survey responses, such as statistical sampling rather  than the current census survey, could be explored with survey experts.", "Labor also noted, as we did in our report, that it is again working to  calculate response rates and we believe this is a step in the right direction.  However, only calculating response rates will not ensure that the data  Labor is using to calculate prevailing wages are truly representative of the  wages being paid in a particular area. If a response rate is low\u2014some  wage rates are calculated on as few as three workers\u2014then Labor must  also analyze nonrespondents to ensure that those who received a survey  but did not respond do not significantly differ from those who responded.  Survey expertise could assist with this critical data quality check to help  ensure prevailing wages are representative of wages actually paid to  workers.", "Labor commented that the current survey form was not recently  redesigned, but is a scannable version of the form that was last updated in  2004. We adjusted our report language accordingly. The agency also noted  that errors on wage survey forms typically result from errors in the  information provided by survey respondents rather than errors made by  Wage and Hour Division employees. We agree; however, we believe the  fact that respondents continue to make some of the same errors in  completing the wage survey form that were identified by the Labor OIG in  2004 is a concern. Labor did not pretest the current form with survey  respondents to ensure clarity, which could partially explain why  contractors and interested parties made errors. A professional survey  methodologist could develop a pretesting plan to address issues that affect  the quality of the survey data, such as respondent comprehension,  retrieval, judgment, and response formulation.", "We believe it is critical for Labor to obtain expert methodological advice  because this would allow the agency to make course corrections before  time and money are spent implementing new procedures that may  increase the speed of processing data, but not sufficiently address its  quality.

Using Labor\u2019s revised timelines, we calculated the expected reduction in  the amount of time from the start of each survey to publication of wage  rates. To assess whether Labor\u2019s surveys under the new processes were on  schedule, we reviewed an ASDS Individual Time Tracking Report by  Activity/Survey for October 1, 2009, through September 1, 2010, that  provided the number of staff hours logged in each survey activity for the  pilot building and heavy surveys and highway surveys started under the  new processes. We then compared the last activity in which staff hours  had been logged for each survey with its expected activity based on the  date the regional office entered the survey into ASDS and Labor\u2019s new  timelines. We could not calculate the exact number of days surveys were  ahead of or behind schedule because Labor did not have a report that  reliably recorded the date a survey moved from one activity to the next.  Additionally, for one state building and heavy survey and three state  highway surveys, we could not calculate the actual timelines because the  dates in the data provided by Labor were out of sequence.", "Labor officials provided inconsistent guidance on which activity in their  timelines reflected the actual start of a survey; however, for various  reasons, we used the date the survey was recorded as being entered into  the database for our analysis of whether the surveys were on schedule.  During our review, a senior Labor official indicated the appropriate survey  start date was the date the survey was entered into ASDS by regional  office officials. Toward the end of our review, the official indicated the  correct start date was the date surveys were first mailed to contractors or  interested parties because each region had its own method for when it  entered surveys into ASDS. For example, some regions entered surveys  when they planned them while others entered surveys when they ordered  Dodge Reports. We believe using the date surveys were first mailed as the  start date would exclude certain key activities on Labor\u2019s survey timeline,  such as ordering, receiving, and cleaning the Dodge Report data for  building and heavy surveys and inputting interested party lists for highway  surveys. Nonetheless, we conducted an additional timeliness analysis  using alternative start dates based on Labor\u2019s concerns. Given that Labor  officials were concerned the regional offices may enter building and heavy  surveys into ASDS before actually starting them, we used the date the  Dodge data were requested, which is the second step in the new process.  For the building and heavy surveys we reviewed, none of them changed  status based on the alternative start date. In other words, all were still  behind schedule. For highway surveys, we used the date surveys were first  mailed to interested parties as the start date for the alternative analysis.  For the highway surveys we reviewed, only one changed status from  behind schedule to ahead of schedule. Therefore, based on the limited  changes to our findings from using alternative start dates, as well as the  fact that the alternative start dates exclude parts of the survey process on  which Labor had been working to improve timeliness and for which staff  had logged hours, we decided to conduct our analysis using the original  date provided by Labor (the date the regional offices entered the survey  into ASDS).", "To assess the adequacy of Labor\u2019s current wage survey methodology we  compared it with survey guidance published by OMB and Labor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Survey Data", "paragraphs": ["We used data from ASDS to evaluate the geographic level at which rates  were issued and the number of workers used to issue rates.

We selected these surveys because they were recently  published and represented geographic diversity, to the extent possible, in  terms of the Labor regional offices that conducted the surveys. The data  from the surveys we reviewed included the following construction types:  Florida\u2014building, heavy, highway, and residential; Maryland\u2014building,  heavy, and residential; Tennessee\u2014building, heavy, highway, and  residential; and West Texas Metropolitan\u2014building and residential. The  survey results included metropolitan and rural rates for all construction  types with the exception of the Maryland heavy construction type and the  West Texas survey, which only included metropolitan rates.", "To evaluate the geographic level at which wage rates were issued, we  analyzed, for each survey in our review, the \u201ccalculation basis\u201d field on  Labor\u2019s WD-22 form, which indicates whether the wage rate for each job  classification was determined based on county-level data, multi-county  data, or statewide data. We were unable to determine the geographic level  for rates that had been combined in the final WD-22 so we reported them  separately. Regional office officials said they may combine rates from  counties with the exact same wage and fringe benefit data in the final WD- 22. However, the rates being combined may have been calculated at  different geographic levels\u2014for example, one county\u2019s rates may have  been calculated at the group level while another county\u2019s rates may have  been calculated at the supergroup level. Because the geographic level at  which rates for each combined county were calculated is not reported on  the WD-22, we reported the percentage of these rates separately. We  analyzed geographic levels for key job classifications only because nonkey  job classifications cannot be issued at the supergroup or state level. Key  job classifications are those determined by Labor to be necessary for one  or more of the four construction types, as follows:    Building Construction: bricklayer, boilermaker, carpenter, cement  mason, electrician, heat and frost insulators/asbestos workers/pipe  insulators, iron worker, laborer-common, painter, pipefitter, plumber,  power equipment operator, roofer, sheet metal worker, tile setter, and  truck driver.", "Heavy Construction and Highway Construction: carpenter, cement  mason, electrician, iron worker, laborer-common, painter, power  equipment operator, and truck driver.", "Residential Construction: bricklayer, carpenter, cement mason,  electrician, iron worker, laborer-common, painter, plumber, power  equipment operator, roofer, sheet metal worker, and truck driver.", "Table 1 provides the percentage of wage rates issued at each geographic  level by construction type and metropolitan or rural designation for the  four surveys we reviewed.", "We also used WD-22 data to determine the number of workers used to  calculate wage rates for all key job classifications for the four surveys in  our review. Using the \u201ctotal number reported\u201d column in WD-22 reports,  we calculated the number of workers whose wage rates were included in  each wage rate calculation for key job classifications. We reported the  data by quartiles with the exception of the \u201c3 workers\u201d category, which we  broke out separately because it is the minimum number of workers for  which Labor must receive data in order to issue a wage rate for a job  classification. Table 2 provides the percentage of key job classification  rates issued by number of workers, construction type, and metropolitan or  rural designation for the four surveys we reviewed.", "Finally, we used WD-22 data to determine the percentage of wage rates  that included federal data. We calculated this percentage for the building  and residential construction types for the surveys in our review because  Labor uses federal data for these construction types only when it has  insufficient survey data, whereas federal data are used in all highway and  heavy surveys.

However, Labor officials had concerns about us surveying  contractors in states where Labor had completed wage survey data  collection, but was still in the process of contacting contractors for data  clarification and verification. Labor officials believed contractors might  get confused if they received requests for information from more than one  agency and were concerned our activities might affect their efforts. We  agreed with these concerns. Therefore, instead of surveying contractors,  we opted to conduct semi-structured interviews with a wide variety of  Davis-Bacon stakeholders. Also, in order to solicit opinions directly from  contractors but not interfere with Labor\u2019s ongoing efforts, we interviewed  a small number of individual contractors in states that had been surveyed  less recently but where the results of those wage surveys had been  published.

For example, we did not ask representatives from academia  about filling out the survey form or attending pre-survey briefings because  they would typically not be involved in these activities. In our findings, we  noted cases in which we did not ask all stakeholders a particular question.", "To select representatives from academia, we conducted a literature review  to identify studies that reviewed or evaluated the Davis-Bacon wage  survey process.
