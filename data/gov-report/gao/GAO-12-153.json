Also, the percentage of recipients paid benefits under the disability compensation program increased from 15 percent to 26 percent. The cost of enhanced monthly benefits has increased from $124 million in fiscal year 2000 to $409 million in fiscal year 2010; however, VA does not know what portion of these costs was paid specifically for A&A and Housebound benefits. VA maintains data on enhanced monthly benefit recipients\u0092 total payments but does not separately identify the amount awarded as an A&A or Housebound benefit. VA officials stated that under its current system, separately tracking the costs of these benefits would be complicated and difficult.", "Enhanced monthly benefits helped veterans obtain services to perform everyday living activities in different ways, but high service costs and limited service availability in some areas can make it difficult to acquire the services. Benefit recipients GAO spoke with said that they used their benefits to pay for in-home services by private providers, offset lost income from family members who provided care for them, or defray the costs of an assisted living facility. However, obtaining services from private providers can still pose difficulties for some recipients because of the generally higher cost of services in large urban areas or the limited availability of services in rural areas.", "VA conducts a number of outreach activities to educate veterans and their family members about available benefits; however, a large number of elderly veterans may not be aware of their potential eligibility for enhanced monthly benefits. A VA study found that of pension recipients\u0097who are mainly elderly veterans\u009762 percent might be eligible for enhanced monthly benefits but only 22 percent received them, which the study primarily attributed to lack of awareness about the benefits. VA\u0092s outreach efforts may not be sufficient to inform elderly veterans about enhanced monthly benefits because outreach activities do not typically focus on these benefits, some printed material lacks information on eligibility and application requirements for these benefits, and the extent to which regional offices conduct elderly outreach varies, among other reasons."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA conduct more focused outreach to better educate potential recipients about enhanced monthly benefits.

As an enhancement of basic disability compensation and  pension benefits, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers Aid and  Attendance (A&A) and Housebound benefits, which help these individuals  obtain needed services. A&A benefits are paid to severely disabled  individuals who require regular aid and attendance of another person.  Housebound benefits, which are generally smaller than A&A benefits, are  paid to disabled individuals who are substantially confined to their homes.  Depending on whether the veteran is receiving disability compensation or  pension benefits, the combined payment is called an enhanced disability  compensation or enhanced pension, which we collectively refer to as  enhanced monthly benefits. Provided as a single monthly payment in  combination with the disability compensation or pension benefit,  enhanced monthly benefits can help defray the cost of obtaining needed  daily living support services. Enhanced monthly benefits are  administered by VA\u2019s Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA). Recipients  of these benefits have generally been among the oldest and most  severely disabled veterans. Although enhanced monthly benefits have  existed for decades, there are questions about whether those who may  be eligible for and need the benefits are aware of them.", "As requested, this report examines (1) characteristics of enhanced  monthly benefit recipients; (2) how the benefits help veterans obtain  needed services, and the associated difficulties they face obtaining these  services; and (3) VA\u2019s efforts to educate veterans and their family  members about the availability of the benefits. To conduct our work, we  analyzed VA data from fiscal years 2000 to 2010 on the characteristics of  recipients of enhanced monthly benefits, such as age and disabling  conditions. We also conducted focus group discussions with veterans and  their family representatives to obtain their views on how enhanced  monthly benefits helped them obtain needed assistance. We conducted  phone interviews with veterans or their family representatives who could  not attend a focus group discussion. We held focus group discussions in  San Antonio, Texas; St. Petersburg, Florida; and Norfolk, Virginia. We  selected these locations because they had high concentrations of  veterans who were receiving enhanced monthly benefits. We randomly  selected 33 focus group participants based on VA data on veterans  receiving these benefits during fiscal year 2009. We also gathered data  from MetLife and Genworth on the cost of providing services to assist  individuals with disabilities. We interviewed officials from VA\u2019s Veterans  Health Administration (VHA) about other benefits and services VA  provides to help veterans perform everyday activities. In addition, we  reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, as well as prior GAO and  other reports that addressed outreach efforts and best practices. We  interviewed veterans and their family members regarding their  experiences in learning about and applying for enhanced monthly  benefits, the effectiveness of VA\u2019s outreach efforts, and possible  improvements to such efforts.

Also, services are less available in some rural areas,  which can limit recipients\u2019 ability to obtain them.

For example, the spouse of one veteran said that she had to  attend to him 24 hours a day\u2014including bathing and dressing him, and  taking him to dialysis treatment\u2014which prevented her from getting a job.  An August 2009 study of veterans who received assistance from family  caregivers found that persons with disabilities who had more restrictions  in performing daily living activities and more health care needs were less  likely than people with fewer restrictions to obtain home-based care,  placing additional stress on their caregivers. According to a November  2010 study, some of the major difficulties family members and others face  in providing caregiver support for veterans include a lack of knowledge  about the veterans\u2019 medical condition as well as a lack of skills to help  caregivers perform various activities. Some of the caregivers we  contacted said they were unable to provide all of the assistance needed  to perform everyday living activities.

These officials said that  some attorneys and financial planners may convince elderly veterans,  who ordinarily would be ineligible for a VA pension because of excess  assets, to reduce these assets by transferring them into annuities or  irrevocable trusts. We also observed websites where organizations  market asset transfer services to help elderly veterans qualify for VA  pension and enhanced monthly benefits. Representatives from an elderly  advocacy organization noted that financial planners may be charging  significant fees for each senior citizen they assist in transferring assets to  qualify for a VA pension. Once established, these investments could  severely limit veterans\u2019 access to their assets or prevent them from  obtaining Medicaid benefits in the future.

The home page does contain  a link for the pension program that provides information on eligibility and  application requirements for A&A and Housebound benefits; however,  because it is not apparent that this link would provide such information,  users may not be inclined to follow it. Also, VA and the Department of  Defense recently developed the eBenefits web portal to provide veterans  with customized information on, and how to apply for, VA benefits and  assistance, but it does not include a direct link to information on  enhanced monthly benefits. A few of our focus group participants  commented that they had difficulty finding information about enhanced  monthly benefits on VA\u2019s website. Website guidelines recommend that  navigation procedures to access online information be simple and that  links be properly labeled to help users obtain desired results.", "Finally, VA provides information on enhanced monthly benefits through its  nine call centers, including a call center that exclusively responds to  inquiries related to the VA pension. These centers handle inquiries from  the 800 number that VA directs veterans to call for information about  benefits. In response to a VA Office of Inspector General study that found  that veterans had difficulty getting through to call agents and obtaining  correct information, VBA implemented a new call routing system in March  2011 to improve callers\u2019 access to call agents, and is working to develop  national performance standards for call agents to improve the quality of  services provided."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Guidance to VBA Regional Offices on Elderly Outreach Is Broad, and the Extent to Which Regional Offices Conduct These Activities Varies", "paragraphs": ["Most outreach activities for VA\u2019s benefits are conducted at the VBA  regional office level, and VBA provides broad guidance on conducting  outreach to its regional offices. In its procedures manual, VA requires  each VBA regional office to designate an elderly outreach coordinator and  provides suggestions on collaborating with agencies or organizations that  serve the elderly. However, besides these suggestions, this manual does  not define the specific duties of the coordinator or identify other types of  elderly outreach activities that should be conducted. We contacted 10 of  VBA\u2019s 57 regional offices and of these 10 offices, only 4 collaborated with  local agencies that serve the elderly, despite suggestions in the manual to  do so. Also, the extent to which VBA regional offices coordinated and  collaborated on outreach with local VHA facilities varied among the 10  regional offices we contacted. For example, while staff in all of these  offices said that they coordinate with VHA, only six indicated that they  provide training to social workers and other VHA employees to enable  them to provide information on available VBA benefits to potential  recipients. Staff in all of the regional offices we contacted told us they  collaborate with VSOs on outreach, but the extent and nature of this  collaboration differed. The collaboration included such things as training  VSO staff on available benefits and working with VSO staff to conduct  outreach in remote areas or to provide application assistance to veterans  who are physically unable to visit the regional office. Some offices may  have worked with VSOs in one or a combination of these ways.", "Similarly, the extent to which regional offices identified locations to  conduct elderly outreach also varied among the 10 regional offices we  contacted. Staff in 5 offices told us they proactively identify locations to  disseminate information on VA benefits as well as identify potential  recipients. During these elderly outreach activities, regional office staff  may have one-on-one conversations with attendees and provide  information on enhanced monthly benefits to those who indicate they  need assistance to perform everyday living activities. However, staff in  the other five offices said that they did not conduct elderly outreach  activities at all, or only did so in response to invitations from other  organizations.", "Agencywide, the amount of time VBA regional offices spent conducting  elderly outreach activities varied considerably. VA\u2019s fiscal year 2010 data  show that the total number of hours regional offices reported spending on  elderly outreach ranged from 0 to over 100. For example, 2 regional  offices reported spending over 100 hours, 12 reported less than 10 hours,  and 9 offices either reported they did not conduct any elderly outreach or  did not report this information. There may be several reasons for this wide  variance. Although staff in most regional offices we contacted said that  limited staff, funding, and other resources minimize their capacity to  conduct outreach, some offices had staff with full-time responsibilities for  outreach, including elderly outreach. In contrast, other offices conducted  outreach as part of ancillary duties or on a voluntary basis. VA is currently  prioritizing outreach to the homeless as well as Post 9/11 veterans and  staff in some offices we contacted told us they focus their outreach on  those veteran groups rather than the elderly. Also, VA has acknowledged  that the number of elderly veterans is increasing but has yet to establish  detailed plans or performance goals for its elderly outreach efforts. For  example, VA\u2019s strategic plan for fiscal years 2011 to 2015 includes  outreach initiatives for different veteran population groups but none that  specifically target elderly veterans. In addition, for elderly outreach, VA is  currently using the total number of hours devoted annually to these types  of activities as a performance indicator, but this does not provide the  information needed to assess the outcomes and effectiveness of the  agency\u2019s efforts. VBA officials told us the agency is in the process of  identifying appropriate performance goals and measures for all of its  outreach efforts.", "VA\u2019s broad guidance posed some challenges for regional offices in  conducting elderly outreach, and VA has begun to take steps to address  this issue. For example, staff in one office said they conducted minimal  elderly outreach, in part, due to a lack of guidance from VA\u2019s central  office, while staff in another office told us that more specific guidelines on  conducting elderly outreach are needed. Recently, VA has taken some  steps to enhance guidance to regional offices. For example, in May 2010,  VA\u2019s central office reinstituted bimonthly conference calls with regional  elderly outreach coordinators to facilitate information sharing among  participants. Also, VA\u2019s central office requires regional offices to submit  weekly reports on their outreach activities through a web-based reporting  tool. The reports include information on the type of outreach activity  conducted, the number of hours devoted to each targeted veteran  population group, and the number of attendees at an outreach event.  According to VBA officials, the reporting tool is currently being enhanced  to enable VA\u2019s central office to conduct a more in-depth analysis of the  information reported, which may in turn allow for more tailored guidance  to each regional office.", "Many of the staff at regional offices and the veterans we spoke with  provided suggestions on how VA might increase awareness about  enhanced monthly benefits. Staff at several VBA regional offices  suggested VA increase awareness by using local or national media to  disseminate information targeted to elderly veterans. Suggestions by  veterans included mailing information on eligibility and application  requirements to potential recipients. Some of the veterans we spoke with  also said that VHA was their first source of information about enhanced  monthly benefits and that VHA employees should play a primary role in  providing this information."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Enhanced monthly benefits can play a critical role in helping aging and  disabled veterans obtain the services they need to perform everyday  living activities and, in many cases, allow them to stay in their homes or  other noninstitutional settings. Demand for these benefits will likely grow  as life expectancy increases and more younger service members return  home with injuries from global conflicts. Although enhanced monthly  benefits have existed for decades, many within certain populations, such  as elderly veterans, are unaware of them and are, therefore, forgoing  valuable benefits. While VA conducts a number of outreach efforts and  provides information to educate veterans and their families about  available benefits, there are opportunities for VA to improve its efforts to  ensure that potential recipients, particularly the elderly and those who are  not connected to VA\u2019s health care system, are aware of all benefits for  which they may be eligible. Without specific performance goals and  metrics to improve outreach to elderly veterans, more detailed guidance  to better instruct regional offices on how to conduct elderly outreach, and  improved information on application and eligibility requirements for  enhanced monthly benefits that is easy to access, many elderly veterans  and their family members may fail to receive assistance that could  improve their quality of life. It will be important for VA to address these  issues to ensure that veterans are aware of all available benefits for  which they may qualify. Taking steps to better inform elderly veterans  about enhanced monthly benefits will not only ensure that they receive  benefits that could help them obtain needed services to perform daily  living activities, but also ensure that younger veterans are aware of the  benefits as they age and possibly develop a need to access these  benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To enable VA to improve its efforts to educate veterans and their family  members about enhanced monthly benefits, we recommend that the  Secretary of VA direct the Undersecretary for Benefits to take steps to  conduct more focused outreach to potential recipients, which could entail  the following:  Improving communication of and accessibility to information about  enhanced monthly benefits. Such efforts could include (1) providing  more information in the VA benefits handbook and other informational  material on VA benefits, (2) increasing the visibility of links on VA\u2019s  website to information about these benefits, and (3) using local or  national broadcast and print media to disseminate information about  these benefits.", "Continuing efforts to establish specific performance goals and metrics  for increasing outreach to elderly veterans.", "Providing more detailed guidance to regional offices on how elderly  outreach should be conducted and on the specific duties of outreach  coordinators."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to VA for review and comment.

The data included recipients\u2019 age, disabling conditions, period  of service, state of residence, type of benefit received, and where  applicable, the reason for termination of benefits. We also obtained  information on the total enhanced monthly benefit payment. These data  were retrieved from VA\u2019s Benefits Delivery Network and Veterans  Services Network. Data obtained included any veterans and qualified  surviving spouses or parents who received Aid & Attendance (A&A) or  Housebound benefits as an enhancement to monthly compensation or  pension benefits during this time period. Since these data are not  publicly available, VA compiled data extracts for our use. We reviewed  relevant federal laws and regulations. We also reviewed VA policies and  other documents, and interviewed officials in the VA\u2019s Veterans Benefits  Administration (VBA) Compensation and Pension Services to identify  requirements for receiving enhanced monthly benefits, and how benefit  amounts are determined. In our analysis of information about periods of  service, we excluded veterans who fought in World War I or during the  Mexican Border Period because they comprised a very small number of  cases at the end of fiscal year 2000 (a total of 123, or less than 0.11  percent of all veteran recipients) and none by the end of fiscal year 2010.  Also, we removed duplicate entries in the diagnostic code fields in VA\u2019s  data. Our assessment of the reliability of VA\u2019s data is discussed  separately in this appendix.", "For our second objective, we reviewed studies and reports by GAO and  others to obtain information on the services that recipients of enhanced  monthly benefits may need to perform everyday living activities, the  different sources of this help, and difficulties veterans may face in obtaining  these services. We also interviewed two national and two local  organizations that provide services and support to the elderly, individuals  with disabilities, and their caregivers. In addition, we analyzed information  on the cost of acquiring these services to show how costs can vary across  all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We also examined provisions of  the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 to  determine how it would help caregivers.

To evaluate outreach to  potential recipients by VA\u2019s central office, we interviewed officials from  central office who were familiar with its efforts. We also identified VA\u2019s  past and present outreach activities, as well as its outreach plans. In addition, we reviewed the outreach guidance that VBA central office  provides to VBA regional offices. To evaluate VBA regional office  outreach efforts targeted to potential recipients, we contacted officials  from 10 regional offices. These regional offices were judgmentally  selected to represent the different characteristics of VA\u2019s regional offices.  In addition, we examined fiscal year 2010 data on regional office elderly  outreach activities. We assessed VA\u2019s print and online informational  materials for clarity and the extent to which they provide complete  information on eligibility and application requirements for enhanced  monthly benefits. We also analyzed VA\u2019s website and eBenefits portal for  ease of accessing information about eligibility and application  requirements. In addition, we reviewed studies about Internet usage  among elderly and disabled populations. To enhance our evaluation of  VA\u2019s outreach efforts, we interviewed representatives of veterans service  organizations (VSO) to obtain their views on VA\u2019s outreach efforts. We  also interviewed representatives of organizations that represent and  interact with elderly populations and individuals with disabilities, some of  whom have collaborated with VA on outreach. In addition, we used key  outreach best practices identified in GAO and other reports as criteria to  assess VA\u2019s outreach efforts. The criteria included outlining of strategic goals for the campaign and determination of a  identification and researching of the target audience to understand  some of its key characteristics, such as size of population; establishment of strategic partnerships with other entities that are  stakeholders in the issue to get help with planning and implementing  the outreach campaign;  targeting of the outreach message with audience specific, culturally  sensitive content and use of media and languages that are the most  appropriate for the audience;  reinforcement of the message with repetition and different media,  especially when targeting people who may be challenging to serve;  and development and implementation of performance measures for  evaluating the effectiveness of the outreach campaign.", "As part of our audit work for objectives two and three, we conducted a  series of focus groups and one-on-one interviews with veterans who  receive enhanced monthly benefits or a family member they chose to  represent their views.
