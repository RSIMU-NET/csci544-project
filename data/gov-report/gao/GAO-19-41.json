Specifically, based on its annual survey of  behavioral health issues, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health  Services Administration (SAMHSA) within the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) estimated that 10.4 million adults in 2016 had a  serious mental illness; however, only 6.7 million adults received treatment  for these issues in the past year. Serious mental illnesses\u2014including  schizophrenia and bipolar disorders\u2014substantially interfere with a  person\u2019s major life activities such as maintaining interpersonal  relationships and employment. Further, a recent study covering the period  2008-2014 found that more than 50 percent of adults with co-occurring  mental health and substance use disorders (such as alcohol and opioid  use disorders) received neither mental health care nor substance use  treatment in the prior year.", "According to SAMHSA, workforce shortages are a key driver of the unmet  need for behavioral health services; 55 percent of counties in the United  States do not have any practicing behavioral health workers. In light of these issues, SAMHSA officials and other experts have called for using  peer support specialists to help address shortages in the behavioral  health workforce. Peer support specialists are individuals who use their  own personal, lived experience recovering from mental illnesses to  support others in their recovery.", "In recent years, states have increased their focus on recovery as part of  mental health services, and this has included utilizing peer support  specialists. A nationwide study found that 41 states and the District of  Columbia had established programs to train and certify these workers,  and two other states were in the process of developing such a program  as of July 2016. As the peer support specialist workforce continues to  grow, there has been increased attention to standardizing the profession  through certification.", "The 21st Century Cures Act included a provision for us to conduct a study  of peer support specialist programs in states that receive funding from  SAMHSA and identify best practices in these states related to training  and credential requirements for peer support specialist programs. This  report describes  (1) programs for certifying peer support specialists in selected  states and  (2) leading practices for certifying peer support specialists  identified by program officials in selected states.", "To describe programs for certifying peer support specialists in selected  states, we selected six states to illustrate aspects of, and variations in, the  certification programs that states have developed for peer support  specialists. The results from our sample cannot be generalized to other  state peer support specialist programs. We selected our sample states  using five criteria, specifically (1) recommendations from SAMHSA  officials, researchers in the field of peer support, and national-level mental  health organizations on states with well-established programs; (2)  SAMHSA data that indicated that a state had reported using SAMHSA\u2019s  Community Mental Health Services Block Grant for peer support  generally; (3) the age of the state\u2019s certification program was at least 2  years old; (4) geographic diversity across the United States; and (5) the  prevalence of serious mental illness among adults in the state. Using  these criteria, we selected the following six states for our sample: Florida,  Georgia, Michigan, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Texas.", "We then reviewed information from the selected states describing  certification requirements for their peer support specialist programs,  including policy manuals and guidelines for becoming a peer support  specialist, training materials, and information on certification renewal.  Additionally, to understand general training practices to inform our  discussions with state program officials, we reviewed our previous reports  on assessing training and development efforts and key principles for  effective workforce planning. We similarly reviewed the National  Commission for Certifying Agencies\u2019 Standards for the Accreditation of  Certification Programs to provide similar guidance. Finally, we  interviewed individuals with responsibilities related to the peer support  specialist programs in the selected states, including state program  officials and staff from independent certification boards and consumer  advocacy groups.

We collected information from the six selected states on their  certification practices through a questionnaire we developed and follow- up interviews with state officials. This included asking their opinions on  what they considered to be leading practices in the areas of screening,  training, and certification requirements for a state peer support specialist  program. We then analyzed information obtained from our interviews with  officials from the selected states to determine which leading practices  they consistently identified for certifying peer support specialists. For the  purposes of this report, we included a practice as a leading practice if it  was identified by state officials from the majority (at least four) of the  selected states. We then examined information from the six selected  states to determine whether they were currently applying the identified  leading practices, even if a particular state had not identified the practice  as a leading practice during the interview.", "We also interviewed 10 stakeholders about leading practices.

One of these requirements is that peer support  specialists complete a training and certification program as defined by the  state. Another requirement is that peer support specialists receive  supervision from a \u201ccompetent mental health professional,\u201d which may be  provided through direct oversight or periodic care consultation. The state  defines the amount, scope, and duration of the supervision as well as  who is considered a competent mental health professional.", "States have used the flexibility allowed by the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services to create their own programs to certify peer support  specialists. Some of these state peer support specialist programs are  assessment-based certificate programs\u2014programs that provide training  and then evaluate whether applicants achieved the learning objectives of  that training through an examination in order to receive certification. Other  programs are professional certification programs\u2014programs that evaluate  applicants against predetermined standards of knowledge, skills, or  competencies.

According  to officials, the core competencies were developed in response to  inconsistencies in the training and certification of peer support  specialists that emerged as states began to develop their programs.  SAMHSA\u2019s core competencies reflected the five foundational  principles of peer support identified by consumers and other  stakeholders: services should be (1) recovery oriented; (2) person- centered; (3) voluntary; (4) relationship-focused; and (5) trauma  informed.

For example,  SAMHSA\u2019s Center for Mental Health Services funds peer support  programs through its administration of the Community Mental Health  Services Block Grant, which provides flexible funding to the states to  support services and related support activities for individuals with serious  mental illness. While the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant  accounted for less than 1 percent of total revenues received by state  mental health agencies in fiscal year 2015, the flexibility of the funds  allows them to be expended to pay for services that Medicaid and other  health insurance will not pay for, such as training and developing  standards. In fiscal year 2018, 40 states and the District of Columbia  reported using the funds from the Community Mental Health Services  Block Grant for peer support.", "SAMHSA also provides discretionary grants directly to domestic nonprofit  organizations that aim to expand the capacity of peer support providers.

The extent to which each screening requirement was  used by each state varied, and the specifics of each requirement also  varied across the six programs we reviewed (see fig. 2).", "Education. Five of the six states that we reviewed required a high school  diploma or equivalent. Officials from four of these states indicated that  this level of education was necessary given the skills needed by peer  support specialists, such as reading comprehension and communication  skills. In contrast, Oregon officials told us that they did not require a high  school diploma or equivalent; however, the officials noted that most of  their peer support specialists have at least a high school education.", "Mental health experience. While all six state programs we reviewed  required applicants to have lived experience in recovery from mental  illness, the programs implemented this requirement in different ways.  Some required a mental health diagnosis, while others required a  minimum length of recovery time or required applicants to have received  services for a mental illness. Texas officials said they did not have a  specified length of recovery requirement due to the difficulty of pinpointing  the specific time a person began his or her recovery; rather, Texas  required applicants to self-identify as having experience living in recovery.", "Prior work or volunteer experience. Three of the six state programs  required applicants to have prior relevant work or volunteer experience,  although the amount of experience required varies. For example, to start  the certification process, applicants in Michigan must be currently working  in a peer support specialist role and have been in that position for at least  10 hours a week for the past 3 months. In contrast, Georgia officials told  us that they found this requirement to be a barrier for some individuals  who have not been able to work; therefore, Georgia did not have this  requirement.", "Letters of recommendation.

Topics covered during the training  typically include ethics, recovery, sharing the recovery story, and  communication skills. (See app. III for an example of a peer support  specialist core training schedule.) While all six states require applicants to  attend core training, the length, cost, and curricula of these trainings  varied across the states, as figure 3 shows.", "Length of training. All six programs required at least 40 hours of in- person core training, with Georgia and Pennsylvania requiring more than  70 hours. The six states required at least a week of core training to allow  sufficient time to cover a core curriculum of general peer-related  information, such as the meaning and role of peer support services, and  at times including role play, in an effort to develop the interpersonal skills  needed for an effective peer leadership.", "Cost of training. All states but Florida charged applicants fees to attend  training. Training fees varied by state, ranging from $85 in Georgia to  $1,400 in Pennsylvania. These fees varied because what they covered  also varied. For example, state program officials from Michigan told us  that, among other things, the $600 fee covers the price of lodging for the  core training, consultant fees, materials, and college credit hours that can  be earned by attending the training and the graduation ceremony. In  contrast, state program officials from Georgia told us that the $85 they  charge covered the cost of producing the course manual and that all other  costs are covered by the state.", "Training curriculum.

(See fig. 4.)", "Examination. Four of the states we reviewed administered a single,  statewide exam that applicants must pass before becoming certified,  while in the remaining two states applicants had to pass an exam  administered by the approved training vendor. The exams included  multiple choice or essay questions. One training vendor responsible for  conducting training in at least two states told us that the vendor included  an oral evaluation component as part of the exam, in light of the  communication and interpersonal skills needed for the peer role.  Similarly, a state program official from Pennsylvania told us that  observational assessments are also used to determine an applicant\u2019s  skills and knowledge.", "Code of ethics. Like other health professions, peer support specialists  typically must agree to abide by a code of ethics. All six states we  reviewed required peer support specialists to sign a code of ethics before  becoming certified. Of the six states, the codes of ethics in Pennsylvania,  Georgia, Michigan, and Texas were unique to peer support specialists,  while Florida and Oregon used codes of ethics that also applied to other  workforces, such as substance use disorder professionals and community  health workers. Relatedly, five of the six states also had formal processes  in place to investigate and take action in the event that a peer violated the  code of ethics by, for example, disclosing confidential information. These  actions range from reprimand to revocation of certification.", "Certification renewal. Three of the six states we reviewed required peer  support specialists, once certified, to renew their certifications every 1 to 3  years, while the remaining three states awarded lifetime certifications.", "Continuing education. Five of the six states required certified peer  support specialists to meet annual continuing education requirements,  which ranged from approximately 10 hours per year to 36 hours every 2  years. According to some state program officials, requiring continuing  education ensures continued competence in the field of peer support or  provides specialized training, such as training for working with specific  populations (such as veterans) or incorporating additional approaches or  skill sets (such as training about the Wellness Recovery Action Plan)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State Officials Generally Cited Six Leading Practices for Certifying Peer Support Specialists", "paragraphs": ["Officials from peer support specialist programs in selected states  generally cited six leading practices for certifying peer support specialists.  The 10 stakeholders\u2014representing the perspectives of researchers,  training or consulting organizations, associations, and advocacy  organizations\u2014we spoke with generally agreed that the six identified  leading practices should be incorporated into programs that certify peer  support specialists because the practices can lead to stronger quality of  services for individuals with serious mental illnesses.", "Leading practice one: Systematic screening of applicants. Program  officials in five of the six selected states cited the importance of  systematic or detailed screening of applicants to become peer support  specialists as a leading practice. All six state programs assessed  applicants through a variety of approaches, including (1) using screening  questions about the applicants\u2019 understanding of the peer role, (2)  conducting telephone interviews with applicants, (3) reviewing  applications with a standardized tool or scoring rubric, and (4) having  multiple people review applications for objectivity. Eight of the 10  stakeholders we interviewed confirmed that this was a leading practice,  though some cautioned that these requirements should not unnecessarily  exclude individuals with unique backgrounds or little work history. The  Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic  Brain Injury, which in 2011 explored how to most effectively apply peer  support in the military environment as part of its ongoing mission, has  similarly identified systematic screening with defined selection criteria as  a best practice for peer support programs.", "While work or volunteer experience can be used as a screening  requirement for applicants and was required by three of the states we  reviewed, four of the stakeholders we interviewed commented that  meeting these requirements can be challenging for individuals with a  history of mental illness who may have been previously unable to enter  the workforce. Research has shown that the stigma associated with  mental illness is a significant barrier to work for individuals with mental  illness and has shaped employer decisions about hiring or keeping a  person with mental illness in the workplace. These workplace barriers,  along with others, such as access to mental health treatment, contribute  to the relatively low workforce participation of adults with serious mental  illnesses. One stakeholder commented that peer support programs have  a responsibility not to contribute to barriers in the workplace for  individuals with mental illnesses.", "Our review shows that some of the peer support specialist programs in  the six selected states are taking steps to address these barriers. For  example, Florida recently changed its requirements and now provisionally  certifies peer support specialists who meet all the certification  requirements except for the requirement to have 500 hours of work or  volunteer experience. After receiving the provisional certification, peer  support specialists have 1 year to complete the work or volunteer hours  necessary to upgrade to the full certification.", "Leading practice two: Conducting core training in-person. Program  officials from five of the six selected states cited core training that is  conducted in-person, as opposed to online, as a leading practice. Three  program officials told us that core training should be done in-person to  foster relationship building and experiential learning to develop the  interpersonal skills a certified peer support specialist needs. All six state  programs had in-person core training, regardless of whether the training  was run by the state program itself or through approved vendors. For  example, Michigan hosts its core trainings at a retreat center where  participants are encouraged to stay for the week. Michigan program  officials told us that this creates a place for training participants from  across the state to network, discuss how their agencies work and the  types of issues they face as peer support specialists, and share best  practices. SAMHSA\u2019s core competencies identify the importance of using  active listening skills, understanding when to share experiences and  when to listen, and using their own recovery story to inspire hope.", "All 10 stakeholders we interviewed confirmed that providing in-person  training was a leading practice, though 3 commented that some of the  knowledge segments could be done online. Five stakeholders we  interviewed told us that observing the skills of peer support specialists  during training or incorporating observation as part of the certification  exam is important. One stakeholder explained that while written tests are  a good measure of basic knowledge, the tests cannot fully assess the  skills and competencies needed for certification. While 2 stakeholders  cited the increased costs of delivering and grading exams with an  observational component as the reasons many states use written exams  only, 1 stakeholder noted that including an observational component is a  more accurate assessment of whether or not people have developed  needed skills. Another stakeholder commented that using a written test  alone may allow individuals who are good test takers to become certified,  even if they lack the interpersonal skills needed to be a peer support  specialist.", "Leading practice three: Incorporating physical health and wellness  into training or continuing education. Program officials from five of the  six selected states cited the importance of emphasizing to peer support  specialists that they should help others manage their physical health\u2014in  addition to their mental health\u2014during core training or continuing  education as a leading practice. All six of the selected states incorporated  managing physical health conditions into their core training or continuing  education. (See text box.) In these trainings, peer support specialists  learn how to help others with access to needed care and prevention  services, set personal health goals to promote recovery and a wellness  lifestyle, and adopt healthy habits to prevent disease or lessen the impact  of existing chronic health conditions. The need for physical health- related training was identified after a 2006 report found that individuals  with serious mental illnesses were dying 25 years earlier than the general  population, largely due to treatable medical conditions caused by  modifiable risk factors, such as smoking and poor nutrition or obesity.  SAMHSA identified educating peers about health, wellness, recovery, and  recovery supports as a core competency.", "All 10 stakeholders we interviewed confirmed that emphasizing the  importance of physical health was a leading practice, though 2  stakeholders commented that incorporating physical health and wellness  into trainings should only be done as continuing education.", "Example of Leading Practice Three: Georgia Peer Support Whole Health and  Wellness Georgia determined it was important to incorporate physical health and wellness into  training for peer support specialists and was the first state to have related services\u2014 which it calls Peer Support Whole Health and Wellness\u2014provided by certified peer  support specialists covered by Medicaid. These peer support specialists\u2014who complete  additional training and are certified in Whole Health Action Management\u2014receive  medical technical support from registered nurses and are trained to work in both primary  care and behavioral health settings. Georgia created the service using a SAMHSA- funded Transformation Transfer Initiative grant, which was designed to give states the  opportunity to increase their efforts to make their state behavioral health delivery systems  more consumer driven, among other things.", "The SAMHSA-Health Resources and Services Administration Center for Integrated  Health Solutions adapted Georgia\u2019s training, along with a training developed by New  Jersey, to publish a Whole Health Action Management Peer Support Training Participant  Guide in 2015. This adapted 2-day training aims to teach peers to use a person-centered  planning process to create a whole health goal and how to engage in peer support,  including Whole Health Action Management peer support groups, to meet that goal.", "Leading practice four: Preparing organizations to effectively use  peers. Program officials from four of the six selected states cited efforts  to ready provider organizations\u2014such as hospitals or drop-in centers\u2014to  employ certified peer support specialists as a leading practice. State  program officials told us that organizational readiness includes making  sure staff understand the role of peer support specialists and can provide  appropriate supervision. (See text box.) Five of the selected states have  developed guidance or training for supervisors of peer support  specialists. Nine of the 10 stakeholders we interviewed confirmed that  this was a leading practice. SAMHSA identified using supervision  effectively and engaging in problem-solving strategies with a supervisor  as a core competency for this workforce.", "Example of Leading Practice Four: Michigan Peer Liaisons  In order to help provider organizations understand the role of peer support specialists,  Michigan created an informal peer liaison role at all 46 of the local Community Mental  Health Services Programs tasked with coordinating mental health services. State officials  told us that these peer liaisons have telephone calls and in-person meetings to provide  informal feedback on technical assistance needs and share information on how certified  peer support specialists are doing in their roles and responsibilities. According to state  officials, peer liaisons have helped prepare mental health agencies to work with peer  support specialists and have helped the state identify what new trainings should be  developed to better help peer support specialists succeed in the workplace.", "Many of the stakeholders we interviewed highlighted the importance of  having individuals in an organization who understand the peer support  role. Eight of the stakeholders we interviewed told us that supervisors  need to understand or be trained in the peer support role and skillset, with  three stakeholders commenting that supervisors need to be specifically  aware of the difference between peer support specialists and clinical  providers. For example, to achieve this the training and certifying  organization in Texas runs a twelve month program that helps provider  organizations effectively implement peer support services. The program,  which is designed as a learning community, focuses on changing  organizational culture, defining and clarifying the peer support specialist  role, and supervising these staff, among other things. Relatedly, three  stakeholders told us that there should be more than one peer support  specialist at each organization. One stakeholder noted that having  multiple peer support specialists at an agency provides built in support  and understanding of the peer role, which is important given that peer  support specialists typically have the lowest level of power in an organization. Another stakeholder noted that putting a single peer support  specialist in an organization can be isolating.", "Leading practice five: Continuing education requirements specific to  peer support. Program officials from five of the six selected states  considered it a leading practice to require, after certification, peer support  specialists to take continuing education that is specific to the peer support  role. This is to ensure that peers maintain their competency and are  aware of new developments in the field. Five of the six selected states  required certified peer support specialists to maintain their competence  through continuing education, and all five of these states had a  requirement that the continuing education be specific to the peer support  role. (See text box.) All 10 stakeholders we interviewed confirmed that  this was a leading practice. The Defense Centers of Excellence for  Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury similarly identified as a  best practice enabling continued learning through structured training.  SAMHSA identified seeking opportunities to increase knowledge and  skills of peer support as a core competency for peer support specialists.", "Example of Leading Practice Five: Pennsylvania Continuing Education  Requirement As an added step to ensure that the peer support specialist workforce is competent,  Pennsylvania places some of the burden on provider agencies for ensuring that certified  peer support specialists meet continuing education requirements. The state requires its  licensed provider agencies to develop a staff training plan to ensure that each certified  peer specialist receives the continuing education they need. Pennsylvania also requires  these agencies to provide opportunities for certified peer specialists to network with other  certified peer specialists both within and outside the agency. The state monitors  compliance with these requirements through annual inspections. State officials told us  that this requirement serves as a safety net and assures them that certified peer support  specialists are up to date in their training.", "Leading practice six: Engaging peers in the leadership and  development of certification programs. Program officials from four of  the six selected states cited having certified peer support specialists lead  or participate in the certification process of applicants as a leading  practice. State program officials told us that peers should lead in a variety  of ways, including helping screen applicants, developing curricula,  providing training, and serving as mentors or supervisors to other certified  peer support specialists.
