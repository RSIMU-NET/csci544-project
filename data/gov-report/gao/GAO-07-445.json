However, these interim lobby solutions have caused operational inefficiencies, in part because they require a large number of screeners. According to TSA, in-line baggage screening--where EDS machines are integrated with an airport's baggage conveyor system--can be a more cost-effective and efficient alternative to lobby-based, stand-alone equipment. For example, in-line systems can increase the efficiency of airport, airline, and TSA operations, and lower costs by reducing the number of screeners. Moreover, in-line explosive detection systems can enhance security because they reduce congestion in airport lobbies, thus removing a potential target for terrorists. However, installing in-line systems can have large up-front costs, related to the need for airport modifications. To help defray these costs, in 2003, Congress authorized TSA to reimburse airports up to 75 percent of the cost to install these systems by entering \"letter of intent\" (LOI) agreements. An LOI, though not a binding commitment of federal funding, represents TSA's intent to provide the agreed-upon funds in future years if the agency receives sufficient appropriations to cover the agreement. TSA has issued eight letters of intent to help defray the costs of installing in-line systems at nine airports as of February 2007, but none since February 2004. In September 2003, TSA and the City of Los Angeles signed an LOI and an attached memorandum of agreement (LOI/MOA) in which TSA agreed to pay an amount not to exceed 75 percent of the agreed upon estimated total project cost of $341 million (about $256 million) to install in-line checked baggage screening systems at both Los Angeles (LAX) and Ontario (ONT) International Airports. However, in December 2003, officials from the City of Los Angeles' airport authority--Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA)--informed TSA that aspects of the design concept were infeasible and that additional construction modifications would be needed. LAWA subsequently submitted a revised cost estimate to TSA in April 2005 and requested that TSA amend the LOI/MOA to increase the federal reimbursement by about $122 million. TSA has not amended the LOI to provide for additional reimbursements; however, as of February 2007, TSA had obligated the $256 million for the City of Los Angeles LOI/MOA in accordance with the schedule agreed to in the LOI and had reimbursed LAWA for about $26 million in expenses. Senate Report 109-273 directs us to review the reasons for the differences between the original 2003 cost estimate and the revised 2005 cost estimate submitted by LAWA. In response and as agreed with committee offices, we identified the key factors that contributed to the differences between the two cost estimates. On January 23, 2007, we briefed staff of the Senate Subcommittee on Homeland Security, Committee on Appropriations, on the results of our work."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["A key reason for the difference between the 2003 total project cost estimate and the revised 2005 estimate to install in-line baggage screening systems at LAX and ONT was that the 2003 estimate was developed at an early stage in the design process and was therefore based on preliminary data and assumptions that were subject to change. Consequently, the estimate did not adequately foresee some of the costs of retrofitting new systems into existing buildings or allow for sufficient space for the EDS machines, baggage inspection rooms, and conveyor belts. LAWA officials stated that they were under a tight timeframe to apply for the LOI because TSA had told them that federal funding was limited and that 17 other airports were competing for the funding. The 2003 total project cost estimate used concepts and construction estimates developed in about 12 weeks by Boeing, TSA's contractor. According to TSA and LAWA officials, both TSA and Los Angeles signed the LOI/MOA knowing the preliminary nature of the cost estimate. According to construction industry guidance, an estimate's accuracy depends on the quality of information known about the project at the time the estimate is prepared. The 2003 estimate was made at the \"concept development\" stage where the final project cost can be expected to range from 50 percent under to 100 percent over the estimated cost, according to this guidance. The 2005 revised estimate was made at the \"design development\" stage where the range of the final project cost estimate can be expected to be more accurate--from 20 percent under to 30 percent over the estimated cost. In December 2003, LAWA presented TSA with a summary of inadequacies it had found in the original Boeing concept and the associated potential cost and scheduling impacts. LAWA then began an engineering study to update the in-line system concepts at LAX and ONT, the results of which it presented to TSA in September 2004. TSA reviewed these updated concepts and determined that they would meet its performance requirements; however, TSA's review did not address cost issues. LAWA used these updated concepts to develop its 2005 estimate, which was based on more definitive information about terminal design requirements than the 2003 estimate. According to LAWA, new construction and excavation included in the 2005 designs increased the estimated costs. Among the design changes, LAWA determined that the placement of EDS machines in the 2003 concepts was infeasible in five of nine of the LAX terminals and both ONT terminals. In addition, the 2005 estimate included 20 additional baggage inspection rooms, 9 rooms for on-screen resolution of EDS alarms, and 10 computer rooms at LAX and ONT terminals. The 2005 estimate also included over $11 million in computer networking costs and costs associated with on-screen resolution of EDS alarms, which the 2003 estimate did not foresee. TSA also highlighted two additional factors that caused differences between the two estimates--cost increases due to the delay in beginning construction of the project and the escalation of construction costs between 2003 and 2005. LAWA also determined that TSA's contractor and subcontractor made a mathematical error in the 2003 concept development estimate: construction costs were only included for one of the two baggage screening facilities and neither of the connected tunnels at ONT. TSA officials told us in January 2007 they were not able to substantiate this error."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To meet the mandate to screen all checked baggage for explosives by  December 31, 2003, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)  placed minivan-sized explosive detection systems (EDS) and other  screening equipment in airport lobbies.

Because few in-line  systems were in use at the time of the September 2003 LOI/MOA, only  limited information on the capabilities of the in-line EDS machines,  including actual bags screened per hour and false alarm rates, was  available for modeling the systems. In June 2006, TSA produced the  Recommended Security Guidelines for Airport Planning, Design and  Construction to guide future construction of in-line checked baggage  screening systems based on its past experiences. TSA also expects to  release more detailed guidelines for in-line system planning and design in   a few months.", "The LOI/MOA affords TSA flexibility to amend the agreement to account  for changed circumstances.

We visited LAX and ONT to obtain a first-hand  perspective of the modifications needed to install the in-line EDS systems  at both airports. Additionally, we examined industry guidance on  estimating costs for construction projects.

In  addition, LAWA and TSA provided technical comments concerning facts in  the report which we incorporated as appropriate.", "In its March 8, 2007, comments, LAWA wrote that it believes the draft did  not paint an accurate or complete picture of the facts. In general, LAWA  raised three points: (1) TSA has the authority to revise the LOI to reflect  accurate cost figures and explicitly anticipated doing so during the  LOI/MOA development process, (2) the report fails to assign specific  responsibility for initial designs and any errors, as directed by the Report  of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and (3) the report does not  recognize that LAWA responded to TSA urgency in completing the  agreements and, as a result, used preliminary design and cost estimates as  the basis for entering into the LOI/MOA.", "We do not agree with LAWA\u2019s comments. With respect to its first point, it  is true that the LOI/MOA agreements afford TSA flexibility to amend the  agreements to account for changed circumstances. As stated in our report,  however, under the terms of the LOI/MOA and in accordance with the law,  TSA is under no obligation to amend the LOI/MOA or to reimburse LAWA  for any costs beyond those agreed upon in the LOI/MOA. To date, as noted  in our report, TSA has not indicated any intent to amend the LOI/MOA  agreements to provide LAWA with additional funding for this project.", "LAWA states that it did not believe it would be held financially responsible  for increases in eligible and allowable costs due to reasons beyond its  control. When subsequent estimates revealed that the project costs would  exceed the LOI/MOA-estimated amount, LAWA requested an amendment  to the LOI to receive a 75 percent federal reimbursement of the   $485 million revised estimate.", "LAWA also commented that a senior TSA official provided written  assurances that the agency \u201cwould have the opportunity to cover an  increase in costs due to design changes\u201d and referenced an April 2004   e-mail from a TSA official to LAWA in support of this assertion. LAWA  noted that it relied on this and other assurances from TSA, \u201creinforced in  various discussions,\u201d at the time it concluded the LOI/MOA process.", "While the April 2004 e-mail cited above did note that LAWA would not \u201cbe  held to estimates that do not prove to be right on the mark,\u201d this particular  statement was made at least seven months after TSA and LAWA had  concluded the LOI/MOA process and entered into the agreements.  Furthermore, the MOA clearly provides that the agreement signed by both  parties constitutes the \u201ccomplete integration of all understandings  between the parties.\u201d More generally, it provides that any prior,  contemporaneous, or subsequent changes, whether written or oral, have  no force or effect, and that any changes or modifications to the MOA must  be in writing, signed by the TSA Contracting Officer, and duly executed by  the City of Los Angeles to have such force or effect. Neither LAWA nor  TSA presented any documentation suggesting that steps prescribed in the  MOA had been (or were anticipated to be) taken to amend the LOI/MOA  with respect to the reimbursable amount.", "LAWA also stated that the report does not reflect the extensive and  protracted discussions LAWA had with TSA, leaving the impression that  LAWA simply presented a new set of design concepts to TSA in September  2004. Our objective in this report, as agreed with congressional offices,  was to identify the key factors that contributed to the differences between  the 2003 and the 2005 cost estimates. As such, we reported that LAWA  reported the findings of its engineering study in September 2004 and that  TSA approved the concepts. We believe this statement sufficiently  demonstrates the agreement between TSA and LAWA on the revised  designs.", "In its second point, LAWA suggests that the GAO report avoids assigning  responsibility to TSA or its contractors and, as a result, \u201cfailed to answer  the Senate Committee\u2019s direction to provide a detailed explanation of the  reasons for any differences the original estimate, including identification  of and the party responsible for any material mistakes, omissions, and  infeasible design concepts in the original estimate.\u201d", "The objective of the report, as agreed with the appropriate congressional  offices in accordance with our Congressional Protocols, was to identify  factors contributing to differences between the estimates. To the extent  appropriate, we identified the roles and responsibilities of the various  parties. Specifically, we noted that Boeing produced the conceptual  designs that served as the basis for the 2003 estimate agreed to in the  LOI/MOA. We noted that these designs had been developed at an early  stage of the design process, which assumes costs that can differ greatly  from final project costs. The report also states that LAWA had determined  that Boeing had made a mathematical error in the Ontario estimate.  Further, we determined that both TSA and LAWA had signed the LOI/MOA  knowing of the preliminary nature of the cost estimate. Finally, as  referenced in our scope and methodology and as agreed with the  congressional offices, in identifying factors associated with the estimates,  we did not independently verify the 2003 or 2005 cost estimates.", "In its third point, LAWA suggests the report does not recognize that LAWA  responded to TSA urgency in completing the agreements and, as a result,  used preliminary design and cost estimates as the basis for entering into  the LOI/MOA.", "The report notes that \u201cLAWA officials stated that they were under a tight  timeframe because TSA had told them that federal funding was limited and  17 other airports were competing for the funding.\u201d We identified this as a  factor associated with the preliminary nature of the 2003 estimate. LAWA  also commented that it was essentially required to accept the Boeing  design and cost estimates. The report states that TSA and LAWA used the  Boeing estimate to provide the basis for the estimate agreed to in the  September 2003 LOI/MOA. Neither TSA nor LAWA provided evidence  suggesting that TSA had required LAWA to accept the Boeing design and  cost estimates.", "In its e-mail comments, TSA stated that concept development for in-line  solutions at all of the airports with LOIs was a collaborative effort between  TSA and the respective airport entity. TSA further stated that most of the  LOI estimates were developed early in the concept development phase. We  incorporated a comment into the report to acknowledge that TSA viewed  the development of the concepts as a partnership; however, we did not  review concept development at other airports.", "In its comments, TSA also states that there were only two changes in its  guidance between 2003 and 2005. The first was the addition of the use of  On-Screen Alarm Resolution Protocol during the alarm resolution process,  which TSA acknowledged required redesign and associated cost increases.  The second was the increase in the baggage throughput number per EDS  which led to the deletion of 13 EDS machines from the quantity estimated  in the 2003 concepts. According to TSA, this would have a significant  impact on lowering the overall project cost, which would be supported by  decreasing required space, baggage handling system infrastructure  (generally up to $4 million per machine on average) and associated  electrical, mechanical, data and other infrastructure.", "In its comments, TSA described two additional factors that caused  differences between the two estimates\u2014 cost increases due to the delay in  beginning construction of the project and the escalation of construction  costs between 2003 and 2005. We incorporated this comment into the  report.", "Finally, TSA stated in its comments that it had reviewed the mathematical  error LAWA determined Boeing made in the 2003 concept for ONT, and  had not been able to validate that the error had been made. In our report  we acknowledge that TSA was not able to substantiate the error.", "We will send copies of this report to the Secretary of Homeland Security  and the Assistant Secretary, Transportation Security Administration, and  interested congressional committees.
