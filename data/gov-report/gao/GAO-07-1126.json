The Department of Transportation (DOT) and Department of Justice (DOJ) share responsibility for overseeing ADA compliance. GAO was asked to review federal oversight and enforcement of ADA compliance, including (1) what is known about compliance, (2) difficulties the federal government faces in overseeing and enforcing compliance, and (3) the sources of federal help and any gaps in that help. GAO's work encompassed a wide range of federal agencies and other entities, such as industry associations, transportation providers, and disability advocacy groups, as well as detailed reviews in eight cities across the country."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While data indicate accessibility is improving for public transit, the extent of ADA compliance for other modes of transportation and public rights-of-way is unknown due to the lack of reliable data. For example, there are no national data on compliance with requirements for ADA paratransit--transit service that complements bus or rail transit. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) solicits compliance data from registered commercial bus companies, but the response rate is low (13 percent in 2006), and the agency has not verified or analyzed the data. In other instances, such as the accessibility of Amtrak's train stations, data are still being developed. Federal agencies face three main difficulties overseeing and enforcing compliance. First, they differ greatly in the degree to which they have an oversight framework in place. For example, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has a memorandum of understanding in place with DOJ specifying each agency's responsibilities for public transit, while the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration have no formal mechanism for coordinating with DOJ. Second, federal agencies' lack of data about compliance limits DOT's ability to target its oversight and enforcement efforts. Only the Federal Transit Administration uses data in this manner. Third, DOT officials regard their enforcement options, such as withholding grant money, as lengthy and complex processes that would not be undertaken lightly. DOT officials said the authority to impose fines--an option they lack--would be more useful. Federal agencies provide a variety of technical assistance to help entities comply with the ADA, but gaps in regulations and guidance exist. For example, one gap involves a requirement for local governments to develop plans for identifying and correcting accessibility problems with public rights-of-way. As a result, GAO found confusion about which entities needed to develop the plans and how to use and update plans once they were developed. DOJ officials said most localities had not developed such plans, leaving themselves open to private lawsuits and federal enforcement action."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Access to transportation and public rights-of-way is critical to helping  people with disabilities live independently\u2014allowing individuals to gain  access to the goods, services, employment opportunities, and social  contacts that support their quality of life. According to recent estimates,  there are about 40-50 million people with disabilities in the United States.  These include people with spinal cord injuries or other mobility  impairments, who may use a wheelchair or other mobility aid; people who  are blind or visually impaired, who may need assistance in reading signs or  locating crosswalks; people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing, who may  have difficulty hearing stop or route announcements; people with  cognitive impairments, who may have difficulty negotiating the public  transportation system; and others.", "The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) protects the legal rights  of people with disabilities and requires the provision of services, including  access to transportation and public rights-of-way. Since ADA  requirements became effective, access to surface transportation has  improved. For example, reports from the National Council on Disability  and the Bureau of Transportation Statistics found that more public and  private transportation vehicles are accessible now than at the time the  ADA was enacted.", "To help ensure that people with disabilities have such access, the federal  government is responsible for monitoring, overseeing, and enforcing ADA  requirements, as well as providing technical assistance. Specifically, the  Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access  Board) issues guidelines that show how buildings, facilities, and vehicles  covered by the law can be made accessible to individuals with disabilities.  These guidelines form the basis for enforceable standards when  incorporated into federal regulations. The Department of Transportation  (DOT) issues regulations for both public and private transportation and is  responsible for reviewing compliance among public entities. The  Department of Justice (DOJ) issues regulations setting rules and standards  for access in public and commercial facilities, including public rights-of- way, and has responsibility for litigation on the government\u2019s behalf in  enforcing the ADA upon referral of a finding of noncompliance by DOT or  by intervention in a privately filed lawsuit. DOJ is also responsible for  enforcing compliance among both publicly and privately operated  transportation systems that serve the general public.", "Despite overall improvements in accessibility since the ADA\u2019s enactment  and these federal oversight responsibilities, individuals with disabilities  continue to face barriers to accessible transportation. For example, a  national study conducted by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics in  2002 found that approximately 12 percent of individuals with disabilities  had difficulties obtaining the transportation they need, compared with 3  percent of people without disabilities. A 2004 national survey found that  people with disabilities were twice as likely to have inadequate  transportation as people without disabilities. In addition, research has  shown that compliance gaps still pose significant problems for many  individuals with disabilities. For example, a 2005 National Council on  Disability report found that some transit agencies fail to comply with the  ADA regulatory requirement to announce bus or rail stops, making it  difficult for people with visual or cognitive impairments to know when to  get off the bus or train. Elevators at rail stations may not be in working  order, rendering those stations inaccessible to people with certain  mobility impairments. The ADA requires public transit operators to  provide paratransit service for persons with disabilities who cannot use  the regular transit system, but many of these complementary paratransit  systems have timeliness problems, providing rides either too early or too  late, preventing riders from reaching their jobs or appointments in a timely  manner. Further, some transportation providers\u2014including taxi and  commercial bus drivers\u2014have refused to accommodate service animals,  such as guide dogs, as required by law. Finally, problems with public  rights-of-way include intersections without curb ramps or sidewalks  blocked by telephone poles.", "This report responds to your request that we review the federal  government\u2019s oversight of compliance with the ADA. Specifically, it  addresses: (1) what is known about the extent of ADA compliance for  surface transportation and public rights-of-way; (2) what difficulties, if  any, the federal government faces in overseeing and enforcing compliance  with the ADA; and (3) the sources of federal technical assistance that are  available to help public transportation providers, businesses, and state and  local governments comply with ADA requirements and what gaps, if any,  exist. In addition, we provided information on several sources of federal  financial assistance for ADA-related activities (see app. I).", "To address these questions, we reviewed the statutes, regulations, and  policies governing ADA requirements for surface transportation modes  and public rights-of-way; reviewed relevant literature; and gathered and  analyzed available federal agency data on ADA compliance. To assess the  reliability of accessibility data from the National Railroad Passenger  Corporation (Amtrak) and the Federal Transit Administration\u2019s National  Transit Database, we spoke with agency officials about data quality  control procedures and reviewed relevant documentation. We determined  the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We  interviewed officials from DOJ, DOT\u2019s Office of the Secretary, and the  various offices responsible for specific surface transportation modes  (transit, rail, commercial bus, and pedestrian access). These offices  included the Federal Transit Administration, Federal Railroad  Administration, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and Federal  Highway Administration. We also interviewed officials from the Access  Board, Amtrak, industry associations, and national-level disability  organizations. We also made site visits to eight cities, where we met with  officials from various entities, including transportation agencies, state  departments of transportation, municipal governments, centers for  independent living, and local disability advocacy groups. These cities were  selected on the basis of several factors, including size, experience with  federal ADA oversight processes, and geographic diversity.

In general, however, new  vehicles that were purchased or leased after August 1990, and buildings or  facilities that are constructed or altered after August 1990, must be  accessible. Other requirements include the following:    Transit authorities must provide comparable paratransit services to those  individuals who are unable to use fixed-route bus or rail services because  of a disability. These services are typically provided using wheelchair- accessible vans, small buses, or taxis.", "Existing intercity rail (Amtrak), commuter rail, light rail, and rapid rail  systems were to have at least one accessible car per train as of July 26,  1995.", "Existing \u201ckey stations\u201d in rapid rail, commuter rail, and light rail systems  were to have been made accessible by 1993 unless certain extensions  permitted by law were granted.", "Most existing stations currently served by Amtrak must be accessible by  July 26, 2010.", "Commercial bus companies must provide an accessible bus with 48-hour  notice, among other things.", "Entities such as hotels that generally offer transportation (shuttle service  to the airport, for instance) must provide equivalent transportation  services for people with disabilities.", "For public rights-of-way, all projects for new construction that provide  pedestrian facilities must incorporate accessible pedestrian features.  Projects altering the usability of the roadway must also incorporate  accessible pedestrian improvements.", "Figure 1 shows examples of some of these accessible transportation  features.", "A number of federal agencies have a role in implementing, overseeing, and  enforcing the ADA\u2019s surface transportation requirements. We will discuss  them in more detail later in this report, but their general roles and  responsibilities are as follows:    The Access Board is an independent federal agency devoted to  accessibility for people with disabilities. The board develops and  maintains design criteria for facilities and transit vehicles (these design  criteria are not enforceable until implemented in DOJ or DOT regulations).  It also provides technical assistance and training on these requirements  and on accessible design.", "DOJ has responsibility for publishing federal regulations governing access  to public and commercial services. DOJ also has responsibility for  investigating alleged ADA violations by private entities, including  transportation providers, and conducting compliance reviews. DOJ refers  allegations of ADA violations by public transportation entities to DOT for  investigation. DOJ also may commence civil action in U.S. district court  under certain circumstances.", "DOT is responsible for publishing federal regulations for carrying out the  transportation provisions of the ADA. Offices within DOT have the  following responsibilities:   Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) promulgated DOT\u2019s  regulations for the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. OST  also coordinates and approves DOT guidance and interpretation for  transportation accessibility. For example, OST issued a Notice of  Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in February 2006 in which it proposed  changes to ADA regulations, including revising commuter and intercity  rail station platform requirements and clarifying public transit  providers\u2019 responsibilities to modify their services when needed to  ensure program accessibility. OST also sought comment on how to  accommodate changes in mobility devices used by individuals with  disabilities, among other things.", "Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is responsible for  implementation of program access to individuals with disabilities by  state departments of transportation and other FHWA aid recipients,  including pedestrian rights-of-way access requirements from the ADA.", "Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) informs  commercial bus companies of their ADA responsibilities and collects  data on ADA compliance.", "Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is responsible for overseeing  federal grants to Amtrak, including ADA provisions.", "Federal Transit Administration (FTA) is responsible for overseeing  federal grants for public transportation, which includes compliance  with ADA requirements for public transportation systems, including  ADA-complementary paratransit.", "Two other agencies\u2014one inside DOT, the other outside\u2014also have roles  in ADA compliance. The National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration (NHTSA), within DOT, establishes federal motor vehicle  safety standards for platform lifts and vehicles equipped with platform lifts  (including commercial buses and public transportation vehicles). NHTSA  is also responsible for ADA compliance of state motor vehicle agencies  that receive federal funds. In addition, the National Council on Disability  (NCD), an independent federal agency, gathers information about the  implementation, effectiveness, and impact of the ADA. NCD also reviews  and evaluates federal policies, programs, practices, and procedures  concerning people with disabilities, and all statutes and regulations  pertaining to federal programs that assist people with disabilities, to  assess their effectiveness in meeting those needs.", "Several major interest groups and industry associations also play a role.  For example, the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund provides  ADA-related training, technical assistance, and legal services, and  advocates on behalf of people with disabilities. Also, the American Public  Transportation Association has an Access Committee designed to promote  successful implementation of the transportation provisions of the ADA by  facilitating information sharing and monitoring and reporting to its  members on the status of pending litigation, among other activities.", "A number of reports by national organizations indicate that transportation  accessibility has improved since Congress passed the ADA. For example,  NCD reported that the ADA has resulted in a significant expansion of lift-  and ramp-equipped buses, more accessible fare collection technology, and  increased availability of formats for disseminating accessible information.  Because of increased regulation, vehicles are of higher quality, and travel  has become more efficient. However, disability advocates have said (and  many federal agencies and industry associations agree) that there are still  problems. In a 2002 survey conducted by DOT\u2019s Bureau of Transportation  Statistics, a greater percentage of people with disabilities reported having  problems with several modes of transportation as compared with people  without disabilities (see fig. 2). Complaints and lawsuits, among other  sources of information, indicate accessibility problems persist. DOJ has  referred more than 500 ADA-related surface transportation complaints to  DOT since 2000 and is investigating 36 additional cases, as of July 2007,  according to DOJ officials. Also, additional complaints go directly to DOT.  Finally, private parties have filed numerous lawsuits alleging violations of  surface transportation and public rights-of-way accessibility requirements.", "Providing accessible transportation and public rights-of-way can be  expensive, especially if an entity has to modify existing structures or  purchase new equipment. Congress recognized this and phased in many of  the requirements over time. Unlike other situations in which Congress  identifies transportation priorities and provides grants or other funding  sources to help entities address those priorities, there are few funds that  are specifically targeted for ADA compliance. The ADA is a civil rights law,  not a transportation program; however, many federal transportation  funding sources can be used to comply with ADA requirements.

DOT collects some  accessibility data from urban public transit agencies and helped fund  several surveys to determine certain accessibility information for rural and  specialized transportation services. Much of the data for other modes,  however, are either unreliable or still being developed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Some Data Are Available on the Percent of Accessible Vehicles and Stations", "paragraphs": ["For public transit, data are available on the percent of vehicles and  stations that are wheelchair accessible in urban areas. DOT reports that  accessibility in the urban transit vehicle fleet is increasing as new,  accessible vehicles are replacing older ones, since the ADA requires that  all new or refurbished transit vehicles be accessible. In 1989, before  passage of the ADA, 36 percent of public transit buses in the United States  were accessible. By 2005, 97 percent were lift- or ramp-equipped,  according to FTA\u2019s National Transit Database. However, accessibility  varies significantly by mode of transportation. For example, only 51  percent of commuter railcars were accessible in 2005. ADA regulations do  not require that transportation providers make all railcars accessible  immediately; rather, that they make the fleet accessible over time as they  purchase or lease new cars, and that they provide at least one accessible  car per train. According to FTA officials, transit buses are more likely to  be accessible than railcars because, on average, railcars have a longer life  span. For example, buses are replaced about every 10 to 15 years, while  according to Amtrak officials, railcars are planned for replacement after 30  to 40 years but may last over 50 years under certain circumstances. The  ADA also requires that new transit facilities (including stations) and  alterations to existing facilities comply with federal accessibility  standards, and FTA has tracked this since 2002. By 2005, FTA\u2019s National  Transit Database reflected that transit agencies reported that 71 percent of  total transit stations were ADA-compliant.", "Also, while limited, some dated estimates of accessibility in rural areas  and for special service transportation exist. In a survey conducted by the  Community Transportation Association of America in 2000, an estimated  60 percent of the transit fleet in rural areas was lift- or ramp-equipped, as  compared with 40 percent in 1994. Also, in 2002, approximately 37,700  special service vehicles were used by approximately 4,800 special service  providers including religious organizations, senior centers, rehabilitation  centers, and other private and nonprofit organizations to transport seniors  and persons with disabilities. The majority of the special service providers  were located in rural areas. Of the special service vehicles purchased in  2002, about 76 percent were accessible (approximately 28,700 vehicles).", "Although available data indicate increasing accessibility of transit vehicles,  requirements in ADA regulations extend beyond having lift- and ramp- equipped vehicles. Other requirements include properly maintaining the  vehicle lifts and ramps and announcing transit stops. According to an FTA  official, there are no national data on compliance with these two  requirements, although FTA\u2019s periodic compliance reviews provide the  agency with some information about the state of compliance. We heard  from a number of federal agencies and local and national disability groups  that these areas continue to be a problem for transit agencies, making it  difficult for individuals with disabilities to access the public transit system.", "FTA also maintains data on key rail stations, which were required by the  ADA to be fully accessible by 1993 (with extensions permitted through  July 2020 for extraordinarily expensive structural changes). According to  FTA, as of June 2007, of the 687 key rail stations identified in transit  systems nationwide, 321 were found to be fully compliant with ADA  requirements, 311 were functionally accessible but not fully compliant, 28  were not accessible, and 27 were proceeding under approved time  extensions. While the number of ADA-compliant stations is still relatively  low, this is a substantial improvement over the 52 key rail stations (8  percent) that FTA identified as fully compliant in 2000.", "In addition to fixed-route transit, FTA also oversees ADA-complementary  paratransit, which will be discussed in the next section."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Less Is Known About the Extent of ADA Compliance for Public Rights-of-Way and Other Transportation Modes", "paragraphs": ["For public rights-of-way and many modes of surface transportation, such  as intercity passenger rail, less is known about ADA compliance because  much of the information is unreliable or still being developed.

Amtrak officials indicate that all new or remanufactured Amtrak  equipment is accessible, in accordance with the ADA. For example, all of  the cars on the Acela high-speed rail service in operation on the Northeast  Corridor are accessible because the cars were manufactured and placed in  service in or around 2000-2001, according to Amtrak officials. As of June  2007, 82 percent of Amtrak\u2019s 1,451 passenger cars were fully accessible to  people in wheelchairs. FRA officials said that Amtrak appears to be on  schedule to have all of its passenger cars ADA-compliant by the end of  2008.", "Every train is also required to have a number of wheelchair spaces (for  those who want to sit in their chairs) and accessible seats (for those who  want to store their chairs and sit in a seat) equal to the number of coaches.  For instance, if a train has four passenger cars it must have at least four  wheelchair spaces and four accessible seats somewhere on that train (but  not more than two in each car). Amtrak has policies and procedures in  place to ensure that these requirements are met. The requirements are  specifically explained in the station master\u2019s guidance for each route and  updated every 6 months when schedules change. Amtrak keeps an internal  record of instances when it is unable to meet the accessibility  requirements for each train, due to such things as mechanical failure.", "In addition to requirements for accessible cars, the ADA requires Amtrak  to make most of the stations that it serves fully accessible by July 2010,  even if Amtrak does not own the station. According to Amtrak,  transportation personnel check each station for wheelchair accessibility  and report that information to Amtrak every 6 months for inclusion in  Amtrak\u2019s timetable. As of June 2007, 45 percent of the 479 stations that  Amtrak serves were fully accessible to people in wheelchairs. An  additional 31 percent had barrier-free access between the street or parking  lot, station platform, and trains, although individual facilities (such as  restrooms and ticket counters) may not be accessible. Amtrak officials  said that these stations serve 97 percent of passenger boardings and  deboardings.", "ADA requirements extend beyond wheelchair accessibility, however, such  as requiring accessible telephones and detectable warnings at platforms.  One difficulty that Amtrak cited in making existing stations accessible is  that ADA regulations define \u201cstations\u201d to include platforms, making it  difficult to determine who is responsible for making and paying for  changes when one entity owns the station building (often a public entity),  and another entity owns the platforms (typically a private entity such as a  freight railroad). Amtrak officials said that this is impeding Amtrak\u2019s  overall progress in ensuring that stations are ADA compliant.", "Although Amtrak has had 17 years to make its stations accessible, in its  2008 grant and legislative request, Amtrak said that insufficient time and  funding are likely to prevent full compliance at all station stops by the  required deadline. Amtrak estimated the cost of compliance for all stations  to be approximately $250 million and requested $50 million in ADA  funding for fiscal year 2008 above its base grant request. In addition,  Amtrak asked Congress for an extension of at least 5 years after  promulgation of DOT\u2019s final regulations on station platforms (discussed in  the next paragraph) to meet its statutory obligation on ADA compliance.", "Amtrak officials say that they requested the extension in part because  DOT issued an NPRM in February 2006 that would raise the required  height for certain new intercity passenger and commuter rail station  platforms to eliminate the need for wheelchair lifts. DOT plans to finalize  this rule by early 2008 and has received a significant number of comments  on it. Amtrak officials said that, if DOT finalizes the regulation in its  current form, implementing the rule would take significant additional cost  (potentially more than twice as much as it would cost without the  proposed rule) and time to comply. In addition, Amtrak officials expressed  concern that if the cost of complying with that regulation becomes too  high, Amtrak may have to eliminate service at certain smaller stations  rather than make those stations fully accessible. The officials also expect  to receive complaints from freight railroads that the elevated platforms  would interfere with their freight railcars that run on the same tracks as  Amtrak. On the other hand, DOT officials believe the cost differential  between the current requirements and the additional proposed  requirements is negligible for many of the Amtrak stations to which these  proposed requirements would apply. Moreover, FRA officials believe that  conflicts with freight traffic are likely to be minimal and that there are well  known and moderately priced techniques that can mitigate conflicts that  occur. Further, the other station accessibility requirements\u2014such as for  restrooms, parking, signage, and curb ramps\u2014have not changed since  1991, and DOT officials said that their proposed regulations should not be  at fault for any delay or other problems Amtrak may face in addressing  ADA requirements.", "In part due to Amtrak\u2019s slow progress in implementing the ADA, FRA\u2019s  grant agreements for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 required Amtrak to assess  the accessibility of the stations that it serves, identify the steps needed to  make them accessible, and report to FRA by September 2006 and May  2007 on its status. Amtrak is in the process of surveying intercity  passenger rail stations to determine their accessibility and has hired a  contractor to help in this effort, but the study has not been completed to  date, limiting the available information on ADA compliance. Of the 479  stations that are required to be fully accessible, Amtrak had assessed 371  (77 percent) by June 2007 and expects to have the remaining assessments  completed by December 2008, according to an Amtrak official. Amtrak  reported some preliminary findings in a briefing to its board of directors in  June 2007; however, the briefing did not include specific, station-by-station  information on accessibility, the estimated cost to bring each station into  compliance, or a schedule for achieving full compliance. An Amtrak  official said that Amtrak cannot determine the cost or time frame for  achieving compliance without knowing whether DOT\u2019s proposed  requirements for rail platforms will be finalized or whether Congress will  appropriate additional funds. Additionally, ADA regulations require that  DOT periodically conduct reviews of Amtrak\u2019s compliance with ADA  requirements. FRA does not conduct such reviews, further limiting the  availability of data on Amtrak\u2019s ADA compliance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Commercial Bus", "paragraphs": ["There are limited data available on ADA compliance among commercial  bus companies.

Large, fixed-route companies must also purchase lift-equipped buses  when acquiring new vehicles and were to have 50 percent of their vehicle  fleets accessible by 2006 and to have 100 percent of the fleets accessible  by 2012. DOT regulations require commercial bus companies to report to  FMCSA annually on the number of their accessible vehicles, requests for  accessible service, and their ability to meet those requests. FMCSA  includes information about this reporting requirement on its Web site and  sent letters and e-mails to all registered companies starting in 2004,  reminding them of their obligations. The two major industry associations  also urged their members to respond to FMCSA\u2019s data request. However,  13 percent of companies reported this required data in 2006, compared  with 21 percent in 2005 and 16 percent in 2004, and FMCSA does not have  the authority to fine companies for failure to comply with these reporting  requirements.

DOT was to also conduct a similar  study for fixed-route commercial buses by October 2007. Neither study has  been completed to date. After an internal disagreement within DOT about  which agency is responsible for conducting these studies, officials from  DOT\u2019s OST and FMCSA recently decided\u2014in response to our preliminary  findings\u2014to work jointly to produce these reports, with participation from  FTA and other DOT modal administrations. According to DOT, its General  Counsel\u2019s office will meet with key officials from FMCSA and other  concerned DOT organizations to finalize plans for completing the study.  DOT expects to issue its results during the first quarter of calendar year  2008. In the meantime, however, the status of compliance of commercial  bus companies is unknown.", "According to agency officials, FMCSA has received two ADA-related  complaints regarding commercial bus passenger service since 2001, and  DOJ has received relatively few complaints about the accessibility of  commercial buses. However, FMCSA identified several possible ADA  violations among small commercial bus companies during compliance  reviews and forwarded that information to DOJ for possible investigation.  Furthermore, despite the small number of complaints to federal agencies,  reports in the media and several recent and ongoing court cases indicate  that there may be compliance issues among some commercial bus  companies. For example, in November 2006, Peter Pan Bus Lines brought  suit against FMCSA with the allegation that the modal administration had  not ensured that another commercial bus company was complying with  the ADA. Little is known about compliance by small charter-tour  companies, but according to DOT officials, they have limited anecdotal  evidence suggesting that many such companies are unaware of ADA rules  or do not comply with them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Public Rights-of-Way", "paragraphs": ["There are no national data on the accessibility of public rights-of-way, in  part because there are no requirements for either FHWA or DOJ to collect  such information, although individual localities may collect this  information.

However, after January 26, 1992, any new construction, alteration,  or renovation (including road resurfacing) must comply with DOJ  regulations. Many localities are also required to inventory the accessibility  of public rights-of-way under their jurisdiction as part of developing an  ADA-required transition plan for improving that accessibility. Many of the  national and local disability advocacy groups we spoke with, however,  said that access to public rights-of-way is still a major barrier to the  mobility of people with disabilities. For example, a local disability  advocacy group cited several recent examples in which a locality had a  major construction project in the downtown area where the renovated  sidewalks and medians did not include curb ramps and were inaccessible  (see fig. 3). Some groups added that inaccessible routes to bus stops also  hinder access to public transit.", "Also, we heard from local officials that, in some instances, curb ramps  have been installed, but are not fully compliant with federal regulations.  For example, officials from one major urban area said that although the  locality installed curb ramps, the ramps are too steep and are not well  maintained. One difficulty is in determining who is responsible for making  rights-of-way accessible.

However, they have started to visit  states to determine if they have transition plans or plans to meet  accessibility obligations using DOJ guidance as a tool.

In another example, DOJ negotiated settlement agreements  with six taxi service providers to eliminate surcharges or bans on travelers  with service animals or wheelchairs.

DOT agencies are required to hold a  hearing in front of, and gain approval from, the Secretary of  Transportation prior to withholding funding.

For example, DOJ joined a private suit against a large city and reached a  consent agreement in which the city agreed to address alleged ADA  violations involving its fixed-route public bus systems. For private  transportation entities, DOJ can, and has, initiated its own lawsuits, joined  existing private lawsuits, used mediation, signed settlement agreements,  and sought civil penalties.

Thus, to  address these concerns, and others, the DOT issued an NPRM soliciting  public comment on this topic, as well as on paratransit services and level  boarding for rail station platforms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More Clarity Needed for Public Rights-of-Way Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Advocacy and industry groups and state and local governments told us  that current federal regulations and guidance have gaps or are unclear on  (1) ADA-required transition plans for assessing the accessibility of state  and local governments\u2019 structures including sidewalks and curb ramps and  (2) technical requirements for installing accessible public rights-of-way.", "Many Jurisdictions Lack Information about Transition Plans for  Correcting Public Rights-of-Way Deficiencies or Are Unaware They  Have to Develop a Plan  ADA regulations require state and local governments to assess local  accessibility and draft a transition plan for upgrading the public rights-of- way within their jurisdictions. Current regulations require any public  entity that employs 50 or more persons to develop such a plan. If a public  entity has responsibility or authority over streets, roads, or walkways, its  transition plan must include a schedule for providing curb ramps, or other  sloped areas, where pedestrian walks cross curbs, including state and  local government offices and facilities, transportation, and places of public  accommodation. At a minimum, the plan must identify physical obstacles  that might limit the accessibility of programs or activities, describe in  detail the methods that will be used to make facilities accessible, specify  the schedule for taking identified steps, and indicate the official  responsible for implementing the plan. However, gaps exist in the current  federal regulations and guidance because they do not specify how to  include that information in the plans and, if a jurisdiction has a plan, when  it should update the plan.", "The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials  surveyed state departments of transportation and concluded that  considerable confusion exists among states about when and how to  update transition plans. In addition, several members of an industry  association (representing different states and localities) told us that  jurisdictions are confused about what is supposed to be included in a  transition plan and indicated that more specific federal guidance would be  helpful. For example, one state transportation official mentioned that  federal guidance was unclear on what data should be collected for ADA  transition plans and did not address field-level implementation of ADA  requirements for transition plans.", "Without proper regulations and accompanying guidance from the federal  government, states and localities face challenges creating these plans, or  may not create them at all. DOJ Project Civic Access reviews typically  reveal that, most commonly, the responsible government has not  established an ADA transition plan and the accompanying policies and  procedures necessary to ensure the installation of curb ramps at public  rights-of-way. Absent such plans, states and localities may neither assess  the status of the accessibility of their public rights-of-way nor develop a  schedule for updating curb ramps and ensuring access to public services  and programs, leaving themselves vulnerable to private lawsuits or federal  compliance actions. Furthermore, without transition plans, it is difficult or  impossible for the federal government to assess compliance and collect  information or data from state and local governments with regard to the  accessibility of their public rights-of-way.", "FHWA has recognized the lack of information on ADA-required transition  plans and other aspects of civil rights requirements and plans to complete  civil rights program assessments of all state departments of transportation  by the end of fiscal year 2008. This project should, among other things,  enable FHWA to gauge the number of states that have developed and  implemented a transition plan. The program assessments are designed to  assess how state departments of transportation implement ADA  requirements and ascertain the extent to which they are involved with  local governments\u2019 ADA implementation on projects and programs that  are jointly funded by FHWA and a state department of transportation.  While these program assessments are a first step, FHWA will not assess  the content of state transition plans or determine whether the state  transportation agencies are in compliance with the ADA. The assessments  will also not address whether local governments throughout the country  have created transition plans.", "FHWA has also drafted a tool kit for its division offices and state  departments of transportation. The tool kit will assist staff tasked with  compliance and oversight activities for ADA requirements, including  oversight of transition plans for state departments of transportation.  According to FHWA, this tool kit is under review by FHWA\u2019s Office of  Chief Counsel and is not yet available publicly. In addition, FHWA is  involved in a federally funded research project by the National  Cooperative Highway Research Program focusing on the development of a  guide for updating ADA transition plans for state departments of  transportation. This project is aimed at helping states translate applicable  laws and guidance into field-level implementation of ADA requirements for  transition plans and related requirements and is anticipated to be  completed in May 2008.", "Technical Standards for Installing Public Rights-of-Way Are Not  Finalized  In addition to the transition plans required by the ADA, the Access Board  developed ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) for installing accessible  structures and devices such as curb ramps for sidewalks. These guidelines  serve as the basis for DOJ and DOT\u2019s current ADA regulations, originally  published in 1991. However, ADA accessibility requirements in current  regulations focus primarily on accessibility standards for building  facilities, not public rights-of-way. In June 1994, the Access Board  published an interim rule containing more information on public rights-of- way, among other accessibility topics, to supplement the ADA accessibility  requirements. As the transportation community and others reviewed these  guidelines, however, they were concerned about the magnitude of the  work that would be needed to meet the public rights-of-way guidance. As a  result, the Access Board withdrew the sections of the rule pertaining to  public rights-of-way and began conducting education and outreach  activities to inform the transportation industry about accessibility of  public rights-of-way. Current ADA accessibility requirements, as codified  in regulation, do not contain the Access Board supplement on public  rights-of-way.", "In 1999, the Access Board resumed its efforts to develop final guidelines  for public rights-of-way and, nearly a decade later, work continues on  these draft guidelines. After soliciting input from a wide variety of  stakeholders, the Access Board released another draft of its public rights- of-way guidelines in 2002 for public comment and received an extensive  public response. The board considered these comments and, in 2005,  published revised draft guidelines for purposes of gathering additional  information for an economic impact analysis, which is still under way by  the Access Board. The new guidelines are expected to cover such subjects  as pedestrian access to sidewalks and streets, including crosswalks, curb  ramps, street furnishings, pedestrian signals, parking, and other parts of  the public rights-of-way. They will likely also address issues such as access  at street crossings for pedestrians who are blind or have low vision,  wheelchair access to on-street parking, and constraints posed by space  limitations, roadway design practices, slope, and terrain. According to  Access Board and DOJ officials, the draft guidelines are more consistent  with industry standards.", "The draft guidelines remain a work in progress. The Access Board is still  working on the economic analysis, and, once it is complete, the draft  guidelines will go out for public comment. As of July 2007, however, the  Access Board was not able to provide an estimate for when the guidelines  might be finalized. If codified into federal regulations and standards by  DOJ, the Access Board draft guidelines would supplement the current  ADA accessibility requirements and provide a comprehensive set of  regulations for public rights-of-way.", "Various studies and advocacy and industry groups, as well as officials with  whom we spoke, cited the lack of final, specialized standards for public  rights-of-way as a problem. Some of their comments and findings are as  follows:    According to a report by the National Academies of Sciences,  improvements to pedestrian accessibility have lagged behind  improvements to the rest of the transportation network, in part because no  enforceable regulations for making public rights-of-way accessible have  been issued.", "Officials with the National Council on Disabilities said that, absent such  enforceable standards, localities continue to erect barriers, such as  inaccessible bus stops, intersections without curb ramps or with  improperly constructed curb ramps, and barriers blocking sidewalks.", "Officials with a national industry association with whom we spoke said  that localities are uncertain about requirements for and definitions of  accessible pedestrian signals. The officials said that there is a strong bias  for localities to delay in adding pedestrian signals, depending on what the  final guidelines will require. For example, one city is conducting a major  construction project downtown to add light rail. In the course of this  construction, 60 pedestrian signals will be modified, but the city is unsure  how to proceed since accessible pedestrian signals are not defined or  covered in current ADA requirements.", "Industry groups with whom we spoke noted that states and localities may  not make an investment in accessibility improvements for public rights-of- way that go beyond current regulations for curb ramps, since draft  guidelines will likely change. Furthermore, officials with whom we spoke  identified aspects of current accessibility requirements that are not clear,  such as detectable warning requirements for curb ramps.", "Additionally, industry and advocacy groups and state and local  governments said that differences between the draft guidelines, current  ADA accessibility requirements, other federal guidelines, and national and  state building codes create challenges for state and local governments that  are trying to comply with applicable accessibility requirements for public  rights-of-way.", "State and local government officials, as well as officials from advocacy and  industry groups, pointed to the lack of finalized comprehensive standards  for public rights-of-way as an obstacle to ensuring access to transportation  for individuals with disabilities. FHWA, which implements ADA pedestrian  access requirements for federal, state, and local government agencies that  build and maintain highways, has provided some guidance, but FHWA  officials acknowledge that the effectiveness of the guidance is limited.  Furthermore, FHWA directs states and localities to use the Access Board\u2019s  draft guidelines as best practices. In the absence of finalized  comprehensive standards for public rights-of-way, DOJ and the Access  Board have developed guidance on these issues. For example, DOJ has  developed an online tool kit for state and local governments to use in  identifying and fixing problems in public rights-of-way accessibility.  However, according to federal officials, it is difficult to provide effective  training and technical assistance for states and localities while Access  Board draft guidelines are not final and codified in regulation. Federal  officials have acknowledged that the draft guidelines will likely change as  a result of the rulemaking process."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Congress passed the ADA in part to help people with disabilities have  access to transportation, but 17 years later the federal government cannot  determine the extent of its success for many transportation modes due to  a lack of reliable data. While some improvements have been made in  surface transportation accessibility, further advances are also hindered, in  part, by confusion among transportation providers and local governments  about some of the more complex and emerging aspects of accessibility  requirements and among federal agencies about their respective roles and  responsibilities. For state and local governments, a major source of  confusion is the ADA\u2019s requirement to develop and update transition plans  that inventory the accessibility of public rights-of-way and identify steps  and time frames for addressing deficiencies. Industry associations and  state and local transportation agencies that we interviewed were unsure  what should be included in the plan, what a successful plan would look  like, and how often to update the plan. The problem is persistent enough  that the National Cooperative Highway Research Program, which is  funded by FHWA and state transportation agencies, is conducting a study  to develop a tool to help state transportation agencies with these plans.  FHWA is also conducting program assessments of state transportation  agencies to determine whether they have completed transition plans.", "There is also confusion among DOT\u2019s modal administrations about what  steps DOT is able to take to enforce the ADA. DOT established a Disability  Law Coordinating Council to coordinate the agency\u2019s disability-related  guidance and policies, but this mission does not include coordination of  oversight and enforcement efforts. FTA and DOJ crafted a memorandum  of understanding that set out their respective responsibilities for shared  enforcement of the ADA, and this was successful in that it helped develop  working relationships that have furthered oversight and enforcement of  accessibility requirements in public transportation. However, FMCSA does  not conduct ADA compliance reviews or investigate complaints for  commercial buses and has indicated that it cannot withhold or revoke a  company\u2019s operating authority for noncompliance with the ADA. A federal  court directed FMCSA to reexamine the statute for further consideration.  In addition, although FMCSA and DOT\u2019s Office of the Secretary have not  gathered and reviewed information on the accessibility of demand- response and fixed-route commercial bus service and determined whether  to retain or modify the ADA regulations governing such buses, as required,  they recently developed a preliminary strategy for doing so in response to  our preliminary findings. FRA also has had limited involvement in ADA  enforcement and has not conducted periodic compliance reviews of  Amtrak, as required by regulation, but FRA officials indicated that they  may do so in the future. Amtrak\u2019s delay in conducting station assessments,  including providing information on the steps necessary to bring them into  compliance with the ADA by July 2010, hinders FRA\u2019s ability to adequately  oversee intercity passenger rail accessibility.", "When DOT does identify ADA violations\u2014whether by local transit  agencies, Amtrak, or other entities\u2014DOT primarily relies on informal  negotiations and reminders to attempt to obtain compliance with the ADA.  In many cases, these informal methods are sufficient to correct the  problem. Sometimes, however, an entity refuses to comply due to  competing priorities for funds, lack of expertise, or other reasons. The  ADA has been in effect for more than 17 years, and federal officials are  less sympathetic to such reasons than they used to be. Other than the  informal methods, DOT\u2019s other enforcement options are withholding grant  funds or pursuing litigation through DOJ. However, DOT has rarely used  these options because they are too drastic or lengthy to effectively address  the problem in many instances. There is very little middle ground  available. Civil penalties are a tool that DOT uses to achieve other goals,  but it does not have authority to use them for ADA violations. DOT\u2019s Office  of the Secretary already has experience in administering civil penalties  against air carriers for violations of the Air Carrier Access Act. Likewise,  FRA and FMCSA impose civil penalties against freight rail and commercial  motor carriers, respectively, for safety violations. Similar authority for  ADA violations would give DOT\u2019s oversight and enforcement efforts more  weight and help ensure that accessibility is a higher priority for public and  private surface transportation providers and local governments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the availability of data on ADA compliance and improve FRA\u2019s  ability to oversee Amtrak\u2019s progress in implementing the ADA, we  recommend that the President of Amtrak continue to report to FRA on the  status of Amtrak\u2019s review of the accessibility of its stations.

Second, they indicated the proposed rules are unclear  regarding who is responsible for ADA compliance in areas where different  public and private entities own stations. Finally, they stated these potential  requirements are expensive, especially in the face of Amtrak\u2019s funding  difficulties. They conclude that many technical, ownership, and funding  issues are involved in addressing ADA compliance.
