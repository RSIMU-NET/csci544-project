GAO surveyed a generalizable sample of local governments, studied taxpayer compliance in two jurisdictions that met selection criteria, reviewed IRS documents, and interviewed government officials and others.

Neither local-government tax bills nor mortgage-servicer documents identify what taxpayers can properly deduct. Without such information, determining deductibility can be complex and involve significant effort. While IRS guidance for taxpayers discusses what qualifies as deductible, it does not indicate that taxpayers may need to check both tax bills and other information sources to make the determination. In addition, tax software and paid preparers may not ensure that taxpayers only deduct qualified amounts. There are no reliable estimates for the extent of noncompliance caused by taxpayers claiming nondeductible charges, or the associated federal tax loss. However, GAO estimates that almost half of local governments nationwide included generally nondeductible charges on their bills. While the full extent of overstatement is unknown due to data limitations, GAO estimates that taxpayers in two counties collectively overstated their deductions by at least $23 (or $46 million using broader matching criteria). IRS examinations of real-estate tax deductions focus more on whether the taxpayer owned the property and paid the taxes than whether the taxpayer claimed only deductible amounts, primarily because nondeductible charges are generally small. IRS guidance does not require examiners to request proof of deductibility or direct them to look for nondeductible charges on tax bills. Various options could improve compliance with the real-estate tax deduction, such as providing taxpayers with better guidance and more information, and increasing IRS enforcement. However, the lack of information regarding the extent of noncompliance and the associated tax loss makes it difficult to evaluate these options. If IRS obtained information on real-estate tax bill charges, it could find areas with potentially significant noncompliance and use targeted methods to reduce noncompliance in those areas."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Voluntary compliance with federal tax laws is a critical component of the  federal tax system.

In our 1993 report, we  stated that two reasons for noncompliance were: (1) real-estate tax bills  that did not distinguish between deductible taxes and nondeductible user  fees; and (2) inadequate IRS education and enforcement activities with  respect to the deduction for real-estate taxes.", "In 2006, individuals\u2019 federal deductions of real-estate taxes amounted to  about $156 billion.

Local governments, such as counties, can levy and  collect taxes on behalf of smaller jurisdictions within their boundaries. For  example, a county could collect real-estate taxes on behalf of a city within  the county. In 2006, local-government property tax revenue was about  $347 billion, compared to about $12 billion for state-government property  tax revenue. Local governments can use property tax revenues to fund  local services, such as road maintenance and law enforcement. In 2006,  property taxes made up an average of 45 percent of general own-source  revenue for local governments nationwide.", "According to the Congressional Research Service, the real-estate tax  deduction was the most frequently itemized federal income tax deduction  claimed by individual taxpayers from 1998 through 2006; the deduction  was claimed on approximately 31 percent of all individual tax returns, and  on about 87 percent of all returns with itemized deductions. The real- estate tax deduction provides a benefit to homeowners and also provides  an indirect federal subsidy to local governments that levy this and other  deductible taxes, since it decreases the net cost of the tax to taxpayers.  Deductible real-estate taxes also may encourage local governments to  impose higher taxes, which may allow them to provide more services than  they otherwise would without the deduction. In 2006, individual taxpayers  claimed about $156 billion in real-estate taxes as an itemized deduction.  By allowing taxpayers to deduct qualified real-estate taxes, the federal  government forfeits tax revenues that it could otherwise collect.", "Taxpayers can claim paid real-estate taxes as an itemized deduction on  Schedule A of the federal income tax return for individuals. In addition,  the Housing and Recovery Act signed July 30, 2008, included a provision  that allowed non-itemizers to deduct up to $500 ($1,000 for joint filers) in  real-estate taxes paid for tax year 2008. Taxpayers can also deduct paid  real-estate taxes on other parts of the tax return, including as part of a  deduction for a home office or in calculating net income from rental  properties. For purposes of this report, references to the real-estate tax  deduction mean the itemized deduction on Schedule A.", "Taxpayers may deduct state, local, and foreign real-property taxes from  their federal tax returns if certain conditions are met. Taxpayers may  only deduct real-estate property taxes paid or accrued in the taxable  year. To be deductible, real-estate taxes must be imposed on an interest  in real property. Taxes based on the value of property are known as ad  valorem. Further, real-estate taxes are only deductible when they are  levied for the general public welfare by the proper taxing authority at a  like rate against all property in the jurisdiction. Real-estate-related  charges for services are not deductible. Examples of such charges for  services include unit fees for water usage or trash collection. In addition,  taxpayers may not deduct taxes assessed against local benefits of a kind  tending to increase the value of their property. Such local benefit taxes  include assessments for streets, sidewalks, and similar improvements.  However, local benefit taxes can be deductible if they are for the purpose  of maintenance and repair of such benefits or related interest charges.", "IRS estimates that on income tax returns for 2001, all overstated  deductions taken together resulted in $14 billion in tax loss. IRS estimated  the amount of misreporting of deductions, but did not estimate the  resulting tax loss for each deduction. However, according to data from  IRS\u2019s National Research Program, which is designed to measure individual  taxpayer reporting compliance, in 2001 about 5.5 million taxpayers  overstated their real-estate tax deductions, which resulted in a total  overstatement of about $5.0 billion. The median overstatement was $436,  or about 23 percent of the median claimed deduction amount of $1,915.  We estimate that 38.8 million taxpayers claimed this deduction in 2001.  While about 5.5 million taxpayers overstated their deductions, about 3.3  million understated their deductions. Taken as a whole, about 8.8 million  taxpayers on average overstated their deductions by about $85 each,  which resulted in a net total overstatement of about $2.5 billion.", "Taxpayers can overstate or understate their real-estate tax deductions in a  number of ways. For example, they can overstate their deduction by not  meeting such eligibility requirements as property ownership and payment  during the tax year, or by inappropriately deducting the same taxes on  multiple parts of the income tax return. Taxpayers can also overstate by  claiming such real-estate tax-related amounts as local benefit taxes and  itemized charges for services, which, as noted earlier, are not deductible.  Taxpayers can also understate their real-estate deduction. For example,  first-time homeowners may understate this deduction because they are not  aware that they are entitled to claim it. Similarly, taxpayers who buy and  sell a home in the same year could understate this deduction out of  confusion over how much in taxes they can deduct for the old and new  homes.", "Our 1993 report found that a majority of the local real-estate tax bills that  we reviewed included nondeductible items, such as service charges, in  addition to deductible real-estate taxes. Our report also indicated that  local governments had increased their use of service charges in reaction to  events that had reduced their revenues, such as local laws that restricted  growth in real-estate taxes. By increasing user fees to finance services,  local governments could keep their tax rates lower. We also reported that  some local jurisdictions did not clearly indicate nondeductible items on  real-estate tax bills and combined all types of payments (e.g., deductible  and nondeductible real-estate taxes) into a total amount, which may lead  taxpayers to claim this total amount on the bill as deductible and thereby  overstate their deduction.", "Most taxpayers rely upon either paid preparers or tax software to file their  tax returns. Recent estimates indicate that about 75 percent of taxpayers  used either a paid preparer (59 percent) or tax software (16 percent) to file  their 2007 taxes.

To get an indication of the extent  to which taxpayers may be overstating their real-estate tax deductions by  including such nondeductible charges, we conducted case studies on five  large local governments, collecting and analyzing tax data from them and  IRS. Specifically, we worked with IRS to determine which charges on the  five local governments\u2019 tax bills were likely deductible. While conducting  these five case studies of taxpayer noncompliance in claiming the real- estate tax deduction, we identified challenges in determining what charges  qualify as deductible real-estate taxes. Then, to the extent possible, for two  jurisdictions we compared the amounts that were likely deductible to the  amounts the taxpayers claimed as deductions on Schedule A of their 2006  federal tax returns. Appendix III provides details on the methodology for  this case study, including jurisdiction selection.", "To describe the extent that IRS examinations of the real-estate tax  deduction focus on potential overstatements due to taxpayer inclusion of  nondeductible charges, we reviewed IRS guidance for examiners related  to the real-estate tax deduction, and interviewed IRS examiners about the  standard procedures and methods they use for auditing this deduction. We  reviewed guidance in the Internal Revenue Manual, which serves as the  handbook for IRS examiners, to determine how clearly it instructs  examiners to verify the deductibility of charges on real-estate bills when  auditing this deduction. Our interviews with IRS examiners focused on the  extent to which examiners determine the deductibility of charges on real- estate bills when auditing this deduction, challenges faced by examiners  auditing this deduction, and whether examiners have information about  local jurisdictions with large nondeductible charges on their real-estate tax  bills. The examiners we interviewed included examiners and managers  based in IRS offices across the United States.", "To assess possible options for improving voluntary taxpayer compliance  with the real-estate tax deduction, we interviewed members of  organizations representing local governments and IRS officials about  potential options.

In our review, we found no instances where the local  government indicated on the bill what amounts were deductible for  federal real-estate tax purposes.

As a result, local  governments did not want to make such determinations.", "Taxpayers with mortgages may also receive information about real-estate  tax bill charges paid on their behalf by mortgage servicers, but this  information generally does not identify what taxes can be deducted. To  protect a mortgage holder\u2019s interest in a mortgaged property, mortgage  servicers often collect funds from property owners whose mortgages they  service (borrowers) and hold them in escrow accounts. They then draw  from the funds to pay real-estate taxes and related charges on the  properties as they are due. Mortgage servicers provide borrowers with  annual statements summarizing these and other deposits and withdrawals  of escrow account funds. In addition, mortgage servicers have the option  of reporting such escrow payments on information returns relating to paid  mortgage interest, but can choose to report other information instead.", "Mortgage industry representatives we spoke with stated that when  reporting escrow payments, mortgage servicers usually report the total  amount paid at any given time to local governments from escrow accounts  and do not itemize the specific types of charges paid for, regardless of the  statement used.

While local government officials we spoke with  provided us with significant support in our research, some of the  information we asked for was either unavailable or impractical to obtain  due to format or volume. The main challenge we faced was that each of  the five local governments had over 100 taxing districts\u2014cities, townships,  school districts, special districts, etc.\u2014and gathering detailed information  for each district, such as how each district calculates the rate it charges,  was difficult and time-consuming.

However, they would still face similar challenges in  determining whether the amounts on their tax bills qualified as deductible.

For example, a taxpayer residing in the home owned by  his or her parent(s) could incorrectly claim the real-estate tax deduction  for the property. It is also common for first-time homebuyers to  improperly claim the full amount of real-estate taxes paid for the tax year,  even though the seller had paid a portion of these taxes.", "Examinations of the real-estate tax deduction usually take place as part of  a broader examination of inconsistent claims across the individual tax  return. In examining deductions on the Schedule A, IRS examiners have  found cases in which some taxpayers incorrectly include real-estate taxes  as personal-property taxes on Schedule A, sometimes deducting the same  tax charges as both personal-property taxes and real-estate taxes.  Furthermore, IRS examiners might find claims on other parts of the return  that prompt them to check the real-estate tax claimed on Schedule A, or  find overstated real-estate tax deductions on Schedule A that indicate  noncompliance elsewhere on the return. For instance, a taxpayer might  claim the real-estate tax deduction for multiple properties on Schedule A,  but fail to report any rental income earned from these properties on the  Schedule E form, which is used to report income or loss from rental  income. Also, a taxpayer might claim the total amount of real-estate  taxes paid on Schedule A, but improperly claim these taxes again as part  of the business expense deductions on the Schedule E or Schedule C  forms, or both. IRS guidance instructs taxpayers to deduct only real- estate taxes paid for their private residences on Schedule A, and to dedu any real-estate taxes paid on rental properties on Schedule E. If taxpaye use a part of their private residence as the principal place for conducting  business, they should divide the total real-estate taxes paid on the  property accordingly, with the portion of real-estate taxes paid for the  business deducted on Schedule C.", "As noted earlier, the format and the level of detail about charges on local  real-estate bills vary greatly across local governments. IRS examiners told  us that they do not focus on the deductibility of most real-estate charges  when auditing real-estate tax deductions because determining  deductibility from looking at such bills can take significant time and effort.  They also said that when they detect apparent nondeductible charges  claimed in the real-estate tax deduction, the amounts are usually small. As  a result, the examiners we interviewed generally contended that  determining the deductibility of every charge on a bill could be an  inefficient use of IRS resources.

Changing the tax code could affect both taxpayers who overstate and  those who understate their deductions.

If many taxpayers overstate  the deduction and the aggregate revenue loss is high enough, pursuing  options to reduce noncompliance would be more important. Conversely,  fewer taxpayers making errors and lower revenue losses might lead to a  decision to not pursue any options or only options that have minimal costs  and burdens. Ultimately, policymakers in concert with tax administrators  will have to judge whether concerns about noncompliance justify the  extent to which options, including those on which we make  recommendations, should be pursued to help taxpayers comply.", "Compliance could be measured in different ways, which could yield better  information at increasing cost. For example, IRS has research programs  that are designed to measure compliance. One option is to modify IRS\u2019s  National Research Program (NRP) studies that IRS planned to launch in  October 2007, which were designed to annually examine compliance on  about 13,000 individual tax returns. NRP staff could begin to collect  information through this annual study to compute how much of the overall  amount of noncompliance with claiming the real-estate tax deduction is  caused by taxpayers claiming nondeductible charges. If pursued, IRS  would need to consider how much additional time and money to invest in  its annual research to measure taxpayer compliance in claiming only  deductible charges in the real-estate tax deduction.

In the  absence of data, a simple illustration can provide context, recognizing that  taxpayer experiences would vary widely. To illustrate, if we use an IRS  estimate that roughly 43 million taxpayers claimed the real-estate tax  deduction in 2006, and assume that each taxpayer spent only 1 hour to  access and use information about charges on the bill to make  determinations about deductibility, then a total of 43 million taxpayer  hours would be used to calculate this deduction.

A barrier to any information  reporting is that 19 of the 20 local-government tax collectors that we  interviewed did not maintain records by a unique taxpayer identifier, such  as the SSN. For IRS to check compliance in claiming only deductible  charges, IRS would need an unambiguous way of matching the local data  to the federal data, which traditionally relies on the SSN. Local- government representatives said significant challenges could arise in  collecting and providing SSNs to IRS, given concerns about privacy, and  possible needed changes to state laws.", "Local-government representatives that we interviewed viewed information  reporting as having the highest costs and burdens of the options that we  discussed for providing additional information to taxpayers. One example  of a potentially high cost that local governments would incur is the cost  associated with computer reprogramming to enable them to report the  information. One way to reduce the costs for many local governments  would be to require information reporting for larger local governments  only or for those that have nondeductible charges on their real estate bills.

Along a continuum, this burden shifting could be major, such as through  information reporting, or fairly minor, such as through providing taxpayers  with better information or guidance to help them determine deductibility.  In either case, taxpayer compliance is likely to improve and the overall  compliance burden to society could possibly be lower to the extent that  IRS, local governments, and other third parties can reduce the costs of  overall compliance through economies of scale.", "Because the extent of the compliance problem is not known and some of  the options we identified could significantly increase local-government or  IRS burdens in order to achieve significant compliance gains, a sensible  starting point is options that impose less burden shifting. Providing  taxpayers better guidance on how to comply, including the information  sources they need to consider, is among the least burdensome and costly  means to address noncompliance with the real-estate tax deduction.  Because taxpayers still would have to exercise considerable effort to  comply fully, improved guidance may not materially reduce  noncompliance. Providing taxpayers somewhat better information, such  as real-estate bills that clearly identify ad-valorem and non-ad-valorem  charges would shift more burden to local governments, but likely would  have a larger effect on reducing noncompliance. Providing taxpayers  traditional information reports, that is, documents that clearly identify  federally tax deductible charges, would shift considerable burden to local  governments and possibly IRS, but also would considerably reduce  taxpayers\u2019 compliance burden and likely result in significant compliance  gains. If local governments, possibly with IRS assistance, could determine  deductibility for less cost than the sum of each taxpayer\u2019s costs in doing  so, the net compliance burden for society may go down even as  compliance increases.", "Significant reductions in noncompliance might also be achieved with  minimum shifting of burdens through targeted use of the identified options  for addressing noncompliance. Targeting, however, requires information  about localities where there are significant risks of taxpayers claiming  large nondeductible charges. If IRS learned which jurisdictions have the  largest dollar amounts of nondeductible charges on their bills, it could  take a number of targeted actions, such as outreach to the local  governments to help them determine deductible charges, targeted  outreach to taxpayers in those jurisdictions to help them correctly  compute the deduction, targeted outreach to the tax-preparation and  mortgage-servicer industries, and targeted examinations of the real-estate  tax deduction in these localities.

IRS also noted that determining  deductibility can be complex and that neither the local real-estate tax bills  nor mortgage service documents tell taxpayers what amounts are  deductible.", "IRS agreed with 7 of our 10 recommendations and identified actions to  implement them. Specifically, IRS agreed with 2 recommendations on  enhancing guidance to taxpayers, saying it would change various  publications to (1) highlight an alert to taxpayers to check for  nondeductible charges on their real-estate tax bills and (2) caution that the  bills may be insufficient evidence of deductibility.", "IRS also agreed with three recommendations on outreach to third parties  to ensure that taxpayers are getting the best information possible to  comply in claiming the real-estate tax deduction.

IRS  also said it would work with local governments to clarify charges on their  real-estate tax bills.", "Further, IRS agreed with two recommendations on learning more about  where noncompliance in claiming nondeductible charges is most likely  and then taking action to improve compliance. IRS agreed to identify a  cost-effective way to identify local governments that have potentially large  nondeductible charges on their real-estate tax bills. After identifying these  local governments, IRS also agreed to reach out to them to help determine  the deductibility of their charges and help the affected taxpayers correctly  claim the deduction. As part of this set of actions, IRS agreed to reach out  to the tax preparation and mortgage servicing industries with customers in  these localities.", "IRS disagreed with three recommendations. However, for one of the  recommendations, IRS did agree to take action consistent with the intent  of the recommendation. We recommended that IRS enhance its guidance  to taxpayers by providing information or a worksheet on steps taxpayers  could take to find out if any charges on a real-estate tax bill are  nondeductible. IRS said its Publication 17 already had a chart providing  guidance on which real-estate taxes can be deducted but agreed to add a  caution advising taxpayers that they must contact the taxing authority if  more information is needed on any charge. We believe such an action will  enhance IRS\u2019s current education efforts related to this issue and may help  improve taxpayer compliance, especially if the addition provides guidance  on situations in which a taxpayer may need to contact the taxing authority.", "The other two recommendations IRS disagreed with related to improving  IRS\u2019s guidance to its staff who audit the real-estate tax deduction. IRS did  not agree to revise the guidance to clarify that mortgage escrow  statements, cancelled checks, Forms 1098, and real-estate tax bills may  not be sufficient evidence of deductibility. IRS also did not agree that  examiners should ask taxpayers for evidence of deductibility whenever  they are auditing the deduction and believe that the taxpayers have  claimed nondeductible charges that are large, unusual, or questionable.  IRS said that the guidance for examiners is sufficient and that examiners  are to use their judgment and consider all available evidence in coming to  a determination.", "We appreciate that examiners must exercise judgment about the scope of  an audit. However, in reviewing over 100 examination files and in talking  with examiners, we found that not all examiners focus on the deductibility  of the real-estate charges or ask the taxpayer for adequate evidence of  deductibility, even in situations where deductibility may be in question.  Therefore, when examiners have reason to believe that taxpayers claimed  nondeductible charges that are large, unusual, or questionable, we  continue to believe they should ask taxpayers for adequate support. We  also continue to believe that the guidance to examiners should clearly  state that real-estate bills should be examined and that other information  on the nature and purpose of tax bill charges may also be needed. This  improved guidance may be especially pertinent when IRS has  implemented our recommendations to identify local governments with  large nondeductible charges on their bills and to take related actions to  help taxpayers comply. If IRS does targeted examinations of taxpayers in  those localities, the IRS examiners will need to clearly understand what  evidence is required to determine the deductibility of the various charges  on the real-estate bills to ensure that taxpayers are correctly claiming the  real-estate tax deduction.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its  issue date.

All of the local governments within the selected  county areas are included in the sample. The total number of local  governments included in the sample was 1,732. Before constructing our  sample, we checked to make sure that QPTS sample data provided to us  by the Census Bureau were internally consistent and reliable for our  purposes.", "In our survey, we asked the local governments whether they included non- ad-valorem charges on their real-estate tax bills, how they differentiated  non-ad-valorem charges from ad-valorem charges, and whether and how  they alerted taxpayers to the presence of non-ad-valorem charges on the  bills. We also asked the local governments for a sample residential real- estate tax bill that included information about all possible charges for  which property owners in that jurisdiction could be billed.", "We conducted two pretests of our draft survey instrument with officials  from Alexandria, Virginia, and Montgomery County, Maryland, to ensure  that (1) the survey did not place an undue burden on the respondent\u2019s  time, (2) the questions and terminology were clear and unambiguous, (3)  the respondents were able to obtain data necessary to answer the survey  questions, and (4) our method for requesting sample bills matched any  preferences offered by the respondents.", "In late April 2008, we mailed questionnaires to our survey sample  population using addresses of the local government entities provided to us  from the Census Bureau\u2019s Governments Division.

We took steps in the  development of the questionnaire, the data collection, and the data  analysis to minimize these nonsampling errors. For example, a social  science survey specialist helped us design the questionnaire. Then, as  stated earlier, the draft questionnaire was pretested with two local  jurisdictions.

Does the bill contain a disclaimer warning that some of the charges  included in the real-estate tax bill may not be deductible for federal tax  purposes?", "A bill met our first criterion if either of the following applied:    The bill differentiated by labeling each item as ad valorem or non\u2013ad  valorem.", "The bill provided millage rates for items.", "A bill met our second criterion if all of the line items were individually  broken out AND either of the following applied:    Line item descriptions were spelled out and clearly identified.

We restricted our analysis to these two  counties due to limitations in resources. While taxpayers can claim  deductions for real-estate taxes paid on multiple IRS schedules, we limited  our analysis to the amount claimed on IRS Form 1040, Schedule A, which  generally does not include deductions for real estate used for business  purposes.", "We used the SAS SQL procedure (PROC SQL) to merge the IRS data to the  tax-roll data we received from our two selected counties.

It is still possible that some duplicates  exist in the data, since the names and address fields were recorded in  disparate ways in the data we received from the counties. We used  programming logic to parse the names; due to the inconsistencies in the  names and address fields in the data, the name and address information  may not have parsed the same way for all taxpayers.", "For each taxpayer that we were able to match to the county data, we  compared the amount the taxpayer claimed as a real-estate tax deduction  on the Schedule A return to the total ad-valorem amount each taxpayer  was billed by the county and which was due in 2006. We then calculated  the difference between the amount claimed on Schedule A and the ad- valorem portion of the amount billed by the county for each taxpayer. As  indicated above, we worked with IRS to determine which charges billed by  the county were deductible under federal tax law. The counties we  selected for analysis did not maintain their tax data in a way that would  allow us to itemize all of the charges, particularly the ad-valorem charges,  on individuals\u2019 tax bills. As a result, we were not able to take into account  ad-valorem charges that may not be deductible in our lower-bound  computation of overstated real-estate tax deductions. Instead, we used the  ad-valorem portion of the amount billed as a proxy for the deductible  amount. While the proxy is imperfect, it is our understanding that the non- ad-valorem charges in our selected counties were not imposed at a  uniform rate and thus did not appear to be deductible as taxes under  Section 164 of the Internal Revenue Code. Given the limitations of the  data, this approach allowed us to take into account those charges that are  least likely to be deductible. Also, the approach produced a lower-bound  computation of potential noncompliance in our two counties. We can only  produce a lower-bound computation due to uncertainty of noncompliance  for those taxpayers where we could not match IRS and local records.", "To develop the lower-bound computations of potential noncompliance, we  excluded those taxpayers whose claimed deduction was greater than 1.15  times the total amount billed; this was chosen as a cutoff point to account  for taxpayers who may own multiple properties and therefore deduct on  their federal tax return a higher amount than is shown on the local tax  bills. We also excluded taxpayers whose claimed deduction was less than  the ad-valorem portion of the amount billed by the county (within a small  margin of error), since we did not have conclusive data to determine  whether the taxpayers held only a partial ownership in the real estate  covered by the local bill.", "We then summed the difference between the claimed Schedule A  deduction and the ad-valorem portion of the amount billed by the county  to develop a lower-bound computation of noncompliance for the  population of taxpayers in each county that we were able to match to the  county data.", "For the purposes of our analysis, we created two separate categories for  those taxpayers who claimed a deduction that was approximately equal to  the billed amount up to 1.15 times the total amount billed.
