DOD used similar processes in its excess capacity analyses conducted in 1998 and 2004. This process included three major steps: (1) categorizing bases according to their primary missions and defining indicators of capacity; (2) developing ratios of capacity-to-force structure for DOD's baseline year of 1989; and (3) aggregating the analysis from the installation level across the military services and department-wide.", "In both its 1998 and 2004 reports, DOD recognized some limitations with its methods for estimating excess capacity and stated that its analyses lacked the precision necessary to identify specific installations or functional configurations for realignment or closure. In addition, GAO's review of DOD's methods for estimating excess capacity outside of a congressionally-authorized BRAC process identified a number of limitations. First, DOD's approach assigns each installation to only one mission category, even though most installations support more than one mission. This approach effectively excluded significant portions of some bases' infrastructure from the analysis. Second, the services measured capacity for some similar functions differently such as test and evaluation facilities, which makes it difficult for DOD to evaluate excess capacity across the department. Third, DOD did not attempt to identify any excess capacity or capacity shortfall that existed in 1989; hence it is uncertain to what extent DOD's estimates of excess capacity may be overstated or understated. Finally, in instances where DOD's analysis indicated that projected capacity was less than needed capacity--indicating a capacity shortage--within an installation category, DOD treated these cases as having zero or no excess capacity when aggregating the results of its analysis. If DOD had treated those installation categories as having a capacity shortages, DOD's method would have calculated a lower number of bases and consequently a lower percentage of excess capacity across the department than DOD reported to Congress.", "DOD's testimony in March 2012 and again in March 2013, that it had about 20 percent excess capacity remaining after the end of BRAC 2005, relied on earlier calculations that the department made in 2004 and 2005. Specifically, these estimates were reached by subtracting DOD's estimate of the amount of capacity that would be eliminated by the approved recommendations from BRAC 2005--3 to 5 percent of plant replacement value--from DOD's 2004 estimate that it had 24 percent excess capacity. However, pre-BRAC estimates of the percentage of bases that may be excess to needed capacity, which is expressed as a percentage of bases, and plant replacement value, which is measured in dollars, are not comparable measures. In March 2013, the Acting Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations and Environment) testified that the method upon which DOD's current estimate is based is helpful in determining whether an additional BRAC round is justified, but only through the BRAC process is the Department able to determine specifically which installations or facilities are excess."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Due in part to challenges the Department of Defense (DOD) faces in  reducing excess and obsolete infrastructure, DOD\u2019s Support  Infrastructure Management is on GAO\u2019s High Risk List of program areas  that are vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or are  most in need of transformation.

The law established the  procedures for making recommendations for base closures and  realignments and originally required DOD to submit a 6-year force  structure plan and to base its closure and realignment decisions on that  plan, as well as on selection criteria proposed and established for the  round by DOD. For the 1991, 1993, and 1995 BRAC rounds, DOD  performed a detailed capacity analysis based on extensive data collection  efforts to identify specific bases capable of accommodating additional  forces in order to develop its proposed list of closures and realignments.

For example, to develop recommendations for the 2005  BRAC round, DOD collected an estimated 25 million pieces of capacity  and military value data from DOD databases and from hundreds of  defense installations. These data were certified as to their accuracy by  hundreds of persons in senior leadership positions across the country.  The DOD Inspector General and the services\u2019 audit agencies also played  an important role in ensuring that the data used in the BRAC analyses  were accurate. In our March 2013 report, Military Bases: Opportunities  Exist to Improve Future Base Realignment and Closure Rounds, we  provide a detailed assessment of that process.", "In Senate Report 112-173 accompanying the Senate Armed Services  Committee\u2019s version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2013, we were directed to review the systems and processes that  DOD uses to identify the extent to which bases or facilities are excess to  needs.

Since that time, the BRAC process has  changed in many ways, with a variety of requirements and procedures  mandated by subsequent BRAC statutes or adopted by DOD. Among  these is the requirement that the Secretary of Defense develop a current  force structure plan. DOD\u2019s force structure plan is designed to identify the  number and type of forces that DOD needs to combat the anticipated  threats to the security of the United States. As specified in DOD\u2019s force  structure plan in support of BRAC 2005, the President\u2019s National Security  Strategy and the Secretary of Defense\u2019s National Defense Strategy  provide the focus for the military forces. DOD then analyzes current and  future threats, challenges, and opportunities to develop the force structure  plan. DOD\u2019s planning framework helps determine the capabilities required  to respond to a range of scenarios. The Department then analyzes the  force requirements for the most likely, the most dangerous, and the most  demanding circumstances.", "One of the objectives of the first BRAC Commission was to review the  current and planned military base structure in light of force structure  assumptions and, using the process and the criteria the Commission  developed, to identify which bases should be realigned or closed. To  accomplish this, the Commission used a two-phase approach. Phase I  grouped bases into 22 overall categories, such as training bases and  administrative headquarters, and then focused on determining the military  value of bases within each category, each base\u2019s capacity to absorb  additional missions and forces, and the overall excess capacity within the  category. The Commission then ranked the bases to identify those  warranting review in phase II, which focused on assessing the cost and  savings of base realignment and closure options.", "The Defense Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1990 substantially  revised the process for DOD base closure and realignment actions within  the United States, establishing an independent Defense Base Closure  and Realignment Commission and providing for BRAC rounds in 1991,  1993, and 1995. One of the key elements of the 1990 BRAC statute was  the requirement that DOD submit a force structure plan and that closure  and realignment decisions be based on that force structure plan and on  the final selection criteria established for the BRAC round. As part of the  BRAC process for 1991, 1993, and 1995, an important step in the military  services\u2019 approach for identifying bases to close or realign was  determining whether excess capacity existed at their bases. The starting  point for this step was comparing changes in the force structure plan to  the base structure of the military services. After applying military value  criteria and other specific BRAC criteria, each of the services  developed their recommendations for closures and realignments for  submission to the BRAC Commission.", "In May 1997, the Secretary of Defense announced his intention to ask  Congress to authorize two additional BRAC rounds. Later that year,  Congress enacted section 2824 of the National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 1998, which required that the Secretary of Defense  provide the congressional defense committees with a comprehensive  report on a range of BRAC issues, including the need for any additional  BRAC rounds and an estimate of the amount of DOD\u2019s excess capacity.  DOD submitted the required report in April 1998 and estimated that DOD  had 23 percent excess capacity. In the report, DOD also stated that its  method for estimating excess capacity determined the extent to which  reductions in base structure had kept pace with reductions in force  structure since 1989.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 amended  the 1990 BRAC statute by authorizing a BRAC round for 2005, and  required DOD to report to Congress on several BRAC-related issues in  2004 in order for the 2005 round to proceed. The statute directed, among  other things, that the Secretary of Defense provide Congress with a 20- year force structure plan and a worldwide inventory of military installations  and facilities as part of DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2005 budget justification  documents. In addition, as part of the force structure plan and inventory  submission, the Secretary was to prepare (1) a description of the  infrastructure necessary to support the force structure described in the  force-structure plan, (2) a discussion of categories of excess  infrastructure and infrastructure capacity, and (3) an economic analysis of  the effect of the closure or realignment of military installations to reduce  excess infrastructure. DOD provided the required report, which estimated  that the department had 24 percent excess capacity, on March 23, 2004.  In that report, the Secretary of Defense also certified that an additional  round of BRAC was needed and that the round would result in savings by  fiscal year 2011.", "Subsequently, an initial part of DOD\u2019s BRAC recommendations  development process for the 2005 round involved an overall capacity  analysis of specific locations or functions and subfunctions at specific  locations. The analysis relied on data calls to obtain certified data to  assess such factors as maximum potential capacity, current capacity,  current usage, excess capacity, and capacity needed to meet surge  requirements. This capacity analysis\u2014in conjunction with the  department\u2019s 20-year force structure plan, military value analysis, and  transformational options; applicable guiding principles, objectives, or  policy imperatives identified by individual military services or joint cross- service groups; and military judgment\u2014was used to identify realignment  and closure scenarios for further analysis, ultimately leading to finalized  recommendations for base realignments and closures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Methods for Calculating Pre-BRAC Estimates of Excess Capacity Have Limitations", "paragraphs": ["Our review of DOD\u2019s pre-BRAC estimates of excess capacity found that  the methods DOD has used and the resulting estimates have limitations.  DOD used similar methods in 1998 and 2004 to calculate its pre-BRAC  estimates of excess capacity. However, our current review identified a  number of additional limitations with DOD\u2019s methods. For example,  DOD\u2019s approach assigns each installation to only one mission category,  even though most installations support more than one mission. In  addition, to arrive at the excess capacity estimate it provided to Congress  in 2012 and repeated in 2013, DOD subtracted an estimate of excess  capacity that it expected would be disposed of during the 2005 BRAC  round from the amount of excess capacity estimated to exist immediately  before that BRAC round to arrive at the current excess capacity estimate  of about 20 percent. However, because DOD\u2019s pre-BRAC excess  capacity estimate, expressed as a percentage of bases, and plant  replacement value, expressed in dollars, are not measured in the same  units, they are not comparable measures."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Method for Estimating Excess Capacity in 1998 and 2004", "paragraphs": ["DOD based its 1998 and 2004 estimates of 23 percent and 24 percent  excess capacity, respectively, on a method that compared measures of  force structure projected to be in place at the end of the 5-year Future  Years Defense Programs that were current at the time of each estimate,  to associated indicators of capacity. DOD\u2019s 1998 and 2004 technique  consisted of three major steps: (1) categorizing bases according to their  primary missions and defining indicators of capacity, (2) developing ratios  of capacity-to-force structure for DOD\u2019s baseline year of 1989, and (3)  aggregating these various excess capacity indicators that were calculated  at the installation level to the military service level and then department- wide.", "To begin DOD\u2019s analysis, each of the military services identified  categories for their bases, identified bases that the services considered  major installations, and categorized their bases according to their  primary missions\u2014such as depots, training, or administration\u2014so that  each installation was included in only one category. Figure 1 shows the  installation categories used by each military service and the Defense  Logistics Agency.", "Figure 1. Installation Categories for the Military Services and the Defense Logistics Agency.", "The services then defined various indicators of capacity\u2014such as  maneuver base acres or facility square feet\u2014for each installation  category.", "Next, DOD divided each services\u2019 indicators of capacity by a measure of  force structure\u2014such as the number of military and civilian personnel  authorized, authorized end strength, or the size of the acquisition  workforce\u2014to develop ratios of capacity-to-projected force structure and  compared them to ratios from 1989, which was used as a baseline. For its  1998 analysis DOD projected force structure through 2003, and for its  2004 analysis DOD projected force structure through 2009 because these  dates marked the end of DOD\u2019s Future Year\u2019s Defense Program  projections that were current at the time the analyses were performed.", "For example, as illustrated in Figure 2, in its 1998 capacity analysis, DOD  projected, that in 2003, there would be 6.575 million square feet of  administrative space on Army administrative bases, and DOD projected  that there would be 65,516 military and civilian personnel assigned to  those bases, resulting in a capacity-to-force structure ratio of 100.4.  Similarly, according to its 2004 capacity analysis, DOD projected that, in  2009, there would be 6.121 million square feet of administrative space on  Army administrative bases, and DOD projected that there would be  64,598 military and civilian personnel assigned to those bases, resulting  in a capacity-to-force structure ratio of 94.8.", "DOD then calculated the extent to which the ratio of capacity-to-force  structure for each base category differed from the ratio in 1989, which  was used as a baseline. To do this, DOD first calculated an estimate of  capacity it would need for the year in question for each of its various  indicators of capacity. For instance, to continue with the second example  above, DOD calculated an estimate of administrative capacity the Army  would need for 2009. As illustrated in Figure 3, DOD calculated its  needed capacity indicators by multiplying the projected 2009 force  structure measure (64,598 military and civilian personnel in this case) by  the 1989 capacity-to-force ratio (81.3 for Army administrative bases),  which in this case resulted in an estimated needed capacity of 5.25  million square feet of Army administrative space.", "To calculate the projected excess capacity for 2009, DOD subtracted a  base category\u2019s estimated needed capacity from its projected 2009  capacity. In our Army administrative base example, DOD subtracted its  estimated needed capacity for 2009 of 5.25 million square feet from its  estimated existing capacity in 2009 of 6.12 million square feet, which  resulted in DOD\u2019s estimate of 0.87 million square feet of excess Army  administrative space or 14 percent of the Army\u2019s existing administrative  space in 2009.", "After computing these indicators of excess capacity for each category of  installation for each military service and the Defense Logistics Agency,  DOD then aggregated these indicators departmentwide. Specifically,  DOD first multiplied the number of bases in a category by the percentage  of excess for that category, which resulted in DOD\u2019s estimate of the  number of excess bases in each category. Continuing our Army  administrative capacity example above, as illustrated in Figure 4, the  percentage of excess capacity (in this case, the Army\u2019s estimated 14- percent excess of projected administrative space in 2009) would be  multiplied by the number bases in the category (12 in the case of Army  administrative bases), resulting in an estimated number of excess  administrative bases (1.7 in this case).", "As illustrated in Figure 5, to calculate an overall indication of excess  capacity for each DOD component, DOD summed the estimated number  of excess bases for each installation category within a component (22.3 in  the case of the Army) and divided this by the sum of the number of all  bases in all categories for that component (78 in the case of the Army),  which resulted in a percentage of excess bases for the component. In our  example, DOD estimated that 29 percent of the Army\u2019s bases were in  excess to its estimated needed capacity.", "Finally, the departmentwide excess was calculated by summing the  estimated number of excess bases for each military service and the  Defense Logistics Agency (65.2), summing the number of bases included  in the analysis (276), then dividing the sum of the excess bases by the  total number of bases in the analysis, resulting in estimated department- wide excess of 24 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Methods DOD Used to Estimate Excess Capacity in 1998 and 2004 Have Limitations", "paragraphs": ["DOD recognized some limitations within its method for estimating excess  capacity, stating in both its 1998 and 2004 reports to Congress that the  analysis it performed provided an indication of the type and amount of  excess capacity within the department, but recognizing that the analyses  lacked the precision to identify specific installations or functional  configurations for realignment or closure. In addition, our current review of  DOD\u2019s method for estimating excess capacity outside of a  congressionally-authorized BRAC process identified a number of  limitations.", "First, DOD assigned each base to only one installation category, even  though most bases support more than one mission. This approach  effectively excluded significant portions of a base\u2019s infrastructure from the  analysis. For example, in the case of Army maneuver bases, using base  acres as the indicator of capacity does not include about 204 million  square feet of buildings located on the 12 Army maneuver bases in  DOD\u2019s analysis. Another limitation associated with DOD\u2019s method is that  the services measured capacity for some similar functions differently. For  example, the Army and Air Force measured capacity for test and  evaluation facilities in terms of physical total square feet of space, while  the Navy measured its capacity for these facilities in terms of work years.  These differences make it difficult for DOD to assess excess capacity  across the department. A third limitation is that, in using 1989 as a  baseline, DOD assumed that the bases and facilities as they existed in  1989 were appropriately sized to support missions, and DOD did not  identify any excess capacity or capacity shortfall that may have existed at  that time. This approach, in essence, transfers any excesses and  shortfalls that existed in 1989 into DOD\u2019s estimates of future capacity  needs because, as illustrated in Figure 3 above, the capacity-to-force  structure ratio from 1989 was used to calculate the needed capacity for  2009. It is therefore uncertain to what extent DOD\u2019s estimates of excess  capacity are overstated or understated. Finally, in both the 1998 and 2004  analyses, in instances where DOD\u2019s analysis indicated that projected  capacity was less than needed capacity\u2014indicating a capacity  shortage\u2014within a specific installation category, DOD treated these  cases as having zero or no excess capacity. Despite the data showing  capacity shortages, DOD used this data to aggregate the results of its  analysis across the department. If DOD had treated those installation  categories as having capacity shortages, DOD\u2019s estimates would have  resulted in a lower number of excess bases and consequently a lower  percentage of excess capacity across the department than DOD reported  to Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Statements about Remaining Excess Capacity in 2012 and 2013 Relied on Two Earlier Calculations", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s testimony in March 2012 and March 2013, that by its estimates  DOD had about 20 percent excess capacity remaining after the end of  BRAC 2005, relied on earlier calculations that the department made in  2004 and 2005. First, in 2004, using the method described above, the  department estimated that it had 24 percent excess capacity. Then, in  2005, DOD\u2019s report transmitting its recommendations to the BRAC  Commission stated that, while it is difficult to measure the full extent of  the improvements in effectiveness and efficiency of the BRAC 2005  recommendations, four statistics would illustrate the breadth and depth of  the effect of its proposed actions. One of those statistics was the  department\u2019s projection that DOD\u2019s plant-replacement value would be  reduced by 5 percent. After the BRAC Commission reviewed DOD\u2019s  recommendations and made some changes, including reducing the  number of closures at major installations, DOD revised its estimate of  the expected percentage reduction in plant-replacement value and  projected that it would likely be around 3 percent. In 2012, the Deputy  Under Secretary of Defense (Installations and Environment) said that  these estimates from 2004 and 2005 suggested that roughly 20 percent  excess capacity remained.
