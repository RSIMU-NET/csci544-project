Most of these interactions with taxpayers occur during the January through April tax filing season.

The 2004 budget request, like other recent requests, identifies compliance as one of IRS's top priorities for additional resources. IRS intends to fund some program enhancements from the requested budget increase and internal savings. Several factors, including lowered savings projections since the budget request was prepared, raise questions about IRS's ability to achieve all the savings and shift resources to compliance as planned. IRS's recent history raises the same questions, in part, because unbudgeted expenses, such as pay raises, have absorbed budget increases. IRS is requesting $2.1 billion in information technology. This includes $429 million for the agency's multiyear capital account that funds contractor costs for the Business Systems Modernization program, and $1.67 billion for information systems, primarily for operations and maintenance. In response to GAO's recommendation last year, IRS has begun to implement an information technology management process patterned after its systems modernization program. Until the process is fully implemented, IRS will have limited ability to develop supportable information systems budget requests. IRS's 2003 filing season performance has improved over last year. For example, IRS's telephone access has improved and the Web site has seen increased use. Such improvements represent a payoff from IRS's ongoing systems modernization investments and wider management improvements. Although IRS has not succeeded in reallocating staff to one of its priority needs, compliance, there will likely be increased potential for such reallocation as modernization proceeds. This will present Congress, in its oversight and appropriations roles, with significant opportunities to weigh in on IRS's overall strategy for better accomplishing its mission."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to participate in the Subcommittee\u2019s inquiry into Internal  Revenue Service\u2019s (IRS) fiscal year 2004 budget request and 2003 tax filing  season performance.", "With its mission to \u201cprovide America\u2019s taxpayers with top quality service by  helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities and by  applying the tax law with integrity and fairness to all,\u201d IRS is responsible  for collecting most of the funds that pay for the federal government.

This effort was  originally projected to save 222 FTEs and $14.6 million. According to  IRS officials, these functions will not be delivered on time due to  schedule delays. IRS officials have not determined the impact of this  delay and are currently assessing other potential approaches to achieve  savings in this area.", "IRS officials said the remaining three of the seven most significant efforts  will achieve all or more of their projected savings. For example, the effort  to improve the efficiency of handling payments and returns, originally  projected to save 121 FTEs and $4.6 million, is now expected to have more  than double the savings, or 235 FTEs and $11.9 million, due to greater than  expected productivity. However, according to IRS officials, even when their  savings are combined, these three efforts will not save enough to offset the  reduced savings from the other four.", "Reengineering efforts may not achieve all of their savings goals, in part,  because of the long time lag between when IRS begins developing its  budget request and when the fiscal year begins. As with most other federal  agencies, IRS usually begins formulating its budget request about 18  months before the start of the fiscal year and about 10 months before the  President submits his budget to Congress.

In September 2002, the Commissioner attributed the  decline in compliance staffing to increases in workload in other essential  operations such as processing returns, issuing refunds, and answering  taxpayer mail. In the most recently completed fiscal year, 2002, IRS faced  unbudgeted cost increases, such as rent and pay increases, in the amount  of about $106 million. As a result, IRS had to delay hiring revenue agents  and officers, tax compliance officers, and tax specialists. As shown in  appendix I, in 2002 figure 2 shows about 69 percent of IRS\u2019s spending was  for labor costs.

As part of its 2003 budget request, IRS identified internal savings of  almost $197 million and 2,287 FTEs to be accomplished through various  reengineering efforts and workload decreases. IRS planned to reinvest  those savings in higher priority areas\u2014compliance and customer service  program enhancements, including efforts to stabilize audit rates, improve  telephone assistance level of service, and target highest priority collection  cases. However, IRS now estimates that about $75 million, or 38 percent, of  the dollar savings and about 1,280, or 56 percent, of the FTE savings will be  achieved by the specific reengineering efforts and workload decreases as  identified in the 2003 budget request. IRS officials provided several reasons  why some savings for these particular reengineering efforts will not be  realized, including delays in modernization projects and less-than- anticipated workload decreases. For example, IRS received more innocent  spouse cases than anticipated, and the cases received were more complex,  causing the hours spent per case to increase.", "While savings associated with a particular effort listed in the 2003 budget  request may not materialize, IRS officials said that business unit managers  have identified other ways to increase productivity and did more work with  fewer staff\u2014therefore achieving productivity increases through efforts not  identified in the 2003 budget request. As an example, officials provided an  analysis showing increased telephone collections cases closed with  significantly fewer staff than in the previous year.

For  example, when we typed \u201cearned income tax credit\u201d into the forms and  publication search function, Publication 596\u2014the primary publication on  the earned income tax credit\u2014was the 70th item on the list, and we had to  scroll through seven pages to find it.

At congressional direction, the TIGTA has been responsible for  measuring the quality of assistance at IRS\u2019s walk-in sites. According to  TIGTA officials, the accuracy of tax law assistance provided at IRS\u2019s walk- in sites increased as of February this year to about 73 percent\u2014an increase  of 27 percentage points over the same period last year. TIGTA also found  that the rate at which IRS employees referred taxpayers to a publication  instead of answering tax law questions\u2014which had been an issue last  year\u2014declined by about 85 percent.", "According to TIGTA officials, the increased accuracy rates resulted from  various steps taken by IRS, including revising to the guidelines used by  walk-in staff, certifying staff proficiency, conducting monthly reviews of  tax law accuracy, and taking immediate action to address review  information relating to any incorrect answers or improper referrals found  during IRS or TIGTA quality reviews.", "As table 1 shows, more taxpayers had their returns prepared by  community-based coalitions and other organizations that provide free tax  return-preparation assistance as part of IRS\u2019s Volunteer Income Tax  Assistance and Tax Counseling for the Elderly programs. These programs  use IRS-trained volunteers to help prepare basic tax returns for taxpayers  with special needs\u2014including those with a low to fixed income, non- English speaking people, and the elderly."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["As the examples of improved telephone access and the Brookhaven  Processing Center closing show, IRS is beginning to realize payoffs from  the ongoing systems modernization investments and wider management  improvements. Although IRS has not succeeded in reallocating staff to one  of its priority needs, compliance, there will likely be increased potential for  such reallocation as modernization proceeds. This will present Congress, in  its oversight and appropriations roles, with significant opportunities to  weigh in on IRS\u2019s overall strategy for better accomplishing its mission.  Specifically, Congress will have opportunities to help IRS establish  strategic priorities and make decisions about the resources needed to meet  those priorities.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement, and I would be  pleased to respond to any questions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "How IRS Allocated Expenditures and Staff Resources in Fiscal Year 2002", "paragraphs": ["To provide some context for understanding the 2004 budget request, figures  2 and 3 illustrate how the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allocated  expenditures and staff resources in fiscal year 2002, the most recently  completed year. Figure 2 shows IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2002 actual expenditures  in several categories, including about 69 percent that was spent on labor.  Figure 3 shows how IRS allocated its labor across functional areas,  including ensuring compliance such as auditing and collecting delinquent  taxes (45 percent), providing taxpayer services such as telephone  assistance (21 percent), and processing tax returns (15 percent). However,  the boundaries between categories may not be as well defined as the  figures indicate. For example, in figure 3, staff categorized as maintaining  information systems could also be considered under support for  processing, taxpayer service or compliance. Therefore, the figures are  meant to provide a summary of how IRS uses its resources and should be  interpreted with caution."], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
