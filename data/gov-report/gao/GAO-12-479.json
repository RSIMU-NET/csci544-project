The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 requires DOD to submit to the congressional defense committees an annual report on DOD\u0092s electronic warfare strategy for each of fiscal years 2011 through 2015. DOD issued its fiscal year 2011 and 2012 strategy reports to Congress in October 2010 and November 2011, respectively. GAO found that DOD\u0092s reports addressed two key characteristics: (1) purpose, scope, and methodology and (2) problem definition and risk assessment. However, DOD only partially addressed four other key characteristics of a strategy, including (1) resources, investments, and risk management and (2) organizational roles, responsibilities, and coordination. For example, the reports identified mechanisms that could foster coordination across the department and identified some investment areas, but did not fully identify implementing parties, delineate roles and responsibilities for managing electronic warfare across the department, or link resources and investments to key activities. Such characteristics can help shape policies, programs, priorities, resource allocation, and standards in a manner that is conducive to achieving intended results and can help ensure that the department is effectively managing electronic warfare.", "DOD has taken steps to address a critical electronic warfare management gap, but it has not established a departmentwide governance framework for electronic warfare. GAO previously reported that effective and efficient organizations establish objectives and outline major implementation tasks. In response to a leadership gap for electronic warfare, DOD is establishing the Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum Control Center under U.S. Strategic Command as the focal point for joint electronic warfare. However, because DOD has yet to define specific objectives for the center, outline major implementation tasks, and define metrics and timelines to measure progress, it is unclear whether or when the center will provide effective departmentwide leadership and advocacy for joint electronic warfare. In addition, key DOD directives providing some guidance for departmentwide oversight of electronic warfare have not been updated to reflect recent changes. For example, DOD\u0092s primary directive concerning electronic warfare oversight was last updated in 1994 and identifies the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics as the focal point for electronic warfare. The directive does not define the center\u0092s responsibilities in relation to the office, including those related to the development of the electronic warfare strategy and prioritizing investments. In addition, DOD\u0092s directive for information operations, which is being updated, allocates electronic warfare responsibilities based on the department\u0092s previous definition of information operations, which had included electronic warfare as a core capability. DOD\u0092s oversight of electronic warfare capabilities may be further complicated by its evolving relationship with computer network operations, which is also an information operations-related capability. Without clearly defined roles and responsibilities and updated guidance regarding oversight responsibilities, DOD does not have reasonable assurance that its management structures will provide effective departmentwide leadership for electronic warfare activities and capabilities development and ensure effective and efficient use of its resources."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD should (1) include in its future electronic warfare strategy reports to Congress certain key characteristics, including performance measures, key investments and resources, and organizational roles and responsibilities; (2) define objectives and issue an implementation plan for the Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum Control Center; and (3) update key departmental guidance to clearly define oversight roles, responsibilities, and coordination for electronic warfare management, and the relationship between electronic warfare and cyberspace operations.

DOD has committed  billions of dollars developing, maintaining, and employing warfighting  capabilities that rely on access to the electromagnetic spectrum\u2014 including precision-guided munitions and command, control, and  communications systems. DOD ensures control of the electromagnetic  spectrum through the coordinated implementation of joint electromagnetic  spectrum operations, which includes electronic warfare and spectrum  management activities, with other lethal and nonlethal operations that  enable freedom of action in the electromagnetic operational environment.  Electronic warfare, which is the use of electromagnetic energy and  directed energy to control the electromagnetic spectrum or to attack the  enemy, is essential for protection of friendly operations and denying  adversary operations within the electromagnetic spectrum throughout the  operational environment. As we previously reported, DOD\u2019s investments  are projected to total more than $17.6 billion from fiscal years 2007  through 2016 for the development and procurement of new and updated  fixed-wing airborne electronic attack systems alone, which are one  element of electronic warfare.", "According to DOD, the U.S. military\u2019s access to and use of the  electromagnetic spectrum is facing rapidly evolving challenges and  increased vulnerabilities due to the increasing quality and availability of  electronic warfare capabilities to both state and non-state actors. Also,  DOD has reported that electronic warfare capabilities, which play a critical  and potentially growing role as an enabler for military operations, are  currently stressed and will remain so in the future. Moreover, according to  DOD, near-peer competitors, primarily Russia and China, have fully  recognized the critical nature of electromagnetic spectrum control in  military operations. There also has been recognition among near-peer  competitors of the relationship between electronic warfare and  cyberspace operations, which includes computer network operations.  For example, as noted in the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review  Commission\u2019s 2009 report to Congress, China\u2019s Integrated Network  Electronic Warfare concept incorporates elements of cyberspace  operations in tandem with elements of traditional electronic warfare, and  advocates for the employment of traditional electronic warfare  operations\u2014such as the jamming of radars and communications  systems\u2014in coordination with cyberspace attack operations.", "DOD has identified persistent electronic warfare capability gaps, and  these shortfalls have been consistently highlighted by the combatant  commands as some of their highest warfighting priorities. According to a  Center for Strategic and International Studies report, the U.S. Strategic  Command identified 34 capability gaps affecting electronic warfare,  including a lack of leadership across the department. This lack of leadership was identified as the most critical gap. In our recent report on  DOD\u2019s airborne electronic attack capabilities, we found that DOD is  developing multiple systems which provide similar capabilities, and that  the lack of leadership may undermine DOD\u2019s ability to consolidate these  systems. Specifically, we found that all four military services within the  Department of Defense are separately acquiring new airborne electronic  attack systems, but that opportunities may exist to consolidate some  current service-specific acquisition efforts. With the prospect of slowly  growing or flat defense budgets for years to come, the department must  get better returns on its weapon system investments and find ways to  deliver more capability to the warfighter for less than it has in the past.  Therefore, we recommended that the Secretary of Defense conduct  program reviews for certain new, key systems; determine the extent to  which the most pressing capability gaps can be met and take steps to fill  them; align service investments in science and technology with the  departmentwide electronic warfare priority; and review the capabilities  provided by certain existing and planned systems to ensure investments  do not overlap.

For example, the directive does not reflect the  establishment of the JEMSCC under Strategic Command.", "DOD Directive 3600.01 (Information Operations)\u2014Issued in 2006 and  revised in May 2011, this directive provides the department with a  framework for oversight of information operations, which was defined  as the integrated employment of the core capabilities of electronic  warfare, computer network operations, military information support  operations (formerly referred to as psychological operations), military  deception, and operations to influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp  adversarial human and automated decision making while protecting  that of the United States. However, the definition of oversight  responsibilities for information operations has changed, and these  changes have not yet been reflected in DOD Directive 3600.01.", "DOD Directive 3222.4 has not been updated to reflect the responsibilities  for electronic warfare assigned to Strategic Command. Both the  December 2008 and April 2011 versions of the Unified Command Plan  assigned Strategic Command responsibility for advocating for joint  electronic warfare capabilities. Similarly, the directive has not been updated to reflect the establishment of the JEMSCC and its associated  electronic warfare responsibilities. Specifically, the directive does not  acknowledge that JEMSCC has been tasked by Strategic Command as  the primary focal point for electronic warfare; rather, the directive  designates the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology,  and Logistics as the focal point for electronic warfare within DOD. As a  result, it is unclear what JEMSCC\u2019s roles and responsibilities are in  relation to those of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology, and Logistics. For example, it\u2019s unclear what JEMSCC\u2019s role  will be regarding development of future iterations of the DOD\u2019s electronic  warfare strategy report to Congress, which is currently produced by the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics. Also it is unclear what role, if any, the JEMSCC will have in  prioritizing electronic warfare investments. Moreover, the directive has not  been updated to reflect the Secretary of Defense\u2019s memorandum issued  in January 2011, which assigned individual capability responsibility for  electronic warfare and computer network operations to Strategic  Command.", "DOD Directive 3600.01 provides both the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics and the Under Secretary of  Defense for Intelligence with responsibilities that aid in the oversight of  electronic warfare within DOD. However, pursuant to the Defense  Secretary\u2019s January 2011 memo, the directive is under revision to  accommodate changes in roles and responsibilities. Under the current  version of DOD Directive 3600.01, the Under Secretary of Defense for  Intelligence is charged with the role of Principal Staff Advisor to the  Secretary of Defense for information operations. The Principal Staff  Advisor is responsible for, among other things, the development and  oversight of information operations policy and integration activities as well  as the coordination, oversight, and assessment of the efforts of DOD  components to plan, program, develop, and execute capabilities in  support of information operations requirements. Additionally, the current  Directive 3600.01 identifies the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics as responsible for establishing  specific policies for the development of electronic warfare as a core  capability of information operations.", "Under the requirements of DOD acquisition policy, the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics regularly collects cost,  schedule, and performance data for major programs.the cost information of electronic warfare systems are reported as distinct  programs, while in other cases, some electronic warfare systems are  subcomponents of larger programs, and cost information is not regularly  collected for these separate subsystems. Additionally, the Under  Secretary\u2014in coordination with the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force\u2014is  developing an implementation road map for electronic warfare science  and technology. The road map is supposed to coordinate investments  across DOD to accelerate the development and delivery of capabilities.  The road map is expected to be completed in late summer of 2012.", "The Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum in January 2011 that  prompted DOD officials to begin revising DOD Directive 3600.01.

According to the memorandum, the Principal Staff  Advisor is to serve as the single point of fiscal and program accountability  for information operations. However, according to DOD officials, this  accountability oversight covers only the integration of information  operations-related capabilities and does not cover the formerly defined  core capabilities of information operations, including electronic warfare  and computer network operations. For example, DOD officials stated that  the Principal Staff Advisor for information operations would maintain  program accountability where information operations-related capabilities  were integrated but would not maintain program accountability for all  information-related capabilities. However, the memorandum does not  clearly describe the specific responsibilities of the Principal Staff Advisor  for information operations.", "The Secretary\u2019s memorandum directed the Under Secretary of Defense  for Policy, together with the Undersecretary of Defense (Comptroller) and  Director of Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation, to continue to work to  develop standardized budget methodologies for information operations- related capabilities and activities. However, these budget methodologies  would capture only data related to information operations. For example,  according to Under Secretary of Defense for Policy officials, they do not  collect or review electronic warfare financial data, but may review this  data in the future to determine if it relates to integrated information  operations efforts. Officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Policy stated that DOD Directive 3600.01 was under revision  to reflect these and other changes as directed by the Secretary\u2019s  memorandum. Until the underlying directive is revised, there may be  uncertainty regarding which office has the authority to manage and  oversee which programs.

According to DOD, to ensure all aspects  of electronic warfare can be developed and integrated to achieve  electromagnetic spectrum control, electronic warfare must be clearly and  distinctly defined in its relationship to information operations (to include  computer network operations) and the emerging domain of cyberspace.  In the previous section, we noted that DOD\u2019s directives do not clearly  define the roles and responsibilities for the oversight of electronic warfare  in relation to the roles and responsibilities for information operations. The  current DOD Directive 3600.01 does not clearly specify what  responsibilities the Principal Staff Advisor has regarding the integration of  information operations-related capabilities\u2014specifically the integration of  electronic warfare capabilities with computer network operations.", "Further, DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2011 electronic warfare strategy report to  Congress, which delineated its electronic warfare strategy, stated that the  strategy has two, often co-dependent capabilities: traditional electronic  warfare and computer network attack, which is part of cyberspace  operations. Moreover, according to DOD officials, the relationship  between electronic warfare and cyberspace operations\u2014including  computer network attack\u2014is still evolving, which is creating both new  opportunities and challenges. There will be operations and capabilities  that blur the lines between cyberspace operations and electronic warfare  because of the continued expansion of wireless networking and the  integration of computers and radio frequency communications. According  to cognizant DOD officials, electronic warfare capabilities may permit use  of the electromagnetic spectrum as a maneuver space for cyberspace  operations. For example, electronic warfare capabilities may serve as a  means of accessing otherwise inaccessible networks to conduct  cyberspace operations; presenting new opportunities for offensive action  as well as the need for defensive preparations.", "Current DOD doctrine partially describes the relationship between  electronic warfare and cyberspace operations. Specifically, current joint  doctrine for electronic warfare, which was last updated in February 2012,  states that since cyberspace requires both wired and wireless links to  transport information, both offensive and defensive cyberspace  operations may require use of the electromagnetic spectrum for the  enabling of effects in cyberspace. Due to the complementary nature and  potential synergistic effects of electronic warfare and computer network  operations, they must be coordinated to ensure they are applied to  maximize effectiveness. When wired access to a computer system is  limited, electromagnetic access may be able to successfully penetrate the  computer system. For example, use of an airborne weapons system to  deliver malicious code into cyberspace via a wireless connection would  be characterized as \u201celectronic warfare-delivered computer network  attack.\u201d In addition, the doctrine mentions that electronic warfare  applications in support of homeland defense are critical to deter, detect,  prevent, and defeat external threats such as cyberspace threats.", "DOD has not yet published specific joint doctrine for cyberspace  operations, as we previously reported. things, that DOD establish a time frame for deciding whether to proceed  with a dedicated joint doctrine publication on cyberspace operations and  update existing cyber-related joint doctrine.

Such information could then inform the  further development of doctrine. U.S. Cyber Command officials stated  that they have participated in regular meetings with representatives from  the military services, the National Security Agency, defense research  laboratories, and others, to discuss the relationship of electronic warfare  and cyberspace operations.

In the absence of a  strategy that fully addresses these and other key elements, the DOD  components and military services responsible for implementing this  strategy, evaluating progress, and ensuring accountability may lack the  guidance necessary to prioritize their activities and establish milestones  that are necessary to achieve intended results within a reasonable time  frame. Moreover, as a result, DOD may not be effectively managing its  electronic warfare programs and activities or using its resources  efficiently. For example, an effective strategy could help DOD reduce the  potential for unnecessary overlap in the airborne electronic attack  acquisition activities on which we have previously reported.", "The military\u2019s increasing reliance on the electromagnetic spectrum\u2014 coupled with a fiscally constrained environment and critical gaps in  electronic warfare management\u2014highlights the need for an effective  governance framework for managing and conducting oversight of the  department\u2019s electronic warfare activities. The absence of such a  framework can exacerbate management challenges, including those  related to developing and implementing an effective strategy and  coordinating activities among stakeholders. Without additional steps to  define the purpose and activities of the JEMSCC, DOD lacks reasonable  assurance that this center will provide effective departmentwide  leadership for electronic warfare capabilities development and ensure the  effective and efficient use of its resources. As we previously reported,  DOD acknowledges a leadership void that makes it difficult to ascertain  whether the current level of investment is optimally matched with the  existing capability gaps. Leveraging resources and acquisition efforts  across DOD\u2014not just by sharing information, but through shared  partnerships and investments\u2014can simplify developmental efforts,  improve interoperability among systems and combat forces, and could  decrease future operating and support costs. Such successful outcomes  can position the department to maximize the returns it gets on its  electronic warfare investments. In addition, multiple organizations are  involved with electronic warfare and outdated guidance regarding  management and oversight may limit the effectiveness of their activities.  Both the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics and the JEMSCC have been identified as the focal point for  electronic warfare within the department, yet it is unclear what each  organization\u2019s roles and responsibilities are in relation to one another.  Further, each organization\u2019s management responsibilities related to future  iterations of the electronic warfare strategy report to Congress and  working with the military services to prioritize investments remain unclear.  Updating electronic warfare directives and policy documents to clearly  define oversight roles and responsibilities for electronic warfare\u2014 including any roles and responsibilities related to managing the  relationship between electronic warfare and information operations or  electronic warfare and cyberspace operations, specifically computer  network operations\u2014would help ensure that all aspects of electronic  warfare can be developed and integrated to achieve electromagnetic  spectrum control."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve DOD\u2019s management, oversight, and coordination of electronic  warfare policy and programs, we recommend that the Secretary of  Defense take the following three actions:", "Direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology,  and Logistics, in coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense for  Policy and Strategic Command, and others, as appropriate, to include  at a minimum the following information in the fiscal years 2013  through 2015 strategy reports for electronic warfare:", "Performance measures to guide implementation of the strategy  and help ensure accountability.

The characteristics GAO previously identified are: (1) purpose,  scope, and methodology; (2) problem definition and risk assessment;   (3) goals, subordinate objectives, activities, and performance measures;  (4) resources, investments, and risk management; (5) organizational  roles, responsibilities, and coordination; and (6) integration and  implementation. While these characteristics were identified in our past  work as desirable components of national-level strategies, we determined  that they also are relevant to strategies of varying scopes, including  defense strategies involving complex issues. For example, identifying  organizational roles, responsibilities, and coordination mechanisms is key  to allocating authority and responsibility for implementing a strategy.  Further, goals, objectives, and performance measures provide concrete  guidance for implementing a strategy, allowing implementing parties to  establish priorities and milestones, and providing them with the flexibility  necessary to pursue and achieve those results within a reasonable time  frame.
