Although the underlying conditions remain fundamentally unchanged, within the past 2 years DOD has begun a number of initiatives intended to address previously reported problems and transform its business operations. The Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support, Senate Committee on Armed Services, asked GAO to provide a current status report on DOD's progress to date and suggestions for improvement. Specifically, GAO was asked to provide (1) an overview of the impact of financial and related business weaknesses on DOD operations, (2) the underlying causes of DOD business transformation challenges, and (3) the status of DOD reform efforts. In addition, GAO reiterates the key elements to successful reform: (1) an integrated business transformation strategy, (2) sustained leadership and resource control, (3) clear lines of responsibility and accountability, (4) results-oriented performance, (5) appropriate incentives and consequences, (6) an enterprise architecture to guide reform efforts, and (7) effective monitoring and oversight.

However, overhauling the financial management and related business operations of one of the largest and most complex organizations in the world represents a huge management challenge. Six DOD program areas are on GAO's \"high risk\" list, and the department shares responsibility for three other governmentwide high-risk areas. DOD's substantial financial and business management weaknesses adversely affect not only its ability to produce auditable financial information, but also to provide timely, reliable information for management and Congress to use in making informed decisions. Further, the lack of adequate transparency and appropriate accountability across all of DOD's major business areas results in billions of dollars in annual wasted resources in a time of increasing fiscal constraint. Four underlying causes impede reform: (1) lack of sustained leadership, (2) cultural resistance to change, (3) lack of meaningful metrics and ongoing monitoring, and (4) inadequate incentives and accountability mechanisms. To address these issues, GAO reiterates the keys to successful business transformation and makes two additional suggestions for legislative action. First, GAO suggests that a senior management position be established to spearhead DOD-wide business transformation efforts. Second, GAO proposes that the leaders of DOD's functional areas, referred to as domains, receive and control the funding for system investments, as opposed to the military services. Domain leaders would be responsible for managing business system and process reform efforts within their business areas and would be accountable to the new senior management official for ensuring their efforts comply with DOD's business enterprise architecture."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["It is a pleasure to be back again to discuss financial management and  related business transformation efforts at the Department of Defense  (DOD). At the outset, I would like to thank the Subcommittee for having  this hearing and acknowledge the important role hearings such as this one  serve in providing a catalyst for business transformation at DOD. The  involvement of this Subcommittee is critical to ultimately assuring public  confidence in DOD as a steward that is accountable for its finances. DOD\u2019s  substantial long-standing financial and business management problems  adversely affect the economy, effectiveness, and efficiency of its  operations, and have resulted in a lack of adequate transparency and  appropriate accountability across all major business areas. As a result,  DOD does not have timely, reliable information for management to use in  making informed decisions. Further, as our reports continue to show,  these problems result in significant fraud, waste, and abuse and hinder  DOD\u2019s attempts to develop world-class operations and activities to  support its forces. Of the 25 areas on GAO\u2019s governmentwide \u201chigh risk\u201d  list, 6 are DOD program areas, and the department shares responsibility  for 3 other high-risk areas that are governmentwide in scope. The  problems we continue to identify relate to human capital challenges,  ineffective internal control and processes, and duplicative and stovepiped  business systems. The seriousness of DOD\u2019s financial management  weaknesses underscores the importance of no longer condoning \u201cstatus  quo\u201d business operations at DOD.", "Although the underlying operational conditions remain fundamentally  unchanged since I last testified before this Subcommittee in March 2002,  DOD has taken action to begin addressing a number of these challenges as  part of its business transformation effort. Business transformation has  been a priority of Secretary Rumsfeld. For example, DOD has been  granted additional human capital flexibilities and is in the process of  developing a new personnel management system for its civilian  employees. In addition, through its Business Management Modernization  Program (BMMP), DOD is continuing its efforts to develop and implement  a business enterprise architecture and establish effective management and  control over its business system modernization investments. To date,  however, tangible evidence of improvements in DOD business operations  remains limited to specific business process areas, such as DOD\u2019s  purchase card program, where improvements have generally resulted from  increased management focus and better internal control rather than from  major modifications to automated systems. It is important to note that  some of the key elements I highlight in this testimony as necessary for  successful business transformation were critical to the success of several  narrowly defined initiatives that I will discuss today.", "Because DOD is one of the largest and most complex organizations in the  world, overhauling its financial management and related business  operations represents a huge management challenge. In fiscal year 2003,  DOD reported that its operations involved over $1 trillion in assets, nearly  $1.6 trillion in liabilities, approximately 3.3 million military and civilian  personnel, and disbursements of over $416 billion. Moreover, execution of  DOD operations spans a wide range of defense organizations, including  the military services and their respective major commands and functional  activities, numerous large defense agencies and field activities, and  various combatant and joint operational commands that are responsible  for military operations for specific geographic regions or theaters of  operations. To execute these military operations, the department performs  an assortment of interrelated and interdependent business process areas,  including logistics management, procurement, healthcare management,  and financial management. Secretary Rumsfeld has estimated that  successful improvements to DOD\u2019s business operations could save the  department 5 percent of its budget a year. Using DOD\u2019s reported fiscal  year 2004 budget amounts, this percentage would equate to approximately  $22 billion a year in savings.", "Two years ago, I testified on the challenges DOD faces in transforming its  financial management and related business operations and systems and I  discussed several key elements necessary for reform to succeed. If the  past has taught us anything, it is that addressing the department\u2019s serious  financial and related business process weaknesses will not be easy. For  several years, we have reported on DOD\u2019s efforts to improve the  effectiveness and efficiency of its business operations and actions needed  to achieve and sustain reform. Many of the same underlying causes, such  as lack of sustained leadership, cultural resistance to change,  parochialism, and stovepiped operations, that impeded the success of  previous administrations in addressing DOD\u2019s problems continue today. If  DOD is unable to address these underlying causes that have resulted in the  failure of previous broad-based reform efforts, improvements will remain  marginal, confined to narrowly defined business process areas and  incremental improvements in human capital policies, business processes,  internal control systems, and information technologies.", "Today, I will provide my perspectives on (1) the impact that long-standing  financial management and related business process weaknesses continue  to have on DOD\u2019s business operations, (2) underlying causes that have  impeded the success of prior efforts, (3) keys to successful reform, and   (4) the status of current DOD business transformation efforts. In addition,  I will offer two suggestions for legislative consideration, which I believe  will provide the sustained top-level leadership and accountability  necessary for the overall business transformation effort to succeed. My  statement is based on previous GAO reports as well as on our review of  the work of other DOD auditors and recent DOD reports and studies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Impact of Financial Management and Related Business Process Weaknesses", "paragraphs": ["As I previously stated, and we have reported on for several years, DOD  faces a range of financial management and related business process  challenges that are complex, long-standing, pervasive, and deeply rooted  in virtually all business operations throughout the department. As I  recently testified and as discussed in our latest financial audit report,  DOD\u2019s financial management deficiencies, taken together, continue to  represent the single largest obstacle to achieving an unqualified opinion on  the U.S. government\u2019s consolidated financial statements. To date, none of  the military services has passed the test of an independent financial audit  because of pervasive weaknesses in internal control and processes and  fundamentally flawed business systems.", "In identifying improved financial performance as one of its five  governmentwide initiatives, the President\u2019s Management Agenda  recognized that obtaining a clean (unqualified) financial audit opinion is a  basic prescription for any well-managed organization. At the same time, it  recognized that without sound internal control and accurate and timely  financial and performance information, it is not possible to accomplish the  President\u2019s agenda and secure the best performance and highest measure  of accountability for the American people. The Joint Financial  Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) principals have defined  certain measures, in addition to receiving an unqualified financial  statement audit opinion, for achieving financial management success.  These additional measures include (1) being able to routinely provide  timely, accurate, and useful financial and performance information,   (2) having no material internal control weaknesses or material  noncompliance with laws and regulations, and (3) meeting the  requirements of the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of  1996 (FFMIA). Unfortunately, DOD does not meet any of these conditions.  For example, for fiscal year 2003, the DOD Inspector General issued a  disclaimer of opinion on DOD\u2019s financial statements, citing 11 material  weaknesses in internal control and noncompliance with FFMIA  requirements.", "Recent audits and investigations by GAO and DOD auditors continue to  confirm the existence of pervasive weaknesses in DOD\u2019s financial  management and related business processes and systems. These problems  have (1) resulted in a lack of reliable information needed to make sound  decisions and report on the status of DOD activities, including  accountability of assets, through financial and other reports to Congress  and DOD decision makers, (2) hindered its operational efficiency,   (3) adversely affected mission performance, and (4) left the department  vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse. For example,    450 of the 481 mobilized Army National Guard soldiers from six GAO case  study Special Forces and Military Police units had at least one pay  problem associated with their mobilization. DOD\u2019s inability to provide  timely and accurate payments to these soldiers, many of whom risked  their lives in recent Iraq or Afghanistan missions, distracted them from  their missions, imposed financial hardships on the soldiers and their  families, and has had a negative impact on retention. (GAO-04-89, Nov. 13,  2003)", "DOD incurred substantial logistical support problems as a result of weak  distribution and accountability processes and controls over supplies and  equipment shipments in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom activities,  similar to those encountered during the prior gulf war. These weaknesses  resulted in (1) supply shortages, (2) backlogs of materials delivered in  theater but not delivered to the requesting activity, (3) a discrepancy of  $1.2 billion between the amount of materiel shipped and that  acknowledged by the activity as received, (4) cannibalization of vehicles,  and (5) duplicate supply requisitions. (GAO-04-305R, Dec. 18, 2003)", "Inadequate asset visibility and accountability resulted in DOD selling new  Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST)\u2014the  current chemical and biological protective garment used by our military  forces\u2014on the internet for $3 each (coat and trousers) while at the same  time buying them for over $200 each. DOD has acknowledged that these  garments should have been restricted to DOD use only and therefore  should not have been available to the public. (GAO-02-873T, June 25, 2002)", "Inadequate asset accountability also resulted in DOD\u2019s inability to locate  and remove over 250,000 defective Battle Dress Overgarments (BDOs)\u2014 the predecessor of JSLIST\u2014from its inventory. Subsequently, we found  that DOD had sold many of these defective suits to the public, including  379 that we purchased in an undercover operation. In addition, DOD may  have issued over 4,700 of the defective BDO suits to local law enforcement  agencies. Although local law enforcement agencies are most likely to be  the first responders to a terrorist attack, DOD failed to inform these  agencies that using these BDO suits could result in death or serious injury.

This condition was a result  of inaccurate ship configuration records and incomplete, outdated, or  erroneous historical parts demand data. Such problems not only have a  detrimental impact on mission readiness, they may also increase  operational costs due to delays in repairing equipment and holding  unneeded spare parts inventory. (GAO-03-887, Aug. 29, 2003)", "DOD sold excess biological laboratory equipment, including a biological  safety cabinet, a bacteriological incubator, a centrifuge, and other items  that could be used to produce biological warfare agents. Using a fictitious  company and fictitious individual identities, we were able to purchase a  large number of new and usable equipment items over the Internet from  DOD. Although the production of biological warfare agents requires a high  degree of expertise, the ease with which these items were obtained  through public sales increases the risk that terrorists could obtain and use  them to produce biological agents that could be used against the United  States. (GAO-04-81TNI, Oct. 7, 2003)", "Based on statistical sampling, we estimated that 72 percent of the over  68,000 premium class airline tickets DOD purchased for fiscal years 2001  and 2002 was not properly authorized and that 73 percent was not  properly justified. During fiscal years 2001 and 2002, DOD spent almost  $124 million on premium class tickets that included at least one leg in  premium class\u2014usually business class. Because each premium class  ticket cost the government up to thousands of dollars more than a coach  class ticket, unauthorized premium class travel resulted in millions of  dollars of unnecessary costs being incurred annually. (GAO-04-229T,   Nov. 6, 2003)", "Some DOD contractors have been abusing the federal tax system with  little or no consequence, and DOD is not collecting as much in unpaid  taxes as it could. Under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996,  DOD is responsible\u2014working with the Treasury Department\u2014for  offsetting payments made to contractors to collect funds owed, such as  unpaid federal taxes. However, we found that DOD had collected only  $687,000 of unpaid taxes over the last 6 years. We estimated that at least  $100 million could be collected annually from DOD contractors through  effective implementation of levy and debt collection programs. (GAO-04- 95, Feb. 12, 2004)", "DOD continues to lack a complete inventory of contaminated real  property sites, which affects not only DOD\u2019s ability to assess the potential  environmental impact and to plan, estimate costs, and fund cleanup  activities, as appropriate, but also its ability to minimize the risk of civilian  exposure to unexploded ordnance. The risk of such exposure is expected  to grow with the increase in development and recreational activities on  land once used by the military for munitions-related activities (e.g., live  fire testing and training). (GAO-04-147, Dec. 19, 2003)", "DOD\u2019s Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command working capital fund  activities used accounting entries to manipulate the amount of customer  orders for the sole purpose of reducing the actual dollar amounts reported  to Congress for work that had been ordered and funded (obligated) by  customers but not yet completed by fiscal year end. As a result,  congressional and DOD decision makers did not have the reliable  information they needed to make decisions regarding the level of funding  to be provided to working capital fund customers.

According to DOD, the cost of researching and making adjustments to  accounting records was about $34 million in fiscal year 2002, primarily to  pay hundreds of DOD and contractor staff. (GAO-03-727, Aug. 8, 2003)", "DOD and congressional decision makers lack reliable data upon which to  base sourcing decisions due to weaknesses in DOD\u2019s data-gathering,  reporting, and financial systems. As in the past, we have identified  significant errors and omissions in the data submitted to Congress  regarding the amount of each military service\u2019s depot maintenance work  out-sourced or performed in-house. As a result, both DOD and Congress  lack assurances that the dollar amounts of public-private sector workloads  reported by military services are reliable. (GAO-03-1023, Sept. 15, 2003)", "DOD\u2019s information technology (IT) budget submission to Congress for  fiscal year 2004 contained material inconsistencies, inaccuracies, or  omissions that limited its reliability. For example, we identified  discrepancies totaling about $1.6 billion between two primary parts of the  submission\u2014the IT budget summary report and the detailed Capital  Investments Reports on each IT initiative. These problems were largely  attributable to insufficient management attention and limitations in  departmental policies and procedures, such as guidance in DOD\u2019s  Financial Management Regulations, and to shortcomings in systems that  support budget-related activities. (GAO-04-115, Dec. 19, 2003)", "Since the mid 1980s, we have reported that DOD uses overly optimistic  planning assumptions to estimate its annual budget request. These same  assumptions are reflected in its Future Years Defense Program, which  reports projected spending for the current budget year and at least 4  succeeding years. In addition, in February 2004 the Congressional Budget  Office projected that DOD\u2019s demand for resources would grow to about  $473 billion a year by fiscal year 2009. DOD\u2019s own estimate for that same  year was only $439 billion. As a result of DOD\u2019s continuing use of  optimistic assumptions, DOD has too many programs for the available  dollars, which often leads to program instability, costly program stretch- outs, and program termination. Over the past few years, the mismatch  between programs and budgets has continued, particularly in the area of  weapons systems acquisition. For example, in January 2003, we reported  that the estimated costs of developing eight major weapons systems had  increased from about $47 billion in fiscal year 1998 to about $72 billion by  fiscal year 2003. (GAO-03-98, January 2003)", "DOD did not know the size of its security clearance backlog at the end of  September 2003 and had not estimated a backlog since January 2000.  Using September 2003 data, we estimated that DOD had a backlog of  roughly 360,000 investigative and adjudicative cases, but the actual  backlog size is uncertain. DOD\u2019s failure to eliminate and accurately assess  the size of its backlog may have adverse affects. For example, delays in  updating overdue clearances for personnel doing classified work may  increase national security risks and slowness in issuing new clearances  can increase the costs of doing classified government work. (GAO-04-344,  Feb. 9, 2004)", "These examples clearly demonstrate not only the severity of DOD\u2019s  current problems, but also the importance of reforming financial  management and related business operations to improve mission support  and the economy and efficiency of DOD\u2019s operations, and to provide for  transparency and accountability to Congress and American taxpayers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Underlying Causes of Financial and Related Business Process Transformation Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The underlying causes of DOD\u2019s financial management and related  business process and system weaknesses are generally the same ones I  outlined in my prior testimony before this Subcommittee 2 years ago. For  each of the problems cited in the previous section, we found that one or  more of these causes were contributing factors. Over the years, the  department has undertaken many initiatives intended to transform its  business operations departmentwide and improve the reliability of  information for decision making and reporting but has not had much  success because it has not addressed the following four underlying causes:    a lack of sustained top-level leadership and management accountability for    deeply embedded cultural resistance to change, including military service  parochialism and stovepiped operations;   a lack of results-oriented goals and performance measures and  inadequate incentives and accountability mechanisms relating to business  transformation efforts.", "If not properly addressed, these root causes will likely result in the failure  of current DOD initiatives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lack of Sustained Leadership and Adequate Accountability", "paragraphs": ["DOD has not routinely assigned accountability for performance to specific  organizations or individuals who have sufficient authority to accomplish  desired goals. For example, under the Chief Financial Officers Act of  1990, it is the responsibility of the agency Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to  establish the mission and vision for the agency\u2019s future financial  management and to direct, manage, and provide oversight of financial  management operations. However, at DOD, the Comptroller\u2014who is by  statute the department\u2019s CFO\u2014has direct responsibility for only an  estimated 20 percent of the data relied on to carry out the department\u2019s  financial management operations. The other 80 percent comes from DOD\u2019s  other business operations and is under the control and authority of other  DOD officials.", "In addition, DOD\u2019s past experience has suggested that top management  has not had a proactive, consistent, and continuing role in integrating daily  operations for achieving business transformation related performance  goals. It is imperative that major improvement initiatives have the direct,  active support and involvement of the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of  Defense to ensure that daily activities throughout the department remain  focused on achieving shared, agencywide outcomes and success. While  the current DOD leadership, such as the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, and  Comptroller have certainly demonstrated their commitment to reforming  the department, the magnitude and nature of day-to-day demands placed  on these leaders following the events of September 11, 2001, clearly affect  the level of oversight and involvement in business transformation efforts  that these leaders can sustain. Given the importance of DOD\u2019s business  transformation effort, it is imperative that it receive the sustained  leadership needed to improve the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness  of DOD\u2019s business operations. Based on our surveys of best practices of  world-class organizations, strong executive CFO and Chief Information  Officer leadership is essential to (1) making financial management an  entitywide priority, (2) providing meaningful information to decision  makers, (3) building a team of people that delivers results, and   (4) effectively leveraging technology to achieve stated goals and  objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cultural Resistance and Parochialism", "paragraphs": ["Cultural resistance to change, military service parochialism, and  stovepiped operations have all contributed significantly to the failure of  previous attempts to implement broad-based management reforms at  DOD. The department has acknowledged that it confronts decades-old  problems deeply grounded in the bureaucratic history and operating  practices of a complex, multifaceted organization. Recent audits reveal  that DOD has made only small inroads in addressing these challenges. For  example, the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2003 requires the DOD Comptroller to determine that each financial  system improvement meets the specific conditions called for in the act  before DOD obligates funds in amounts exceeding $1 million. However,  we found that most system improvement efforts were not reviewed by the  DOD Comptroller, as required, and that DOD continued to lack a  mechanism for proactively identifying system improvement initiatives. We  asked for, but DOD did not provide, comprehensive data for obligations in  excess of $1 million for business system modernization. Based on the  limited information provided, we found that as of December 2003,  business system modernization efforts with reported obligations totaling  over $479 million were not referred to the DOD Comptroller for review for  fiscal years 2003 and 2004.", "In addition, in September 2003, we reported that DOD continues to use a  stovepiped approach to develop and fund its business system investments.

DOD\u2019s ability to address its current \u201cbusiness-as- usual\u201d approach to business system investments is further hampered by its  lack of (1) a complete inventory of business systems (a condition we first  highlighted in 1998), (2) a standard definition of what constitutes a  business system, (3) a well-defined enterprise architecture, and (4) an  effective approach for controlling financial system improvements before  making obligations exceeding $1 million.

Traditionally, DOD has  focused on justifying its need for more funding rather than on the  outcomes its programs have produced. DOD has historically measured its  performance by the amount of money spent, people employed, or number  of tasks completed.

Despite DOD\u2019s acknowledgement that many of its  systems are error prone, duplicative, and stovepiped, DOD continues to  allow its component organizations to make their own investment  decisions, following different approaches and criteria. These stovepiped  decision-making processes have contributed to the department\u2019s current  complex, error-prone environment of approximately 2,300 systems. In  March 2003, we reported that ineffective program management and  oversight, as well as a lack of accountability, resulted in DOD continuing  to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in system modernization efforts  without any assurance that the projects will produce operational  improvements commensurate with the amount invested. For example,  the estimated cost of one of the business system investment projects that  we reviewed increased by as much as $274 million, while its schedule  slipped by almost 4 years. After spending $126 million, DOD terminated  that project in December 2002, citing poor performance and increasing  costs. GAO and the DOD Inspector General (DOD IG) have identified  numerous business system modernization efforts that cost more than  planned, take years longer than planned, and fall short of delivering  planned or needed capabilities. Despite this track record, DOD continues  to increase spending on business systems while at the same time it lacks  the effective management and oversight needed to achieve real results.

Effective human capital  strategies are necessary for any business transformation to succeed at  DOD. For several years, we have reported  that many of DOD\u2019s business  process and control weaknesses were attributable in part to human capital  issues. Recent audits of DOD\u2019s military payroll and the individually billed  travel card program further highlight the adverse impact that outdated and  inadequate human capital practices, such as insufficient staffing, training,  and monitoring of performance, continue to have on DOD business  operations.", "I strongly support the need for modernizing federal human capital policies  both within DOD and for the federal government at large. We have found  that a critical success factor for overall organizational transformation is  the use of a modern, effective, credible, and integrated performance  management system to define responsibility and assure accountability for  achieving desired goals and objectives. Such a performance management  system can help manage and direct the transformation process by linking  performance expectations to an employee\u2019s role in the transformation  process. GAO has found that there are significant opportunities to use the  performance management system to explicitly link senior executive  expectations for performance to results-oriented goals. There is a need to  hold senior executives accountable for demonstrating competencies in  leading and facilitating change and fostering collaboration both within and  across organizational boundaries to achieve results. Setting and meeting  expectations such as these will be critical to achieving needed  transformation changes. Simply put, DOD must convince people  throughout the department that they must change business-as-usual  practices or they are likely to face serious consequences, personally and  organizationally. DOD has already applied this principle at the Defense  Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). For example, DFAS managers\u2014 and sometimes staff\u2014are rated and rewarded based on their ability to  reach specific annual performance goals. But linking employee pay to the  achievement of measurable performance goals must be done within the  context of a credible human capital system that includes adequate  safeguards.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004  authorized  DOD to establish a National Security Personnel System for its civilian  employees that is modern, flexible, and consistent with the merit  principles outlined by the act. This legislation requires DOD to develop a  human capital system that is consistent with many of the practices that we  have laid out for an effective human capital system, including a modern  and results-oriented performance management system. However, in our  opinion, DOD does not yet have the necessary institutional infrastructure  in place within its organization to support an effective human capital  transformation effort. This institutional infrastructure must include, at a  minimum,    a human capital planning process that integrates the department\u2019s human  capital policies, strategies, and programs for both civilian (including  contractors) and military personnel, with its program goals, mission, and  desired outcomes; the capabilities to effectively develop and implement a new human capital  system, and   a modern, effective, credible, and hopefully validated performance  management system that includes a set of adequate safeguards, including  reasonable transparency and appropriate accountability mechanisms, to  ensure the fair, effective, and credible implementation of the system.", "The results of our review of DOD\u2019s strategic human capital planning  efforts along with the use of human capital flexibilities and related human  capital efforts across government underscore the importance of such an  institutional infrastructure in developing and effectively implementing new  personnel authorities. In the absence of this critical element, the new  human capital authorities will provide little advantage and could actually  end up doing damage if not properly implemented.", "As DOD develops regulations to implement its new civilian personnel  system, the department needs to do the following.", "Ensure the active involvement of the Office of Personnel Management  (OPM) in the development process, given the significant implications that  changes in DOD regulations may have on governmentwide human capital  policies.", "Ensure the involvement of civilian employees and unions in the  development of a new personnel system. The law calls for DOD to involve  employees, especially in the design of its new performance management  system. Involving employees in planning helps to develop agency goals  and objectives that incorporate insights about operations from a front-line  perspective. It can also serve to increase employees\u2019 understanding and  acceptance of organizational goals and improve motivation and morale.", "Use a phased approach to implementing the system in recognition that  different parts of the organization will have different levels of readiness  and different capabilities to implement new authorities. Moreover, a  phased approach allows for learning so that appropriate adjustments and  midcourse corrections can be made before the regulations are fully  implemented departmentwide. In this regard, DOD has indicated that it  plans to implement its new human capital system for 300,000 civilian  employees by October 1, 2004. It is highly unlikely that DOD will have  employed an appropriate process and implemented an appropriate  infrastructure to achieve this objective.", "It is worth mentioning here that the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) is also currently developing a new human capital system. DHS is  using a collaborative process that facilitates participation from all levels of  DHS, and directly involves OPM. We found that the DHS process to date  has generally reflected the important elements of a successful  transformation, including effective communication and employee  involvement. In addition, DHS plans to implement the job evaluation, pay,  and performance management system in phases to allow time for final  design, training, and careful implementation. I believe that DOD could  benefit from employing a more inclusive process and phased  implementation approach similar to the process used by DHS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Business Management Modernization Program", "paragraphs": ["Another broad-based initiative that is vital to the department\u2019s efforts to  transform DOD business operations is the BMMP, which the department  established in July 2001. The purpose of the BMMP is to oversee  development and implementation of a departmentwide business enterprise  architecture (BEA), transition plan, and related efforts to ensure that DOD  business system investments are consistent with the architecture. A well- defined and properly implemented business enterprise architecture can  provide assurance that the department invests in integrated  enterprisewide business solutions and, conversely, can help move  resources away from nonintegrated business system development efforts.  As we reported in July 2003, within 1 year DOD developed an initial  version of its departmentwide architecture for modernizing its current  financial and business operations and systems. Thus far, DOD has  expended tremendous effort and resources and has made important  progress towards complying with legislative requirements. However,  substantial work remains before the architecture will begin to have a  tangible impact on improving DOD\u2019s overall business operations. I cannot  overemphasize the degree of difficulty DOD faces in developing and  implementing a well-defined architecture to provide the foundation that  will guide its overall business transformation effort.", "On the positive side, during its initial efforts to develop the architecture,  the department established some of the architecture management  capabilities advocated by best practices and federal guidance, such as  establishing a program office, designating a chief architect, and using an  architecture development methodology and automated tool. Further,  DOD\u2019s initial version of its BEA provides a foundation on which to build  and ultimately produce a well-defined business enterprise architecture.  For example, in September 2003, we reported that the \u201cAs Is\u201d  descriptions within the BEA include an inventory of about 2,300 systems  in operation or under development and their characteristics. The \u201cTo Be\u201d  descriptions address, to at least some degree, how DOD intends to operate  in the future, what information will be needed to support these future  operations, and what technology standards should govern the design of  future systems.", "While some progress has been made, DOD has not yet taken important  steps that are critical to its ability to successfully use the enterprise  architecture to drive reform throughout the department\u2019s overall business  operations. For example, DOD has not yet defined and implemented the  following.", "Detailed plans to extend and evolve its initial architecture to include the  missing scope and detail required by the Bob Stump National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 and other relevant architectural  requirements. Specifically, (1) the initial version of the BEA excluded  some relevant external requirements, such as requirements for recording  revenue, and lacked or provided little descriptive content pertaining to its  \u201cAs Is\u201d and \u201cTo Be\u201d environments and (2) DOD had not yet developed the  transition plan needed to provide a temporal road map for moving from  the \u201cAs Is\u201d to the \u201cTo Be\u201d environment.", "An effective approach to select and control business system investments  for obligations exceeding $1 million.

Under the leadership of Comptroller Zakheim, DOD is  working to instill discipline into its financial reporting processes to  improve the reliability of the department\u2019s financial data. Resolution of  serious financial management and related business management  weaknesses is essential to achieving any opinion on the DOD consolidated  financial statements. Pursuant to the requirements in section 1008 of the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002, DOD has  reported for the past 3 years on the reliability of the department\u2019s financial  statements, concluding that the department is not able to provide adequate  evidence supporting material amounts in its financial statements.  Specifically, DOD stated that it was unable to comply with applicable  financial reporting requirements for (1) property, plant, and equipment  (PP&E), (2) inventory and operating materials and supplies, (3)  environmental liabilities, (4) intragovernmental eliminations and related  accounting entries, (5) disbursement activity, and (6) cost accounting by  responsibility segment. Although DOD represented that the military  retirement health care liability data had improved for fiscal year 2003, the  cost of direct health care provided by DOD-managed military treatment  facilities was a significant amount of DOD\u2019s total recorded health care  liability and was based on estimates for which adequate support was not  available. DOD has indicated that by acknowledging its inability to  produce reliable financial statements, as required by the act, the  department saves approximately $23 million a year through reduction in  the level of resources needed to prepare and audit financial statements.  However, DOD has set the goal of obtaining a favorable opinion on its  fiscal year 2007 departmentwide financial statements. To this end, DOD  components and agencies have been tasked with addressing material line  item deficiencies, in conjunction with the BMMP.
