Consistent with the first principle, the Air Force involved top senior leaders, UAS pilots, and stakeholders to develop a plan to resolve its UAS pilot shortages\u2014including reassigning UAS workload to Air National Guard units and supporting training and operations with contractors. The Air Force partially applied the second principle to tailor its strategy to address gaps, or shortages, in UAS pilots, such as by using temporary personnel. As of March 2016, 37 percent of the personnel filling UAS pilot positions are temporarily assigned manned-aircraft pilots. Air Force headquarters personnel stated that no other career field in the Air Force relies on temporarily assigned personnel to this extent. Without tailoring its strategy to provide more permanently assigned pilots, the Air Force risks losing the experience that temporarily assigned manned-aircraft pilots have acquired. The Army partially applied the second principle because its strategy is not fully tailored to address its shortages in unit training. The Army experienced training shortfalls\u201461 of 73 UAS units flew fewer than half of the 340-flight-hour per unit annual minimum training goal in fiscal year 2015. A Senior Army official acknowledged the continued training shortfalls was a concern for the Army. Without revising its strategy to address the remaining training shortfalls, the Army risks that its UAS units may continue to train at levels below Army goals.", "The Air Force and the Army have not evaluated their workforce mix\u2014that is the mix of military, federal civilian, and private sector contractor personnel\u2014to determine the extent to which these personnel sources could be used to fly UAS. Furthermore, although neither the Air Force nor the Army have evaluated how and to what extent federal civilians could be used as UAS pilots, both services are using private sector contractors to fly some UAS. Without evaluating their workforce mix, the Air Force and the Army do not have information on alternatives for meeting UAS pilot personnel requirements to meet mission needs. In addition, although the Air Force and the Army deci use private sector contractors to meet mission needs, they did not conduct cost analyses to inform this decision. Without such an analysis, the Air Force and the Army may not be using the most cost-effective workforces to achieve UAS missions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO's 11 recommendations include that the Air Force tailor its strategy to address UAS pilot shortages; the Army revise its strategy to address UAS training shortfalls; and that both services evaluate their workforce mix for UAS pilot positions and conduct analysis to ensure cost effectiveness of workforce decisions.

In response to the  increased demand for UAS, over the last 8 years the Air Force has more  than quadrupled the number of UAS pilots that it requires, from about  400 in 2008 to close to 1,650 in 2016. However, the Air Force has faced  challenges meeting its UAS pilot requirements. The Commanding  General of the Air Force\u2019s Air Combat Command testified before the  Senate Armed Services Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Airland in March  2016 that the Air Force had a shortage of about 200 UAS pilots.  Meanwhile, the Army has faced a different challenge in managing its UAS  pilot workforce\u2014keeping the UAS pilots trained. A March 2015 Army  review found that UAS mishaps were occurring at a rate higher than for  other types of Army aircraft and Army officials stated that training  shortfalls had contributed to these mishaps.", "The Air Force and the Army primarily rely on military servicemembers to  serve as UAS pilots, although both services augment their UAS pilot  workforce with contractors. In the last 2 decades, Air Force and Army  UAS platform capabilities and missions have evolved.", "For example, the Air Force initially used the MQ-1 Predator to perform  intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions before adding weapons to the Predator and acquiring the MQ-9 Reaper, which can  perform strikes, combat search and rescue, and close air support, among  other missions and tasks.", "We have previously reported on the challenges that the Air Force and the  Army have faced managing their UAS pilot workforce. In April 2014, we  found that the Air Force had UAS pilot shortages and as a result its UAS  pilots had experienced a high work load and had limited time for training  and development activities. We recommended, among other things, that  the Air Force use feedback from UAS pilots to develop its approach to  managing challenges related to the recruiting, retention, training, and  development of UAS pilots, and that the Air Force evaluate the viability of  using enlisted or federal civilian personnel as UAS pilots. The Air Force  generally concurred with the seven recommendations we made in 2014  and has implemented two of them. In addition, while data show that the  Army did not face shortages between fiscal years 2012 and 2015, in May  2015 we reported that the Army unit status reports did not require UAS  pilot training information, and thus the Army did not know the extent to  which pilots had been trained and were ready to deploy. We  recommended that the Army require unit status reports to include UAS  pilot readiness information, among other things. The Army concurred with  this recommendation as well as with one additional recommendation and  has taken action to address them since we issued our report, but the  Army has not fully implemented these recommendations. Further in  March 2016, we testified that the Air Force and the Army had taken steps  in response to our recommendations that made in the April 2014 and May  2015 reports but that further action was needed to fully address these  workforce challenges. See appendix I for the status of actions taken on  the recommendations that we made in the April 2014 and May 2015  reports.", "A Senate report accompanying a bill for the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 included a provision for us to  review the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) personnel strategies for  UAS. This report assesses the extent to which the Air Force and the  Army have (1) applied key principles of effective strategic human capital  planning in the actions taken to address challenges with managing UAS  pilots and (2) evaluated the workforce mix to meet UAS pilot  requirements.", "For our first objective, we compared criteria that we previously developed  on key principles of effective strategic human capital planning with actions  the Air Force and the Army have taken to address challenges that each  has faced with managing the UAS pilot workforce. In our prior work, we  found that strategic human capital planning is an important component of  an agency\u2019s effort to develop long-term strategies for acquiring,  developing, and retaining staff needed for an agency to achieve its goals  and of an agency\u2019s effort to align human capital activities with the  agency\u2019s current and emerging mission. Specifically, we have found that  an agency\u2019s efforts to conduct strategic human capital planning should be  characterized by five key principles: (1) involving top senior leaders,  employees, and other stakeholders in developing, communicating, and  implementing strategic workforce plans; (2) developing strategies tailored  to address gaps in critical skills and competencies that need attention; (3)  monitoring and evaluating progress toward meeting workforce planning  goals; (4) building the capability needed to address administrative,  educational, and other requirements important to supporting workforce  strategies; and (5) determining the critical skills and competencies  needed to achieve goals.", "To identify the extent to which the Air Force and the Army have applied  these key principles in actions to address challenges with managing UAS  pilots, we reviewed Air Force and Army documentation related to those  services\u2019 challenges and the actions taken to address those challenges.  These documents include data on the number of required and actual UAS  pilots in the Air Force for fiscal year 2016, Air Force data on the number  of personnel filling UAS pilot instructor positions as of July 2016, Air  Force data on the number of hours that UAS pilots and manned-aircraft  pilots fly on average per year from fiscal year 2015. These documents  also included Army data on the number of personnel filling UAS pilot  positions as of May 2016 and the average number of training hours  completed by certain UAS units for fiscal year 2013 through the third  quarter of fiscal year 2016. We assessed the reliability of these data by  reviewing related documentation and interviewing agency officials  knowledgeable about the data. We determined that these data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives. We  determined that the services \u201capplied\u201d a key principle for strategic human  capital planning when their actions generally demonstrated the  characteristics specified in the principle; we determined that the services  \u201cpartially applied\u201d a key principle for strategic human capital planning  when their actions explicitly demonstrated at least one characteristic of  the principle; and we determined that the services did \u201cnot apply\u201d a key  principle for strategic human capital planning when their actions did not  demonstrate any characteristics of the principle.", "For our second objective, we compared Air Force and Army efforts to  determine the type of personnel to use for UAS pilots positions to criteria  in DOD Directive 1100.4, Guidance for Manpower Management,  articulating DOD policy that assigned missions shall be accomplished  using the least costly mix of military, federal civilian, and contract  personnel consistent with military requirements and other needs of the  department and DOD Instruction 1100.22, Policy and Procedures for  Determining Workforce Mix, establishing the workforce mix decision  process, which includes the consideration of cost as a deciding factor in  workforce mix decisions and states that manpower authorities consider all  available personnel when determining the workforce mix, including active  military, federal civilians, and contractors.

However, the  demand for UAS has outpaced the Air Force\u2019s ability to produce UAS  pilots using the existing training pipeline. To meet the demand for UAS  pilots, the Air Force has relied on support from the Air National Guard and  has pursued efforts to increase the number of UAS pilots. For example,  the Air Force trained traditional manned-aircraft pilots to fly UAS and  placed graduates of manned-aircraft pilot training into UAS training rather  than in advanced manned-aircraft training. In 2010, the Air Force created  a dedicated UAS pilot career field and developed a training program for  pilots who specialize in flying UAS. As of 2015, the Secretary of Defense  had tasked the Air Force to provide 60 \u201ccombat lines\u201d to combatant  commanders, which is the measure of the capability to provide near- continuous 24-hour presence of a UAS over a specific region on Earth.

We determined that the Air Force applied this  principle in the actions taken to address UAS pilot shortages because the  Air Force has involved top senior Air Force leaders, stakeholder offices,  and UAS pilots in UAS units to develop a strategy (i.e., the Get Well Plan)  to address UAS pilot shortages. In documentation of the Get Well Plan  the Air Force describes its UAS pilot shortage, the plan\u2019s goals, and  initiatives to address the shortages, such as by reassigning some of the  UAS workload to Air National Guard units and by supporting training and  operations through the use of contractors. According to Air Force  headquarters officials, in 2015 top senior Air Force leaders developed the  Get Well Plan, and the Secretary of the Air Force and other top senior  leadership helped develop the plan\u2019s two goals to staff 100 percent of the  positions for (1) instructors at the UAS pilot school and (2) combat UAS  pilots. Further, stakeholder offices such as the Air Combat Command and  the Air Force Special Operations Command participated in developing the  plan, according to headquarters Air Force officials. In addition, the Air  Combat Command\u2019s Culture and Process Improvement Program Office  surveyed and interviewed UAS pilots in UAS units from August 2015  through September 2015 to identify any challenges the pilots and units  faced and subsequently developed over 150 initiatives to address these  challenges. For example, according to a draft report of this effort, UAS  pilots reported that their morale was low and some attributed this to the  isolated locations of UAS bases. In response, the Air Force announced  that it would establish new UAS units at up to two existing Air Force  bases in possible locations that include Arizona, Georgia, and Idaho.", "Army\u2014partially applied. Top senior Army leaders and stakeholders  developed a strategy to address UAS unit training shortfalls and UAS unit  readiness issues including UAS mishaps that the Army identified in 2015,  but we determined that the Army had partially addressed this principle  because the Army did not involve UAS pilots serving in UAS units in this  effort. According to senior officials from the Army Aviation Center of  Excellence, the Army\u2019s top senior leaders, stakeholders from the Army  Combat Readiness Center, and other organizations prepared a briefing in  March 2015 that documented findings about UAS training shortfalls, UAS  mishaps, and an Army strategy to address UAS training shortfalls.  The  strategy included initiatives to (1) increase the amount of flight training  that UAS pilots conduct at their homestations, (2) issue guidance on UAS  training requirements, and (3) establish a system to report the amount of  training that UAS units complete to higher level commands. According to  Army officials, by addressing UAS unit training shortfalls, the Army could  address those UAS mishaps that are due to human error.", "Army officials told us that the Army had involved three senior enlisted  UAS pilots serving in management support positions at the Army Aviation  Center of Excellence. These three UAS pilots, who supported top senior  leaders who developed the strategy communicated with UAS units to  verify the amount of training that they had completed and collect  information on unit needs, among other things, according to senior  officials at the Aviation Center of Excellence. However, this approach  does not constitute involving employees in developing a strategy to  address UAS training shortfalls and mishaps. The senior enlisted UAS  pilots involved in developing the Army\u2019s strategy are not currently serving  in UAS units but instead serve in a support role to senior leadership that  oversee Army UAS programs. However, the Army was experiencing  training shortfalls within UAS units, not at higher level commands that  oversee these units. Without soliciting input directly from UAS pilots in  UAS units, such as by conducting focus groups or surveys, the Army is  not able to capture and incorporate the unique perspective of employees  who are conducting the day-to-day work of serving as UAS pilots. Had it  done so the Army may have been able to identify any challenges that  these pilots might face in completing their training or in avoiding mishaps.  By collecting input from personnel serving as unit-level UAS pilots, the  Army could help ensure that any strategy developed might address root  causes of training shortfalls and mishaps that top leadership and other  stakeholders might not be aware of. For example, as discussed above,  the Air Force involved UAS pilots in its planning to address quality-of-life  challenges that those pilots face and these pilots were uniquely suited to  identify those challenges. Responding to those challenges, the Air Force  developed an initiative to establish additional UAS bases to address the  low morale that was attributed to serving in the isolated locations of some  UAS bases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Air Force and the Army Have Developed Strategies to Address Gaps in Critical Skills and Competencies for UAS Pilots but Have Not Fully Tailored the Strategies to Address Persistent Gaps", "paragraphs": ["Another key principle for effective strategic human capital planning is that  it is important for organizations to develop human capital strategies that  are tailored to organizations\u2019 unique needs and these strategies can be  used to address human capital conditions that need attention such as  gaps, or shortages, in critical skills and competencies.", "Air Force\u2014partially applied. The Air Force has developed a strategy  designed to address UAS pilot shortfalls and the Air Force has increased  the staffing levels of UAS pilots; however, we determined that the Air  Force partially applied this principle because its strategy is not fully  tailored to address persistent gaps such as continuing to rely on manned- aircraft pilots, limitations in cadet interest in the UAS pilot career field, and  the high workload of UAS pilots.", "Since we reported on UAS pilot shortages in April 2014, the Air Force has  developed a personnel strategy designed to help improve the staffing  level of the UAS pilot career field. For example, the Air Force\u2019s UAS  workload was reduced when the Secretary of Defense reduced the  number of UAS combat lines that Air Force military units fly from 65 to 60  and the active-duty UAS pilot workload was also reduced when the Air  Force reassigned 3 combat lines from active-duty units to Air National  Guard units. The Air Force also extended the assignments of manned- aircraft pilots who were serving as temporary UAS pilots and increased  the number of UAS pilot candidates that it brought in to the Air Force. The  Air Force as of July 2016 had met the goal in the Get Well Plan to staff  100 percent of the UAS pilot positions needed for combat. The Air Force  has also made progress in achieving the second goal in the Get Well  Plan, to staff 100 percent of the instructor pilot positions, staffing 93  percent of these positions as of July 2016. Further, the Air Force  improved the overall staffing level of the UAS pilot career field staffing 90  percent of the total number of required UAS pilot positions with pilots who  specialize in flying UAS with temporarily assigned manned-aircraft pilots  as of March 2016. This is an improvement from the 85 percent of these  positions that the Air Force had filled when we reported on UAS pilot  shortages in 2014.", "However, we determined that the Air Force partially applied this principle  because the Air Force has not developed human capital strategies that  are fully tailored to address issues that the Air Force has to eliminate  remaining shortfalls. For example, the Air Force continues to rely on a  significant number of manned aircraft pilots who are temporarily  reassigned to fly UAS. As of March 2016, 37 percent of the personnel  filling UAS pilot positions were temporarily assigned manned-aircraft  pilots. Air Force Headquarters officials told us that no other career field in  the Air Force relies on temporary personnel to the extent that the UAS  pilot career field does. Manned-aircraft pilots who are temporarily serving  as UAS pilots acquire experience in flying UAS and the unique needs of  how UAS operate in operational settings. When these manned aircraft  pilots leave the UAS pilot career field and return to assignments flying  manned aircraft, the UAS pilot career field loses that experience. Without  developing strategies and tools that are more fully tailored to address this  gap, the Air Force\u2019s UAS pilot workforce will continue to lose the  experience that temporarily assigned manned aircraft pilots have  acquired.", "Further, the Air Force strategy is not fully tailored to address the issue of  a lack of cadet interest in the UAS pilot career field at the Air Force  Academy and in the Reserve Officer Training Corps, and Air Force  headquarters officials told us that this is a challenge for the Air Force. Air  Force officials at the Air Force Academy and Reserve Officer Training  Corps told us that most cadets who join the Air Force express limited  interest in becoming a UAS pilot and instead want to become a manned- aircraft pilot. Air Force headquarters officials told us that the Air Force has  taken some steps to address this issue, including headquarters personnel  visits to some Reserve Officer Training Corps units at several universities  to discuss with cadets the merits of the UAS pilot career field.  However,  the Air Force\u2019s strategies are not tailored to address the lack of cadet  interest in the UAS pilot career field.", "In addition, the Air Force\u2019s strategy has not been tailored to address the  high workload of UAS pilots. For example, the Air Force estimates that its  UAS pilots fly their aircraft in operations much more than other pilots in  the Air Force. In particular, the Air Force estimates that UAS pilots fly an  average of 900 hours annually, while fighter pilots fly an average of 200  hours annually, and pilots of cargo and air refueling tankers fly an  average of 500 hours annually. Further, Air Force headquarters officials  told us that most of the hours that fighter pilots fly are to conduct training  exercises while virtually all of the hours that UAS pilots fly are to conduct  operations (see fig. 1).", "Air Force officials stated that it is difficult to compare the number of hours  that different types of pilots fly and draw conclusions about the  comparative effects of differing workloads. However, as we reported in  2015, the amount of time that Air Force UAS pilots work leaves them little  time to train.", "Air Force headquarters officials agreed with our assessment that UAS  pilot shortages remain a significant challenge for the Air Force and called  attention to the comments made by the Chief of Staff of the Air Force  acknowledging these challenges in August 2016. Officials told us that  the shortages in the UAS pilot and fighter pilot careers are the two areas  of greatest concern regarding the Air Force operations career fields. In  addition, an Air Force headquarters official told us that the Air Force has  not advocated for providing additional personnel to fill the remaining  unmet UAS pilot requirements because the Air Force would not be able to provide enough personnel to fully meet them. Without tailoring its strategy  to address this shortfall between all UAS pilot position requirements and  the actual positions filled, the Air Force risks continuing to not meet its  requirements.", "Army\u2014partially applied. The Army developed a strategy to address  shortfalls in UAS unit training, but we determined that the Army partially  applied this principle because its strategy is not fully tailored to address  its issues such as a lack of adequate facilities and access to airspace,  resulting in the Army experiencing considerable training shortfalls for UAS  pilots. As discussed earlier, the Army\u2019s strategy for addressing training  shortfalls includes a number of initiatives: (1) increasing the amount of  flight training that UAS pilots conduct at their homestation, (2) issuing  guidance on UAS training requirements, and (3) establishing a system to  report the amount of training that UAS units complete to higher level  commands. However, according to data provided by the Army Aviation  Center of Excellence, in fiscal year 2015 61 of the 73 RQ-7B Shadow  units that were training at their homestation flew an average of 129 hours  of the 340-hour unit goal, and as of the end of the third quarter in fiscal  year of 2016, 68 of the 78 RQ-7B Shadow units flew an average of 79  hours of the 340-hour unit goal (see fig. 2). A senior Army official  acknowledged that continued UAS unit training shortfalls is a concern for  the Army.", "According to Army officials, a lack of adequate facilities, lack of access to  airspace, and the inability to fly more than one UAS at a time contributed  to the lack of progress toward improving UAS homestation training.

In  addition, officials at Air Combat Command told us that they use data from  the Get Well Plan updates that show which units are more fully staffed to  identify those that can support training personnel on any new equipment  that the Air Force deploys while maintaining combat operations.", "However, we determined that the Air Force partially applied this principle  because the Air Force does not monitor the extent to which achieving the  human capital goals in its Get Well Plan helps it to achieve programmatic  goals. According to headquarters Air Force officials, the Air Force has  three program goals that are related to addressing UAS pilot shortfalls: to  (1) meet combat demand, (2) staff enough personnel to UAS units to  allow UAS pilots time to train and take part in development activities, and  (3) provide surge UAS combat capabilities when needed. When we asked  Air Force officials how the Air Force measures the extent that achieving  goals in the Get Well Plan helps it to achieve its three programmatic  goals, these officials provided documentation that shows the Air Force  monitors the sequencing of requirements that it needs in its various UAS  units. However, this approach does not constitute an approach to  measure how achieving goals in its Get Well Plan helps it to achieve its  three programmatic goals. For example, the documentation does not  address how achieving goals it the Get Well Plan will help the Air Force  provide UAS pilots time to train or help the Air Force provide surge UAS  capabilities. Until the Air Force begins monitoring the extent to which  achieving the human capital goals in its Get Well Plan helps it to achieve  programmatic goals, the Air Force will not know whether its strategies are  having the effect that the Air Force intends regarding its program goals.", "Army\u2014applied.

Human capital  flexibilities are any policies, practices or adjustments to existing policies  and practices that an agency has the authority to implement and that it  uses to manage its workforce to accomplish its mission. For example,  agencies may implement policies related to recruiting, retention, work-life  policies, and training, among other things.", "Air Force\u2014partially applied. The Air Force has taken some steps to  incorporate two flexibilities into its strategy to address UAS pilot  shortages; however, we determined that the Air Force partially applied  this principle because it is too early to assess whether these steps will  result in effective workforce planning that reduces the Air Force UAS pilot  shortages and the Air Force has not explored additional flexibilities that it  may need to use to address additional requirements for UAS pilots. First,  the Air Force is working on an initiative that would enable it to provide  UAS pilots with \u201cdwell time\u201d\u2014a time during which servicemembers are at  their homestation during which they are able to take leave, attend  training, and recuperate. As part of its Culture and Process Improvement  effort, Air Force UAS pilots recommended that the Air Force provide them  dwell time. Because most Air Force UAS pilots remotely operate UAS  from Air Force bases in the United States they can live at home.  However, the Secretary of the Air Force noted in January 2015 that UAS  pilots fly 6 days in a row and work 13 to 14 hour days on average. The  Secretary noted that an average manned-aircraft pilot flies between 200  and 300 hours per year. The Air Force provides dwell time to  servicemembers who return from certain overseas deployments. In  particular, an Air Force policy states that for every 1 year an active duty  servicemember is deployed to certain overseas locations, they are  required to be assigned for 2 years at their homestation. However, this  requirement does not apply to UAS pilots because most operate their  UAS remotely from the United States. In October 2016, the Commanding  General of the Air Combat Command drafted a request to the Chief of  Staff of the Air Force to provide dwell time to UAS pilots. According to a  draft memorandum of the request, for every month that an Air Force UAS  unit spends performing a combat role the personnel in that unit would  subsequently receive half a month to focus solely on training. As of  October 2016, the Air Force had not implemented this initiative and the  Commanding General of the Air Force\u2019s Air Combat Command testified  before the Senate Armed Services Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Airland  in March 2016 that to implement dwell time for UAS pilots the Air Force  would need to increase the size of its UAS capability by 25 to 30  percent.", "Second, in September 2016, the Air Force increased the maximum  annual retention pay for UAS pilots from $25,000 to $35,000, the  maximum amount allowed under the authority provided in the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal year 2016. It is too early to assess  the effectiveness of this flexibility in addressing the persistent UAS pilot  shortages, because this flexibility was only recently incorporated and  might be followed by a corresponding bonus for manned-aircraft pilots.  Earlier in an April 2016 letter that the Secretary of the Air Force sent to  the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Secretary  expressed the need to ensure equity in the amount of retention bonuses  that the Air Force pays UAS pilots and manned-aircraft pilots. However,  during the course of our review, Air Force officials acknowledged that in  March 2016 and April 2016 the Air Force had indicated to Congress the  need to authorize an increase to the maximum annual amount of  retention bonus that the Air Force pays to manned-aircraft pilots to  $60,000 per year\u2014about 70 percent more than the amount that the Air  Force will pay UAS pilots. While the Air Force has taken some steps to  incorporate the dwell time and retention pay flexibilities into its strategy to  address UAS pilot shortages, it is too early to tell whether these steps will  result in effective workforce planning outcomes that reduce Air Force  UAS pilot shortages.", "While the Air Force has taken steps to implement flexibilities to its  strategy, Air Force requirements for the number of UAS pilots it needs  may underrepresent those needs and Air Force leadership expect  demand for UAS pilots to grow, but the Air Force has not explored  additional flexibilities to meet these needs. In 2014, we found that the Air  Force had conducted a study in 2008 to determine the required number of  UAS pilots in UAS units, but the study did not account for all tasks those  units perform. Air Force officials stated that, as a result, the requirement  was probably too low. We recommended that the Air Force update its  requirement for UAS units and the Air Force concurred with our  recommendation. However, since we issued our report, the Air Force has  not updated its requirement, although it conducted a new study in 2015.  In addition, in March 2016, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force testified that  he expected that the Air Force will continue to experience growth in the  demand for UAS capabilities in the long term, and that to meet this  expected growth, the Air Force would need more personnel. Updating  the requirement for the number of UAS pilots in a unit and growth in  future demand for Air Force UAS capabilities could both result in an  increase in the number of UAS pilots that the Air Force needs. However,  the Air Force has not explored the potential of adding flexibilities related  to recruiting, such as recruiting bonuses or other recruitment incentives  according to an Air Force official. Without exploring additional flexibilities  that the Air Force may need in the future, the Air Force may not be poised  to meet future needs for additional pilots.", "Army\u2014partially applied. The Army has taken some steps to incorporate  flexibilities into its strategy to address UAS unit training shortfalls;  however we determined that the Army partially applied this principle  because it is too early to assess whether these steps will result in  effective workforce planning that reduces Army UAS training shortfalls. As  we noted earlier, Army officials told us that Army UAS units continue to  face training shortfalls due to inadequate facilities and shortfalls in  airspace. To address these factors, some Army units are implementing  flexibilities to overcome these factors at their installations, according to  Army officials. For example, to overcome airspace restrictions, a unit at  Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, travels to the Yakima Training  Center in Washington where there is more available airspace to conduct  training. In addition, personnel at the National Training Center at Fort  Irwin, California launch UAS and then transfer control of the aircraft to  UAS pilots at Fort Hood, Texas, which increases the opportunities for the  pilots at Fort Hood to train. However, as we noted earlier, the Army  continues to experience training shortfalls and, as of the end of the third  quarter in fiscal year of 2016, 68 of the 78 RQ-7B Shadow units that were  not deployed flew an average of 79 hours of the 340-hour minimum  identified by the Army in its UAS Holistic Review.

The Air  Force evaluates whether UAS pilot candidates display these  competencies to a sufficient degree using aptitude tests that are also  used to assess the competencies of manned-aircraft pilot candidates  including the Air Force Officer Qualification Test, the Test of Basic  Aviation Skills, and the Multi-Tasking Test. Officials at the Air Force  Personnel Center told us that their research has found that UAS pilots  and manned-aircraft pilots need many of the same competencies to be  successful. Air Force researchers told us that because the Air Force  adopted the manned-aircraft pilot selection method to select UAS pilots,  Air Force researchers conducted validation research to ensure that this  approach was sound and found that this method is a valid predictor of  whether UAS pilot candidates will successfully complete UAS training.

Air Force  Personnel Center researchers told us that, while the Air Force has no  measures that focus specifically on measuring attention to detail, another  Air Force test partially measures attention to detail. The researchers  noted that some of the competencies that Air Force tests do not  specifically measure are related to other competencies that the Air Force  tests do measure and that when two competencies are related, the Air  Force may only need to assess if a candidate has aptitude for one of  those competencies. Moreover, they told us that the Air Force\u2019s tests do  not measure all of the competencies that are important for UAS pilots.

Since the Army first established a  UAS pilot specialty in 1990, the Army has acquired new UAS platforms  with additional mission capabilities, and has expanded its use of UAS. For  example, when the Army UAS pilot career specialty was first established  in 1990, the Army flew the RQ-2A Pioneer UAV, which performed  missions such as reconnaissance, surveillance, and battle damage  assessment. In contrast, some Army UAS pilots currently fly the MQ-1C  Gray Eagle, which is a larger, weaponized UAS with longer endurance  and additional mission capabilities, including attack capabilities. In  addition, in 2003, the Army transferred its UAS program from its Military  Intelligence Branch to the Aviation Branch. According to a 2007 Army  Research Institute study on the selection of Army UAS pilots, with that  shift there was also an increase in the number and types of UAS  employed by the Army and changes in UAS missions and operations.

In its July 2016 congressional inquiry response, the Air Force  stated that both federal civilians and private sector contractors would be  limited to intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. Army  headquarters officials stated that the Army has not used federal civilians  as UAS pilots because of limitations on the functions that federal civilians  can perform that are needed for some Army UAS missions.

Private sector contractors are further restricted from performing any  inherently governmental activities, such as federal procurement activities  performed in operational environments, which federal civilians are  permitted to perform. Army headquarters officials stated that the  disadvantage to using private sector contractors is that GOCO units are  less capable with respect to functions they may perform and more  expensive than military units, but according to these officials, the Army  continues to use them due to limits set by the administration on the  number of uniformed personnel that can be used in conflicts in the Middle  East. Similarly, one Air Force official we spoke with indicated that in some  cases, these limitations on private sector contractors performing certain  activities may impact the mission.

The study found that using DOD federal civilians  may be an option for realizing cost savings. Personnel and Readiness  also sponsored a RAND Corporation study examining effective ways to  convert military positions to positions filled by federal civilian personnel,  referred to as military-to-civilian conversions. The study was published in  June 2016 and recommended changes to statutes, policies, and business  practices to facilitate military-to-civilian conversions.

As  mentioned above, in its July 2016 congressional inquiry response, the Air  Force included cost estimates for active duty, federal civilian, and private  sector contractor personnel and determined that using private sector  contractors is the option with the lowest cost for calendar year 2017 for  the additional 10 combat lines to help meet the DOD-wide 90 combat line  requirement. The Air Force conclusion was based in part on the  assumption that active duty and federal civilian personnel would increase  long-term costs such as an enduring increase in force structure that  private sector contractors would not similarly require. However, according  to an Office of the Secretary of Defense official, federal civilians can be  hired on a short-term basis. In addition, the Air Force response to the  congressional inquiry assumes that the private sector contractors will be  used only to meet a temporary increase in demand and as such includes  cost estimates for one calendar year. However, in March 2016, the  Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force testified  that demand for UAS capabilities will likely continue to increase, calling  into question whether the 10 private sector contractor-supported combat  lines will remain temporary. While the use of private sector contractors  might be a viable solution in the short-term, without a more in-depth cost  analysis, the Air Force will lack information on the most cost-effective  options in the long-term, particularly if the demand for UAS increases.", "Army headquarters officials said the Army has not completed a cost  analysis of private sector contractors and federal civilians because its use  of GOCO units was intended to be a short-term solution to meet mission  needs. According to these officials, hiring federal civilians as UAS pilots  would be a permanent action that would require a permanent personnel  structure. However, as noted above, there are options for hiring federal  civilians to meet short-term needs. In addition, while Army headquarters  officials say the Army\u2019s use of private sector contractors began as a  short-term need, private sector contractors have been flying Army UAS  for 8 years because of ongoing conflict in the Middle East. Completing a  cost-analysis could better inform decision-making on the workforce,  including continuing to rely on private sector contractors instead of  exploring other options, such as using federal civilians. Without  conducting a cost analysis, both the Air Force and the Army may not  know whether they are using the most cost effective workforce mix for  meeting mission needs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The demand for UAS capabilities has grown considerably in recent years  to support combat operations, as has the demand for a sufficient number  of trained UAS pilots needed to provide those capabilities. The Air Force  has experienced challenges providing the required number of UAS pilots  to meet that demand. In addition, the Army has experienced challenges in  providing its goal number of training hours to its UAS pilots when not  deployed. Both the Air Force and the Army have, in most cases, partially  addressed strategic human capital planning principles to help them  address those challenges. However, by not taking actions consistent with  certain elements of the principles, the Air Force and the Army could  hinder their ability to address their personnel challenges. For example,  because the Army had not involved UAS pilots in UAS units in developing  its strategy to address training shortfalls, it may have missed an  opportunity to gain valuable information and insight from UAS pilots that  may help address root causes of training shortfalls and mishaps. In  addition, if the Air Force and the Army do not revise their strategies to  fully tailor them to address remaining issues with gaps, the Air Force risks  continuing to not meet its requirements and the Army risks continuing to  train at levels that are below Army requirements. Moreover, because the  Air Force has not monitored the extent to which achieving the human  capital goals it has set also helps it achieve its programmatic goals, the  Air Force may be limited in its understanding whether its goals and  strategies are having their intended effects. Further, while the Air Force  has taken steps to incorporated flexibilities into its human capital  strategies, without exploring the potential to use additional flexibilities,  such as recruiting bonuses or other recruitment incentives, it may not be  poised to meet future needs for UAS pilots. For the Army, because it has  not incorporated additional, important UAS pilot competencies in its UAS  pilot candidate selection method and validated that selection method, it  may be missing opportunities to improve its personnel selection and  realize associated benefits, such as reduced training costs.", "The Air Force and the Army primarily use military personnel to fill UAS  pilot positions and have also used contractors to fly UAS, yet neither  service has evaluated its workforce mix for UAS pilot positions, including  specifically evaluating the use of federal civilians, because the Office of  the Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness has not directed  the services to conduct such an evaluation as part of its oversight  responsibilities. Evaluating the workforce mix would help to ensure that  the Air Force and the Army are using the mix of personnel best suited to  meeting mission needs and would provide information on options for  addressing shortages and limitations on using military personnel. In  addition, the Air Force and Army did not inform their workforce decisions  with cost analyses that would provide information on the most cost- effective workforce for meeting mission needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making 11 recommendations to the Secretary of Defense to  improve the strategic human capital planning of the Air Force\u2019s and the  Army\u2019s UAS pilot workforces.", "To help the Air Force in its effort to address UAS pilot shortfalls, we are  making the following 3 recommendations related to three of the five  principles for effective strategic human capital planning.", "To help ensure that the Air Force strategies to address UAS pilot  shortages are tailored to address remaining issues, such as the  significant amount of pilots who are temporarily assigned to the UAS  pilot career, the limited amount of cadet interest in the UAS pilot  career, and the workload of UAS pilots, we recommend that the  Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the Air Force to revise  the Get Well Plan to address these issues.", "To help the Air Force ensure that its strategies are having the  intended effects, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct  the Secretary of the Air Force to monitor the extent to which that  achieving the human capital goals in its strategy helps the Air Force  achieve its programmatic goals.", "To help the Air Force ensure that it is poised to meet future needs for  UAS pilots, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the  Secretary of the Air Force to explore the potential use of additional  flexibilities that would enable it to increase the number of UAS pilots in  its workforce.", "To help the Army in its effort to address UAS unit training shortfalls, we  are making the following 6 recommendations related to three of the five  principles for effective strategic human capital planning.", "To help the Army identify challenges that UAS pilots face in  completing their training, we recommend that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Secretary of the Army to  collect feedback from UAS pilots in UAS units, such as by  surveying, or conducting focus groups with them and  incorporate such feedback into the Army\u2019s strategy to address  UAS training shortfalls.", "To help ensure that Army Shadow units meet minimum training  requirements, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the  Secretary of the Army to revise its strategy to address UAS training  shortfalls to ensure that it is fully tailored to address training issues  and address factors such as lack of adequate facilities, lack of access  to airspace, and the inability to fly more than one UAS at a time.", "To help the Army ensure that it is basing its decisions to select  individuals for UAS pilot training on sound evidence and to help it take  advantage of the key benefits associated with effective personnel  selection that could include reducing training costs, improving job  performance, improving retention of qualified personnel, enabling  leadership development, and enhancing organizational effectiveness,  we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of  the Army to  validate that the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery is an  effective predictor of UAS pilot candidate performance in UAS  pilot training and job performance; assess existing research that has been performed that identifies  UAS pilot competencies; and  incorporate relevant findings from such research into the Army\u2019s  approach for selecting UAS pilot candidates, as appropriate.", "To help address personnel shortages and meet mission needs cost  effectively, we are making two recommendations that the Office of the  Secretary of Defense, through the Under Secretary of Defense  (Personnel & Readiness) direct the Air Force and the Army to: evaluate the workforce mix and the use of federal civilians for UAS  conduct cost analyses consistent with DOD guidance to inform their  workforce decisions and ensure cost effectiveness of the UAS pilot  workforce mix."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for comment. In its written  comments, DOD partially concurred with nine recommendations and  concurred with two recommendations. For the nine recommendations  with which DOD partially concurred, DOD noted actions that it had been  taken that DOD believed addressed the intent of our recommendations.  DOD\u2019s comments are summarized below and reprinted in their entirety in  appendix III.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Air Force  revise the Get Well Plan to help ensure that the Air Force strategies to  address UAS pilot shortages are tailored to address the significant  amount of pilots who are temporarily assigned to the UAS pilot career, the  limited amount of cadet interest in the UAS pilot career, and the workload  of UAS pilots. In its comments, DOD stated that it does not disagree with  our recommendation. However, DOD believes that the Get Well Plan  addresses these issues and significant steps have already been taken to  fulfill the intent of our recommendation; therefore, no further direction is  needed in response to our recommendation. We disagree. The Get Well  Plan has two stated goals: to staff 100 percent of the positions for (1)  instructors at the UAS pilot school; and (2) combat UAS pilots, and does  not address the three issues we discuss in this recommendation. We  continue to believe that the Air Force needs to take action to help ensure  that its strategy is fully tailored to address the challenges we identified  and that the Air Force acknowledged existed.", "DOD also partially concurred with our recommendation that the Air Force  monitor the extent to which achieving the human capital goals in its  strategy helps the Air Force achieve its programmatic goals. DOD stated  that it agrees that continuous monitoring of the Air Force Get Well Plan is  critical and noted that the Air Force provides regular updates to the senior  leadership of the department on the goals and status of the Get Well  Plan. DOD also stated that based on those updates, the Office of the  Secretary of Defense will provide additional direction as necessary and  appropriate. As we noted in the report, the Air Force does not measure  how achieving goals in its Get Well Plan helps it to achieve its three  programmatic goals: (1) meeting combat demand, (2) staffing enough  personnel to UAS units to allow UAS pilots time to train and take part in  development activities, and (3) providing surge UAS combat capabilities  when needed. For example, the Air Force\u2019s current monitoring does not  address how achieving goals in the Get Well Plan will help the Air Force  provide UAS pilots time to train or help the Air Force provide surge UAS  capabilities. We continue to believe that until the Air Force develops such  an approach and begins monitoring the extent to which achieving the  human capital goals in its strategy helps the Air Force achieve its  programmatic goals, the Air Force will not know whether its strategies are  having the intended effect on its program goals.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Air Force  explore the potential use of additional flexibilities to enable it to increase  the number of UAS pilots in its workforce to meet future needs. DOD  stated that the Air Force is exploring additional measures with the  potential to increase the number of pilots in the UAS pilot workforce. It  stated that, as needed, the Air Force will engage with the Office of the  Secretary of Defense to secure authorities necessary to implement  desired measures relating to the workforce, but that further direction from  the Secretary of Defense is not necessary at this time. As we stated in the  report, the Air Force has taken some steps to incorporate two  flexibilities\u2014providing \u201cdwell time\u201d and retention bonuses\u2014into its  strategy to address UAS pilot shortages. We continue to believe that  exploring the use of additional flexibilities to increase the number of UAS  pilots is important given that current Air Force requirements for the  number of UAS pilots it needs may underrepresent those needs, and Air  Force leadership expects demand for UAS pilots to grow.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendations that the Army (1)  collect feedback from pilots in UAS units to help the Army identify  challenges faced in completing their training and (2) incorporate such  feedback into the Army\u2019s strategy to address UAS training shortfalls. DOD  stated that incorporating feedback from the field is already an element of  the Army\u2019s strategy for improving the sustainability, maturity, and health  of its UAS workforce. DOD stated that our findings will reinforce the  importance of using feedback to improve and refine the Army's overall  strategy. DOD also stated that it does not believe that further direction is  necessary. We disagree that additional direction is not necessary for  addressing UAS training shortfalls. While it is encouraging that the Army  is incorporating feedback from the field to improve the sustainability,  maturity, and health of its UAS workforce, we specifically address training  shortfalls in UAS units in our findings, which the Army does not discuss in  its response to this recommendation. As noted in our report, we believe  that by collecting input through focus groups or surveys of UAS pilots  serving in UAS units, the Army could identify the root causes of chronic  training shortfalls in RQ-7B Shadow units and use its findings to shape its  strategy to address its documented training shortfalls.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Army revise its  strategy to address UAS training shortfalls to ensure that it is fully tailored  to address training issues and address factors such as lack of adequate  facilities, lack of access to airspace, and the inability to fly more than one  UAS at a time. DOD stated that the Army has already taken steps to  continuously improve its training strategy and that our findings will  underline the importance of those initiatives, but that additional direction  related to our recommendation is not necessary. We disagree. We  acknowledge in our report that the Army has taken steps to overcome  some of its training challenges. For example, to overcome airspace  restrictions, a unit at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, travels to  the Yakima Training Center in Washington where there is more available  airspace to conduct training. However, these steps have not resulted in   Army RQ-7B Shadow units meeting homestation training goals since at  least 2013. Given this, we believe that the Army needs to revise its  strategy to more fully tailor it to address the barriers to help it address  these training shortfalls.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Army validate  that the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery is an effective  predictor of UAS pilot candidate performance in UAS pilot training and job  performance. DOD stated that it believes that the current graduation rate  of soldiers from its UAS pilot school of 98 percent is an indication that the  existing personnel resource predictors and practices are sufficient. It also  stated that periodic re-validation is prudent, but specific direction to do so  is not necessary. We disagree. Regarding the Army\u2019s graduation rate of  personnel attending UAS pilot training, Army officials told us that senior  Army leaders pressure officials at the Army UAS pilot schoolhouse to  ensure that UAS pilot candidates make it through training. As a result, this  statistic may not provide the Army with reliable evidence that its approach  to selecting personnel to serve as UAS pilots is providing the Army with  personnel who have the aptitude for this career. Validating that the Armed  Services Vocational Aptitude Battery is an effective predictor of training  and job performance of UAS pilot is an important step that would help the  Army ensure that it is basing its decisions to select individuals for the  UAS pilot career field on sound evidence.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendations that the Army (1)  assess existing research that has been performed that identifies UAS  pilot competencies and (2) incorporate relevant findings from such  research into the Army\u2019s approach for selecting UAS pilot candidates, as  appropriate. DOD stated that incorporating findings regarding UAS pilot  competencies is already an integral part of both workforce and community  management and that effective and efficient resource management, as  well as force shaping and management processes, will help ensure that  the Army's selection of candidates is consistent with the findings of  existing research in this area. DOD stated that it does not believe it is  necessary to provide additional direction or guidance to the Army to  leverage existing research that identifies UAS pilot competencies. We  disagree. As we noted in our report, the Army has used the same  approach to assess the competencies of UAS pilot candidates since at  least 2002 and has not incorporated findings from scientific research,  such as results from an Army Research Institute study conducted in 2007,  on UAS pilot candidates. We believe that by assessing existing research  that identifies UAS pilot competencies and incorporating relevant findings  from such research into the Army\u2019s approach for selecting UAS pilot  candidates that the Army could take advantage of the benefits associated  with effective personnel selection. Assessing and incorporating such  findings may allow the Army to  reduce training costs, improve job  performance, improve retention of qualified personnel, enable leadership  development, and enhance organizational effectiveness.", "Finally, DOD concurred with our two recommendations that the Air Force  and the Army evaluate the UAS workforce mix and the use of federal  civilians for their UAS pilot positions and that the Air Force and Army  conduct cost analyses consistent with DOD guidance to inform their  workforce decisions and ensure cost effectiveness of their UAS pilot  workforce mix.", "We are sending copies of this report to appropriate congressional  committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Secretaries of the Air Force  and the Army; and the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness.

In  particular, we found that the Air Force (1) had operated below its optimum  crew ratio, which is a metric used to determine the personnel needs for  Air Force aviation units; (2) had not developed a minimum crew ratio; (3)  had not tailored its recruiting and retention strategy to align with the  specific needs and challenges of UAS pilots; (4) had not considered the  viability of using personnel other than officers such as enlisted or civilians  as UAS pilots; (5) had not incorporated feedback from UAS pilots into  efforts to manage the career field; (6) had not fully analyzed the effects of  being deployed-on-station on UAS pilots\u2019 quality of life; and (7) had not  analyzed the effect of being a UAS pilot on the chances for promotion.

In our prior work, we found that strategic human  capital planning is an important component of an agency\u2019s effort to  develop long-term strategies for acquiring, developing, and retaining staff  needed for an agency to achieve its goals and of an agency\u2019s effort to  align human capital activities with the agency\u2019s current and emerging  mission. Specifically, we have found that an agency\u2019s efforts to conduct  strategic human capital planning should be characterized by five key  principles: (1) involving top senior leaders, employees, and other  stakeholders in developing, communicating, and implementing strategic  workforce plans; (2) developing strategies tailored to address gaps in  critical skills and competencies that need attention; (3) monitoring and  evaluating progress toward meeting workforce planning goals; (4) building  the capability needed to address administrative, educational, and other  requirements important to supporting workforce strategies; and (5)  determining the critical skills and competencies needed to achieve goals.", "To identify the extent to which the Air Force and the Army have  implemented these key principles in actions to address challenges with  managing UAS pilots, we reviewed Air Force and Army documentation  related to these services challenges and the actions taken to address  those challenges. These documents include data on the number of  required and actual UAS pilots in the Air Force for fiscal year 2016, Air  Force data on the number of personnel filling UAS pilot instructor  positions as of July 2016, and Air Force data on the number of hours that  UAS pilots and manned-aircraft pilots fly on average per year from fiscal  year 2015. These documents also included Army data on the number of  personnel filling UAS pilot positions as of May 2016 and the average  number of training hours completed by certain UAS units for fiscal year  2013 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. We assessed the  reliability of these data by reviewing related documentation and  interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  our reporting objectives.
