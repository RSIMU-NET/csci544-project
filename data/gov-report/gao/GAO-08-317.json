These subnational governments may face fiscal stress similar to the federal government. Given the nature of the partnership among levels of government in providing services to Americans and the economic interrelationships among levels of government, understanding potential future fiscal conditions of the state and local government sector is important for federal policymaking. To provide Congress and the public with this broader context, we developed a fiscal model of the state and local sector. This report describes this model and provides (1) simulations of the state and local government sector's long-term fiscal outlook, (2) an analysis of the underlying causes of potential fiscal difficulties for the sector, (3) a discussion of the extent to which the long-term simulations are sensitive to alternative assumptions, and (4) an examination of how the state and local government sector could add to future federal fiscal challenges. The potential fiscal outcomes of the state and local government sector are projected through two fiscal balance measures: net lending or borrowing and what we call the operating balance. Net lending or borrowing--which is roughly analogous to the federal unified surplus or deficit--is a measure of the balance of all receipts and expenditures during a given time frame. Historically, total expenditures have usually exceeded total receipts, and the sector issues debt to cover part of the costs of its capital projects. As such, net lending or borrowing typically measures the need for the sector to borrow funds or draw down assets to cover its expenditures. The operating balance net of funds for capital expenditures--referred to in this report as the \"operating balance\"--is a measure of the ability of the sector to cover its current expenditures out of current receipts, that is, the balance of expenditures and receipts related to activities taking place in a given year. Most states have some sort of requirement to balance operating budgets. Projects with longer time frames are typically budgeted separately from the operating budgets and financed by a combination of current receipts, federal grants, and the issuance of debt. Because some current receipts may be used to fund part of longer-term investments, we developed a measure of the operating balance that makes adjustments for the extent to which current receipts are unavailable to fund current expenditures because they have been spent on longer-term projects, such as investments in buildings and roads."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Our model shows that in less than a decade the state and local government sector will begin to face growing fiscal challenges. Both fiscal balance measures (1) net lending or borrowing and (2) the operating balance--are likely to remain within their historical ranges in the next few years, but both begin to decline thereafter and fall below their historical ranges within a decade. That is, absent policy changes, state and local governments will face an increasing gap between receipts and expenditures in the coming years. Since most state and local governments actually face requirements that their operating budgets be balanced or nearly balanced in most years, the declining fiscal conditions our simulations suggest are really just a foreshadowing of the extent to which these governments will need to make substantial policy changes to avoid these potential growing fiscal imbalances. As is true for the federal sector, the growth in health-related expenditures is the primary driver of the fiscal challenges facing the state and local government sector. In particular, two types of state and local expenditures will likely rise quickly. The first is Medicaid expenditures, and the second is expenditures by these governments for health insurance for state and local employees and retirees. Conversely, other types of expenditures of state and local governments in the aggregate--such as wages and salaries of state and local workers, nonhealth transfer payments (e.g., family assistance), and investments in capital goods--are assumed to grow slower than gross domestic product (GDP). Moreover, under the current policy scenario of the base case, most revenue categories grow at approximately the same rate as GDP. Therefore, the projected rise in health-related expenditures is the root of the fiscal difficulties these simulations suggest will occur. Although health care expenditures clearly appear to be a looming problem for the state and local government sector, the extent of fiscal difficulties faced by any given state or local government will vary with its individual expenditure and tax profile. We also used the model to examine how the fiscal balance measures would be affected over the long-term under assumptions that differed from those of our base case. In particular, we analyzed scenarios that differ across three factors: (1) the rate of growth in tax receipts, (2) the rate of growth in expenditures, and (3) the rate of growth in medical care expenditures. Some of the alternative scenarios were designed to examine the extent to which a change in base-case assumptions for any of these factors would enable the state and local government sector to maintain fiscal balances in their historical ranges. We found that it would be difficult to address the expected future fiscal deficits solely through tax increases or solely through expenditure cuts. Since 1992, we have produced long-term simulations of what might happen to federal deficits and debt under various policy scenarios. Our most recent long-term federal simulations show ever larger deficits resulting in a very large and growing federal debt burden over time.4 In that work, we found that federal fiscal difficulties stem primarily from an expected explosion of health-related expenditures. Our findings thus show that the state and local sector will provide an additional drag on an already declining federal government fiscal outlook and that the critical problem of escalating costs of health care is an economywide problem that will need to be addressed by all levels of government."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In speeches and presentations over the past several years, I have called  attention to our large and growing federal fiscal challenge and the risks it  poses to our nation\u2019s future.  For over a decade GAO has run long-term  simulations showing that absent a change in policy, the combined effects of  demographic changes and growing health care costs drive ever-increasing  federal deficits and debt levels. GAO\u2019s most recent federal simulations  show an anticipated persistent gap between expected revenues and  expected spending resulting in a very large and growing federal debt  burden over time.  The primary drivers of the spending are large federal  entitlement programs\u2014Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.

To provide Congress and the public with a broader perspective on our  nation\u2019s fiscal outlook, GAO has developed a fiscal model of the state and  local sector.  This unique model enables GAO to simulate fiscal outcomes  for the entire state and local government sector for several decades into the  future.", "The findings of these new simulations indicate that the state and local  government sector faces fiscal challenges that in many ways mirror those  of the federal government.  In particular, GAO has found that in the absence  of policy changes, large and recurring fiscal challenges for the state and  local sector will begin to emerge within a decade. For example, the analysis  suggests that state and local governments will need to somewhat increase  their pension contributions to fully fund pension costs for their employees.   Additionally, there is increasing concern that investment in the nation\u2019s  infrastructure is not sufficient to maintain its condition and to  accommodate the increased demand of a growing economy.  Moreover, as  in the federal sector, the growth in health-related costs serves as the  primary driver of the fiscal challenges facing the state and local  government sector.  In particular, two types of state and local expenditures  will likely rise quickly because of escalating medical costs.  The first is  Medicaid expenditures, and the second is the cost of health insurance for  state and local employees and retirees.

Taxes, such as property taxes, sales  and excise taxes, personal income tax, and corporate income taxes, make  up a large component of these receipts\u2014fully $1.2 trillion.  In addition, the  federal government provided over $400 billion to state and local  governments in the form of various grants (including Medicaid), loans, and  loan guarantees.  These federal funds accounted for approximately 22  percent of state and local government total receipts.  State and local  governments also obtain revenues from several other sources, such as  income receipts on financial assets; certain receipts from businesses and  individuals (such as vehicle and licensing fees); and, in some years, from  surpluses on government-run enterprises that provide services such as  energy, liquor, lotteries, and public transit.", "State and local governments fund a broad range of services such as public  safety, housing, education, and public transportation programs.

In particular, in the  base case we assume that current federal, state, and local policies remain  constant.  On the receipt side, this translates into an assumption that the  current tax structures of state and local governments are maintained in  future years and that tax receipt growth reflects past experience, except  that we remove the effect of past policy changes and the effects of unusual  capital gains.  On the expenditure side, we make assumptions that would  generally be consistent with the maintenance of current policies in the  provision of services to citizens.  Since compensation of state and local  employees is a large cost component of providing services to citizens, our  assumptions about the growth in the number of state and local employees  over time, as well as the growth in their wages, are significant components  through which we implement the assumptions of the maintenance of  current policy.  Since 1980, the level of employment in the state and local  sector has grown significantly faster than the U.S. population, but for our  simulation we maintain state and local government employment as a steady  share of the population over time.  This would be consistent with the  maintenance of current policy if there were no productivity gains in the  sector, or a modest increase in real services, to the extent that state and  local workers experience gains in productivity.  Also, we assume that  employees of state and local governments receive pay increases each year  equal to those of private sector workers\u2014an assumption that is generally  consistent with historical experience.  Finally, we assume that the total  cost of many goods procured by the sector to provide services will rise with  increases in the population being served and the rate of inflation in the  economy.

Historical data from 1980 to 2006 are shown along with  our model simulations beginning in 2007 and running through 2050.  The  figure shows that the two measures generally track one another.  It also  shows that, historically, net lending or borrowing has typically been  negative, but rarely by more than 1 percent of GDP.  This indicates that the  sector generally issues debt\u2014primarily to fund capital expenditures\u2014but  has done so at a reasonably stable pace.  Additionally, the operating  balance measure has historically been positive most of the time, ranging  from about zero to about 1 percent of GDP.  Thus, the sector usually has  been able to cover its current expenses with incoming receipts.  But the  simulation suggests that while projected balances for both net lending or  borrowing and the operating balance remain in their historical ranges for  the next several years, the balances will soon begin to decline and will fall  below their historical ranges within a decade.  That is, the model suggests  that the state and local government sector will face increasing fiscal stress  in just a few years.  Our simulations also indicate that by the mid-2020s the  balance measures will both be well below their historical ranges, and will  continue to fall throughout the remainder of the simulation time frame.   These projected deficits\u2014worsening throughout the projection time frame  under an unchanged policy scenario\u2014indicate that, because most state and  local governments cannot actually run such deficits for any length of time,  these governments will need to make tough choices on spending and tax  policy to meet their budget requirements and to promote favorable bond  ratings.", "Another way of measuring the long-term challenges faced by the state and  local sector is through a measure known as the \u201cfiscal gap.\u201d  With deficits  rising rapidly as shown in figure 1, the outstanding debt of the state and  local sector will experience unprecedented growth.  The fiscal gap is an  estimate of the action needed today and maintained for each and every year  to achieve fiscal balance over a certain period.  We measured the gap as the  amount of spending reduction or tax increase needed to maintain debt as a  share of GDP at or below today\u2019s ratio.  For the state and local sector, we  calculated that to close the fiscal gap would require action today equal to a  15.2 percent tax increase or a 12.9 percent reduction in spending financed  by non-grant revenues.  The fiscal gap can also be expressed as a share of  the economy or in present value dollars.  We calculated that in 2007 dollars  the fiscal gap amounts to $10.6 trillion, which represents 1.4 percent of the  discounted value of GDP over the same time frame."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Decline in Fiscal Balances Is Related to Rapidly Growing Health-Related Costs", "paragraphs": ["Based on our review of the evidence, we estimate that expenditure growth  for health care will be significant and these expenditures will constitute a  rapidly growing burden for state and local governments.  Two types of state  and local expenditures in particular will likely rise quickly due to escalating  medical costs.  First, under CBO\u2019s intermediate projections, federal  Medicaid grants to states per recipient will rise by 1 percent more than  GDP per capita in the coming years.  Since Medicaid is a federal and state  program with federal Medicaid grants based on a matching formula, these  estimates indicate that expenditures for Medicaid by state governments  will rise quickly as well.  Second, we estimated future expenditures for  health insurance for state and local employees and retirees.  Specifically,  we assume that the excess cost factor\u2014the growth in these health care  costs per capita above GDP per capita\u2014will average 1.4 percentage points  per year through 2035 and then begin to decline, reaching 0.6 percent by  2050.  This results in a rapidly growing burden from these health-related  activities in state and local budgets.  In contrast, our implementation of  assumptions about current policies indicated that, in aggregate, other  expenditure categories grow less than GDP in our base-case simulations.   For example, even though the wages and salaries of primary and secondary  education employees are a large expenditure of the state and local sector,  under our base-case assumptions these costs are not expected to grow any  faster than the rate of growth of the general economy and will not  represent an increasing burden on governments relative to their revenues.   These base-case assumptions differ from historical experience in which  real spending on primary and secondary education per pupil has risen in  the past few decades.  If such a trend were to continue, spending on  education could place a growing burden on state and local governments in  future years.

Figure 3 shows the expected path of  several tax revenue sources.  We found that personal state income taxes  will show a small rise relative to GDP in coming years.

Sales taxes of the sector are expected to experience  a slight decline as a percentage of GDP in the coming years.  Property  taxes\u2014which are mostly levied by local governments\u2014should rise slightly  as a share of GDP in the future.

Similarly, unusual swings in capital gains  represent past events that may have had a significant impact on receipts  but are not expected to recur in any predictable way.  To purge the effect of  policy changes from the receipts data, we used data from The Fiscal  Survey of the States:  December 2006, National Association of State Budget  Officers (NASBO).  These data provide estimates of the aggregate effect of  tax changes each year.  To remove the effect of atypical capital gains  realizations on receipts, we estimated a relationship between the share of  federal income tax receipts from capital gains receipts and the highest  marginal tax rate on capital gains.  Any deviation between the actual share  of capital gains receipts and the share implied by this relationship was  removed from state personal income taxes.  Using the adjusted receipts  data, we estimated that a 1 percent increase in real taxable personal  income generates an approximate 1.1 percent increase in real personal  income tax receipts.

Selective  sales taxes generally take the form of a given amount of tax for each unit  purchased, (i.e., a unit tax).  Most states, for example, levy a tax on gasoline  which takes the form of a certain number of cents per gallon.  Because the  amount of the unit tax is adjusted only periodically, selective sales tax  receipts tend to grow less rapidly than the value of the sales on which they  are levied and less than incomes.  Accordingly, we estimated the  responsiveness of selective sales tax receipts to income rather than the  responsiveness of the tax base to income.

The relationship between budget outcomes  and the sector\u2019s financial position is shown in the following accounting  identity: total receipts - total expenditures =  change in financial assets - change in financial liabilities For a given difference between total receipts and total expenditures, that  is, the value of net lending or borrowing, various combinations of changes  in financial assets and changes in financial liabilities can satisfy this  identity.  To leverage this relationship for our projections we use two  methods.  The first applies when net lending or borrowing is in its historical  range.

Each group\u2019s real benefit is linked to the real wage  level in the average year of retirement for that group.

This analysis then enables a derivation  of weights for each of the three groups as follows:    weight for new retirees:  the number of beneficiaries this year, less the  number of beneficiaries last year who are still alive, divided by the  number of beneficiaries this year;  weight for continuing recipients is equal to last year\u2019s beneficiaries  divided by this year\u2019s beneficiaries; and   weight for the deceased is the death rate multiplied by last year\u2019s  beneficiaries divided by this year\u2019s beneficiaries.", "Next, we identied the real employment cost index that determines the real  benefit level for each of these three groups.

For the  newly retired group, we use the given year\u2019s employment cost index.  For  the remaining retirees\u2014those already retired and remaining in the group\u2014 we use information from CPS for 2005 which indicated that the average age  of a retired state or local retiree was 68.

The necessary contribution rate can now be derived according to  straightforward logic:  the benefits that are promised to employees  (including liabilities already made and promises that will be made in the  future) must be paid from three sources:  (1) existing pension fund assets  at our starting point in 2006, (2) contributions that employees will continue  to make to those funds in the future, and (3) contributions that employers  will make to those funds in the future.  Mathematically we start with the  present value of future pension benefits.  We then subtract two things:  the  value of pension fund financial assets in 2006\u2014which was approximately  $2.979 trillion\u2014and the present value of employee contributions.  The  present value of the remaining liability is the value that the governments  must fund.  We then divide that present value by the present value of future  wages.  This yields the steady level of employer contribution, relative to  wages, that would need to be made in every year between 2006 and 2050 to  fully fund promised pension benefits.", "Although we are only interested in developing necessary contribution rates  over the simulation time frame\u2014that is, until 2050\u2014we actually have to  derive the contribution rate for a longer time frame in order to find the  steady level of necessary contributions.  This longer time frame is required  because the estimated contribution rate increases as the projection horizon  increases and eventually converges to a steady state.  If the projection  period is of insufficient length, the steady level of contribution is not  attained and the necessary contribution rate is understated. As such, all of  the flows in the calculation extend 400 years into the future.  We use a real  rate of return on pension assets of 5.0 percent to discount future flows  when deriving present values.", "Applying this analysis, we found that in aggregate, state and local  government contributions to pension funds would need to increase by less  than half a percent to fund, on an ongoing basis, the pension liabilities they  have and will continue to incur.  In particular, the 2006 pension  contributions for the sector amounted to 9 percent of wages, and our base- case estimate is that the level would need to be 9.3 percent each year to  fully fund pensions.", "To examine the sensitivity of our model results we altered our assumptions  regarding the expected real yield, and found that the model results are  highly sensitive to this rate.  For our primary simulations, we based the  expected real yield on actual returns on various investment instruments  over the last 40 years as well as the disposition of the portfolio of assets  held by the sector over the last 10 years.  This generated a real yield of 5  percent.  But some pension experts have expressed concern that returns on  equities in the future may not be quite as high as those in the past.  In fact,  some analysts believe that an analysis of this type should only consider  \u201criskless returns.\u201d  Under such an approach we would assume that all  pension funds are invested in very safe financial instruments such as  government bonds.  We estimated the necessary steady level of employer  contributions holding all elements in the model stable except the real  expected yield.  In particular, we analyzed a 4 percent real yield and a 3  percent real yield\u2014the latter of which is a reasonable proxy for a riskless  rate of return.  We found that if returns were only 4 percent, the necessary  contribution rate would rise to 13.4 percent, and if we used a risk-free  return of roughly 3 percent, the necessary contribution rates would need to  be much higher\u2014nearly 18.1 percent of wages.

To estimate expenditures for employee and retiree health insurance  in future years, we made many of the same assumptions as for the pension  analysis.  In particular, we use the same method to develop projections of  employment in the sector, the number of retirees, and the level of wages.   An additional assumption for the health care analysis is that in future years,  the same percentage of employees and retirees of state and local  governments will be enrolled in health insurance through their previous  employer as we observe were enrolled in 2004\u2014the most recent year for  which data were available.  For retirees, we developed this measure from  two data sources.  The Census Bureau\u2019s State and Local Government  Employee-Retirement System survey provided data on the total number of  state and local retirees, and the Health and Human Services Department\u2019s  Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) provided data on state and local  government retirees who are covered by employer-provided health  insurance.

For  active employees we also used MEPS data on employees covered by health  insurance and compared that to BEA data on the total employment in the  sector.  This provided us with a finding that 71 percent of active employees  are receiving health benefits.  Again, we hold this value constant during the  simulation time frame.", "One of the most central assumptions we must make to estimate the pay-as- you-go health care expenditures for employees and retirees in future years  is the cost growth of health care itself.  The cost of health care has been  increasing faster than gross domestic product (GDP) for many years.  As  such, we developed assumptions about how much faster health care costs  would grow, relative to the economy, in future years.  The extent to which  the per-person cost of health care is expected to grow beyond GDP per  capita is called the \u201cexcess cost factor.\u201d  We developed these estimates  based on our own research and discussions with experts.

As with the projections of necessary pension contributions, our estimates  of these expenditures are highly sensitive to certain of our assumptions.  In  particular, the assumptions regarding health care cost growth are critical.   For example, if health costs were to only rise at the rate of GDP per capita,  expenditures for retiree health care would only grow, as a percentage of  wages, from 2.1 percent today to 3.0 percent by 2050.
