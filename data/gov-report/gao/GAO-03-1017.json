The service academies receive more than 10,000 applications  each year. Academy admissions officials screen all applicants and identify  those who they believe could succeed at the academies but who would  benefit from more preparation. The preparatory schools provide an  alternative avenue for these applicants to gain admission to the academies.  The Department of Defense (DOD) pays the full cost of providing  academic preparation, military orientation, and physical conditioning. In  fiscal year 2002, DOD reported that costs per graduate for the U.S. Air  Force Academy Preparatory School, the U.S. Military Academy  Preparatory School, and the U.S. Naval Academy Preparatory School were  $30,842, $41,859, and $40,850, respectively.", "The House report on defense appropriations for fiscal year 2003 directed  that we review the three service academies and their preparatory schools.  As part of our review of the service academies, we reviewed DOD  oversight and admissions issues at all three service academies.

Based on  our review of the service academies, we recommended that the Secretary  of Defense, in concert with the services, enhance performance goals and  measures to improve oversight of the academies\u2019 operations and  performance. These issues are addressed in separate reports. This report  addresses our review of all three service academy preparatory schools. As  agreed with your offices, we assessed (1) the adequacy of the current  mission statements of the preparatory schools, (2) the effectiveness of the  preparatory schools in accomplishing their missions, and (3) the  effectiveness of DOD oversight of the preparatory schools.", "In addition to interviewing officials at all three preparatory schools, the  academies, the service headquarters, and DOD\u2019s Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (OUSD/P&R), we  reviewed the adequacy of the preparatory schools\u2019 mission statements and  pertinent DOD guidance. To assess the effectiveness of the preparatory  schools in accomplishing their missions, we analyzed aggregate  preparatory school performance data for preparatory school academic  years 1993 through 2002 for four target groups of students common to all  preparatory schools: (1) enlisted personnel, (2) minorities, (3) recruited  athletes, and (4) women. Our analysis included preparatory school  admissions and graduation data for each target group.

The U.S. Air  Force Academy Preparatory School is co-located with the U.S. Air Force  Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The U.S. Military Academy  Preparatory School is located at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, and the U.S.  Naval Academy Preparatory School is located in Newport, Rhode Island.   (See fig 1.)", "During World War I, the Secretaries of the Army and the Navy nominated  enlisted personnel to their respective service academies. Many of the first  enlisted personnel did poorly on service academy entrance examinations,  and many of the slots that were created for them went unfilled. To coach  enlisted nominees for service academy entrance examinations, Army and  Navy officials formally established the Military Academy and Naval  Academy preparatory schools in 1946 and 1920, respectively. (The U.S. Air  Force Academy was created in 1954, and its preparatory school in 1961.)  The preparatory schools have evolved over the years and become more  diverse. Today, the student bodies of these schools consist of enlisted  personnel, minorities, recruited athletes, and women (see table 1).", "To be admitted to a preparatory school, an applicant must meet basic  eligibility requirements. Because applicants to the academies must (1) be  unmarried, (2) be a U.S. citizen, (3) be at least 17 years of age and must not  have passed their twenty-third birthday on July 1 of the year they enter an  academy, (4) have no dependents, and (5) be of good moral character, the  preparatory schools apply the same requirements.", "The preparatory schools do not charge for tuition. The enlisted personnel  who are selected to attend the preparatory schools are reassigned to the  preparatory schools as their duty stations, and these enlisted personnel  continue to be paid at the grades they earned before enrolling. Civilians  who are selected to attend the preparatory schools enlist in the reserves  and are paid about $700 per month. Enlisted personnel must complete  their military obligations if they do not complete the programs or go on to  one of the academies. Civilian students do not incur any financial or  further military obligation if they do not complete the programs or go on  to one of the academies. However, they also do not accrue any  transferable college credits while attending the preparatory schools.", "The preparatory schools offer a 10-month course of instruction that  combines academic instruction, physical conditioning, and an orientation  to military life. The daily schedule includes several hours of classroom  instruction, mandatory study time, and extra instruction; time for athletics  or physical training; and some instruction in military customs and  practices. Emphasis is placed on giving each candidate as much tutorial  assistance as is necessary to maximize the individual\u2019s potential for  success. The student body at each school is organized into a military unit  with a student chain of command that is advised by commissioned and  noncommissioned officers. This structure is intended to provide the  students with exposure to military discipline and order.", "In fiscal year 2002, DOD reported that the total cost to operate all three  preparatory schools was about $22 million (see table 2). We did not  independently verify or evaluate these costs.", "OUSD/P&R, the service headquarters, and the service academies have  established clear roles and responsibilities for oversight of the preparatory  schools. According to DOD Directive 1322.22 (Service Academies), the  Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness has  responsibility to assess the operations and establish policy and guidance  for uniform oversight and management of the service academies and their  preparatory schools. The service headquarters perform their oversight  over their respective academies and preparatory schools in accordance  with the directive. The superintendent of each academy reports directly to  the uniformed head of his respective service (the Chiefs of Staff for the  Army and the Air Force and the Chief of Naval Operations for the Navy), in  accordance with the chain of command for each service. The academies  perform the primary DOD oversight function for their respective  preparatory schools. The commanding officers at the Air Force and Army  preparatory schools hold the rank of colonel, and the head of the Navy\u2019s  preparatory school holds the equivalent rank of captain. They report  directly to the superintendent of their respective service academies, in  accordance with the chain of command for each service.", "Appendix II provides general information about the three service academy  preparatory schools."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Preparatory School Missions Are Not Clearly Defined", "paragraphs": ["The three preparatory schools\u2019 current mission statements do not clearly  define the purpose for which the schools are being used by their  respective service academies.

Without a clear mission statement, the  organization cannot establish goals that fully reflect the organization\u2019s  intended purpose.", "Although the preparatory schools exist to help the service academies meet  their diversity needs, the schools\u2019 mission statements simply refer to  preparing \u201cselected personnel who meet special needs,\u201d \u201cselected  candidates,\u201d or \u201ccandidates\u201d for admission to and success at the service  academies. These mission statements are not clearly aligned with DOD  guidance, which states that primary consideration for enrollment shall be  accorded to nominees to fill officer objectives for three target groups:   (1) enlisted personnel, (2) minorities, and (3) women. Senior academy  officials told us that their expectations of the preparatory schools are  consistent with DOD guidance on enrollment objectives and that they also  rely on the preparatory schools to meet their needs for a fourth group\u2014 recruited athletes\u2014adding that the service academies would not be able to  meet their diversity needs if the preparatory schools did not exist.  However, neither DOD nor the service academies have required the  preparatory schools to align their mission statements to reflect DOD\u2019s  guidance and the service academies\u2019 expectations. As a result, none of the  mission statements are explicit about the preparatory schools\u2019 intended  purpose. Table 3 presents more detailed information on the preparatory  schools\u2019 mission statements.", "Even though the mission statements are not explicit about the schools\u2019  intended purpose, data on the number of students belonging to target  groups who enter the preparatory schools and then enter the service  academies indicate that, in practice, the schools are giving primary  consideration for enrollment to those target groups identified by the DOD  directive and the service academies\u2014namely, enlisted personnel,  minorities, recruited athletes, and women\u2014and are primarily preparing  those student groups for admission to the service academies. Preparatory  school and service academy admissions data over a 10-year period  indicate that the preparatory schools are a source for the academies of  target groups\u2014enlisted personnel, minorities, recruited athletes, and  women\u2014identified by DOD guidance and service academy officials.

We  recommended that the Secretary of Defense determine what role the  preparatory schools should play among the services\u2019 officer production  programs and direct the services to clarify their school missions  accordingly. To address this lack of clarity, DOD indicated that it planned  to work with the services to develop a consistent mission statement for  these schools that would be approved by May 1992.
