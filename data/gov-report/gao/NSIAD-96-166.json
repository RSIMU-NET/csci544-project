Depot maintenance involves repairing, overhauling, and modifying and upgrading defense systems and equipment. It also includes limited manufacture of parts, technical support, modifications, testing, and reclamation as well as software maintenance. About $2 billion is spent on contractor logistics support, interim contractor support, and labor used to install some major modifications and parts of depot software maintenance, which are contracted to the private sector using procurement, rather than operation and maintenance funds. Depot maintenance is accomplished in both the DOD depot system and by about 1,300 defense contractors. Currently, there are 29 DOD depot maintenance facilities; 15 depots have been or are in the process of being closed. The DOD depot system employs about 89,000 DOD civilian personnel. This is 43 percent lower than the employment level in the peak year, 1987.", "The depot maintenance workload mix has been the subject of considerable debate in recent years. Historically, depot maintenance on most wartime critical systems was largely performed in DOD depots. The peacetime workload for such critical systems constituted what is referred to as depot maintenance core workload. During the Cold War, there was not much pressure to move work from DOD depots to the private sector. Military leaders expressed a clear preference for retaining much of their work in DOD depots. They expressed the view that the defense depots were highly flexible and responsive to changing military requirements and priorities and produced high-quality work. However, with the end of the Cold War and the subsequent declines in defense spending, there is now increased pressure to privatize more depot maintenance work. As acquisition programs began to decline, a growing concern focused on how the industrial base can be maintained without large development and production programs. Attention began to shift to DOD depot workloads as a potential source of work to keep the industrial base viable and reduce DOD infrastructure costs.", "Efforts to increase the private sector\u2019s share are affected by several statutes that relate to the mix of maintenance work performed by the public and private sectors. Three of the most significant statutes affecting the workload mix are 10 U.S.C. 2464, 10 U.S.C. 2466, and 10 U.S.C. 2469. Title 10 U.S.C. 2464 provides that DOD activities should maintain a logistics capability sufficient to ensure technical competence and resources necessary for an effective and timely response to a mobilization or other national defense emergency. Title 10 U.S.C. 2466 prohibits the use of more than 40 percent of the funds made available in a fiscal year for depot-level maintenance or repair for private sector performance: the so-called \u201c60/40\u201d rule. Title 10 U.S.C. 2469 provides that DOD-performed depot maintenance and repair workloads valued at $3 million or more cannot be changed to another DOD activity without the use of merit-based selection procedures or changed to contractor performance without the use of competitive procedures for competitions among private and public sector entities. In recent years DOD has sought relief from statutes DOD officials believe limit their flexibility to contract out additional depot maintenance workloads\u2014including 10 U.S.C. 2466 and 2469 and other statutes affecting competition and privatization.", "Directions for Defense, the 1995 report of the Commission on Roles and Missions, recommended that DOD privatize most existing depot maintenance work and all support for new and future weapon systems. In his letter forwarding the Commission Report to Congress, the Secretary of Defense agreed with the Commission\u2019s recommendations but expressed a need for DOD to retain a limited organic core capability to meet essential wartime surge demands, promote competition, and sustain institutional expertise. DOD established joint teams and working groups to plan and direct efforts aimed at increasing privatization and outsourcing. DOD\u2019s January 1996 Plan for Increasing Depot Maintenance Privatization and Outsourcing provides for substantially increasing reliance on the private sector.", "Section 311 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 reiterated long-standing congressional support for maintaining core capabilities within DOD depots as essential to national security. Congress found that DOD did not have a comprehensive policy regarding the performance of depot-level maintenance and repair and expressed a compelling need for DOD to (1) articulate known and anticipated core maintenance and repair requirements, (2) organize its resources to meet those requirements economically and efficiently, and (3) determine what work should be performed by the private sector and how such work should be managed. Congress specified that DOD submit a policy report that provides for properly sizing depot capabilities to meet security requirements effectively and efficiently, competition between public and private entities for noncore workload, and performance of maintenance and repair for any new weapon systems defined as core in facilities owned and operated by the United States.", "Section 311 also required DOD to provide a workload distribution report that included (1) an analysis of the need for 10 U.S.C. 2466\u2014the 60/40 rule, its effects on readiness and national security, and a description of specific difficulties experienced by DOD as a result of that requirement; (2) an analysis of the public-private distribution of depot maintenance and repair workloads for fiscal years 1991 through 1995; and (3) a projection of the public-private workload distribution for fiscal years 1997 through 2001.", "The act also required us to analyze and report to Congress on each of these reports within 45 days of their submission.

The report stated that the provision has influenced DOD\u2019s approach to depot maintenance management and cited various types of privatization options that the rule has precluded. It noted that such options could be more cost-effective. The report does not cite any readiness effects, adverse or otherwise. If the 60/40 provision is repealed, DOD\u2019s policy preference for privatizing depot maintenance could result in a large shift of work from the public to the private sector. Under current conditions, a large shift to the private sector, if not properly managed, could result in a more costly depot maintenance system and could increase readiness risks. We found that (1) depot workload competition is limited and privatization without competition may not achieve expected savings, (2) privatization could increase public depot excess capacity and increase depot maintenance costs, and (3) privatization of some mission-essential workloads could increase readiness risks."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Readiness Not Seen as a Problem", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s workload distribution report did not cite any direct effects of the 60/40 provision on military readiness or national security.

Further, the report noted that relief from 10 U.S.C. 2466 would allow DOD to consider lower cost depot maintenance options, such as establishing government-owned and contractor-operated operations, outsourcing new systems, teaming with industry, and using contract employees at DOD facilities.", "Section 311 also provided that the DOD report describe any specific difficulties experienced as a result of the 60/40 provision. Although the report indicated the section 2466 requirement has influenced the Department\u2019s approach to depot management for some time, it provided no examples of particular instances when the 60/40 provision has inhibited the Department from contracting out depot maintenance workload that it wanted to privatize. We asked service officials to identify examples of this situation, but only the Army was able to identify one. According to Army officials, when DOD was conducting public-private competitions, one planned Army aviation public-private competition was changed to a public-public competition. This was done because of concern that if a contractor won the competition, the resulting reallocation of Army aviation maintenance would have violated the 60/40 rule for this particular Army commodity, although not for the Army as a whole. This situation caused the Army to discontinue public-private competitions for aviation programs before DOD terminated the program.", "DOD officials noted that they have not experienced negative effects on military readiness resulting from 60/40. Further, DOD depots historically have produced high-quality work and have been responsive to the needs of military commanders. The issue is whether, as DOD reported, the 60/40 provision limited the Department\u2019s flexibility to move depot maintenance workloads to the private sector, where contractor maintenance can be more cost-effective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Management Flexibility Is the Key Concern", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s workload distribution report emphasized that DOD needs the flexibility to make source of repair decisions without being constrained by mandated limits. However, DOD officials acknowledged that given the current methodology for computing public-private workload mix, the services have some latitude to contract out additional depot maintenance work without breaching the 40-percent threshold for almost all services and commodities. Using the 60/40 rule and the current methodology for developing the mix for fiscal year 1996, we estimate that the Air Force can contract out additional workloads valued at $559 million, the Army $69 million, the Marine Corps $40 million, the naval aviation community $33 million, and the naval ship community $223 million. As discussed later in our report, we are concerned that the current methodology for computing the public-private workload mix overstates the public sector\u2019s share and understates the private sector\u2019s share.", "DOD\u2019s workload report states that relief from the 60/40 rule is needed to permit a shift in the workload mix to the private sector and that the Department has developed a reasonable, quantitative approach for identifying the need for and size of required organic core capabilities. However, as discussed in our companion report analyzing DOD\u2019s depot maintenance policy report, DOD\u2019s new core methodology is based on subjective judgments of risks\u2014the procedures and criteria for which have not yet been established. Further, DOD\u2019s depot maintenance policy limits DOD depots from competing with the private sector for noncore workloads, even though the current DOD depot market is not highly competitive, which limits the potential for privatization savings. Lastly, DOD depots that will remain open after completion of depot closures directed by previous Base Realignment and Closure processes, have substantial excess capacity\u2014a factor that also reduces potential cost-saving opportunities resulting from large-scale privatizations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Depot Maintenance Market Is Not Highly Competitive", "paragraphs": ["Although DOD\u2019s workload distribution report stated that privatization would lower depot maintenance costs, DOD offered no documentation to show that its plans to rapidly increase the private sector\u2019s share of depot maintenance workload will be cost-effective. Our work has found that privatization savings result primarily from market place competition and that such an environment does not currently exist for many depot maintenance workloads.", "While the DOD policy discusses competition for depot maintenance work, we found that the actual contracting environment for most types of equipment is largely noncompetitive. We asked 12 DOD buying commands to identify depot maintenance contracts that were open during 1995. They identified 8,452 contracts valued at $7.3 billion. We selected  240 high-dollar value contracts valued at $4.3 billion to analyze the commands\u2019 use of competitive procedures for the contracted workloads. Table 1 shows the results of our analysis.", "As shown, the 12 buying commands awarded 182, or 76 percent, of the contracts through sole-source negotiation; 49, or 20 percent, through full and open competition; and 9, or 4 percent, through limited competition. The 49 fully competitive awards accounted for about 51 percent of the total dollar value, while the 182 sole-source contracts accounted for about 45 percent of the dollar value.", "In reviewing the number of offerors for the 49 contracts valued at  $2.2 billion that were awarded through full and open competition, we found that the commands averaged 3.6 offers for the 49 contracts\u2014 ranging from a low of only 2 offers to a high of 10. For 30 of the 49 contracts\u2014about 86 percent of the $2.2 billion\u2014the number of offers was 4 or less. Five contracts valued at $525.8 million had only 2 offers, while only 19 contracts valued at $309.4 million had 5 or more offers.", "A large portion of the dollar value of the contracts went to 71 contractors. Of these 71 contractors, 13 had about 76 percent of the $4.3 billion. Three of these 13 contractors had workload valued at $1.3 billion\u201430 percent of the $4.3 billion.", "The private sector market was more competitive for certain types of systems and equipment than for others. For example, competitive awards were more frequent for repair of ground vehicles, trucks, airframes, engines, and other items while sole-source contracts were prevalent for fire control systems, communications and radar equipment, electronic components, and other components. We noted that one buying activity that obligates about $180 million per year for depot maintenance contracts for repair of ship components used sole-source contracts 100 percent of the time\u2014with many of the awards based on cost-type contracts. Officials said they did not have the technical data, technical manpower, or contracting skills to use competitive contracting. Additionally, officials noted that the process for qualifying repair sources is difficult and time-consuming.", "We also analyzed the impact of other conditions on competition. DOD buying commands reported that not having access to required technical data and their inability to precisely define the repair work that must be done frequently influenced their using sole-source repair contracts. The buying commands reported that adequately defining the types of depot maintenance tasks required to complete any given repair or overhaul presents a difficult challenge. For much of the depot maintenance work, specific tasks that must be done, spare and repair parts that will be required, and the type and skill level of the labor required cannot be identified until the equipment or component is inducted into the repair facility for inspection and repair. Our review of depot maintenance contracts showed the difficulty in constraining cost growth in this environment\u2014particularly when cost-type contracts are used. It also showed the large costs normally associated with drafting statements of work, conducting the competitions, and administering the contracts. DOD officials stated that because of these difficulties, DOD depots can often perform depot maintenance work more cost-effectively than contractors. For example, DOD buying commands sometimes used both DOD depots and private sector repair sources for repairing a limited number of items. To compare prices, we looked at 414 items that both sectors maintained. For 62 percent of the items, the contractor\u2019s repair price was higher than the DOD depot\u2019s price for the same item. Further, our review of DOD\u2019s public-private competition program showed that DOD depots won 67 percent of the nonship competitions.", "Given the influence that competition has on the potential for savings when outsourcing DOD work, achieving savings from contracting out depot maintenance workloads will require significant changes in the way the Department manages its contract workload. However, given that the DOD policy proposes using a contractor logistic support model for depot maintenance and that this model has historically involved sole-source contracting to the original equipment manufacturer, it is unclear that large-scale contracting will get the savings DOD states it expects to achieve."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Depot System Has Large Excess Capacity", "paragraphs": ["Another factor that must be considered when assessing the 60/40 rule is the excess capacity that exists in DOD\u2019s depot system. A combination of factors created the extensive excess capacity in the DOD depot system. These factors include (1) the downsizing of the armed forces due to the end of the Cold War; (2) efforts by some DOD components to conduct more repairs in field-level maintenance activities; (3) contracting out more depot work to the private sector; and (4) the increased reliability, maintainability, and durability of most military systems and equipment.", "While depot maintenance personnel have been reduced by 43 percent since 1987, similar depot infrastructure reductions have not been made. DOD\u2019s depot system had 40 percent excess capacity for fiscal year 1996, based on an analysis of maximum potential capacity and programmed workload as the basis for comparison and assuming a 5-day week, one 8-hour-per-day shift operation. The excess capacity varied in each service, from a low of 33 percent in naval aviation, to 35 percent for naval shipyards, 42 percent for the Army, and a high of 45 percent for the Air Force. Some initiatives have been used in recent years to reduce some of DOD\u2019s excess capacity. These initiatives include consolidating workloads, implementing competition between government depots and the private sector, mothballing depot plant equipment, and tearing down unused buildings or converting them to other military uses. However, depot downsizing has largely occurred through the Base Realignment and Closure process.", "Fifteen depots have closed or are in the process of being closed as a result of base closure decisions. Although this will eliminate some excess capacity, privatization-in-place rather than closure and consolidation of workloads in remaining depots has been proposed for seven depots. Privatization-in-place will result in privatizing excess capacity rather than eliminating it.

The data reported in DOD\u2019s historical public-private workloads for fiscal years 1991 through 1993 were extracted from data collected by the Defense Science Board. This data collection included the value of parts and services the depots purchase from the private sector as public sector costs. Some of these repair parts were provided to private sector contractors as government-furnished material and should have been reported as costs of contractor maintenance. Additionally, repair contracts awarded by DOD depots were included as public depot maintenance costs rather than private sector maintenance costs and some contractor depot maintenance costs for classified systems were not included in the private sector data. The services followed a similar approach for fiscal years 1994 and 1995. These conditions resulted in overstating the public sector\u2019s reported share of depot maintenance workload and understating the private sector\u2019s share. Reporting workload in direct labor hours would provide a more accurate picture of workload mix in that it would address the repair parts problem. Section 311 of the Authorization Act specified that, in addition to dollar values, DOD should report workload mix in direct labor hours. However, DOD\u2019s report did not include such data. DOD officials stated that they do not collect direct labor hour data from commercial contractors and could not provide such data or provide a reasonable labor hour comparison estimate.", "In 1994, we testified about our concern that repair parts and materials, maintenance and engineering services, and other goods and services procured from the private sector were included in the public sector\u2019s depot maintenance funding. Additionally, the costs associated with private contractors did not include maintenance costs for some classified systems. Further, the cost for parts and materials that were provided to contractors as government-furnished material were included as public sector rather than private sector costs. In quantifying the impact of these factors, we noted that in 1994 about $437 million of the $1.2 billion expended by Army depots in fiscal year 1993\u2014about 31 percent\u2014went to the private sector. About 21 percent of the dollars expended by the Army depots went to buy parts and material and about 10 percent for other goods and services. If these expenditures were added to the amount of depot maintenance funds spent directly in the private sector, we estimated that about 58 percent of the Army\u2019s depot maintenance budget was spent at that time in the private sector. We identified similar results in the Navy and the Air Force. Further, we found that a Defense Science Board Task Force Report estimated that the public-private ratio becomes nearly 50-50 when dollars spent at DOD depots for parts and components\u2014but purchased from the private sector\u2014are included as part of the private sector\u2019s share.

DOD officials noted that section 311 did not provide specific guidance on what data should be included in the reports. The reported projected workload data could be further understating the private share since it reflects only preliminary calculations of revised core requirements.

The Command calculated its revised ship repair core as 23.3 million direct labor hours, down 16.5 million from 39.8 million in fiscal year 1994. In revising its core computation, it used the same risk analysis process as in fiscal year 1994, which was based on the following three risk factors: the absence of an assured competitive private sector source of depot-level maintenance and modernization; scenario numerical requirements in relation to total ship-class inventory (number of ships in class compared with scenario requirement); and unique maintenance requirement, including large deck ship drydocking and maintenance, complex combatant modernization and depot-level maintenance, nuclear ship defueling or refueling, maintenance and modernization engineering, and battle damage repair.", "Each class containing ships specified by the Joint Chiefs of Staff contingency scenarios was evaluated on the basis of the above risk factors. If there were no risk factors present, the ship class was classified as low risk and considered noncore. If one or two risk factors were present, the class was considered moderate and could be considered core or noncore. If all three risk factors were present, the class was placed in the high-risk category and considered core. These ships are assigned to the public or private sector on the basis of assured capability. Naval shipyards were assigned 43 scenario ships as core, while private shipyards were assigned 148 scenario ships on the basis of assured capability.", "The results of the revised risk assessment were the same as the results in 1994. However, to better reflect workload schedule realities, such as homeporting issues and split work packages on aircraft carriers, the closure or planned closure of 4 naval shipyards, and the planned deactivation of four ballistic missile submarines, Navy officials said that they reduced the 1994 requirement by 11 ships. This reduction includes the planned deactivations of the four ballistic missile submarines and seven ships that will move from pre-risk core to mission-essential but noncore in the private sector\u2014two ballistic missile submarines, two aircraft carriers, two amphibious ships, and one surface combatant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Naval Aviation", "paragraphs": ["Using the data provided in the workload report, the public-private sector mix in 2001 is projected to be 55/45 for naval aviation.

The naval aviation workload data shows a $62-million decline in projected contract workload between 1997 and 2001, and a $120-million decline in projected DOD depot workload over this period.", "The Naval Aviation Systems Command did not use the revised core methodology when calculating its core requirements. Accordingly, the computation did not change from the 13-million direct labor hour requirement previously identified. Navy officials stated that a contractor is helping to develop a risk assessment methodology, but this has not yet been completed. When a methodology is approved and risk assessments are completed for core workloads, the Navy\u2019s core requirements will be revised.", "Given the current status of its reassessment, the revised projected workload distribution for naval aviation was developed using the assumption that workload valued at $184 million that had been identified as noncore using the old criteria would be privatized. This workload includes various engine overhauls; modifications and upgrades on the F-14 aircraft; maintenance work on missiles, components, ground support equipment, gear boxes, and torque meters; and scheduled depot-level maintenance on various aircraft.
