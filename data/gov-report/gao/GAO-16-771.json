It also has established an audit program for covered entities' security and privacy programs. However, for some of its investigations it provided technical assistance that was not pertinent to identified problems, and in other cases it did not always follow up to ensure that agreed-upon corrective actions were taken once investigative cases were closed.

For example, the Privacy Rule provides the right  to request restrictions on uses and disclosures of PHI, the right to  adequate notification of privacy practices, the right of access to PHI, and  the right to request amendments to inaccurate or incomplete PHI. The  Privacy Rule also requires that covered entities and business associates  employ appropriate safeguards for protecting PHI.", "The Security Rule establishes nationwide standards for safeguarding PHI  that is held or transferred electronically. It operationalizes the protections  contained in the Privacy Rule by specifying administrative, technical, and  physical security practices to secure individuals\u2019 electronic protected  health information (ePHI).

Electronic sharing of health information is  especially important because the health care system is highly  fragmented, with care and services provided in multiple settings, such as  physician offices and hospitals, that may not be coordinated. Because of  this fragmentation, providers may lack ready access to critical information  needed to coordinate the care of patients and to ensure that informed  decisions are made about the best treatment options. Lack of care  coordination can lead to inappropriate or duplicative tests and procedures  that can increase health risks to patients and poorer patient outcomes.

Sharing clinical data using manual methods such as faxing paper  records can be time consuming and costly and may be unavailable at the  point of care. In addition, data shared via manual methods are generally  not formatted so that they can be easily accessed by other electronic  systems or stored in EHRs. Lacking the ability to access and store  manual data in their systems, providers may not be able to easily find the  information they need or electronically transmit it to another provider.

For example, the office has established  a system for individuals to submit complaints about potential data  breaches or other potential violations of the HIPAA Security and Privacy  Rules, which it may investigate if warranted and based on resource  availability. HHS also provides covered entities a reporting system to  notify OCR of data breaches. The office assesses these cases to  determine whether to initiate investigations. In addition, OCR can initiate  its own investigations based on factors such as media reports, patterns of  repeat violations, or referrals from other government organizations,  among other instigating events.", "OCR receives thousands of individual consumer complaints every year,  and the number has been growing. For example, OCR reported receiving  17,779 complaints regarding the potential violations of HIPAA rules in  2014; 12,974 in 2013; and 10,457 in 2012. To address the high volume of  cases that it receives, OCR has implemented a triage process where a  central intake unit reviews all complaints as they are submitted and  decides whether to (1) forward the complaint to a regional office for  further review and potential investigation, (2) provide \u201ctechnical  assistance\u201d in lieu of an investigation, or (3) decline to investigate.", "Of the many complaints it receives, OCR opens investigations of  relatively few. Analysis of OCR case files shows that a variety of factors  limit the number of investigations. Reasons OCR may decline to  investigate a complaint include a lack of jurisdiction, a lack of consent  from an individual to disclose information to the entity being investigated,  allegations that would not constitute a violation of the Security and  Privacy Rules, or covered entities no longer being in business. In some  cases, instead of opening an investigation, the office may provide  technical assistance intended to clarify the responsibilities of covered  entities or how to implement specific aspects of the Security and Privacy  Rules.", "According to OCR officials, if the office conducts a complaint  investigation, it has several options for reaching a resolution. It may  conclude that no violation has occurred or that corrective actions have  already been taken that address any identified deficiencies. Some  investigations may result in a resolution agreement, which may contain  items such as a binding corrective action plan, settlements, or  requirements for reporting to HHS on progress. Consistent with the  regulation, the office seeks primarily to resolve complaints through  informal means and technical assistance and resorts to fines only in  cases where the organization will not comply or in cases of willful neglect.

According to OCR officials,  and consistent with regulation, providing technical assistance is a way to  address cases that would otherwise be closed without an investigation.  For the 2015 period we reviewed, in most of the cases where technical  assistance was provided in lieu of a full investigation the guidance  documents provided were relevant to the issue. However, for 12 of the 94  cases we reviewed the technical assistance was not directly applicable to  the submitted complaint.", "For example, in one case, a complaint was submitted about a covered  entity using easily guessed passwords to secure protected health  information before e-mailing it to individuals. HHS closed this complaint  by sending the covered entity a checklist for securing postal mail and  faxes rather than guidance for protecting e-mail. In several other cases  complaints were made about ePHI being inappropriately accessible on a  covered entity\u2019s website. OCR provided guidance to the entities on  password protections for workstations, which was not relevant to the  identified website problem.", "According to OCR officials, the reason that technical assistance does not  always address identified problems is that OCR has only limited technical  assistance guidance on hand, which may not always directly address  identified issues, and there is no review process to ensure that it is  consistent and relevant. OCR officials stated that resource limitations  have prevented them from developing a more comprehensive set of  technical guidance or establishing a review process. As a result, some  complaints are closed with organizations receiving limited guidance on  how to achieve compliance.

However, in 13 of the 205  cases we reviewed where corrective actions were identified, such actions  were not addressed before closure.", "In one case HHS concluded that a covered entity that had suffered a  breach had failed to fully address several key elements of the Security  and Privacy Rules. Specifically, the entity had not completed a risk  assessment or risk management plan, had not trained its staff  appropriately, did not have written policies and procedures for securing  protected health information, and did not use encryption. Although the  entity reported implementing improved encryption and data loss  prevention software, it had not provided evidence of instituting the  required training, establishing the required HIPAA compliance policies, or  conducting the required enterprise-wide risk assessment and risk  management plan. Nevertheless, HHS closed the investigation with these  significant issues outstanding. In its close-out letter, HHS encouraged the  entity to revisit its training policies and HIPAA compliance policies and  reminded it of its responsibilities to perform a risk assessment and create  a new risk management plan.", "OCR requires monitoring of corrective actions for up to 3 years in cases  where it and an entity under its jurisdiction enter into a settlement  agreement. However in other cases, OCR does not generally follow up on  investigations where corrective actions are ongoing or where such actions  have not yet been fully implemented. HHS officials stated that the  covered entities and business associates understand that not addressing  identified issues could result in more serious enforcement actions if a  repeat issue were identified in future investigations. HHS cited a lack of  resources as the reason that it did not follow up with covered entities to  ensure that corrective actions were being implemented before closing  cases. OCR officials told us that they considered it a better use of  resources to open and pursue new investigations rather than tie up  resources waiting for covered entities to provide evidence that corrective  actions had been taken. According to these officials, follow-up is resource  intensive due to the need to constantly reassess an entity\u2019s progress and  the quality of the actions it takes. Yet, without follow up, OCR cannot  determine whether corrective actions have actually been made to address  identified problems or whether covered entities have responded to  technical assistance with improvements to their electronic health  information protections.

For example, according to OCR officials, the revised protocol  makes the purpose of the audits clearer and provides more specific  information about the types of documents and time frames involved in an  audit. OCR has announced that it will begin an initial round of audits in  2016 by selecting and reviewing 224 covered entities and business  associates. The audits will be a combination of desk audits and on-site  reviews.

For example, the final report from their  pilot project identified developing risk analyses and risk management  plans as a challenge for many entities.", "OCR has not yet determined the proportion of audits that will be desk  audits versus site visits but expects the majority to be desk audits due to  resource constraints. Desk audits are designed to be less-intensive  document reviews that assess whether organizations have produced  artifacts such as policies, procedures, and assessments as required  under the Security, Breach Notification, and Privacy Rules. For site visits  a team of assessors visits an organization for 2 to 5 days and conducts  artifact reviews, interviews with organization personnel, and some  verification of implementation. According to OCR officials, these reviews  may include visual inspection of physical security controls but will not  include technical control testing, such as scanning servers for software  vulnerabilities.", "An important piece of implementing effective internal controls, such as  audit programs, is establishing performance measurements for  management objectives such as these.

We also reviewed  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards and  guidance, including the Cybersecurity Framework and Special Publication  800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems, to  identify baseline security and privacy controls that are recommended for  consideration when conducting security risk assessments. We compared  these controls to those cited in HHS\u2019s security risk assessment guidance  to identify potential gaps in the guidance.

Specifically, we obtained and analyzed key documents, such as  notification letters and closure letters, associated with 205 cases that  OCR determined required a corrective action and 94 cases where OCR  provided technical assistance in lieu of investigation. Estimates based on  a probability sample are subject to sampling error. Because we followed a  probability procedure based on random selections, our sample is only one  of a large number of samples that we might have drawn. Since each  sample could have provided different estimates, we express our  confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95  percent confidence interval (e.g., plus or minus 10 percentage points).  This is the interval that would contain the actual population value for 95  percent of the samples we could have drawn.
