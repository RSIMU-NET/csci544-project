Effective execution of the project is critical given the potential effect further cost increases could have on NASA's science portfolio. The project was rebaselined in 2011 with a 78 percent life-cycle cost estimate increase --now $8.8 billion--and a launch delay of 52 months--now October 2018. GAO has made a number of prior recommendations, including that the project perform an updated cost and schedule risk analysis to improve cost estimates. GAO was mandated to assess the program annually and report on its progress. This is the second such report.", "This report assesses the (1) extent to which the JWST project is meeting its cost and schedule commitments and maintaining oversight, (2) current major technological challenges facing the project, (3) extent to which cost risks exist that may threaten the project's ability to execute as planned, and (4) extent to which the JWST project schedule is reliable based on scheduling best practices. GAO reviewed relevant NASA and contractor documents, interviewed NASA and contractor officials, and compared the project schedule with best practices criteria."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) project is generally executing to its September 2011 revised cost and schedule baseline; however, several challenges remain that could affect continued progress. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has requested funding that is in line with the rebaseline and the project is maintaining 14 months of schedule reserve prior to its launch date. Performance data from the prime contractor indicate that generally work is being accomplished on schedule and at the cost expected; however, monthly performance declined in fiscal year 2013. Project officials have maintained and enhanced project oversight by, for example, continuing quarterly NASA and contractor management meetings and instituting a tool to update cost estimates for internal efforts. Program officials, however, are not planning to perform an updated integrated cost/schedule risk analysis, as GAO recommended in 2012, stating that the project performs monthly integrated risk analyses they believe are adequate. Updating the more comprehensive analysis with a more refined schedule and current risks, however, would provide management and stakeholders with better information to gauge progress.", "The JWST project has made progress addressing some technical challenges that GAO reported in 2012, such as inadequate spacecraft mass margin, but others have persisted, causing subsystem development delays and cost increases. For example, the development and delivery schedule of the cryocooler--which cools one instrument--was deemed unattainable by the subcontractor due to technical issues and its contract was modified in August 2013 for the second time in less than 2 years, leading to a cumulative 120 percent increase in contract costs. While recent modifications have been made, execution of the cryocooler remains a concern given that technical performance and schedule issues persist.", "Overall the project is maintaining a significant amount of cost reserves; however, low levels of near-term cost reserves could limit its ability to continue to meet future cost and schedule commitments. Development challenges have required the project to allocate a significant portion of cost reserves in fiscal year 2014. Adequate cost reserves for the prime contractor are also a concern in fiscal years 2014 and 2015 given the rate at which these cost reserves are being used. Limited reserves could require work to be extended or work to address project risks to be deferred--a contributing factor to the project's prior performance issues. Potential sequestration and funding challenges on other major NASA projects could limit the project's ability to address near-term challenges.", "GAO's analysis of three subsystem schedules determined that the reliability of the project's integrated master schedule--which is dependent on the reliability of JWST's subsystem schedules--is questionable. GAO's analysis found that the Optical Telescope Element (OTE) schedule was unreliable because it could not adequately identify a critical path--the earliest completion date or minimum duration it will take to complete all project activities, which informs officials of the effects that a slip of one activity may have on other activities. In addition, reliable schedule risk analyses of the OTE, the cryocooler, or the Integrated Science Instrument Module schedules were not performed. A schedule risk analysis is a best practice that gives confidence that estimates are credible based on known risks so the schedule can be relied upon to track progress."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider directing NASA to perform an updated integrated cost/schedule risk analysis.

Effective execution of the JWST project is critical given the tradeoffs that  the agency made to ensure that it was well-funded and the potential  impact that any future cost increases or delays could have on the health  of NASA\u2019s overall science portfolio. Specifically, based on the cost and  schedule estimates established in 2011, the cost of the project is almost  nine times the cost in its original plan established in 1999, and the impact  of funding JWST for more years than originally anticipated has  significantly decreased the amount of funds NASA has available to begin  work on other major projects. NASA will have the opportunity over the  next few years, during the course of several very complex test events, to  demonstrate the credibility of the 2011 plan.

In our first report, issued in 2012, we assessed the reliability of NASA\u2019s  revised cost estimate based on best practices, the major risks and  technological challenges facing the project, and NASA\u2019s oversight of the  JWST project. This report is our second in response to that mandate. For  this report, we assessed (1) the extent to which the JWST project is  meeting its cost and schedule commitments and maintaining oversight,  (2) the current major technological challenges facing the JWST project,  (3) the extent to which cost risks exist that may threaten the project\u2019s  ability to execute as planned, and (4) the extent to which the JWST  project schedule is reliable based on scheduling best practices.", "Our approach included an examination of the overall cost and schedule  progress that NASA has made since our last report in December 2012  and the JWST program changes made in 2011. We examined and  analyzed earned value management data; analyzed the progress made  and any variances to milestones established during the replan in 2011;  and interviewed officials from the JWST program, various contractors,  and the Defense Contract Management Agency to determine the extent  to which oversight was being conducted. To identify the major  technological risks and challenges facing the project, we reviewed the  project\u2019s risk database, monthly status reviews, and other documentation.  We also interviewed project and contractor officials for the major  subsystems. To identify the cost risks that may threaten the project\u2019s  ability to execute as planned, we examined data on JWST\u2019s cost reserve  posture and reviewed project and contractor documentation on risks to  maintaining cost targets and plans to mitigate those risks. We took steps  to confirm the accuracy of the data and performed various checks to  determine that the data provided was reliable enough for our purposes.  To determine the extent to which the JWST project schedule can be  relied on to accurately represent the potential impact of schedule risks  and technical challenges, we analyzed three subsystem schedules that  are used as inputs to the integrated master schedule using scheduling  best practices. We also conducted interviews with project and contractor  management, schedulers, and analyzed project and contractor  documentation concerning scheduling policies and practices.

Prior to being approved  for development, cost estimates of the project originally ranged from $1  billion to $3.5 billion with expected launch dates ranging from 2007 to  2011. In March 2005, NASA increased the JWST\u2019s life-cycle cost  estimate to $4.5 billion and delayed the launch date to 2013. We reported  in 2006 that the cost growth was due to a delay in launch vehicle  selection, budget limitations in fiscal years 2006 and 2007, requirements  changes, and an increase in the project\u2019s reserve funding\u2014funding used  to mitigate issues that arise but which were previously unknown. In April  2006, an Independent Review Team confirmed that the project\u2019s technical  content was complete and sound, but expressed concern over the  project\u2019s reserve funding, reporting that it was too low and phased in too  late in the development lifecycle. The review team reported that for a  project as complex as JWST, a 25 to 30 percent total reserve funding was  appropriate. The team cautioned that low reserve funding compromised  the project\u2019s ability to resolve issues, address risk areas, and  accommodate unknown problems. The project was baselined in April  2009 with a life-cycle cost estimate of $4.964 billion\u2014including additional  cost reserves\u2014and a launch date in June 2014. Shortly after JWST was  approved for development and its cost and schedule estimates were  baselined, project costs continued to increase and the schedule was  extended.", "In response to a request from the Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on  Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies to the NASA  Administrator for an independent review of JWST\u2014stemming from the  project\u2019s cost increases and reports that the June 2014 launch date was  in jeopardy\u2014NASA commissioned the Independent Comprehensive  Review Panel (ICRP). In October 2010, the ICRP issued its report and  cited several reasons for the project\u2019s problems including management,  budgeting, oversight, governance and accountability, and communication  issues. The panel concluded JWST was executing well from a technical  standpoint, but that the baseline funding did not reflect the most probable  cost with adequate reserves in each year of project execution, resulting in  an unexecutable project. Following this review, the JWST program  underwent a replan in September 2011 and was reauthorized by  Congress in November 2011, which placed an $8 billion cap on the  formulation and development costs for the project. On the basis of the  replan, NASA announced that the project would be rebaselined with a life- cycle cost at $8.835 billion\u2014a 78 percent increase\u2014and would launch in  October 2018\u2014a delay of 52 months. The revised life-cycle cost estimate  included 13 months of funded schedule reserve. In the President\u2019s Fiscal  Year 2013 budget request, NASA reported a 66 percent joint cost and  schedule confidence level associated with these estimates.

Additionally, we identified that the  current JWST schedule reserve lacked flexibility for the last three  integration and testing events (OTIS, the spacecraft, and observatory),  planned for April 2016 through May 2018. While there was a total of 14  months of schedule reserve for all five integration and test events\u2014when  problems are more likely to be found\u2014only 7 months were likely to be  available for these last three efforts. We also reported that the spacecraft  exceeded the mass limit for its launch vehicle and that project officials  were concerned about the mass of JWST since the inception of the  project because of the telescope\u2019s size and limits of the launch vehicle.  In addition to these technical challenges, we reported that the lack of  detail in the summary schedule used for JWST\u2019s JCL analysis during the  2011 replan prevented us from sufficiently understanding how risks were  incorporated, calling into question the results of that analysis and,  therefore, the reliability of the replanned cost estimate.", "In our December 2012 report, we made numerous recommendations  focused on providing high-fidelity cost information for monitoring project  progress and ensuring technical risks and challenges were being  effectively managed and sustaining oversight.

This measure, known as the cumulative  cost performance index (CPI), provides an indication of how a contractor  has performed over an extended period of time. The CPI indicates that  until June 2013 the contractor performed slightly more work for the cost  incurred than what was expected. Recent monthly performance,  however, has begun to lower the cumulative index. From December 2012  until June 2013, monthly CPI data, which gives an indication of current  performance, show that the contractor has been accomplishing less work  than planned for the cost incurred. See figure 5.", "Although several subsystems are experiencing positive performance, cost  overruns on spacecraft-related development activities are contributing to  this recent trend. For example, Northrop Grumman has reported negative  performance within the spacecraft systems engineering and the electrical  power subsystems activities for a 6-month period as of the end of June  2013. We calculate that this contract, which is approximately two-thirds  complete, could experience a slight cost overrun based on current data.  Northrop Grumman is using cost management reserves to offset the  decline in performance, but the JWST project reports that Northrop  Grumman is consuming cost reserves at a rate faster than planned.", "Contractor EVM cost data for ITT/Exelis\u2014which is providing services  related to the OTE and OTIS integration and test efforts\u2014also indicate  that in recent months the contractor has been accomplishing less work  than planned for the cost incurred.

Project officials told us that the  ITT/Exelis has sufficient cost reserves to offset the recent cost overruns  and that a cumulative CPI of 0.98 is within the range of acceptable  performance. Best practices indicate that a CPI of 1.0 or above is  favorable. We found small cost overruns across many elements of the  work being performed by ITT/Exelis, similar to the analysis performed by  the project. Based on our analysis of EVM data through the end of July  2013, we estimate that this contract could experience a small cost  overrun. As of July 2013, ITT/Exelis had completed a little more than one- third of the planned work for this contract and used more than 44 percent  of available management reserves from October 2012 to July 2013.", "In addition to the work being performed by contractors, the JWST project  also performs development work internally at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space  Flight Center.

If the OTE integration and test effort uses schedule  reserve beyond those 7 months, it will reduce the amount of schedule  reserve available for the last three integration and test efforts. Northrop  Grumman officials said that the OTE integration and test effort is very  sequential and does not offer much flexibility to allow for changes to the  process flow. The integration and test of OTE must be complete for the  OTIS integration effort to begin on schedule.

Previously, the project  reported that ISIM had almost 8 months of schedule reserve, which did  not account for the delayed start of the first scheduled cryo-vacuum test\u2014 in which a test chamber is used to simulate the near-absolute zero  temperatures in space. The current 7 months of schedule reserve for the  ISIM integrations and test effort does not include the impact of any  potential delays due to the government shutdown in October 2013, which  was still being determined in mid-December 2013. The first cryo-vacuum  test was considered a risk reduction test by the project because it did not  include two of the project\u2019s four instruments and was to test procedures  and the ground support equipment to be used in later cryo-vacuum tests  of ISIM. During the replan, this test was scheduled to begin in February  2013, but was delayed until August 2013 because of several issues,  including availability of the test chamber and delays in development and  delivery of a radiator for the harness that holds electrical wiring. Project  officials said they will adjust the ISIM schedule to minimize the schedule  impact by performing some activities concurrently, delaying some  activities until after the first cryo-vacuum test, and removing some  activities. They added that a recently approved September 2013 revision  to the ISIM schedule only reduced schedule reserve by 1 week and no  additional risk will be incurred based on these changes to the ISIM  schedule. The two subsequent cryo-vacuum tests, however, have slipped  up to 2 months in the latest revision to the ISIM schedule, although  project officials state that the April 2016 completion date for ISIM testing  and delivery to the OTIS integration and test effort remains unchanged.  According to the JWST program manager, however, the first cryo-vacuum  test was in process when the government shutdown happened and,  although many of the testing goals were accomplished through  prioritization of test activities, the test was terminated once the ISIM staff  resumed work and some activities were not accomplished.

NASA, however, has not addressed the  shortcomings of the schedule that supports the baseline itself. For  example, we found that the lack of detail in the summary schedule used  for JWST\u2019s last JCL in May 2011 prevented us from sufficiently  understanding how risks were incorporated, therefore calling into question  the results of that analysis. Since the JCL was a key input to the decision  process of approving the project\u2019s new cost and schedule baseline  estimates, we maintain that the JWST project should perform an updated  JCL analysis using a schedule that should now be much more refined and  accurate and has sufficient detail to map risks to activities and costs in  addition to the other analyses they currently perform. Doing so could help  increase the reliability of the cost estimate and the confidence level of the  JCL. Furthermore, risk management is a continuous process that  constantly monitors a project\u2019s health. The JWST project is still executing  to a plan that was based on the JCL performed in May 2011.

While resolution of this issue will be a positive step for the project,  other, still unresolved issues with the cryocooler have arisen that have  required additional cost and schedule resources to address. Specifically,  a key component of the cryocooler underperformed prior tests of this  technology by about 30 percent. In addition, both the Jet Propulsion  Laboratory (JPL)\u2014which awarded the cryocooler subcontract\u2014and the  subcontractor were focused on addressing the valve issue, which limited  their attention to the cooling underperformance issue. In late 2012, the  cryocooler subcontractor reported that it would be unable to meet the  cryocooler schedule. The subcontractor is working toward a revised test  schedule, agreed upon in April 2013, which delays acceptance testing  and includes concurrent testing of hardware. In August 2013, the  cryocooler subcontract was modified to reflect a 69 percent cost increase.  Additionally, the number of subcontractor staff assigned to the cryocooler  subcontract has increased from 40 to approximately 110, which accounts  for a significant portion of the cost increase. This was the second time in  less than 2 years that the cryocooler subcontract was modified.  Cumulatively, the cryocooler subcontract value has increased by about  120 percent from March 2012.", "Various issues may have contributed to the current problems with the  cryocooler. For example, according to project and JPL officials they had  not verified the cryocooler cost and schedule estimates provided by the  subcontractor prior to the project establishing new baseline cost and  schedule estimates in 2011. Doing so may have allowed them to ensure  adequate resources were accounted for in the new baseline estimates.  JPL officials stated that the subcontractor proposal was verified prior to  the completion of the March 2012 cryocooler replan. The subcontractor,  however, reported that the 2012 replan did not include cost or schedule  allowance for rework should additional problems arise, which did happen.  In addition, despite erratic and negative EVM data from the subcontractor  immediately following the March 2012 cryocooler replan, an in-depth  review was not initiated until 9 months later by the cryocooler  subcontractor. JPL officials stated that, during this time, they were  performing analysis of the EVM data and the technical progress of the  subcontractor and provided the results of their analysis to the project.  Finally, the project had not followed key best practices since early in  development, which left it at an increased risk of cost and schedule  delays. For example, best practices call for testing of a model or  prototype of a critical technology in its flight-like form, fit, and function and  in a simulated realistic or high fidelity lab environment by its preliminary  design review. While the subcontractor tested a demonstration model of  the cryocooler in such an environment and the project assessed the  technology as mature in 2008, a project official acknowledges that the  demonstration model\u2019s mechanical design was different than what would  be used in space and, according to that official, those differences led to  the loss of performance between the demonstration model and the  current cryocooler. In addition, only 60 percent of the cryocooler\u2019s  expected design drawings were released as of the mission critical design  review\u2014well below the best practice standard of 90 percent drawings  released by critical design review\u2014indicating that the project moved  forward without a stable cryocooler design as well as an immature  cryocooler technology, which increases risk.", "The execution of the remaining cryocooler schedule will continue to be  challenging as the performance issue is not resolved, the revised  schedule is optimistic, the subcontractor has identified significant risks not  incorporated in the rebaseline, and there are risks associated with the  revised testing approach. The cryocooler subcontractor has developed a  separate verification model, which is now being used to validate that the  cryocooler redesign will address the underperformance. This step is  important because, according to the cryocooler subcontractor program  manager, the internal structures of the cryocooler component are intricate  and once a unit is completed the internal structure cannot be modified.  Thus, when issues arise, such as use of incorrect parts or unexpected  underperformance, a new unit must be built rather than simply changing  parts on the underperforming cryocooler component. Testing of the  verification model, which will give an indication of whether the  performance issue has been rectified and a new flight model can be built,  was scheduled to be complete in October 2013, but has been delayed.  The subcontractor project manager reports that issues were found with  processes used to assemble the verification model that must be resolved  before testing resumes, which is not expected until at least late December  2013. This delay may reduce the amount of schedule margin available to  the overall cryocooler effort.", "The cryocooler schedule\u2014agreed upon in April 2013\u2014was optimistic,  according to the cryocooler subcontractor program manager. Shortly after  the new schedule was put in place, he told us that he had low confidence  that the subcontractor would be able to meet this schedule based on the  development issues mentioned above. In addition, the JPL scheduler for  the cryocooler said that he had only moderate confidence of the  subcontractor\u2019s ability to meet this schedule. In line with their concerns,  the cryocooler subcontractor recently depleted all of its schedule reserve  for deliveries to JPL prior to the start of acceptance testing. The  cryocooler subcontractor also identified other risks that could impact its  execution of the subcontract, but that were not included as part of the  rebaseline plan in the modified subcontract. The project retained financial  responsibility for addressing those risks, should they arise, at the project  level by identifying over $8 million in cost reserves in fiscal years 2014  and 2015. However, some of these risks could require significantly more  than $8 million to address. For example, the cryocooler subcontractor  program manager stated that some of these risks, if realized, could take a  year to mitigate. As of September 2013, delivery dates agreed to in April  2013 for all of the major flight and spare cryocooler components have  been delayed, all six weeks of schedule reserve being held at the  cryocooler subcontractor had been exhausted, and the start of  acceptance testing at JPL has been delayed. Any further delays will have  to be accommodated through the use of 12 weeks of schedule reserve  held by JPL. The cryocooler subcontractor also recently began reporting  EVM data based on the latest cost and schedule estimates and, in line  with the delays mentioned above, this data already shows that work is  costing more and taking longer than planned. JPL\u2019s schedule reserve  also has to support any issues that arise during acceptance and end-to- end testing of the cryocooler hardware prior to delivery to the spacecraft  integration and test effort.", "In an effort to reduce this risk, the project reordered the integration and  test schedule. This removed some, but not all, of the cryocooler  component testing schedule risk, which may limit the project\u2019s ability to  address issues that arise during component testing. Specifically, two  major spare components of the cryocooler will still be in acceptance  testing when spacecraft integration and test begins in April 2016, which is  also a risk to the spacecraft integration and test schedule. For example, if  a particular cryocooler component fails during one test and a spare  component is still undergoing acceptance testing, then the test schedule  may be delayed waiting for repairs to be made to the component or for  the spare component to be available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OTE and ISIM Have Made Progress but Face Risks That May Impact Schedule", "paragraphs": ["Northrop Grumman has made progress on the OTE, but the project  expects the contractor to use its current schedule reserve and the OTE is  facing risks that may impact the schedule if they are realized. Progress  has been made over the past year in fabricating the OTE support  structure, which holds the mirrors and ISIM and connects all the pieces of  the observatory. Specifically, all of the support structure sections have  been completed and fully integrated and the structure has entered  cryovacuum testing. The project is tracking an issue with release  mechanisms holding the spacecraft and the OTE together while stowed  within the launch vehicle and used during the deployment of the  telescope after launch. Currently the mechanisms are causing excessive  shock vibration when released. According to a NASA official, the project  and the contractor are evaluating potential solutions which include  changes to the design of the release mechanism, using damping  materials to lessen the impact to the spacecraft, and testing to see if the  shock requirement can be relaxed. The project has delayed the release  mechanism design review until January 2014\u2014after the spacecraft critical  design review\u2014while it works to mitigate the issue with contractors.  Project officials stated the results of this component level design review  will be evaluated prior to a larger mission review to be held later in 2014.  In December 2013, the project was also assessing the possibility that  portions of the observatory\u2019s sunshield may be delivered up to 3 months  late, which could impact the amount of schedule reserve being held by  the project. The project indicates that it is considering options by the  contractor to recover some of that potential schedule delay.", "The project has made progress on various portions of the ISIM as well.  For example, two of the four instruments have been integrated into the  ISIM for testing and fabrication of replacement near infrared detectors  used in three of the four instruments\u2014which we reported in 2012 may  need to be replaced\u2014is ahead of schedule. Prior schedule conflicts with  another NASA project, however, delayed the start of the ISIM integration  and test effort and instrument and component delays are further  threatening the ISIM integration and test schedule which may lead to  additional cost increases. The project has already replanned the ISIM  schedule flow due, in part, to delays with the Near-Infrared Camera  (NIRCam) and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instruments.  Specifically, the NIRSpec instrument and NIRCam\u2019s optics were delivered  more than a year behind schedule. NIRSpec completed environmental  testing and was delivered to Goddard in late September 2013. An  electronics component of the NIRCam instrument, however, failed  functional testing following a vibration test possibly due to manufacturing  defects. The contractor has developed an approach to screen similar  components to verify whether those components have similar anomalies.  If the components pass the screening process, then environmental testing  will continue with a spare in place of the component that malfunctioned. If  all of the components show similar anomalies, they will be restricted from  vibration tests and used in other testing until replacement components  are ready. This issue may impact the already delayed start of the second  and third ISIM cryo-vacuum tests, which would further compress the ISIM  integration and test schedule or require the project to use some of ISIM\u2019s  schedule reserve. Because the ISIM schedule has already been  compressed, the project will have less flexibility should any issues or  delays arise during this effort. The project is covering the current ISIM- related cost increase\u20149.8 percent\u2014primarily with funding reserves.  Extending the length of time needed to conduct the ISIM integration and  test effort, should there be further delays, would require maintaining test  personnel and facilities longer than planned, which may lead to further  cost increases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Northrop Grumman Has Addressed Spacecraft Mass Issues", "paragraphs": ["Northrop Grumman has successfully addressed the spacecraft mass  issue that we reported on in 2012 and project officials state that they are  comfortable with the observatory mass margin as the project heads into  multiple major integration and test efforts, despite the mass margin being  lower than Goddard standards.  In December 2012, we reported that the  spacecraft was more than 200 kilograms over its mass allocation. In  November 2013, Northrop Grumman officials stated that the spacecraft  was under its mass allocation at that time. Since December 2011, both  the contractor and the project made mass reduction a priority and the  contractor currently has margin available to address future issues that  may require additional mass to solve. The project\u2019s current overall mass  margin is approximately 7.7 percent, which does not include 90 kilograms  of additional mass allocation the project received in 2013 from the launch  vehicle provider. This is lower than the Goddard standard of 15 percent  mass margin at this phase of development. According to project officials,  they applied the Goddard standard at the subsystem level rather than at  the observatory level due to JWST\u2019s complexity, which allowed them to  maintain a lower overall observatory mass margin. They added that the  observatory and its component elements have an acceptable amount of  mass margin as the project enters its major integration and test efforts  and, while they will maintain standard mass controls to avoid  unnecessary growth, they do not expect mass margins to be a significant  concern going forward.

In September 2013, project officials reported that  while they are making good technical progress, the level of cost reserves  held by the project in fiscal year 2014 had become the top issue facing  the project and may require them to defer future work. Although not  currently identified as an issue by the project, a significant portion of fiscal  year 2015 project-held cost reserves have also already been allocated.  This does not take into account reserves held by the JWST program at  NASA headquarters in fiscal years 2014 and 2015 that can be used to  supplement reserves held by the project. However, fiscal year 2014  program reserves are minimal compared to future years. As of September  2013, the project has allocated approximately 60 and 42 percent of its  reserves in fiscal years 2014 and 2015, respectively. See figure 8.", "The need to allocate a significant portion of cost reserves in fiscal year  2014 and 2015 has been driven primarily by the technical issues with the  MIRI cryocooler. Specifically, the subcontract modification resulting from  the cryocooler replan required the allocation of over $25 million of cost  reserves in fiscal year 2014 and 2015. After allocation of these cost  reserves, the project began tracking the risk of low fiscal year 2014 cost  reserves.", "Project officials report that the project\u2019s low reserve posture in fiscal year  2014 may require them to defer work to future years. Specifically,  because the project continues to maintain 14 months of funded schedule  reserve, it may begin using some of that schedule reserve to conduct  work later or allow work to take longer than planned. There are risks  associated with this approach, however. For example, prior to the  project\u2019s replan in 2011, low cost reserves and technical challenges  forced project management to defer planned work into future years. This  ultimately led to increased costs for the deferred work and a schedule that  was unsustainable. Much of the remaining work on JWST involves the  five major integration and test efforts\u2014which began in fiscal year 2011\u2014 during which work is often sequential in nature and cost and schedule  growth typically occurs. Depleting schedule reserve now could impact  project officials\u2019 ability to address technical risks or challenges not  currently identified or realized, but that will likely arise during this phase.  Project officials said that they would like to strike a balance between  using remaining cost reserves and having to utilize schedule margin to  complete planned work and address currently unknown technical  challenges, but their goal is to use as little schedule margin as possible in  fiscal year 2014.", "Northrop Grumman has also identified issues with the adequacy of its  cost management reserves in fiscal year 2014. The project shares this  concern given that Northrop Grumman\u2019s cost reserves are eroding faster  than anticipated. As of October 2012, the contractor held more than $244  million in cost management reserves for the remainder of the contract, but  has used almost 24 percent of those management reserves since then.  The approximately $185 million in cost management reserves Northrop  Grumman has available as of September 2013 represents the total  amount of reserves available through the remainder of the contract\u2014 almost 6 years\u2014and not how much is available for use specifically for  fiscal year 2014. The contract modification for the 2011 replan was signed  in December 2013 and, according to the Northrop Grumman program  manager, the amount of management reserve available will likely  increase by more than $45 million once budget distributions are  completed by the end of January 2014. In June 2013, Northrop Grumman  had identified up to $80 million in potential risks for fiscal year 2014.  Project officials said that Northrop Grumman will sometimes fund new  contract requirements for future fiscal years with current year cost  reserves. These officials added that they are in the process of  determining whether the rate Northrop Grumman is spending cost  reserves is a result of additional requirements or because of performance  issues. According to JWST project analysts, Northrop Grumman cost  management reserves also remain a challenge in fiscal year 2015 when  compared to the potential threats. The JWST project manager said that  the project could rephase some planned Northrop Grumman cost  management reserves from future years to fiscal year 2014 instead, but  that would require the project to use some of its fiscal year 2014 cost  reserves, which as noted are already constrained. As noted earlier, the  JWST Program at NASA headquarters maintains another set of cost  reserves that could be used to help in situations such as this, but the bulk  of these reserves will not be available until fiscal year 2015.", "The project\u2019s rate of spending in fiscal year 2013 could also be a  significant issue if it continues into fiscal year 2014 and officials have  begun tracking the rate of spending as a risk. The project spent  approximately $40 million more than planned in fiscal year 2013.  According to program officials, the amount of this overage is becoming  significant not because of a lack of funds in fiscal year 2013, but because  the fiscal year 2014 budget and project cost reserves are constrained.  Project officials said that they planned to carry over funding from fiscal  year 2013 to support approximately 2\u00bd months of work to help fund  contracts and ensure continued operations during a potential continuing  resolution or other periods of funding uncertainty. If the project were to  receive its full funding allocation for fiscal year 2014 at the level planned,  this 2013 money would supplement the money available to the project in  2014. But if the current rate of spending is sustained, the project would  only carry over enough 2013 money to fund the project for about 7 to 8  weeks into fiscal year 2014. The lower amount of funding carried over will  also cause the project to have less available to supplement shortfalls in  future years. For example, the JWST program manager told us that  Northrop Grumman has requested more funding in fiscal year 2014 than  the amount planned. Program officials noted that if the project continues  to spend in fiscal year 2014 at a rate experienced during the latter part of  fiscal year 2013, it may not be able to carry any funds into fiscal year  2015 as planned. Project officials, however, indicate that they are  confident that they will carryover funds into fiscal year 2015. Our review of  the data found that the project\u2019s increased spend rate in fiscal year 2013  is due mainly to additional resources necessary for the ISIM due to late  hardware deliveries, the cryocooler effort, and the Northrop Grumman  effort to prepare for the spacecraft critical design review in January 2014.", "NASA\u2019s ability to remedy these issues will likely be significantly hindered  by the potential impacts from sequestration and competing demands from  other major projects. For example, while NASA officials report that the  agency was able to absorb the sequestration-related reductions in fiscal  year 2013 with relatively no impact on its major projects, including JWST,  they indicate that the agency cannot sustain all of its long-term funding  commitments at sequester levels in fiscal year 2014 and beyond.  Importantly, the JWST project recently began tracking a risk for the  budget uncertainty due to sequestration. The risk outlines that there is a  potential cut to the JWST budget starting in fiscal year 2014, which could  adversely affect the execution of the project\u2019s current plan and potentially  jeopardize the October 2018 launch date. The program office indicates  that NASA headquarters directed JWST to plan for its fiscal year 2014  budget to be consistent with the replan. This direction by NASA could  have an impact on other major NASA projects. In interviews for several  other major NASA projects, officials informed us that they have less than  adequate funding in fiscal year 2014 and some have requested that the  agency rephase funds from later years to fiscal year 2014 to address the  issue. If additional funds are required and prioritized for JWST, there  could be a potentially significant impact on these and other projects within  the agency that are already reporting funding issues in fiscal year 2014."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected JWST Schedules Demonstrate Many Best Practices, but Identified Weaknesses Erode Confidence in the Project\u2019s Integrated Master Schedule", "paragraphs": ["The reliability of the JWST integrated master schedule is questionable  because some of the 23 subordinate schedules synthesized to create it  are lacking in one or more characteristics of a reliable schedule.

For example, if  the date of one activity changes, the dates of its related activities will also  change in response. The master schedule will be able to identify the  consequences of changes and alert managers so they can determine the  best response.

Using  the 10 best practices for schedules, we individually scored and evaluated  the schedules for these subsystems. We then grouped the best practices  into one of four characteristics: comprehensive, well-constructed,  credible, and controlled. The individual best practice scores within each  characteristic were then combined to determine the final score for each  characteristic. See appendix III for more detailed information on each  characteristic and its corresponding best practices. The ISIM and OTE  schedules had more strengths than weaknesses, substantially meeting  three of four characteristics of a reliable schedule. The cryocooler  schedule demonstrated weaknesses in both of the characteristics we  examined.

However, the schedule lacked a schedule  risk assessment\u2014a best practice that gives decision makers confidence  that the estimates are credible based on known risks and allows  management to account for the cost of a schedule slip when developing  the life-cycle cost estimate. Without a schedule risk assessment decision  makers may not obtain accurate cost impacts when schedule changes  occur. Officials noted that while a schedule risk assessment was not  performed on the ISIM schedule itself, the schedule was included as a  part of the overall JWST JCL analysis, and subsequent cost and schedule  estimate, conducted during the project replan in 2011. However, our  analysis of the 2011 JCL indicated that the estimate\u2019s accuracy, and  therefore the confidence level assigned to the estimate, was reduced by  the quality of the summary schedule used for the JCL because it did not  provide enough detail to determine how risks were applied to critical  project activities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Optical Telescope Element", "paragraphs": ["Of the four characteristics of a reliable schedule that we assessed for the  OTE schedule, we found that the comprehensive characteristic was fully  met, credible and controlled characteristics were substantially met, and  the well-constructed characteristic was partially met.

However, while Northrop  Grumman has identified a critical path, our analysis was not able to  confirm that this path described activities in the schedule that were truly  driving the key delivery date for the OTE, which is the delivery of the OTE  to the OTIS testing and integration at Goddard Space Flight Center on  April 28, 2016. Identifying a valid critical path is essential for management  to identify and focus upon activities which will potentially have detrimental  effects on key project milestones and deliverables if they slip. In addition,  we found that one-third of the remaining activities and milestones had  over 200 days of total float. This means that, according to the schedule,  these activities could be delayed 9 working months without impacting the  key delivery date. Realistic float values allow managers to see the impact  of a delayed activity on future work. However, unrealistic estimates of  float make it difficult to know the amount of time one event can slip  without impacting the project finish date. In addition, incorrect float  estimates will result in an invalid critical path. Northrop Grumman officials  agreed with our assessment but noted the high values of total float are  due to their planning process which only details out the schedule in 6  month increments. Activities beyond the detailed planning window of the  schedule have high float and those estimates of float will become more  reasonable as the schedule is planned in detail. However, best practices  state that all activities in the schedule, even far-term planning packages,  should be logically linked in such a way as to portray a complete picture  of the program\u2019s available float and its critical path. Finally, a schedule  risk assessment has not been conducted on the OTE schedule since  2011.

Officials stated that the schedule is used to manage critical  paths to six major hardware deliveries, or key delivery dates. However,  we could not determine how the schedule is used to identify and present  those paths to management. In addition, the use of date constraints in 19  activities within the schedule helps determine the remaining total float to  some deliveries, but causes an overabundance of activities to appear as  critical, which interferes with the identification of the true project-level  critical path. We also found that while the schedule accurately reflected  some of the delays the project is currently experiencing, its schedule  appears to be overly flexible in some cases, such as having activities with  over 500 days\u2014or over 2 working years\u2014of total float.

Northrop Grumman officials, who  manage the schedule and the project, stated that a schedule risk analysis  was performed in March 2013, but the results were not used by JPL  management who oversees the contract. The results of the schedule risk  analysis may help JPL determine the probability of meeting key dates or  how much schedule contingency is needed.", "Officials provided us examples of the schedule risk analysis output, but  we were not able to confirm their validity because documentation was not  available on the data, risk, or methodologies. In addition to the lack of  documentation, because we found the schedule to be only partially well- constructed, we cannot be sure that the results of the schedule risk  analysis are valid. Given the weaknesses noted above, if the schedule  risk analysis is to be credible, the program must have a quality schedule  that reflects reliable logic and clearly identifies the critical path before a  schedule risk analysis is conducted. If the schedule does not follow best  practices, confidence in the schedule risk analysis results will be lacking.

These  comments are reprinted in appendix IV.", "In responding to a draft of this report, NASA concurred with our two  recommendations; however, in some cases it is either not clear what  actions NASA plans to take or when they will complete the action to  satisfy the intent of the recommendations.", "NASA officials concurred with our recommendation to ensure the JWST  project has adequate cost reserves to meet the development needs in  each fiscal year, particularly in fiscal year 2014, and report to Congress  on steps it is taking to do so. In their response, the Acting JWST Program  Director cited NASA and the administration\u2019s request to Congress to  appropriate the full JWST replan level funding for fiscal year 2014, which  includes the level of unallocated future expenses, or cost reserves,  established in the replan. He also commented that NASA conducts  monthly reviews to evaluate risks and associated impacts to funding in  order to ensure that adequate cost reserves are available in each fiscal  year. We acknowledge in our report that the JWST project has been fully  funded at levels commensurate with the 2011 baseline through fiscal year  2013. However, cost reserves approved for the project during the 2011  replan were based on the risks known at that time. The events of fiscal  year 2013 have weakened the project\u2019s financial posture and flexibility the  project has to address any potential technical challenges going forward  into fiscal year 2014 and beyond. In addition, NASA\u2019s response does not  indicate how the agency plans to report to Congress the steps it is taking  to ensure that the JWST project has adequate cost reserves to meet its  October 2018 launch date. We maintain that NASA should provide more  detail to Congress on its plans given the already constrained cost reserve  posture the project has early in fiscal year 2014 and past issues with low  levels of cost reserves that forced the project to defer work, which led to  significant cost increases and schedule delays.", "NASA officials concurred with our recommendation to perform a schedule  risk analysis on OTE, ISIM, and cryocooler schedules, as well as any  other subschedules where a schedule risk analysis was not performed  and that, in accordance with schedule best practices, the risk analyses  are performed on reliable schedules. The Acting Program Director stated  NASA will conduct probability schedule risk analyses on the OTE, ISIM,  and cryocooler schedules by the end of calendar 2014 using NASA best  practices. This is a positive step, given that our previous work has found  that GAO and NASA best practices for scheduling are largely  consistent. The Acting Program Director also stated that NASA will  conduct the same analyses for other schedules lacking a risk analysis.  However, no deadline was mentioned for when these analyses will be  accomplished or for how many schedules will be affected. Having reliable  schedules sooner will provide management with more timely and  accurate information on which to make decisions. If the schedule risk  assessments are not completed until after 2014, the project will have less  than 4 years until launch to utilize the information these risk analyses can  provide. Given that we have found reliability issues with the project\u2019s  schedules for the second year, improving the current schedules to meet  best practices is important to provide management with improved tools to  better understand the schedule risks and manage the project.", "We are sending copies of the report to NASA\u2019s Administrator and  interested congressional committees.

In  assessing earned value management (EVM) data from several  contractors and subcontractors and the project\u2019s schedule estimate, we  performed various checks to determine that the data provided was  reliable enough for our purposes.", "To assess the extent to which the JWST project is meeting its cost and  schedule commitments and maintaining oversight, we reviewed project  and contractor documentation, analyzed the progress made and any  variances to milestones established during the project\u2019s replan in 2011,  and held interviews with project, contractor, and Defense Contract  Management Agency officials. We reviewed project monthly status  reviews, documentation on project risks, and budget documentation. We  examined and analyzed EVM data from several contractors and  subcontractors. The EVM data reviewed included monthly contractor  performance reports and analysis performed by the JWST project on this  information. For our analysis, we entered only high-level monthly  contractor EVM data into a GAO-developed spreadsheet, which includes  checks to ensure the EVM data provided was reliable enough for our  purposes. We also reviewed the project\u2019s analysis of the estimate at  completion for internal work being performed on the Integrated Science  Instrument Module. We interviewed program and project officials at NASA  headquarters and Goddard Space Flight Center to obtain additional  information on the status of the project with regard to progress toward  baseline commitments. We periodically attended flight program reviews at  NASA headquarters where the current status of the program was briefed  to NASA headquarters officials and members of the Standing Review  Board. We also interviewed JWST project and contractor officials from the  Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems to  determine the extent to which oversight was being conducted. In addition,  we interviewed officials from the Defense Contract Management Agency  to obtain information on oversight activities delegated to it by the JWST  project.", "To assess the technological challenges and risks facing the project, we  reviewed project monthly status reviews, information from the project\u2019s  risk database, as well as briefings and schedule documentation provided  by project and contractor officials. These documents included information  on the project\u2019s technological challenges and risks, mitigation plans, and  timelines for addressing these risks and challenges. We also interviewed  program and project officials for each major observatory system to clarify  information and to obtain additional information on system and subsystem  level risks and technological challenges for each subsystem. Further, we  interviewed officials from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Northrop  Grumman Aerospace Systems concerning risks and challenges on the  subsystems, instruments, or components they were developing. We  reviewed GAO\u2019s prior work on NASA Large Scale Acquisitions; the  Goddard Space Flight Center Rules for the Design, Development,  Verification, and Operation of Flight Systems technical standards; and  NASA\u2019s Space Flight Program and Project Management Requirements  and Systems Engineering Processes and Requirements policy  documents.

We selected the  three schedules above as they reflect a significant portion of the work  being conducted within NASA (ISIM), at the contractor level (OTE), and  the subcontractor level (cryocooler) during the course of our work. We  also analyzed schedule metrics as a part of that analysis to highlight  potential areas of strengths and weaknesses against each of our 4  characteristics of a reliable schedule. In order to assess each schedule  against the 4 characteristics and their accompanying 10 best practices,  we traced and verified underlying support and determined whether the  program office or contractor provided sufficient evidence to satisfy the  criterion and assigned a score depicting that the practices were not met,  minimally met, partially met, substantially met, or fully met. By examining  the schedules against our guidance, we conducted a reliability  assessment on each of the schedules and incorporated our findings on  reliability limitations in the analysis of each subordinate schedule. We  also conducted interviews with project and contractor management and  schedulers before our analysis was completed and analyzed project and  contractor documentation concerning scheduling policies and practices.  After conducting our initial analysis, we shared it with the relevant parties  to provide an opportunity for them to comment and identify reasons for  observed shortfalls in schedule management best practices. We took  their comments and any additional information they provided and  incorporated it into the assessments to finalize the scores for each  characteristic and best practice. We were also able to use the results of  the three subordinate schedules to provide insight into the health of the  integrated master schedule since the same strengths and weaknesses of  the subordinate schedules would transfer to the master schedule. We  determined that the schedules were sufficiently reliable for our reporting  purposes and our report notes the instances where reliability concerns  affect the quality of the schedules.", "Our work was performed primarily at NASA headquarters in Washington,  D.C. and Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.
