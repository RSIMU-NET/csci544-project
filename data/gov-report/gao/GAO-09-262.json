Bureau program offices have completed some testing of individual systems, but significant work still remains to be done, and many plans have not yet been developed (see table below). In its testing of system integration, the Bureau has not completed critical activities; it also lacks a master list of interfaces between systems; has not set priorities for the testing of interfaces based on criticality; and has not developed testing plans and schedules. Although the Bureau had originally planned what it refers to as a Dress Rehearsal, starting in 2006, to serve as a comprehensive end-to-end test of key operations and systems, significant problems were identified during testing. As a result, several key operations were removed from the Dress Rehearsal and did not undergo end-to-end testing. The Bureau has neither developed testing plans for these key operations, nor has it determined when such plans will be completed. Weaknesses in the Bureau's testing progress and plans can be attributed, in part, to a lack of sufficient executive-level oversight and guidance. Bureau management does provide oversight of system testing activities, but the oversight activities are not sufficient. For example, Bureau reports do not provide comprehensive status information on progress in testing key systems and interfaces, and assessments of the overall status of testing for key operations are not based on quantitative metrics. Specifically, key operations that do not yet have plans developed are marked as making acceptable progress based solely on management judgment. Further, although the Bureau has issued general testing guidance, it is neither mandatory nor specific enough to ensure consistency in conducting system testing. Without adequate oversight and more comprehensive guidance, the Bureau cannot ensure that it is thoroughly testing its systems and properly prioritizing testing activities before the 2010 Decennial Census, posing the risk that these systems may not perform as planned."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Census Bureau (Bureau) is relying on both the acquisition of new  systems and the enhancement of existing legacy systems for conducting  operations for the 2010 Decennial Census.

For example,  DRIS has conducted integration testing with some systems, such as FDCA,  UC&M, and RPS, and is scheduled to complete integration testing by  February 2010. The FDCA program office has also tested interfaces related  to the address canvassing operation scheduled to begin in April 2009.  However, for many other systems, such as PBO, interfaces have not been  fully defined, and other interfaces have been defined but have not been  tested. Table 9 provides the status of integration testing among key  systems.", "In addition, the Bureau has not established a master list of interfaces  between key systems, or plans and schedules for integration testing of  these interfaces. A master list of system interfaces is an important tool for  ensuring that all interfaces are tested appropriately and that the priorities  for testing are set correctly. Although the Bureau had established a list of  interfaces in 2007, according to Bureau officials, it was not updated  because of resource limitations at the time and other management  priorities. As of October 2008, the Bureau had begun efforts to update this  list, but it has not provided a date when this list will be completed.", "Without a completed master list, the Bureau cannot develop  comprehensive plans and schedules for conducting systems integration  testing that indicate how the testing of these interfaces will be prioritized.  This is important because a prioritized master list of system interfaces,  combined with comprehensive plans and schedules to test the interfaces,  would allow for tracking the progress of this testing. With the limited  amount of time remaining before systems are needed for 2010 operations,  the lack of comprehensive plans and schedules increases the risk that the  Bureau may not be able to adequately test system interfaces, and that  interfaced systems may not work together as intended."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Bureau Has Conducted Limited End-to-End Testing as Part of the Dress Rehearsal, but Has Not Developed Testing Plans for Critical Operations", "paragraphs": ["The Dress Rehearsal was originally conceived to provide a comprehensive  end-to-end test of key 2010 census operations; however, as mentioned  earlier, because of the problems encountered with the handheld devices,  among other things, testing was curtailed. As a result, although several  critical operations underwent end-to-end testing in the Dress Rehearsal,  others did not. According to the Associate Director for the 2010 census,  the Bureau tested approximately 23 of 44 key operations during the Dress  Rehearsal. Examples of key operations that underwent end-to-end testing  during the Dress Rehearsal are address canvassing and group quarters  validation. An example of a key operation that was not tested is the largest  field operation\u2014nonresponse follow-up.", "Although the Bureau recently conducted additional testing of the handhelds,  this test was not a robust end-to-end test. In December 2008, after additional  development and improvements to the handheld computers, the Bureau  conducted a limited field test for address canvassing, intended to assess  software functionality in an operational environment. We observed this test  and determined that users were generally satisfied with the performance of  the handhelds. According to Bureau officials, the performance of the  handheld computers has substantially improved from previous tests.  However, the test was not designed to test all the functionality of the  handhelds in a robust end-to-end test\u2014rather, it included only a limited  subset of functionality to be used during the 2009 address canvassing  operations. Further, the field test did not validate that the FDCA system fully  met specified requirements for the address canvassing operation. Bureau  officials stated that additional testing of the FDCA system, such as  performance testing, mitigated the limitations of this field test.", "Nonetheless, the lack of robustness of the field test poses several risks for  2010 operations. Specifically, without testing all the FDCA system\u2019s  requirements in a robust operational environment, it is unclear whether  the system can perform as intended when the address canvassing  operation begins in April 2009.", "Furthermore, as of December 2008, the Bureau has neither established  testing plans nor schedules to perform end-to-end testing of the key  operations that were removed from the Dress Rehearsal, nor has it  determined when these plans will be completed. As previously mentioned,  these operations include    enumeration of transitory locations,    group quarters enumeration, and  field verification.", "Although the Bureau has established a high-level strategy for testing these  operations, which provides details about the operations to be tested,  Bureau officials stated that they have not developed testing plans and  schedules because they are giving priority to tests for operations that are  needed in early 2009. In addition, key systems needed to test these  operations are not ready to be tested because they are either still in  development or have not completed system testing. Until system and  integration testing activities are complete, the Bureau cannot effectively  plan and schedule end-to-end testing activities. Without sufficient end-to- end testing, operational problems can go undiscovered, and the  opportunity to improve these operations will be lost.", "The decreasing time available for completing end-to-end testing increases  the risk that testing of key operations will not take place before the  required deadline. Bureau officials have acknowledged this risk in  briefings to the Office of Management and Budget. The Bureau is in the  process of identifying risks associated with incomplete testing and  developing mitigation plans, which it had planned to have completed by  November 2008. However, as of January 2009, the Bureau had not  completed these mitigation plans. According to the Bureau, the plans are  still being reviewed by senior management. Without plans to mitigate the  risks associated with limited end-to-end testing, the Bureau may not be  able to respond effectively if systems do not perform as intended."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Bureau Lacks Sufficient Executive-Level Oversight and Guidance for Testing", "paragraphs": ["As stated in our testing guide and IEEE standards, oversight of testing  activities includes both planning and ongoing monitoring of testing  activities. Ongoing monitoring entails collecting and assessing status and  progress reports to determine, for example, whether specific test activities  are on schedule. Using this information, management can effectively  determine whether corrective action is needed and, if so, what action  should be taken. In addition, comprehensive guidance should describe  each level of testing (for example, system, integration, or end-to-end),  criteria for each level, and the type of test products expected. The  guidance should also address test preparation and oversight activities.", "Although the 2010 Decennial Census is managed by the Decennial  Management Division, the oversight and management of key census IT  systems is performed on a decentralized basis. DRIS, FDCA, and DADS II  each have a separate program office within the Decennial Automation  Contracts Management Office; Headquarters Processing and PBO are  managed within the Decennial System and Processing Office; and  MAF/TIGER is managed within the Geography Division. Each program has  its own program management reviews and develops plans and tracks  metrics related to testing. These offices and divisions collectively report to  the Associate Director for the 2010 Census. According to the Bureau, the  associate director chairs biweekly meetings where the officials  responsible for these systems meet to review the status of key systems  development and testing efforts.", "In addition, in response to prior recommendations, the Bureau took initial  steps to enhance its programwide oversight; however, these steps have not  been sufficient to establish adequate executive-level oversight. In June  2008, the Bureau established an inventory of all testing activities specific  to all key decennial operations. This inventory showed that, as of May  2008, 18 percent of about 1049 system testing activities had not been  planned. (See fig. 4.) In addition, approximately 67 percent of about 836  operational testing activities had not been planned.", "Although officials from the Decennial System and Processing Office  described the inventory effort as a means of improving executive-level  oversight, the inventory has not been updated since May 2008, and officials  have no plans for further updates. Instead, officials stated that they plan to  track testing progress as part of the Bureau\u2019s detailed master schedule of  census activities. However, this schedule does not provide comprehensive  status information on testing.", "In another effort to improve executive-level oversight, the Decennial  Management Division began producing (as of July 2008) a weekly  executive alert report and has established (as of October 2008) monthly  dashboard and reporting indicators. However, these products do not  provide comprehensive status information on the testing progress of key  systems and interfaces. For example, the executive alert report does not  include the progress of testing activities, and although the dashboard  provides a high-level, qualitative assessment of testing for key operations  and selected systems, it does not provide information on the testing  progress of all key systems and interfaces.", "Further, the assessment of testing progress has not been based on  quantitative and specific metrics. For example, the status of testing key  operations removed from the Dress Rehearsal was marked as acceptable,  or \u201cgreen,\u201d although the Bureau does not yet have plans for testing these  activities. Bureau officials stated that they marked these activities as  acceptable because, based on past experience, they felt comfortable that a  plan would be developed in time to adequately test these operations. The  lack of quantitative and specific metrics to track progress limits the  Bureau\u2019s ability to accurately assess the status and progress of testing  activities. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Bureau provided  selected examples in which they had begun to use more detailed metrics  to track the progress of end-to-end testing activities.", "Finally, although the Bureau announced in August 2008 that it was  planning to hire a senior manager who would have primary responsibility  for monitoring testing across all decennial systems and programs, the  position had not been filled as of January 2009. Instead, agency officials  stated that the role is being filled by another manager from the Decennial  Statistical Studies Division, who has numerous other responsibilities.", "The Bureau also has weaknesses in its testing guidance; it has not  established comprehensive guidance for system testing. According to the  Associate Director for the 2010 Census, the Bureau did establish a policy  strongly encouraging offices responsible for decennial systems to use best  practices in software development and testing, as specified in level 2 of  Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Capability Maturity Model\u00ae Integration. However,  beyond this general guidance, there is no additional guidance on key  testing activities such as criteria for each level or the type of test products  expected. Standardized policies and procedures help to ensure  comprehensive processes across an organization and allow for effective  executive-level oversight. The lack of guidance has led to an ad hoc\u2014and,  at times\u2014less than desirable approach to testing."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While the Bureau\u2019s program offices have made progress in testing key  decennial systems, much work remains to ensure that systems operate as  intended for conducting an accurate and timely 2010 census. Several  program offices have yet to prepare and execute system test plans and  schedules and ensure that system requirements are fully tested. In  addition, the Bureau has not developed a master list of interfaces, which is  necessary to prioritize testing and to develop comprehensive integration  test plans and schedules. Additionally, end-to-end testing plans for key  operations have not been finalized or executed based on established  priorities to help ensure that systems will support census operations.", "Weaknesses in the Bureau\u2019s IT testing can be attributed, in part, to a lack  of sufficient executive-level oversight and guidance. More detailed metrics  and status reports would help the Bureau to better monitor testing  progress and identify and address problems. Giving accountability for  testing to a senior-level official would also provide the focus and attention  needed to complete critical testing. Also, completing risk mitigation plans  will help ensure that actions are in place to address potential problems  with systems.

For  example, while the Bureau has conducted paper-based nonresponse  followup during previous censuses, it will be using newly developed  systems which have not yet been fully tested in a census-like environment  to integrate responses and manage the nonresponse followup work load.  In addition, new procedures, such as one to remove questionnaires that  were mailed in late from the nonresponse followup operation, have not  been tested with these systems. Any significant change to an existing IT  system introduces the risk that the system may not work as intended;  therefore, testing all systems after changes have been made to ensure the  systems work as intended is critical to the success of the 2010 census.", "In addition, the department and Bureau provided technical comments,  such as noting draft plans that had been developed after the conclusion of  our work, that we have incorporated where appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Commerce, the  Director of the U.S. Census Bureau, and other appropriate congressional  committees.
