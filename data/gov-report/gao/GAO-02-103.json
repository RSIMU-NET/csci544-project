Non-DOD parties such as private contractors or lessees that may have contributed to such contamination may also be responsible for the costs of cleanup at these sites. The Department and other responsible parties either agree to a cost sharing arrangement with the responsible parties conducting the cleanup or the Department conducts the cleanup and attempts to recover the other parties\u2019 share after the cleanup. In previous reports, we identified wide variations in practices within the Department concerning attempts to recover non-DOD parties\u2019 share of the costs of cleanups and recommended that the Department resolve these inconsistencies. Section 348 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 required the Department to issue guidance and collect data on cost recoveries.  In response, the Department issued guidance that requires its components (the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense Logistics Agency) to identify, investigate, and pursue cost recoveries and to report on them in its Defense Environmental Restoration Program Annual Report to the Congress.", "In fiscal year 1998, the Senate Committee on Armed Services directed that we continue to review the Department\u2019s efforts to recover the costs of cleanups from non-DOD parties. In August 2000 and May 2001, we briefed your offices on the status of the Department\u2019s cost recovery efforts. As agreed with your offices, for this report, we determined whether the cost recovery data included in the Department\u2019s fiscal year 1999 report, the latest issued, are accurate, consistent, and complete and how the data changed from those reported in fiscal year 1998.", "The Department\u2019s annual report is the primary vehicle for reporting on environmental cleanups. DOD components provide data on the costs recovered from non-DOD parties, which are included in an appendix to the report. The components use the Department\u2019s 1998 guidance for reporting on cleanups and cost recoveries. The guidance requires that the components attempt to recover the costs of cleanups that exceed $50,000 and report the cleanup sites\u2019 name and location, the amounts recovered, and the costs of pursuing the recovery (for example, attorneys\u2019 fees). For our report, we reviewed the Department\u2019s guidance and the fiscal year 1999 report, including the cost recovery appendix. The details of our scope and methodology are in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Having nearly 28,000 potentially contaminated sites, the Department of Defense manages one of the world\u2019s largest environmental cleanup programs. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, contractors and other private parties may share liability for the cleanup costs at these sites. Two major types of sites that may involve such liability are government-owned, contractor-operated facilities (whose operators may be liable) and formerly used Defense sites (whose current and past owners and operators may be liable). The Defense Environmental Restoration Program Annual Report to the Congress is the primary reporting vehicle for the status of cleanup at the many sites for which DOD is either solely or partly responsible for the contamination. The report contains information on the status of cleanup at the sites, such as the amounts spent to date; future costs; and the stage of completion, among other data.", "In 1992, 1994, and 1997, we reported that the Department had inconsistent policies and practices for cleanup cost reimbursements to and/or recovery of cleanup costs from non-DOD parties responsible for contamination. We recommended that the Secretary of Defense provide guidance to resolve the inconsistencies. The guidance issued by the Department requires the components to pursue the recovery of cleanup costs of $50,000 or more and to include in the annual report to the Congress each site\u2019s name and location, the recovery status, the amount recovered, and the cost of pursuing the recovery. Under the guidance, if a component determines that it is not in the best interests of the government to pursue a cost recovery, it must inform the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environmental Security (now, the Deputy Under Secretary for Installations and Environment), who is responsible for compiling the annual report to Congress. The guidance does not define \u201ccost recovery\u201d or \u201ccost sharing,\u201d and does not address (1) how the costs of pursuing recovery should be determined; (2) whether data on cost recoveries should be reported by fiscal year, cumulatively, or both; and (3) what the procedures are for ensuring that the data are accurate, consistent, and complete."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data in DOD\u2019s Fiscal Year 1999 Report Are Not Accurate, Consistent, or Complete", "paragraphs": ["Because the Department\u2019s management guidance is silent or unclear on key aspects of reporting necessary to collect, verify, and report data on cleanup cost recoveries, its report to Congress for fiscal year 1999 does not provide accurate, consistent, or complete data.  Sound management practices require that organizations have clear and specific guidance regarding what data are to be collected and how they are to be reported, and the controls to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the reports. The reports should be useful to managers for controlling operations and to auditors and others for analyzing operations.

For example, the Army Corps of Engineers reported that at Weldon Spring, Missouri, it had recovered $180.6 million. Supporting records, however, show the amount as the Corps\u2019 share of costs for cleanup the Department of Energy is performing at the site. Corps officials told us they reported only the Corps\u2019 share of cleanup costs at these sites because the guidance did not define \u201ccost sharing.\u201d In addition, these officials said they did not know what others spend on cleanup at the sites. (This is further discussed in the section on the data\u2019s completeness.)  The Corps of Engineers also incorrectly reported recoveries totaling about $70 million at other sites that were also its share of cleanup costs rather than recovered amounts.", "Additionally, there were other reporting inaccuracies.  For example, two sites with ongoing recoveries\u2014the Rocky Mountain Arsenal and the Massachusetts Military Reservation\u2014that should have been reported by the Army in the fiscal year 1998 report were not reported until the following year.  The reported recoveries at these two sites were $17.3 million and $28.2 million, respectively, and were not reported because the Army did not report cost sharing arrangements in fiscal year 1998."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reported Data Are Not Consistent", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s guidance did not specify how to calculate the costs of pursuing recovery or whether components should report fiscal year data, cumulative data, or both. Consequently, the components\u2019 reported data for both cost recoveries and the costs of pursuing recoveries were not consistent.", "Calculating the costs of pursuing recoveries has been particularly problematic. For example, although some costs, such as certain legal costs, are obviously related to efforts to recover costs, other legal costs, such as those incurred in defense against charges brought by states or counties, are not.  Reported costs to pursue recovery for fiscal years 1998 and 1999 were $6.2 million and $37.3 million, respectively.", "In the absence of sufficient guidance, Defense components have varied in their reporting of cost recoveries and the costs to pursue recoveries:   The Air Force estimated the costs of pursuing recoveries at one site and applied these same costs to other sites. It was also the only component that reported cost sharing arrangements with other federal agencies.", "The Navy said it did not keep records to allow it to capture the costs of pursuing recoveries in fiscal year 1998 and reported \u201cunknown\u201d or \u201cto be determined\u201d in fiscal year 1999.", "The Defense Logistics Agency reported $3.6 million in costs to pursue recoveries and $1.1 million in recovered amounts. Officials later determined that some of the reported costs, such as contract costs for investigating and cleaning up the site, should not have been included.", "Reporting entities have also been inconsistent in reporting data by fiscal year and cumulatively.  For example, in the 1998 report, the Army used fiscal year data for cost recoveries and cumulative data for costs to pursue recoveries. The following year, it used fiscal year data for both. The Air Force and Defense Logistics Agency used cumulative data for recoveries and costs to pursue recoveries.  The Navy used cumulative data for recoveries.", "Each of the methods for presenting data\u2014cumulatively or by fiscal year\u2014 has certain drawbacks. Showing data cumulatively shows the long term progress that DOD has made in recovering costs, but it can also obscure instances in which no recoveries occurred in a given fiscal year. Conversely, data for the fiscal year do not show total recoveries at a given site."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reported Data Are Not Complete", "paragraphs": ["The environmental cleanup cost recovery data reported to Congress for fiscal year 1999 were more extensive than that reported in the previous fiscal year\u2019s report primarily because the Corps of Engineers reported on cost sharing arrangements at 86 sites that it did not report in fiscal year 1998. The Army also reported on two additional sites in the report for fiscal year 1999. The Navy reported on one additional site, and the Air Force added one site but eliminated another.

This field includes information such as progress in conducting investigations and contracts awarded for cleanup.  Comments in the additional information field and other sections of the report indicated that cost recovery activities were occurring at sites that were not included in the cost recovery appendix.  We identified 138 sites where cleanup costs exceeded the Department\u2019s threshold for pursuing recoveries, and where there were indications that either cost recovery was being considered or that non-DOD parties were involved in cleanup. None of these sites were reported in the cost recovery appendix. Fifty-five of these sites were from the fiscal years 1998 and 1999 reports. For example, the groundwater cleanup at Bethpage Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant, New York, involved Northrop/Grumman and the Occidental Chemical Company. Also, comments listed under the Army Tarheel Missile Plant, North Carolina, indicated that cost recovery would be requested from Lucent Technologies, a caretaker contractor at the installation. Neither, however, was included in the report\u2019s cost recovery appendix. Failure to include these and other sites at which components may be recovering costs requires decisionmakers and others to search through over 800 pages of reported cleanup data to obtain a complete picture of cost recovery activities.", "The Defense components are required to report both the costs shared with non-DOD parties at the time of cleanup and the costs that they recovered from non-DOD parties after cleanup. However, the components did not report the amounts for some recoveries because they did not know how much money the non-DOD parties had contributed to cleanups resulting from cost sharing arrangements. The Department\u2019s guidance does not include directions for obtaining, calculating, or estimating these amounts; and the components do not have adequate procedures to gather this information. As a result, for 88 sites listed in the fiscal year 1999 report, the amounts spent by non- DOD parties under cost sharing arrangements were not shown. (See table 1.)", "Although it is required, none of the DOD components provided the reasons for deciding not to pursue cost recoveries. According to DOD officials, some reasons for not pursuing recoveries include circumstances where there is insufficient evidence that non-DOD parties caused the problems at the site, where the other responsible party is no longer in business, or where pursuit of the recovery would cost more than the expected amounts recovered.

If effectively implemented, the guidance should improve overall reporting of cost recovery data.  The Department also noted that it was unable to verify the numbers in our report because we had obtained data that were not included in the fiscal year 1999 annual report.
