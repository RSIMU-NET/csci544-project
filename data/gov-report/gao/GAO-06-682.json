However, material misstatements may nevertheless  occur in other information reported by the Foundation on its financial  status to its Board of Directors and others as a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described in this  report.", "As discussed in a later section of this report and in Note 12 to the financial  statements, the Foundation continues to experience difficulties in meeting  its financial obligations.  The Foundation\u2019s continuing financial difficulties  raise substantial doubt, for the fourth consecutive year, about its ability to  continue as a going concern.  The financial statements have been prepared  under the assumption that the Foundation would continue as a going  concern, and do not include any adjustments that would need to be made if  the Foundation were to cease operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opinion on Internal Control", "paragraphs": ["Because of the material weakness in internal control discussed below, the  Foundation did not maintain effective internal control over financial  reporting (including safeguarding assets) but did have effective control  over compliance with laws and regulations.  The Foundation\u2019s controls did  not provide reasonable assurance that losses and misstatements material in  relation to the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a  timely basis.  Our opinion is based on criteria established in our Standards  for Internal Control in the Federal Government.", "In our report on the results of our audit of the Foundation\u2019s fiscal year 2004  financial statements, we reported that the deteriorating financial condition  of the Foundation led to further deterioration in controls over the financial  reporting process, impeding its ability to prepare timely and accurate  financial statements.  At the conclusion of our audit of the Foundation\u2019s  fiscal year 2004 financial statements, we stressed to the Foundation\u2019s  management the importance of documenting the Foundation\u2019s financial  reporting policies and procedures, and further stressed that the policies  and procedures should detail such functions as the monthly closing  process, preparation of the financial statements, and review of financial  data by management.", "During fiscal year 2005, the Foundation hired an accountant to help ensure  that accurate and timely accounting and reporting of financial information  occurred.  This enabled the Foundation to provide us with a draft of the  financial statements within 5 months after the fiscal year-end, something  the Foundation had been unable to do in each of the preceding two  financial statement audits.  However, the Foundation continued to lack  appropriate written procedures during fiscal year 2005 for making closing  entries in its financial records and for preparing complete and accurate  financial statements.  The continued lack of written policies and  procedures during fiscal year 2005 contributed to errors we identified  during our audit of the Foundation\u2019s fiscal year 2005 financial statements.   For example, the Foundation did not adequately perform its year-end bank  reconciliation and misclassified the forgiveness by vendors of some of its  outstanding debt.  Both of these issues resulted in audit adjustments to the  financial statements.  In addition, numerous errors in the financial  statements were not detected by management\u2019s review.  This resulted in the  need for management to make material adjustments to correct errors we  identified during our audit.  The Foundation was ultimately able to produce  financial statements that were fairly stated in all material respects for fiscal  years 2005 and 2004, but not without substantial adjustments identified  during our audit.", "Subsequent to fiscal year 2005, the Foundation\u2019s Board of Directors\u2019 newly  elected Treasurer worked with the National Office staff to improve internal  control over financial reporting and develop written fiscal policies and  procedures for financial operations and reporting.  Since these procedures  were not drafted until after fiscal year 2005, and the procedures related to  financial reporting were not implemented in fiscal year 2005, they had no  effect on the fiscal year 2005 financial statements.  However, if properly  implemented, they should lead to improvements in financial management  going forward.  We will evaluate the effectiveness of these new policies and  procedures during our audit of the Foundation\u2019s fiscal year 2006 financial  statements.", "Foundation management asserted that, with the exception of the material  weakness in financial reporting, its internal control during the period was  effective based on criteria established under GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government.  In making its assertion, Foundation  management stated the need to improve control over financial reporting.   Although the weakness did not materially affect the final fiscal year 2005  financial statements as adjusted for errors identified by the audit process,  deficiencies in internal control may adversely affect any decision by  management that is based, in whole or in part, on other information that is  inaccurate because of the deficiencies.  Unaudited financial information  reported by the Foundation may also contain misstatements resulting from  these deficiencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Compliance With Laws and Regulations", "paragraphs": ["Our tests for compliance with relevant provisions of laws and regulations  for fiscal year 2005 disclosed no instances of noncompliance that would be  reportable under U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards.   However, the objective of our audit was not to provide an opinion on  overall compliance with laws and regulations.  Accordingly, we do not  express such an opinion.", "For the fiscal year 2004 audit, our tests for compliance with relevant  provisions of laws and regulations disclosed one area of material  noncompliance that was reportable under U.S. generally accepted  government auditing standards.  This concerned the Foundation\u2019s ability to  ensure that it had appropriate procedures for fiscal control and fund  accounting and that its financial operations were administered by  personnel with expertise in accounting and financial management.", "Specifically, section 104(c)(1) of the Congressional Award Act, as amended  (2 U.S.C. \u00a7 804(c)(1)), requires the Director, in consultation with the  Congressional Award Board, to \u201censure that appropriate procedures for  fiscal control and fund accounting are established for the financial  operations of the Congressional Award Program, and that such operations  are administered by personnel with expertise in accounting and financial  management.\u201d   The Comptroller General is required by section  104(c)(2)(A) of the Congressional Award Act, as amended (2 U.S.C. \u00a7  804(c)(2)(A)), to (1) annually determine whether the Director has  substantially complied with the requirement to have appropriate  procedures for fiscal control and fund accounting for the financial  operations of the Congressional Award Program and to have personnel  with expertise in accounting and financial management to administer the  financial operations, and (2) report the findings in the annual audit report.", "For 2004, because the Foundation did not have appropriate fiscal  procedures and did not have an individual with expertise in accounting and  financial management to routinely administer the procedures and account  for the financial operations of the Foundation, we determined that the  Director did not substantially comply with the requirements in section  104(c)(1) of the Congressional Award Act, as amended (2 U.S.C. \u00a7  804(c)(1)).", "As discussed earlier, during fiscal year 2005, the Foundation hired an  accountant to focus on improving financial management.  Subsequent to  fiscal year 2005, the newly elected Treasurer and Audit Committee Chair  worked with the National Office staff to improve internal control over  financial reporting and develop written fiscal policies and procedures for  financial operations and reporting.  Due to these actions, we were able to  conclude that for the year under audit, the Foundation was in compliance  with the provisions of the Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Foundation\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern", "paragraphs": ["The Foundation incurred a gain (increase in net assets) of about $10,000 in  fiscal year 2005 as compared to a loss (decrease in net assets) of almost  $168,000 in fiscal year 2004.  This difference of approximately $178,000 was  due primarily to a reduction in salary expenses in fiscal year 2005.  Salary  expenses were less in fiscal year 2005 because the National Director, who  retired at the end of fiscal year 2004, was not replaced during fiscal year  2005.  The Program Director functioned in two positions, serving as the  Acting National Director as well as the Program Director.  As a result, the  Foundation\u2019s salary costs were reduced by over $172,000 between fiscal  years 2004 and 2005.", "Although the Foundation\u2019s overall expenses decreased by over $130,000  between fiscal years 2004 and 2005, operating revenues and other support  decreased by over $134,000, attributable in part to a nearly $64,000 decline  in contributions.  The Foundation attributed this decline in contributions to  the fact that the Foundation was not reauthorized by the Congress for fiscal  year 2005 which, it believes, discouraged some donors from contributing to  the Foundation.  The Foundation\u2019s previous authorization expired on  October 1, 2004.  On December 22, 2005, the President signed Public Law  109-143, which reauthorized the Congressional Award Foundation through  September 30, 2009.", "During fiscal year 2002, the Foundation borrowed $100,000, the maximum  amount allowable against its revolving line of credit, due to ongoing cash  flow problems associated with its daily operations.  This debt, partially  secured by a $50,000 certificate of deposit, remained outstanding at  September 30, 2005.", "Note 12 to the financial statements acknowledges the Foundation\u2019s  difficulties in meeting its financial obligations.  The Foundation has taken  steps to decrease its expenditures and liabilities.  For example, accounts  payable at September 30, 2005, were approximately $16,000, down from  $135,500 in fiscal year 2004.  This decrease in accounts payable was due to  the Foundation using funds from the Congressional Award Fellowship  Trust to pay off a substantial portion of its liabilities, and its ability to  negotiate with certain of its vendors to cancel about $63,000 in liabilities to  these vendors during fiscal year 2005.  In addition, the Foundation showed  considerable cost reductions as evidenced by the decrease in operating  expenses (primarily salaries) from over $594,000 in fiscal year 2004 to  about $464,000 in fiscal year 2005.  However, these steps may not be  sufficient to allow it to continue operations.", "Unaudited financial data compiled by the Foundation as of March 31, 2006,  showed that its financial condition has not improved through the first half  of fiscal year 2006.  While the Foundation has $112,000 in contributions  receivable as of March 31, 2006, $52,000 of this contribution is to be used to  cover costs associated with its planned Congressional Award Golf Classic  fundraising event in May, and $30,000 is to be used to cover costs  associated with the annual Gold Award ceremony in June.  The golf  fundraising event resulted in net revenues for the first time in fiscal year  2004, so its ability to raise funds annually cannot be assured, and the Gold  Award ceremony is not a fundraising event.  There are also indications that  the Foundation is continuing to have difficulty meeting its obligations;  according to the minutes of the January 31, 2006, Board of Directors\u2019  meeting, the Acting National Director and the Controller delayed cashing  their pay checks for two pay periods in January 2006 due to cash flow  problems at the Foundation.", "In addition, the Foundation has a $100,000 line of credit that is payable  upon demand.  If this liability needed to be paid immediately, the  Foundation would have to liquidate its $55,000 certificate of deposit, equity  securities of about $36,000 (reported as outstanding at March 31, 2006), and  its remaining cash balance of about $6,700.", "In its plan to deal with its financial difficulties and increase its revenues,  the Foundation modified its approach to fundraising during the past 2 years  by holding more frequent but smaller and less expensive fundraising events  than in the past.  However, these smaller fundraisers did not increase  contributions, which decreased by over $64,000, or 23 percent, from fiscal  years 2004 to 2005.", "In an effort to further improve fundraising efforts, the Foundation stated  that its Board created a Congressional Liaison Committee, Development  Committee, and Program Committee during fiscal year 2005.  The  Foundation reported that these committees have raised the visibility of the  Foundation.  In addition, the Development Committee has increased the  number of fundraisers from one in the first half of fiscal year 2005 to three  in the first half of fiscal year 2006.  The newly elected Development  Chairperson is leading fundraising initiatives in the corporate community,  including pursuing grant opportunities, and the Foundation continues to  work with professional fundraisers to more actively involve congressional  members.
