Because of these concerns, GAO was asked to review a number of issues surrounding IRS's enforcement efforts. GAO determined the trends in the percent of returns filed that are audited (contact rate) compared with similar data on taxpayer contacts through other enforcement programs for fiscal years 1993 through 2002.

However, the audit rate portrays only a portion of IRS's efforts to enforce tax laws and not all of those efforts have been declining. For IRS's three nonaudit enforcement programs, the contact rates in 2002 compared to 1993, after year to year variations, declined for one, essentially remained the same for one, and significantly increased for one--math error. A complete math error contact trend is unavailable because IRS did not capture one type of data on a substantial number of contacts prior to 1997. For years where complete data are available, IRS has not included all math errors in external reports. IRS officials agreed that all types of errors are identified under the same math error authority and should be similarly counted and reported. IRS annually reports extensive data on audits but only limited, or no, data on its other enforcement programs. This limited reporting does not provide policymakers or taxpayers information on the full extent of IRS's enforcement efforts. To the extent that taxpayers do, as is widely believed, take the level of enforcement into account when self-reporting their tax obligations, the audit rate alone may mislead them. IRS officials believe that more reporting is desirable and intend to report readily available, but incomplete, information on nonaudit programs in future reports."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States tax system is based on self-reporting and voluntary  compliance by taxpayers.

These errors must be corrected to  process a tax return.", "Document Matching Program: This program matches information on  selected tax issues (usually income) reported on tax returns by individual  taxpayers and reported on information returns by employers, banks, and  other payers of income. Document matching also matches information  returns (schedule K-1) filed by pass-through entities\u2014such as  partnerships, trusts and S-corporations\u2014to individual tax returns.

This report    compares IRS\u2019s enforcement programs in terms of their legal authority,  and operational characteristics (including IRS staff time), and describes  what is known about taxpayer perceptions of the enforcement programs.    summarizes enforcement contact trends overall and by taxpayer income  and their causes from 1993 to 2002.    determines what IRS knows about the effect of its enforcement programs  on individual taxpayer compliance and the burdens taxpayers experience  when contacted under the programs.    assesses whether and, if so, how IRS should expand reporting on its  enforcement programs.", "To address these objectives, our work included interviewing IRS officials  and reviewing documents on the similarities and differences across IRS  enforcement programs. To identify trends in IRS\u2019s enforcement programs  including trends by taxpayer income levels, we analyzed IRS data from  fiscal years 1993 through 2002. To analyze impacts on taxpayers, and  tradeoffs of reporting more data about the enforcement programs, we  interviewed IRS officials and reviewed any available research on how the  programs affect individual taxpayers\u2019 compliance and burden. (See our  scope and methodology section for details on our approach.) In addition,  you asked us to analyze trends in the number of contacts by the specific  programs. Appendix III provides this information."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Each year, IRS screens all individual tax returns and selects a small  percentage in which to contact taxpayers about potential noncompliance.  Prior to doing automated checks of tax returns, IRS had relied on its audit  program to contact taxpayers about apparent inaccuracies in reporting  income, deductions, and other issues on their tax returns. For example, to  verify interest income or dependent exemptions claimed by taxpayers, IRS  auditors had to contact taxpayers, request and review documentation.  Thus, if IRS audited the returns of 5 percent of all taxpayers, it could at  most check on the accuracy of interest income for 5 percent of taxpayers.", "Since the 1970s, IRS\u2019s ability to verify some items on individual returns  expanded as IRS\u2019s capacity to use automated processes grew and as  Congress enacted laws requiring third parties (like banks, mortgage  finance firms, etc.) to provide information returns to taxpayers and IRS on  income paid. These steps enabled IRS to more universally and efficiently  check taxpayer compliance for those tax issues covered by information  returns. For example, with the initiation of information returns for interest  income and the development of IRS\u2019s automated capacity, IRS began to  check whether every taxpayer for whom it had received an applicable  information return had accurately reported that interest on their tax  return.", "As a result, for some wage earners who claim no deductions, IRS can  review the accuracy of all, or nearly all, items reported on their tax return  to the extent that third parties correctly filed all information returns. In  these cases, IRS effectively receives information that should be in  taxpayers \u201cbooks and records\u201d and no longer needs to use auditors to  obtain such information from taxpayers\u2019 records for these selected issues.", "Concurrent with these expansions in IRS\u2019s ability to check the accuracy of  certain issues on taxpayers\u2019 returns, the number of taxpayer returns that  IRS audited began to decline. For example, between fiscal years 1981 and  1992, the number of document matching contacts rose from 1.2 million to  3.8 million and the number of audits dropped from 2.5 million to   1.1 million.", "Several GAO reports have discussed IRS audits, other enforcement  contacts, and taxpayer burden as follows:  In 1996, we reported that audit rates fell from 1988 to 1993 and then rose  to a high of 1.67 percent in 1995. In 2001, we reported that audit rates had  steadily dropped from 1996 to 2000, declining to 0.49 percent.", "During 2000, we reported that IRS made almost 10 million nonaudit  contacts of taxpayers in 1998 through about 6 million math error notices,   2 million document matching notices, and 2 million soft notices. We  recommended that IRS analyze the data collected for each of the three  major nonaudit contact programs to improve taxpayer compliance and  taxpayer service.", "During 2000, we reported on IRS\u2019s efforts to estimate taxpayer compliance  burden for prefiling, filing, and postfiling activities. We found that IRS was  developing two models that, when combined, should provide more reliable  estimates of compliance burden for wage earners."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To compare audit and other enforcement programs, we obtained  information on their legal and operational characteristics. For legal  authority, we reviewed the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and IRS  documents. For program operations, we reviewed IRS documents and  interviewed responsible IRS officials to understand how each program  works. For the average time spent on each type of contact, we analyzed  available IRS data for fiscal years 1993 through 2002. For how taxpayers  perceive IRS\u2019s enforcement programs, we interviewed IRS officials;  reviewed tax research studies and press articles; and contacted four large  national organizations representing attorneys, certified public  accountants, enrolled agents, and tax preparers, as well as the largest tax  return preparation firm, and IRS\u2019s national taxpayer advocate.", "To summarize trends in the number and rate of individual taxpayer audits  and other enforcement contacts in total and by taxpayer income, we  analyzed available IRS data from fiscal year 1993 to fiscal year 2002 on  each type of contact. To compute the audit contact rate, we used IRS\u2019s  method, which equals the proportion of IRS audits closed in a fiscal year  compared with returns filed in the previous calendar year. IRS has not  stated a method for computing math error, document matching, and  nonfiler rates. For the document matching and nonfiler programs, we  compared the proportion of notices sent in a fiscal year to return filings in  the previous year because these contacts generally occur in the year after  a return is filed. For the math error program, we based the contact rate on  the proportion of math error notices to the returns filed in that year  because the notices are sent to taxpayers as IRS processes tax returns. For  the math error, document matching, and nonfiler programs, we based the  contact rate on the number of initial notices sent to taxpayers rather than  closures because (1) it is the broadest measure of IRS\u2019s enforcement  efforts with taxpayers and (2) the math error and document matching  programs usually conclude the contact with the taxpayer within a few  months after the initial notice is sent. Nonfiler contacts can take  considerably longer to close, making it difficult to know which tax year to  use in computing a contact rate. We used the number of initial notices so  that the nonfiler program could be measured on a consistent basis with  the document matching and math error programs. To understand the  reasons for the trends, we analyzed our previously issued reports and IRS  reports and interviewed IRS staff for each enforcement program.", "To determine how audit and other enforcement programs affect individual  taxpayer compliance and burden, we obtained and reviewed available data  such as IRS studies and reports, our previous reports, and other research.  We also interviewed responsible IRS officials.", "To assess whether IRS should expand reporting on its enforcement efforts,  we analyzed the types of enforcement data already publicly reported on an  annual basis by IRS. We also analyzed the tradeoffs for two options we  identified\u2014expanding the definition of audit to include the other  enforcement programs and reporting more data on each program. We used  much of the information from the previous objectives and interviews with  IRS officials.", "For all objectives, our work focused on the four major enforcement  programs identified by IRS\u2014math error, document matching, nonfiler, and  audit. We attempted to verify the completeness and accuracy of IRS\u2019s data  but could not reconcile all differences given time constraints. As a result,  we either did not report some data or disclosed limitations in the data  being reported. Further, in analyzing audit and document matching rates  by income level, we did not adjust the income levels for the effects of  inflation over the 1993 to 2002 period because detailed data on taxpayer  income was not available during the timeframes for the assignment. All  data used in the report are final except for the number of tax returns filed  in 2002. Because this number is preliminary, the final math error contact  rate for fiscal year 2002 may differ somewhat from what we report. In  addition, you asked us to analyze two newer IRS efforts\u2014voluntary  compliance agreements and soft notices. Appendix IV describes the two  newer efforts.", "We did our work at IRS\u2019s national office in Washington, D.C., and offices in  New Carrolton, Maryland, and Atlanta, Georgia, between August 2002 and  December 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government  accounting standards.

With regard to legal characteristics,  audits and other enforcement programs are all authorized to contact  taxpayers about apparent noncompliance and to determine and adjust  taxpayers\u2019 tax liability. However, audits have the broadest authority to  detect possible noncompliance, significant powers to obtain information,  and the most restrictions on how IRS is to interact with taxpayers. With  regard to operational characteristics, the extent to which audits are  operationally similar to or different from other enforcement programs  varies depending on the type of audit. Audits done in taxpayer locations  and IRS offices are not similar operationally to other enforcement  programs and audits done through correspondence with the taxpayer,  while still different, are more operationally similar to some of the other  programs. IRS officials were unaware of any research on whether  taxpayers perceive differences among IRS\u2019s enforcement programs.  However, looking at audits and other enforcement programs from the  taxpayers\u2019 perspective, IRS officials and officials we interviewed who  represent taxpayers believe that taxpayers may not perceive distinctions  among many of the enforcement programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Legal Characteristics: Audits Have the Broadest Scope, Significant Powers to Obtain Information, and the Most Detailed Restrictions", "paragraphs": ["In a general sense, the IRC provisions for enforcement are similar in that  they authorize IRS to contact taxpayers about apparent noncompliance  and to determine and adjust taxpayers\u2019 tax liability. However, the IRC  provisions grant IRS the authority to review all matters that may affect a  taxpayer\u2019s tax liabilities under audits but only certain specified tax issues  under other enforcement programs. The IRC also establishes more rules\u2014 including significant powers to obtain information as well as restrictions  on those powers\u2014that govern the nature of audit contacts with taxpayers  than for the other programs.", "The IRC does not explicitly limit the tax issues to be covered by an audit,  unlike for the other enforcement programs. Under the authority of section  7602, audits can cover any issue on a tax return, including those that the  other programs cover. In contrast, the IRC specifies the scope of legal  authority for the three other enforcement programs. For example, after  five statutory expansions since 1976, math error authority now covers   11 tax issues (see app. I). Document matching\u2014which grew primarily  through the 1980s as Congress authorized more information reporting\u2014 now covers over 20 types of individual income as well as certain tax  credits and deductions (see app. II). The IRC also specifically authorizes  the nonfiler program to pursue unfiled tax returns that should have been  filed.", "The IRC also establishes more rules governing IRS\u2019s contacts with  individual taxpayers under the audit program than it does for the math  error, document matching, and nonfiler programs. These rules give IRS  significant powers to obtain information needed to determine an  individual\u2019s tax liabilities when doing an audit and, in turn, places  restrictions on the use of those powers. If resolving issues raised under the  other enforcement programs requires that IRS auditors become involved,  the contacts with taxpayers become audits subject to these greater powers  and restrictions. For example, if a taxpayer who receives a math error  notice files a claim for IRS to abate the tax assessment, IRS could audit  that claim. Similarly, if a taxpayer responds to a document matching  notice with materials that cannot be readily and immediately used to settle  the discrepancy, the case could be referred to audit staff.", "The greater powers that IRS has under audit compared with the other  programs include the authority to examine books and records and take  testimony for purposes of determining the tax liability of a tax return. IRS  also has the power to use a summons to compel taxpayers and third  parties to provide books and records, and to enter premises to examine  objects subject to taxation.", "Given these greater powers, the law also places more restrictions on  audits to protect taxpayer rights. For example, the law restricts IRS from  doing unnecessary audits or generally doing more than one inspection of  taxpayers\u2019 books for each tax year. The law also governs the time and  place of an audit and burden of proof on IRS. In addition, the Internal  Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act (RRA) of 1998 (P.L. 105- 206) added several requirements, such as informing taxpayers of their  rights during audits.", "On the other hand, RRA also added a provision that creates a legal  similarity for all four enforcement programs because it affects any IRS  employee, including those making audit or nonaudit contacts. Section 1203  of RRA lays out the conditions under which any IRS employee is to be  fired for any of 10 specific acts or omissions. Many of these conditions  involve contacts with taxpayers\u2014such as harassing taxpayers or taxpayer  representatives, violating their civil rights, or threatening to audit a  taxpayer for personal gain. These restrictions were intended to protect  taxpayers in their interactions with IRS.", "Another legal provision creates a similarity between audits and two of the  three other programs. Except for the math error program, when IRS  proposes a change in taxpayers\u2019 liabilities, it is required to send a notice  informing taxpayers of their rights, such as the right to appeal additional  taxes that IRS proposes. The IRC does not provide taxpayers a right to  appeal assessments created under math error authority because that  authority generally applies to obvious errors made by taxpayers on their  returns. However, IRS informs taxpayers receiving a math error notice that  they may file a claim to ask IRS to abate (reduce) the tax assessment if  they believe IRS erred."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Operational Characteristics: Audits at IRS Offices or Taxpayer Locations Differ the Most from Other Enforcement Programs", "paragraphs": ["The extent to which audits are operationally similar to or different from  other enforcement programs varies depending on the type of audit.  Compared with other enforcement programs, audits done in taxpayers\u2019  locations or IRS offices are more likely to deal with multiple and complex  issues, require more skill and judgment by IRS employees, require a  greater number of interactions with taxpayers, and take more IRS staff  time. Correspondence audits also tend to differ from other enforcement  programs in these operational characteristics but to a lesser degree, and in  some cases correspondence audits and document matching contacts with  taxpayers can be very similar in these characteristics. Table 1 provides an  overview of key operational dimensions across the enforcement programs.", "Reviewing these operational dimensions helps highlight similarities and  differences across the four types of enforcement.", "Contact triggers: All enforcement contacts use computers to identify a  potential compliance issue. However, audits are more likely to be  triggered by other means such as a special compliance project or referrals  from inside or outside of IRS.", "Number of contacts: Once any potential compliance issues are found, the  fewest contacts with taxpayers to resolve the issues are likely under the  math error and document matching programs because they have relatively  simple issues. Correspondence audits might need more than one contact,  depending on the complexity of the issue(s) being audited and taxpayers\u2019  responses. The number of contacts in the nonfiler program can vary  depending on whether taxpayers respond to an IRS notice by filing a  return, or explaining why a return was not required. Some may not  respond, possibly leading IRS to send a second notice or create a  substitute return and send it to that taxpayer. Audits at IRS offices or  taxpayer locations are likely to have the most contacts with taxpayers  through meetings, notices, or the telephone because they tend to cover  several, more complex issues.", "IRS staff skill and judgment: Audit contacts\u2014especially those done in  IRS offices or in taxpayer locations\u2014require the most staff skill and  judgment to analyze taxpayers\u2019 testimony and books and records. Being  more automated and usually dealing with simpler issues, other  enforcement programs rely on less staff skill and judgment. Document  matching staff might have to analyze taxpayers\u2019 explanations for why they  do not owe more tax but are to refer the case to the audit program if an  explanation requires detailed analysis or includes books and records. The  nonfiler program requires limited skill and judgment when automated  processes send the notices or generate substitute returns. More skill and  judgment is required when IRS staff manually create substitute returns or  when taxpayers respond to a notice by saying that they do not have to file  a return.", "Timing of initial contact: Math error contacts are made as the return is  being processed and identify errors that must be corrected to finish  processing the return. Document matching and nonfiler contacts usually  occur within 1 year after the return is filed or is to be filed. Audits usually  start within 1 year after a return is filed but can start later as long as IRS  finishes the audit within 3 years after the return is filed.", "Another operational characteristic is the average time spent by IRS staff.  Figure 1 shows that audits use more staff time per case than document  matching contacts. For fiscal years 1993 through 2002, the staff time  ranged from roughly an hour per document matching case to up to   30 hours per field audit. (see Table 9 in app. III for details.) IRS does not  separately track the time spent on math errors from the rest of the returns  filing process or on nonfilers from other work done by collection staff.", "Looking across all of these operational dimensions in general, audits that  take place in IRS offices or in taxpayer locations differ the most from  other enforcement programs. They differ primarily because they are more  likely to deal with multiple complex tax issues, require more skill and  judgment by IRS employees, require a greater number of interactions with  taxpayers, and take more IRS staff time. Although correspondence audits  do differ from other enforcement programs on these characteristics, they  do not differ as much from other enforcement programs as do the audits in  IRS field offices or taxpayer locations. The closest similarity between  correspondence audits and the other programs is with the document- matching program. In comparison to the document matching program,  correspondence audits in some cases may deal with about the same  number of issues, have the same number of interactions with taxpayers,  and require similar skill, judgment, and time on the part of IRS staff.  Correspondence audits are less similar to contacts under the math error  and nonfiler programs than to document matching. Math error contacts  deal with straightforward issues that must be corrected as a return is  processed as opposed to contacting the taxpayer up to one year later  about issues in the return. Nonfiler contacts deal with taxpayers who have  not filed a return at all as opposed to seeking to correct issues related to a  filed return.", "In addition to the four major enforcement programs, starting in the mid- 1990s, IRS created two new programs intended to help individual  taxpayers file accurate tax returns. IRS sends so-called \u201csoft notices\u201d on  duplicate claims for dependent exemptions and missing self-employment  tax reporting. The soft notices do not require taxpayers to take action but  are intended to educate them about the potential errors and encourage  them to correct their returns, if necessary. The other new program is the  voluntary compliance agreements program. These agreements are  negotiated with certain employers with the goal of increasing their  employees\u2019 compliance in reporting tip income. As discussed in appendix  IV, while these programs attempt to improve compliance, they have  significant differences from the four major enforcement programs and IRS  has little data on their use. However, IRS was able to provide us with data  that it sent taxpayers 1.2 million soft  notices on duplicate dependent  claims in 2002."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Research Identifies Whether Taxpayers Perceive Distinctions in Enforcement Programs but Officials Believe That Distinctions May Not Be Made", "paragraphs": ["IRS officials were not aware of any research, and our search of the tax  literature and press did not uncover research, on whether taxpayers  perceive distinctions between audits and other enforcement programs.

Otherwise, these officials did not see how taxpayers could view the  enforcement contacts as similar, especially the math error contacts.", "Although they had not surveyed taxpayers, officials we interviewed from  six groups that represent taxpayers or help prepare their tax returns  believed that many individuals perceive no distinction among the  programs.

The rate for the lowest income  taxpayers increased sharply between 1993 and 1995 and then generally  fell, ending virtually the same as in 1993. The document matching contact  rate by income class followed very similar patterns with the rates for all  income levels dropping over the 10-year period.

When  included, the math error contact rate increases (e.g., from 4.97 percent to  6.5 percent in 1997). These math error contacts arise from IRS\u2019s match of  filed tax returns to its masterfile accounts to identify tax returns that  misreport taxes already paid such as in previous years or estimated tax  payments. IRS officials said that the masterfile errors were not reported as  math errors because they are identified through a different process at a  later time compared to other math errors during the processing of tax  returns. In our discussions, these officials agreed that both types of errors  are identified under the same math error authority, are indistinguishable to  taxpayers being contacted, and should be similarly counted and reported.", "IRS also did not include in its published report about 8 million notices sent  in fiscal year 2002 to correct errors in tax returns reporting the rate  reduction credit.

The Economic  Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 authorized tax rate  reductions as well as an advance tax refund, called the rate reduction  credit.

Math error contacts grew over the fiscal year 1993 through 2002 period in  part because Congress expanded the types of tax issues covered by the  math error authority. For example, in 1996, Congress gave IRS authority to  shift a number of earned income tax credit issues from its audit program  to its math error program in that year. As a result, in 1997, IRS shifted over  700,000 cases involving missing or invalid social security numbers (SSN)  on tax returns from the audit program to the math error program. Under  this and other statutory expansions, IRS was making hundreds of  thousands of math error contacts with taxpayers by 2002 that were not  made in 1993.", "A second statutory change played a role in the diverging trends among the  enforcement programs. In RRA, Congress took steps to better ensure that  taxpayer rights were protected by revising certain audit processes, such as  informing taxpayers about their rights and generally how they were  selected for audit. According to IRS officials, the changes contributed to  the decline in audits because IRS auditors had to spend more time to  handle nonaudit duties, to be trained in new procedures and taxpayers\u2019  enhanced rights, and to do new tasks. Those changes contributed to  reductions in the number of audits that each auditor completed, meaning  they were less productive in closing audit cases.", "Finally, declines in enforcement staffing and priorities for using staff also  contributed to trends in enforcement program contacts. IRS has reported  that from 1993 to 2001, enforcement staffing levels declined about   24 percent. These staffing declines affected not only the audit program but  also the document matching and nonfiler programs because those  programs require that IRS staff screen most notices before they are sent  and follow up when taxpayers respond to notices. Given declining staff  resources, IRS has restricted the number of notices sent when it finds  probable noncompliance under the document matching and nonfiler  programs. In contrast, IRS allocated enough resources over this period to  the math error program to continue sending these notices.

For example, trends in the audit rate alone are difficult to use to assess  IRS\u2019s enforcement presence because that rate does not measure the same  phenomenon today as it did earlier.

Over the past several  years, these hearings have included concerns about the declining audit  rate and its possible affect on taxpayers\u2019 compliance. The IRS  Commissioner also expressed concern about the decline in audits.  However, the Commissioner said that he did not believe the audit rate  needed to increase to the same level as a number of years ago because IRS  has other programs to enforce the tax laws that were not available, or as  broad in scope, in past years.", "To the extent that IRS\u2019s audit rate is the major source of information  available to taxpayers on IRS\u2019s enforcement efforts, the public cannot be  fully aware of the extent to which IRS enforces tax laws and thus may  misjudge the chances that noncompliance is likely to be detected.  Taxpayers who are aware only of the audit rate would not be aware that  IRS often contacts more taxpayers under each of its other enforcement  programs\u2014and IRS always contacts far more taxpayers in these other  programs combined\u2014than it does under the audit program.

Although he did not specifically cite possible  increases in voluntary compliance, in a letter issued in March 2001, the IRS  Commissioner said that only focusing on audits substantially understates  IRS\u2019s capacity to find errors.", "While greater awareness of the scope of IRS\u2019s efforts to enforce the tax  law may encourage compliance, it could also increase taxpayers\u2019  awareness of the trends in these efforts. It is not clear how taxpayers  would interpret and react to the differing trends among IRS\u2019s enforcement  programs. For the period from 1993 through 2002, trends in IRS\u2019s  individual enforcement programs often varied from year to year as well as  between the programs. Therefore, the compliance signals to taxpayers  from publicizing data on the trends in these other programs probably  would be different\u2014and more mixed\u2014than the signal they receive based  exclusively on the audit rate.", "In addition, awareness of the fuller range of IRS\u2019s enforcement efforts may  not affect compliance of all groups of taxpayers equally. This could occur,  for example, when the contact rates under the enforcement programs  differ, as they do under the audit and document matching programs for  different income groups. Further, to the extent that taxpayers know that  IRS can only understand their tax situation through a traditional audit,  their compliance might be less affected by fuller reporting on IRS\u2019s other  enforcement efforts.

If the programs were all defined to be audits, IRS might report a  consolidated \u201caudit rate\u201d that would represent all of IRS\u2019s contacts with  taxpayers.

For instance, it would provide  for more complete reporting on IRS\u2019s overall enforcement efforts in a  single \u201crate.\u201d Another advantage to expanding the definition of an audit is  that the major enforcement programs have an overall similarity in what  they intend to achieve. Moreover, some document matching and math  error checks now cover some tax issues that had been covered under  audit authority. Thus, because audits do not measure the same thing over  time, expanding the definition would create a more consistent measure of  the extent to which IRS is enforcing tax laws.", "However, combining all enforcement programs under one definition poses  a number of potential disadvantages. For example, IRS\u2019s legal authority  and operational rules, as well as taxpayers\u2019 rights, vary across  enforcement programs. If all enforcement programs were called audits,  IRS staff and taxpayers could become confused about the rights and  restrictions that govern contacts with taxpayers.

For example, a single audit rate would cover the  range from intense audits covering multiple tax issues to the correction of  simple math errors arising from inadvertent miscalculations by taxpayers.  Given the higher number of math errors being detected by IRS over time, if  taxpayers interpreted a revised audit rate as representing the former  rather than the latter situation, they would be misled about IRS\u2019s true level  of tax return scrutiny. Another challenge for IRS would be in reporting  audit results like tax dollars assessed and time spent per audit.  Considerable variability already exists in these results for audit\u2014e.g., field  audits take significantly more staff hours than correspondence audits.  These differences would be more extreme under a consolidated audit  reporting system that included document matching, nonfiler, and math  error contacts. Finally, the IRS would need to account for potential double  counting because taxpayers can be contacted through more than one  enforcement program for the same return.", "In addition, labeling all IRS enforcement programs as audits might suggest  that the programs are in some sense substitutable in detecting  noncompliance and encouraging voluntary compliance. Although the  document matching and nonfiler programs do replace part of what had  previously been done by auditors, these programs do not completely  substitute for audits. Math error program contacts are even less of a  substitute for audit. Combining all of these efforts suggests an  equivalence\u2014one math error contact with a taxpayer is equivalent to a  complex, intense audit of a taxpayer books and records\u2014that is not  correct. Therefore, if audits dropped even further than they have in recent  years, but math error contacts rose even faster, some might assume that  IRS is doing better at enforcing tax laws while others might disagree.", "Because of such disadvantages, IRS officials said that they do not favor  changing the audit definition to include the other enforcement programs at  this time.

Toward this end, some interest has been expressed in having  IRS report a new audit rate that would aggregate IRS\u2019s various  enforcement programs into a total, revised audit rate. Although such a  measure would attempt to provide a more comprehensive picture of IRS\u2019s  overall effort to detect compliance problems, the advantages of doing so  do not clearly outweigh potential disadvantages.
