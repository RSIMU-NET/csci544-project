In the wake of these natural disasters, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) responded to the need to provide aid quickly through the Individuals and Households Program (IHP) program, which provides housing assistance, real and personal property assistance, and for other immediate, emergency needs. As of February 2006, FEMA made 2.6 million payments totaling over $6 billion. Our testimony today will (1) provide an estimate of improper and potentially fraudulent payments through February 2006 related to certain aspects of the disaster registrations, (2) identify whether improper and potentially fraudulent payments were made to registrants who were incarcerated at the time of the disaster, (3) identify whether FEMA improperly provided registrants with rental assistance payments at the same time it was paying for their lodging at hotels, and (4) review FEMA's accountability over debit cards and controls over proper debit card usage. To estimate the magnitude of IHP payments made on the basis of invalid registrations, we selected a random statistical sample of 250 payments made to hurricanes Katrina and Rita registrants as of February 2006. We also conducted data mining and investigations to further illustrate the effects of control breakdowns."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["We estimate that through February 2006, FEMA made about 16 percent or $1 billion in improper and potentially fraudulent payments to registrants who used invalid information to apply for disaster assistance. Based on our statistical sample, we are 95 percent confident that the range of improper and potentially fraudulent payments is from $600 million to $1.4 billion. In our assessment of whether a payment was improper and potentially fraudulent, we did not test for other evidence of impropriety or potential fraud, such as insurance fraud and bogus damage claims. This means our review potentially understates the magnitude of improper payments made. Examples of fraud and abuse include payments to registrants who used post office boxes, United Parcel Service stores, and cemeteries as their damaged property addresses. Absent proper verification, it is not surprising that FEMA continued to pay fictitious disaster registrations set up by GAO as part of our ongoing forensic audit. In one case, FEMA paid nearly $6,000 to our registrant who submitted a vacant lot as a damaged address. Below is a copy of a rental assistance check sent to GAO after FEMA received feedback from its inspector that the GAO undercover registrant did not live at the damaged address, and after a Small Business Administration inspector reported that the damaged property could not be found. We also found that FEMA provided expedited and housing assistance to individuals who were not displaced. For example, millions of dollars in expedited and housing assistance payments went to registrations containing the names and social security numbers of individuals incarcerated in federal and state prisons during the hurricanes. In addition, FEMA improperly paid individuals twice for their lodging--paying their hotels and rental assistance at the same time. For example, at the same time that FEMA paid $8,000 for an individual to stay in California hotels, this individual also received three rental assistance payments for both hurricane disasters. Finally, we found that FEMA could not establish that 750 debit cards worth $1.5 million went to hurricane Katrina victims. We also found debit cards that were used for a Caribbean vacation, professional football tickets, and adult entertainment."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our ongoing forensic audit and  related investigations of disaster relief assistance provided to individuals  and households for hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In a hearing held in  February 2006 before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs to discuss results of ongoing work, we testified that  significant flaws in the process for registering disaster victims left the  federal government vulnerable to substantial fraud and abuse related to  expedited assistance payments. Due to the magnitude of potential fraud  and abuse we observed in our February 2006 testimony, we plan to issue a  report containing recommendations to Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to improve  internal controls over the Individuals and Households Program (IHP). This  testimony reflects additional findings from the work we have performed  since February. We plan to continue reviewing other aspects of IHP.", "As we previously reported, expedited assistance\u2014a component of the IHP  program for hurricanes Katrina and Rita\u2014took the form of $2,000  payments provided to disaster victims to help with the immediate,  emergency needs for food, shelter, clothing, and personal necessities.  Individuals and/or households who received expedited assistance may  also be eligible to receive other IHP payments for temporary housing  assistance, real and personal property repair and replacement, and other  necessary expenses related to a disaster\u2014up to a cap of $26,200. As of  mid-February 2006, FEMA data showed that the agency had delivered  about $6.3 billion in IHP aid for hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Thirty seven  percent (approximately $2.3 billion) of this amount was delivered through  expedited assistance (EA) to hurricanes Katrina and Rita registrants. Of  the remaining payments, about $2 billion was delivered through temporary  housing assistance, and another approximately $2 billion was for repair  and replacement of real and personal property, and for other  miscellaneous categories.", "As we previously testified, the need to provide assistance quickly led  FEMA to issue payments to hurricanes Katrina and Rita registrants  without first validating the identity and damaged property addresses of all  registrants and without first verifying that the registrants incurred losses  and had needs related to the hurricanes. However, with limited  exceptions, FEMA policy required that subsequent payments for  temporary housing assistance, real and personal property repair and  replacement, and other miscellaneous expenses be made only after FEMA  had conducted an inspection and determined that the extent of loss  merited further assistance. Addresses that were exempt from inspections  had to go through an electronic verification of ownership and occupancy  with a third-party contractor prior to FEMA providing registrants in those  areas with rental assistance and/or other nonexpedited assistance  payments.", "Today\u2019s testimony summarizes the results from our ongoing forensic audit  and investigative work reviewing the type and extent of fraud and abuse  for the IHP program. This testimony will (1) provide an estimate of  improper and potentially fraudulent payments related to certain aspects  of the disaster registrations, (2) identify whether FEMA made improper or  potentially fraudulent IHP payments to registrants who were incarcerated  at the time of the disaster, (3) identify whether FEMA provided registrants  with rental assistance payments at the same time it was paying for their  lodging at hotelrooms, and (4) review FEMA\u2019s accountability over debit  cards and controls over proper debit card usage.", "To estimate the magnitude of IHP payments made on the basis of invalid  registrations, we selected a random sample of 250 payments of the 2.6  million IHP payments made to hurricanes Katrina and Rita registrants as  of February 2006. We excluded 3 of the 250 payments from our analysis  because these payments had been returned to the U.S. Government at the  time of our review, and the U.S. Government was therefore not susceptible  to potential fraud for them. We derived our estimate of improper and  potentially fraudulent payments by summing the dollars associated with  improper and potentially fraudulent payments in our sample and  multiplying that sum by a weighting factor to project the total from the  sample to the population. The weighting factor we used was the number of  payments \u201crepresented\u201d by each of our randomly sampled payments,  namely, the number of payments in the population divided by the number  of payments we sampled. To validate sample registration data, we used a  combination of site visits, comparisons with publicly available data and  Social Security Administration (SSA) data, interviews with residents and  their neighbors, interviews with local postal officials, and duplicate  registration analysis. We also data mined IHP registration data to identify  case studies of registrants who provided invalid and potentially fraudulent  information.", "To further illustrate the effects of control breakdowns, we continued our  undercover operations with bogus registrations to obtain additional IHP  payments beyond the original expedited assistance. To identify IHP  registrants who were prisoners, we obtained a database of federal inmates  as well as databases of inmates at state prisons in and around the areas  affected by hurricanes Katrina and Rita. We then compared prisoner data  to IHP registration data to identify registrations containing prisoner names  and SSNs. To identify case studies of individuals who received rental  assistance at the same time that they were housed in government-paid for  hotels, we compared the IHP registration data to information provided by  the hotels, e.g. driver\u2019s licenses. However, because data provided on hotel  residents did not contain FEMA registration numbers, we were unable to  determine the magnitude of duplicate payments.", "To assess accountability over FEMA debit cards, we interviewed officials  from FEMA, Department of Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service  (FMS), and JPMorgan Chase. To assess the usage patterns of FEMA debit  cards, we data mined debit card purchases and identified transactions that  appeared to be unrelated to emergency disaster needs.

The  improper and potentially fraudulent payments included cases where  individuals and households used invalid SSNs, used addresses that were  fictitious or not their primary residence, and for submitted earlier  registrations. These improper payments based on phony or duplicate  registration data were not only restricted to the initial expedited  assistance payments that we previously reported on, but also included  payments for rental assistance, housing repair, and housing replacement.  For example, rental assistance payments were made to registrants that  used a post office box and a cemetery as damaged properties. In fact, as  part of our ongoing forensic audit, FEMA continues to provide rental  assistance to GAO based on registrations that contained fictitious  identities and bogus damaged addresses. In one case, FEMA even sent  GAO a check for expedited assistance after an inspector could not confirm  that the property existed, and FEMA had decided not to provide housing  assistance to this registration.

Additional details on  the 39 registrants in our sample where we found a problem are as follows:  Payments to Registrants Whose Damaged Property Address Was  Not Their Primary Residence \u2013 Twenty six payments failed the primary  residence test. These include individuals who had never lived at the  damaged property, did not live at the damaged property at the time of the  disasters, or used bogus property addresses on their registrations.

For example, we found that one individual used  several pieces of bogus information to receive expedited assistance.  Specifically, the registrant used a SSN that was valid but the name did not  match the name in records maintained by the Social Security  Administration. The registrant also used a damaged property address in  the 3000 block that was determined to be invalid through our on-site  inspection, as street numbers on that street only went up to the 1000s.  After the initial payment, the registration was withdrawn voluntarily by the  registrant.

The high level of  expedited assistance-related failure was expected because these payments  needed to be made quickly and, typically, prior to a physical inspection of  the damaged property. However, we found that the other 22 failures (56  percent) were related to rental assistance and personal and real property  repair and replacement payments. In its response to a draft GAO report,  FEMA represented to us that all nonexpedited assistance payments,  including the $2,358 in housing assistance payments, were subject to much  more stringent requirements.

However, because the problems did  not relate to identity and address information, they passed our testing  criteria. For example, an individual in our statistical sample provided a  valid SSN and lived in a declared disaster area. However, the individual  informed GAO that he did not incur any hurricane-related damage. Despite  this fact, the individual received $2,000 in expedited assistance. We did not  test whether registrants received duplicate benefits from other FEMA  programs, such as free hotel lodging and trailers, which would have  resulted in FEMA paying duplicate housing benefits to the same registrant.

Similarly, our sample testing and data mining work also identified  additional examples of payments made on the basis of bogus information.", "In our previous testimony, we reported that we were able to obtain  $2,000 expedited assistance checks from FEMA using falsified identities,  bogus property addresses, and fabricated disaster stories. FEMA has  continued to provide us with additional disaster-related assistance  payments even after FEMA received indications from various sources that  our registrations may be bogus. GAO has not cashed these checks and  plans to return the checks to the Department of Treasury upon the  conclusion of our work. The following provides details of two of our  undercover operations:    Case #1 relates to a registration submitted by GAO for hurricane Rita that  cited a bogus address in Louisiana as the damaged property. In October  2005, GAO received notice that the inspector assigned to inspect the  property was not able to find the house despite numerous attempts to  verify the address with the phone book, post office, and with a physical  inspection. The registration was subsequently returned to FEMA by the  inspector and coded as withdrawn because no contact was made with the  registrant. Even though GAO never met with the inspector to prove that  the damaged property existed, FEMA sent GAO a check for $2,000 in early  2006.", "Case # 2 relates to a GAO disaster registration for an empty lot in  Louisiana for hurricane Katrina. Although the damaged property address  was bogus, FEMA notified GAO that an inspection was performed and  confirmed that the property was damaged. However, FEMA stated that  the registration could not be processed because FEMA was unable to  corroborate that the GAO lived at the damaged property. GAO  subsequently submitted a fictitious driver\u2019s license that included the bogus  address, which FEMA readily accepted. Based on the fictitious driver\u2019s  license, FEMA issued GAO a $2,358 rental assistance check, as shown in  figure 1. Subsequent to FEMA issuing the $2,358 check, a Small Business  Administration (SBA) inspector who was responsible for inspecting the  damaged property in evaluation of a potential SBA loan reported that the  property did not exist. Although SBA discovered that the property was  bogus, FEMA issued another rental assistance check to GAO, bringing the  total rental assistance on this bogus registration to about $6,000. We found  that the discrepancy between FEMA\u2019s result (which confirmed that the  property existed), and SBA\u2019s result (which showed that the property did  not exist) occurred because FEMA did not conduct a physical inspection  on the property but instead used geospatial mapping to determine losses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Mining Continued to Find Other Illustrative Examples of Improper and Potentially Fraudulent Payments", "paragraphs": ["We have previously testified regarding potentially fraudulent case studies  we uncovered through data mining and investigative techniques.

Public record searches also determined that only 2 of the  8 individuals actually lived at the current address. Four individuals were  members of the same household who shared the same damaged property  address. However, the 4 individuals each received one expedited and one  rental assistance payment. FEMA criteria specified that members from the  same household who were displaced to the same location should be  entitled to only one IHP payment. According to public records, the other 4  individuals were not living at the address claimed as damaged at the time  of the hurricane.", "Case number 2 involves an individual who used 13 different SSNs\u2014 including one of the individual\u2019s own\u2014to receive payments on 13  registrations. The individual claimed 13 different damaged property  addresses and used one single current address to receive FEMA payments.  According to publicly available records, this individual had no established  history at any of the 13 properties in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama,  which the individual claimed as damaged. The individual received  approximately $139,000 consisting of 8 expedited assistance payments, 4  rental assistance payments, and 14 other payments, including 3 payments  of $10,500 each, and 3 payments ranging from over $12,000 to over $17,000  for personal property replacement. Further audit and investigative work  indicates that 8 of the 13 addresses did not exist or do not have public  ownership records.", "Case number 4 involves a registrant who used the address of a cemetery to  make an IHP claim. Specifically, the registrant used a damaged property  address located within the grounds of Greenwood Cemetery, in New  Orleans, Louisiana, to request disaster assistance from FEMA. Public  records show no record of the registrant ever living in New Orleans.  Instead, public records indicate that for the past five years, the registrant  has resided in West Virginia at the address provided to FEMA as the  registrant\u2019s current address.", "As discussed previously, one statistical sample item we tested related to  an improper and potentially fraudulent payment FEMA made to an  individual who received expedited and rental assistance as a result of  using a post office box as a damaged property address. According to the  Postal Inspector, this post office box was also linked to individuals that  are associated with fraudulent activity. In total, we found that FEMA made  over 2,000 payments totaling about $5.3 million to registrants who  provided a post office box as their damaged residence. While not all  payments made to post office boxes are improper or potentially  fraudulent, the number of potentially fraudulent payments could be  substantially reduced if FEMA put in place procedures to instruct disaster  recipients to provide actual street addresses of damaged property when  claiming disaster assistance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Registrants Using Prisoner Identities Received Millions in Disaster Assistance Payments", "paragraphs": ["FEMA paid millions of dollars to over 1,000 registrants who used names  and SSNs belonging to state and federal prisoners for expedited and  housing assistance.

These  eligibility criteria should have generally excluded prisoners incarcerated  throughout the disaster period. Given the weaknesses we identified earlier  related to the number of individuals who claimed damages based on  invalid property addresses, we can not ascertain whether FEMA properly  verified that these registrations were valid, and therefore deserving of IHP  payments. The following are three cases where prisoner identities were  used to improperly receive IHP payments.", "Case 1 involves a convicted felon, housed in a Louisiana prison from April  2001 to the present, who registered for IHP assistance by telephone. The  registrant made a FEMA claim using a post office box address in Louisiana  as his damaged property address to qualify for IHP payments for expedited  assistance, rental assistance, and personal property replacement. Two of  these payments were made via checks sent to the address he falsely  claimed as his current residence, and the final payment was sent via  electronic funds transfer (EFT) to someone who also listed the same  current address on the checking account. FEMA paid over $20,000 to the  registrant even though the damaged property address on the registration  was a post office box address and the registrant was incarcerated  throughout the disaster period.", "Case 2 involves a registrant who has been incarcerated in a Louisiana state  penitentiary since February 2005. Several weeks after the disaster, the  registrant applied by telephone for individual disaster relief assistance  claiming a Louisiana address. Based on his registration information, FEMA  paid the inmate over $14,000 in checks mailed to an address in Texas that  he listed as his current address, and an EFT was sent to his checking  account. Payments included expedited assistance, rental assistance, and  personal property replacement funds.", "Case 3 involves a registrant who has been incarcerated in a Mississippi  correctional facility since 2004.

Without this information, FEMA was not  able to identify individuals who were housed in hotels, and, thus, FEMA  was unable to determine whether rental assistance should be provided to  individuals to whom the federal government was providing free lodging.  As a result, FEMA made rental assistance payments which covered the  same period of time that the registrant was staying at a FEMA-paid  hotels.

Upfront controls are all the more crucial given the estimated $1 billion  dollars that had gone to improper and potentially fraudulent registrations  related to hurricanes Katrina and Rita. It is key that FEMA address  weaknesses in its registration process so that it can substantially reduce  the risk for fraudulent and improper payments before the next hurricane  season arrives.", "In addition, to help deter future fraudulent registrations, FEMA must  ensure there are consequences for those who commit fraud.

Three of  the 250 were considered out of scope for our study because the payment  has been returned to the U.S. government by the time of our review.  Therefore, our review examined 247 payments for which the government  was subject to financial loss. Potentially fraudulent and invalid payments  are claims that contained (1) bogus identities, (2) addresses that did not  exist, (3) addresses where there was no evidence that the address was the  primary residence of the registrant at the time of the disaster, and (4)  addresses that had been previously registered using duplicate information  (such information would include same SSNs, same damaged address,  and/or same current address). We conducted searches of public records,  available FEMA data, and/or made physical inspections of addresses to  determine if registrations were improper and/or potentially fraudulent.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random selections,  our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we might have  drawn. Since each sample could have provided different estimates, we  express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results  as a 95 percent confidence interval (e.g., plus or minus 5 percentage  points). This is the interval that would contain the actual population value  for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn. As a result, we are 95  percent confident that each of the confidence intervals in this report will  include the true values in the study population.", "To identify whether FEMA made improper or potentially fraudulent IHP  payments to registrants who were incarcerated at the time of the disaster,  we obtained the FEMA IHP database as of February 2006. We obtained  databases containing state prisoner data since August 2005, including  releases and new incarcerations, from the states of Louisiana, Texas,  Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. We also obtained federal  prisoner data since August 2005, including releases and new  incarcerations, from the Department of Justice. We validated the  databases were complete by comparing totals against available public  information on prisoner populations. We compared these databases  against the population of IHP payments to identify prisoner SSN/name  combinations that received payments from FEMA. We restricted this  comparison to prisoners who were in state or federal prisons at the time of  the disasters. We also interviewed prisoners who registered for disaster  relief and prison officials to determine if prisoners were incarcerated at  the time of the disaster.", "To identify whether FEMA improperly provided registrants with rental  assistance payments at the same time it was paying for their hotel rooms,  we reviewed FEMA policies and procedures to determine how FEMA  administered its hotel program, and obtained FEMA data on its hotel  registrants. We also used data mining and forensic audit techniques to  identify registrants who stayed in hotels paid for by FEMA who also  received rental assistance payments through the IHP program. To  determine whether registrations from our data mining resulted in  duplication of housing benefits, we used a selection of 10 case studies for  further investigation. We obtained documentation from hotel officials to  substantiate that case study registrants stayed at hotels paid for by FEMA.  We also gathered available FEMA data on case study registrations that  received multiple rental assistance payments to determine what  information they had provided FEMA in order to receive additional rental  assistance.", "To review FEMA\u2019s accountability over debit cards and controls over  proper debit card usage, we reviewed databases of transactions and  accounts provided by JPMorgan Chase, the administering bank for the  debit cards, as well as FEMA\u2019s database of debit card accounts. We  interviewed bank, FEMA, and Treasury officials regarding the  reconciliation of debit card accounts against IHP registrants and reviewed  documentation related to the payment flow of debit cards. We also  performed data mining on debit card transactions to identify purchases  that did not appear to be indicative of necessary expenses as defined by  the Stafford Act\u2019s implementing regulations.", "During the course of our audit work, we identified multiple cases of  potential fraud. For cases that we investigated and found significant  evidence of fraudulent activity, we plan to refer our cases directly to the  Hurricane Katrina Fraud Task Force. We performed our work from  February 2006 through June 8, 2006 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards and quality standards for investigations as  set forth by the President\u2019s Council on Integrity and Efficiency."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Data Reliability", "paragraphs": ["To validate that the National Emergency Management Information System  database was complete and reliable, we compared the total disbursements  against reports FEMA provided to the Senate Appropriations Committee  on Katrina/Rita disbursements.
