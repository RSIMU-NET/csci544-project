IRS has detailed procedures for identifying, prioritizing, and issuing new guidance. However, it lacks procedures for documenting the decision about what type of guidance to issue.", "In a review of tax guidance, GAO found few instances in which the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) determined that a tax regulation was likely to have significant economic effects and would thus be subject to additional analysis. OMB's significance determinations largely result from initial assessments by the Department of Treasury (Treasury) and IRS that many administrative law or executive order requirements do not apply to most tax regulations and other guidance. Some tax regulations and other guidance are also exempt from further analysis and review under a 1983 agreement between OMB and Treasury, which was reaffirmed in 1993. This agreement has not been revisited in more than 20 years, and it is unclear whether this agreement is still relevant.", "GAO also reviewed eight case files of non-regulatory IRS guidance documents published in 2015 and found that IRS did not consistently document required steps during key phases of the issuance process.

In our review of tax  guidance issued from 2013 to 2015, we found a few examples of  guidance published in the IRB that was written in the form of FAQs.  Such FAQs are authoritative because guidance published in the IRB is  binding on IRS and can be relied upon by taxpayers as authoritative. For  FAQs not published in the IRB, tax practitioners have noted that  sometimes IRS has included a disclaimer noting that the FAQs do not  constitute legal authority and may not be relied upon.

In our interviews and  in tax industry publications we reviewed, tax practitioners and other  experts cited the example of FAQs that established an IRS voluntary  disclosure program for taxpayers with previously undeclared offshore  bank accounts. The Taxpayer Advocate and some tax practitioners  noted that IRS had previously launched a similar disclosure program by  issuing a revenue procedure in the IRB. For the more recent and current  programs, they recommended that IRS replace the series of FAQs issued  on the IRS website with more authoritative and reliable guidance in the  IRB. Some tax practitioners and experts have also recommended that  IRS include disclaimers on information to taxpayers published outside the  IRB noting any legal limitations.

IRS  officials said that while they received some negative feedback following  the 2009 FAQs, subsequent feedback about the 2011 and 2012 FAQs  has been more positive. They stated that providing the offshore program  terms and instructions as FAQs allowed IRS more flexibility to incorporate  input from stakeholders than would have been available through the Chief  Counsel publication process. This flexibility includes being able to quickly  respond to practitioner concerns and trends with program submissions.  According to IRS, the formal guidance process would not allow for such  flexibility.", "Clarity about the authoritativeness of certain IRS publications, such as  some FAQs involving more substantive guidance, could be improved by  either noting any limitations or publishing those FAQs in the IRB.  Additional explanatory language would help taxpayers understand what  type of IRS information is considered authoritative and reliable as  precedent for a taxpayer\u2019s individual facts and circumstances. The first  article in the IRS\u2019s Taxpayer Bill of Rights\u2013\u201dThe Right to Be Informed\u201d\u2013 states that taxpayers have the right to know what they need to do to  comply with tax laws. The article further states that taxpayers are  entitled to clear explanations of the laws and IRS procedures in all forms,  instructions, publications, notices, and correspondence. Just as taxpayers  have the right to clear explanations in IRS instructions and publications,  taxpayers should be alerted to any limitations that could make some IRS  information less authoritative than others. Other federal agencies  sometimes include disclaimers in their guidance to note that the  documents have no legally binding effect on regulated parties or the  agencies. OMB\u2019s 2007 bulletin on good guidance practices also  recommends that agencies\u2019 guidance include disclaimers noting the legal  effect of the guidance.", "Failing to note any limitations associated with particular guidance could  lead to misinterpretation of non-authoritative information sources from  IRS. If taxpayers make decisions after using particular guidance that is  non-authoritative, those taxpayers\u2019 confidence in IRS and the tax system  could be undermined.

Agencies face multiple risks  when issuing guidance, including the risks of challenges to an agency\u2019s  regulatory authority. For example, the IRS faced challenges to a notice  discontinuing an excise tax for telephone charges and creating a refund  process for taxes erroneously collected. Court cases were filed that  argued that the notice should be reviewed as a substantive rule under the  Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Internal control components, such  as written procedures for selecting among guidance types, can help  agencies evaluate the level of risks associated with issuing potential  guidance.

Complete  documentation of approvals at various stages is an internal control activity  that can help drafting teams, managers, and reviewers track and monitor  guidance projects.", "The eight case files that we reviewed also did not consistently document  discussions of whether the final guidance should be reported to us and  Congress as a rule, and whether the guidance could be considered major  under CRA. The CCDM says that all revenue rulings and revenue  procedures will be treated as rules that must be reported to GAO and  Congress. However, one of the two revenue procedures that we  reviewed was not submitted for CRA review. IRS told us that the failure  to notify us and Congress was an oversight due to the revenue procedure  being managed by personnel not familiar with IRS\u2019s usual requirements.  Unlike for revenue procedures and revenue rulings, the CCDM states that  generally notices and announcements are not required to be submitted  for CRA review, but sometimes should be, on a case-by-case basis. For  one of the two notices we reviewed, IRS decided to notify us and  Congress.", "The CCDM requires documentation of public comments, if any. Three of  the eight case files that we reviewed contained evidence that public  comments were obtained. One case file contained public comments  estimating sizeable economic impacts from potential guidance being  drafted. Considering public comments on potential economic effects when  assessing whether non-regulatory guidance should be considered a rule  under CRA and in turn major could help promote IRS compliance with  CRA. More complete documentation of how IRS considers the potential  effects of guidance, including consideration of public comments about any  economic effects, could help IRS evaluate the risk of challenges to its  assessments about whether guidance could be considered major."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Treasury and IRS produce large numbers of regulations and guidance  documents for the public every year. IRS uses a variety of documents to  communicate its interpretation of tax laws to the public, but only considers  guidance published in the IRB to be authoritative. However, IRS does not  always clearly identify the extent to which certain documents published  outside the IRB can be considered authoritative for use by the public.  While IRS does have detailed procedures for identifying, prioritizing, and  issuing new guidance, it lacks documented procedures for deciding what  type of guidance to issue. Policies and procedures that identify factors to  consider when deciding among different guidance types could help IRS  ensure that the selected form of guidance reflects what is known about  the binding nature of various types of guidance.", "Our analysis indicates that IRS has inconsistently documented required  steps during key phases of the guidance issuance process. Although  results from our analysis are not generalizable, complete documentation  of key decisions could help IRS better track and monitor guidance  projects.", "Our review of IRS guidance issued from 2013 to 2015 also found that  very few tax regulations were (1) determined to be significant regulatory  actions under E.O. 12866, (2) determined to have significant economic  impacts on small businesses under RFA, or (3) considered major rules  under CRA. These determinations reflect Treasury\u2019s and IRS\u2019s position  that any impacts associated with tax regulations or other guidance result  from the underlying statute rather than the regulations or guidance  implementing it. Some tax regulations and other guidance are also  exempt from the requirements of E.O. 12866 under a long-standing  agreement between OMB and Treasury. This long-standing agreement,  however, has not been reevaluated since 1993 to ensure that it still  reflects current requirements for reviewing regulations and guidance as  well as the current environment for tax regulations and guidance  (including an increased use of the tax code to accomplish economic and  social objectives through the use of tax expenditures)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue take the  following four actions:  1.  Communicate more clearly the limitations of information not published  in the IRB to taxpayers. Such action could include adding clarifying  language to some pieces of information not published in the IRB, like  FAQs, and amending policies and procedures, such as the IRM, to  clarify when IRS information should contain a statement regarding its  legal authority and whether the item can be used or cited as  precedent.  2.  Amend current policies and procedures for drafting guidance to  include factors to consider when deciding what type of guidance to  issue and procedures for documenting those decisions internally.  3.  Develop policies and procedures to help guidance-drafting teams  assess whether non-regulatory guidance should be considered a rule  for purposes of the CRA and in turn major, and document those  assessments internally.  4.  Take action to ensure that required steps are consistently  documented during key phases of the non-regulatory guidance  process, as defined in the CCDM.", "We recommend that the Director of the Office of Management and  Budget and the Secretary of the Treasury take the following two actions:  1.  Examine the relevance of the long-standing agreement that exempts  certain IRS regulations from executive order requirements and OIRA  oversight; and if relevant, make publicly available any reaffirmation of  the agreement and the reasons for it.  2.  Develop a process to ensure that OIRA has the information necessary  to determine whether IRS rules are major under CRA and significant  under E.O.12866.

We reviewed explanatory  text in the preambles for all 253 tax regulations issued from 2013 to 2015  to understand how frequently tax regulations are not subject to additional  reviews or analyses. In these preamble sections, Treasury and IRS  describe what authorities apply or do not apply to a particular regulation,  and whether the regulation was subject to additional centralized reviews.  We then searched an online database of agency regulatory actions  reviewed by OIRA to identify any tax guidance determined to be  significant or economically significant under E.O. 12866. We also  searched an online database of agency rules submitted to the  Comptroller General to determine what tax guidance, if any, was  determined to be major under the Congressional Review Act (CRA).

Our  classifications were based on a plain reading of the Highlights page  summary of the guidance document. To determine whether our  classifications were valid, we cross-checked them against IRS lists of  guidance on particular subjects. We also validated our classifications by  reviewing annual year-in-review articles published by a tax practitioner  trade publication that summarized guidance published for particular  topics. In doing so, we removed from our population about half of the non- regulatory guidance items that involved routine administrative matters  such as: guidance related to the administration of private letter rulings; guidance documents that list tax exempt organizations whose status  has been revoked or is currently being appealed; announcements of disciplinary actions IRS\u2019s Office of Professional  Responsibility has taken against paid tax preparers; and monthly, quarterly, and other periodic updates to interest rates and  other values that taxpayers use to perform calculations when  preparing tax returns.", "To determine to what extent selected non-regulatory, non- routine/administrative guidance products followed relevant authorities, we  selected a non-generalizable sample of guidance documents published in  2015. We selected eight guidance documents, chosen so that no two  selected were about the same tax issue. We selected two from each of  the four non-regulatory guidance types published in the IRB (revenue  rulings, revenue procedures, notices, and announcements). We reviewed  IRS documentation associated with each guidance project (case files) to  evaluate how the guidance process followed relevant authorities. Criteria  for our evaluation included elements from executive orders and OMB  bulletins on agency guidance processes, and relevant internal controls.", "Because we used a non-generalizable sample to select the guidance  documents, our findings cannot be used to make inferences beyond our  sample of eight guidance projects. However, we determined that the  selection of these guidance projects was appropriate for our design and  objectives, and that the selection would generate valid and reliable  evidence to support our work. We used a standard data collection  instrument to review each case file to ensure we consistently captured  information about the process followed and actions taken to issue the  selected guidance documents. To ensure reliability, two analysts  separately conducted this analysis, and a third analyst compared and  reconciled any inconsistencies. We then analyzed the results of this data  collection effort to identify main themes and develop summary findings,  and traced and verified all information.
