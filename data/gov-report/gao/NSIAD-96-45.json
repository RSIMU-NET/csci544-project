One aircraft was developed specifically for the close support mission, while others are considered multi-role assets that can also be used for other missions, such as interdiction, reconnaissance, or air superiority. The effectiveness of the individual weapons depends in part on their specific capabilities and the availability of target acquisition; command, control, communications and intelligence systems; and logistical support.", "According to DOD officials, the systems that have been developed provide the services with complementary capabilities that provide flexibility to joint force commanders. Several factors account for the growth of close support systems across the services. First, title 10 U.S.C. and DOD Directive 5100.1 spell out the broad missions for each of the services. To carry out these missions, each service acquires some organic close support capability independent of the other services. For example, the Army acquires artillery and attack helicopters not solely on the basis on its close support missions but also on the basis of its broader responsibility \u201cto defeat enemy land forces.\u201d Second, under DOD\u2019s assignment of functions to the individual services, all four services have a primary responsibility for conducting CAS. Third, some systems used for close support missions can perform multiple roles and therefore have not been developed solely on the basis of close support requirements. Fourth, changes in equipment and doctrine, such as the development and use of Army attack helicopters as maneuver units, have greatly altered the complexity and scope of warfighting operations, including close support. Finally, because the need for close support may arise unexpectedly, each service seeks a certain degree of independence in its close support systems since there is no assurance that other services\u2019 weapons can be made available to respond in time.", "Table 1.1 shows the inventory of service assets that can be used for close support missions that existed in fiscal years 1990 and 1994 and the inventory projected for fiscal year 2001.

In 1990, the Army began fielding ATACMS, a long-range precision-guided missile fired from MLRS launchers. The range of ATACMS is triple that of conventional MLRS rockets and cannon artillery. Even though ATACMS is not used specifically for close support, it provides the Army with the capability of destroying targets that could ultimately influence the close battle. Each MLRS launcher can fire two ATACMS. In 1993 the Army began fielding its M109A6 155-millimeter Paladin self-propelled howitzer. The Paladin is a major modification of existing M109A2/3 howitzers, which the Army fielded in the 1970s. Unlike other self-propelled howitzers, the Paladin is equipped with a fire control system that allows each howitzer to locate and orient itself, making it more effective than unmodified and older self-propelled or towed howitzers. The Army plans to field approximately 890 Paladin systems by the end of fiscal year 2000.", "The ability of the Air Force to provide CAS has also improved over the past decade. Even though the Air Force lost longer range CAS aircraft by retiring the A-7s in the early 1990s, it now employs A/OA-10s and multi-role F-16s for CAS. The A/OA-10, specifically designed for CAS, is able to carry a large amount of ordnance, can loiter in the battle area for up to 1.7 hours, and was designed to survive light air defenses at low altitudes. F-16s have greater speed and are able to engage targets from higher altitudes than either A/OA-10 or A-7 aircraft. In addition, some F-16s are equipped with Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infra-Red for Night (LANTIRN) systems, which allow F-16 pilots to navigate and identify targets at night.", "The Marine Corps has also improved its close support capabilities. It reduced its artillery force structure by nearly 50 percent since 1988 by retiring its 155-millimeter and 8-inch self-propelled howitzers that had been used for general support, and the 105-millimeter towed howitzers that had been its primary direct support weapon. The Marines now use the M-198 155-millimeter towed howitzer for both direct and general support. The M-198 provides more range and lethality than 105-millimeter howitzers and is easier to transport than the self-propelled howitzers it replaced. The Marine Corps also upgraded its AV-8B Harrier aircraft used primarily for CAS. The AV-8B is capable of vertical/short takeoff and landings and can perform CAS, interdiction, and air-to-air operations. In the early 1990s, the Marine Corps installed night capability on 66 of the day-attack version of the AV-8Bs and installed both night capability and an air-to-ground radar on an additional 28 day-attack aircraft.

Although the Air Force had planned to retire all of its A/OA-10s as early as fiscal year 2002, it now plans to maintain 316 of these aircraft in its force structure through fiscal year 2028."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Budget Implications of Fixed-Wing CAS Debate Could Be Significant", "paragraphs": ["A broad assessment of joint CAS requirements leading to recommendations on the appropriate numbers, types, and mix of fixed-wing requirements could result in substantial budgetary savings depending on the outcome of the assessment. In 1994 the Congressional Budget Office estimated that about $1.9 billion could be saved over 5 years if the Air Force retired all A/OA-10 aircraft. Similarly, the Air Force told the Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces that if it retired all of its A/OA-10s, it could save approximately $5.8 billion in procurement, RDT&E, operation and maintenance, and other indirect costs between fiscal years 1995-2001.", "The potential loss of the A/OA-10s would force the Army to rely more on its attack helicopters for CAS than it has in the past. If the Air Force eliminated its A/OA-10s, its multi-role F-16s would become the Air Force\u2019s primary CAS aircraft. Accordingly, any assessment of fixed-wing CAS requirements would need to consider the impact that increased use of F-16s for CAS would have on the capability of this aircraft to conduct other missions, such as interdiction."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Collectively, the services\u2019 current mix of weapon systems constitutes a formidable joint close support capability. Nevertheless, the services plan to invest about $10.6 billion over the next 6 years in weapons upgrades and enhancements to further add to this capability. Whether these investments represent the most appropriate, cost-effective mix of weapon systems to meet close support missions is unclear because each military service has continued to propose enhancements to its capabilities without adequate consideration of the capabilities of its other weapons or those of other services.", "Moreover, the Department\u2019s assessment processes do not enable the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, to provide effective military advice to the Secretary of Defense on the services acquisition and modernization proposals for close support. The JROC has only assessed modernization proposals involving major weapon systems rather than the full range of weapons used for close support. Moreover, although a joint warfighting assessment process was instituted in late 1994 to support the JROC in its recommendations to the Chairman, a separate assessment of the close support mission has not yet been made. Unless comprehensive assessments of joint mission needs and existing capabilities for close support are conducted on a routine basis, the Chairman cannot provide the independent military advice the Secretary needs in deciding which systems should be funded, in what quantities they should be procured, and what priority should be assigned to competing proposals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["To assist the Secretary of Defense in determining whether and which proposed enhancements to close support systems should be funded, and in what quantities and priority, we recommend that comprehensive cross-service assessments of overall joint close support mission needs, existing close support systems, and planned enhancements be made on a routine basis. Such assessments might be made within the context of the JWCA process although alternative mechanisms might be explored.", "To be useful to decisionmakers, these assessments should include a determination of which existing capabilities should be retained, modernized, or retired, and in what quantities to ensure full joint capability. They should be broad enough to encompass all close support capabilities\u2014not just major weapon systems\u2014and service-generated analysis should be supplemented by other analytical support, where independence is critical. Because some systems have multiple roles, the assessments need to recognize the contributions of these systems to these other missions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["DOD partially agreed with GAO\u2019s recommendation but stated that (1) the land and littoral warfare JWCA is conducting a comprehensive assessment of the fire support requirements and capabilities for the close battle; (2) the Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System (PPBS)\u2014together with data from the JWCA and other DOD studies\u2014provides leaders with the information they need to make the determinations cited in our report; and, (3) the assessments currently underway and planned are sufficiently broad in scope, and diverse in sources of analytical data to ensure that service parochialism is held in check and the necessary degree of purity of data and process is being preserved.", "We recognize the JWCA process as a positive approach that may lead to improved assessment of existing close support capabilities and service-generated requirements. We continue to believe, however, that to be of most use to decisionmakers, the assessment process must deal directly with the issue of sufficiency\u2014that is, the mix and quantity of systems needed to ensure full capability. Accordingly, we believe that ongoing and future assessments should include recommendations on which close support systems should be developed, modernized, retained, or retired.", "Based on our discussions with members of JWCA working groups, we are not as optimistic as DOD that service influence over the requirements generation process is being held in check. The Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces recently concluded that DOD\u2019s current management processes allow the services to develop and field weapons without a DOD-wide assessment of the need for these weapons. Thus, the Commission appears to support our contention that service-generated analyses of requirements should be routinely challenged by service-independent analyses of DOD-wide requirements.", "The full text of the DOD\u2019s comments appears in appendix I."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
