In particular, DOD\u2019s military departments and functional  organizations have not always worked well together to accomplish  departmental objectives. For example, in August 2017, we found that  DOD\u2019s efforts to implement a hierarchical, portfolio-based approach to  strategically acquire contracted services had not been successful. In part,  we found that cultural barriers and military commanders\u2019 reluctance to  give up certain responsibilities for determining how and which services  were needed to meet their missions hindered DOD\u2019s efforts. We have  highlighted these challenges in numerous additional products, including  our High-Risk List, which calls attention to agencies and program areas  that are high risk because of their vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse,  and mismanagement or are most in need of transformation.

The act also required DOD to establish cross- functional teams whose leaders report directly to the Secretary of  Defense and that, among other things, address the critical objectives and  outputs outlined in the department\u2019s organizational strategy. DOD refers  to these teams as \u201cSecretary of Defense-empowered cross-functional  teams.\u201d The act further required DOD to provide training on (1)  leadership, modern organizational practice, collaboration, and the  operation of cross-functional teams to individuals who have been  appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate to a position  within the Office of the Secretary of Defense within 3 months of their  appointment, and (2) elements of successful cross-functional teams to  members of those established teams and their supervisors.", "Prior to February 2018, the Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO)  led the department\u2019s efforts to implement section 911 of the NDAA for  Fiscal Year 2017.

To identify  leading practices for effective cross-functional teams, we reviewed  literature from January 1990 through September 2017 that covered the  use of these teams in both the private and public sectors as well as five  case studies of cross-functional teams. In addition, we selected six  academic and practitioner experts to interview based on their publications  or research, prior testimony before the Senate Armed Services  Committee on the implementation of cross-functional teams at DOD, and  recommendations from DOD officials. Through this research, we  identified eight broad categories of leading practices associated with  effective cross-functional teams: (1) open and regular communication, (2)  well-defined team goals, (3) inclusive team environment, (4) senior  management support, (5) well-defined team structure, (6) autonomy, (7)  committed cross-functional team members, and (8) an empowered cross- functional team leader.

For example, in the  early 1980s, Congress expressed concern that DOD\u2019s structure primarily  served the needs of the services and encouraged interservice rivalries  that led to operational failures. In response, Congress passed the  Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 to  improve the management and administration of the department, among  other purposes. One of the changes emanating from this act included  specifying the military department secretaries\u2019 responsibility for training  and equipping forces, while making clear that the military service chiefs  were not in the chain of command for military operations. The act also  required that military personnel selected for promotion to brigadier  general or rear admiral (lower half) to have joint duty experience unless  waived by the Secretary of Defense or an authorized official. However,  shortfalls in strategic integration at DOD\u2014how DOD and the military  services align their efforts and resources across different regions,  functions, and domains\u2014continue. Congress intended that section 911 of  the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 improve strategic integration across the  organizational and functional boundaries of DOD by, among other things,  requiring the Secretary of Defense to develop an organizational strategy  to advance a collaborative culture across DOD and create cross- functional teams to address critical objectives and outputs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s External and Internal Cross-Functional Team Studies", "paragraphs": ["As required by section 911 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017, DOD  awarded a contract to study how best to implement effective cross- functional teams in DOD.

It identified  seven critical factors for cross-functional team success: (1) mission; (2)  objective; (3) delegated authorities; (4) team membership; (5) ways of  working; (6) collaborative environment; and (7) an implementation plan.  While not required by the contract, the study also contained a checklist for  implementing cross-functional teams, which includes recommendations to  assist DOD in assembling, initiating, and operating a team. The checklist  distinguished action items by implementation phases: prelaunch, at  launch, throughout the project, and at the project\u2019s close. For example,  the checklist suggested that, at launch, DOD should onboard the team  and tailor training to the team experience and timeframe.

From the case studies, ODCMO officials  identified lessons learned to inform establishing and monitoring cross- functional teams. The ODCMO\u2019s internal study found that cross-functional  teams require significant senior leader attention. For example, the  Secretary of Defense was directly involved in the sampled cross- functional teams, and he publicly stated his support for the teams, gave  the teams precedence over other programs, and endorsed non-standard  funding practices to accelerate their work. Further, the Secretary of  Defense regularly engaged with teams. The study also found that DOD  should provide team members with background information and the  context behind the team\u2019s mission and goals.

To address the first statutory element, the draft  organizational strategy identifies several mission-focused and business- operations areas that would benefit from the use of cross-functional  teams. For example, the strategy identifies three primary candidates for  business operations, including Military Health Systems reforms, financial  auditability, and security clearance backlog mitigation. To address the  second statutory element, the draft organizational strategy identifies  considerations for the appropriate use of cross-functional teams. For  example, the strategy states that cross-functional teams should be used  only for the Secretary of Defense\u2019s highest-priority issues and that cross- functional teams require significant engagement with the Secretary of  Defense and other top leadership.", "Section 911 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 also identifies several  outcomes that DOD should achieve to advance a collaborative culture  within the department; however, we found that DOD\u2019s draft organizational  strategy does not clearly articulate how the department will achieve these  outcomes. The act states that DOD\u2019s organizational strategy should,  among other things: provide for the furtherance and advancement of a collaborative, team- oriented, results-driven, and innovative culture within the department  that fosters an open debate of ideas and alternative courses of action,  and supports cross-functional teaming and integration;  improve the manner in which the department integrates the expertise  and capacities of the functional components of the department for  effective and efficient achievement of critical objectives and other  organizational outputs that span multiple functional boundaries and  would benefit from the use of cross-functional teams;  improve the management of relationships and processes involving the  Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the combatant  commands, the military departments, and the defense agencies with  regard to such objectives and outputs;  improve the ability of the department to work effectively in interagency  processes with regard to such objectives and outputs in order to  better serve the President; and achieve an organizational structure that enhances performance with  regard to such objectives and outputs.", "We found that the draft strategy does not outline how the department will  achieve these outcomes. For example, the draft organizational strategy  notes that DOD leaders recognize the department must fully embrace and  operationalize the cultural attributes set forth in section 911, including a  more collaborative, team-oriented, results-driven, and innovative culture;  however, it does not identify actions the department will take to help  ensure that leaders embrace these attributes, such as through guidance  or training. When we asked how the draft organizational strategy will help  achieve these outcomes, ODCMO officials stated that the strategy  contains references to cultural attributes for the department. For example,  the draft organizational strategy describes cultural attributes of the  department\u2019s management and business operations, such as visibility  across components and collaboration. However, ODCMO officials stated  that they agree that the strategy could do more to address collaboration.  The ODCMO officials said they originally interpreted section 911 to mean  that the organizational strategy should focus on DOD\u2019s organizational  structure, processes, and leading practices for implementing cross- functional teams, rather than on how to transform the department\u2019s  culture more broadly. Nonetheless, the outcomes called for under the act  refer to the need to advance a collaborative culture across the  department.

We  previously reported on leading practices and implementation steps for  mergers and organizational transformations that can help agencies  transform their cultures so that they are more results-oriented, customer- focused, and collaborative. The leading practices and implementation  steps listed in table 2 were built on the lessons learned from large private  and public sector organizational mergers, acquisitions, and  transformations.", "These leading practices state that organizations should ensure that top  leadership drives the transformation by defining and articulating a  succinct and compelling reason for change. Doing so helps employees  and stakeholders understand the expected outcomes of the  transformation and engender not only their cooperation, but also their  ownership of the outcomes. In addition, our leading practices state that  organizations should establish a coherent mission and integrated  strategic goals by adopting our leading practices for results-oriented  strategic planning. Lastly, our leading practices state the organizations  should include implementation goals and a timeline for achieving the  transformation. By demonstrating progress toward these goals, the  organization builds momentum and keeps employees excited about the  opportunities change brings and helps to ensure the transformation\u2019s  successful completion.

In addition, our leading practices state  that a core characteristic of a strategic training and development process  is leadership commitment, meaning that agency leaders consistently  demonstrate that they support and value continuous learning and set the  expectation that effective training and development will improve individual  and organizational performance. Further, as organizations are typically  resistant to change and need top leadership to drive a successful  organizational transformation, ensuring that senior officials receive this  training will be important for DOD\u2019s overall organizational transformation  to succeed in driving a more collaborative culture.", "Without the provision of training for top leadership within the Office of the  Secretary of Defense that includes the required elements in section 911  of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 or developing criteria for obtaining a  waiver from providing the training, DOD may have difficulty implementing  its new organizational strategy as top leadership commitment is a key  element of an organizational transformation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Developed Training for Team Members That Addresses Statutory Requirements and Plans to Provide the Training Once Team Members Are Announced", "paragraphs": ["We found that DOD has developed a draft training curriculum for cross- functional team members and their supervisors that addresses required  statutory elements, including the element focused on collaboration.

A revised strategy that addresses how  the department will achieve these outcomes and is consistent with our  leading practices for mergers and organizational transformations would  better position DOD to further a culture within the department that is  collaborative, team oriented, results driven, and innovative.", "DOD could also address three other areas to improve the department\u2019s  collaborative efforts. First, OCMO officials need to collaborate with key  stakeholders across the department\u2014such as the Secretary of Defense,  military departments, the combatant commands, and defense agencies\u2014 to strengthen the organizational strategy and ensure a more successful  implementation. Without this stakeholder input, the organizational  strategy may meet resistance and not result in the desired organizational  change. Second, DOD\u2019s guidance for cross-functional teams is critical to  their consistent and effective implementation across the department. This  guidance would also help ensure that such teams are provided with the  leadership support and resources, among other things, to address the  Secretary of Defense\u2019s strategic objectives and further promote  collaboration across the department. Third, without training for  presidential appointees to positions within the Office of the Secretary of  Defense that includes leadership, modern organizational practice,  collaboration, and the operation of cross-functional teams or developing  criteria for who could receive a waiver for this training and on what basis,  DOD may have difficulty aligning the perspective of these leaders to most  effectively bring about change when implementing its new organizational  strategy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making a total of four recommendations to the Secretary of  Defense and the Chief Management Officer (CMO).", "The Secretary of Defense should ensure that:  The CMO, in its revisions to the draft organizational strategy, address  how the department will promote and achieve a collaborative culture, as  required under section 911 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017.

In addition, we selected six academic and practitioner  experts to interview based on their publications or research, prior  testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on the  implementation of cross-functional teams at DOD, and recommendations  from DOD officials. We identified eight broad categories of leading  practices associated with effective cross-functional teams: (1) open and  regular communication, (2) well-defined team goals, (3) inclusive team  environment, (4) senior management support, (5) well-defined team  structure, (6) autonomy, (7) committed cross-functional team members,  and (8) an empowered cross-functional team leader.", "To identify what is known from published research about factors  contributing to effective cross-functional teams, we conducted a literature  search among relevant articles published from January 1990 through  September 2017.

We first reviewed  the abstracts for each of these articles for relevancy in identifying  contributing factors related to effective cross-functional teams. For the 17  articles that we found relevant and based on empirical research, we  reviewed the full article for methodological rigor. GAO social scientists  read and assessed each study, using a standardized data collection  instrument. The assessment focused on information such as the  population examined, the research design and data sources used, and  methods of data analysis. The assessment also focused on the quality of  the data used in the studies as reported by the researchers, any  limitations of data sources for the purposes for which they were used, and  inconsistencies in reporting study results. A second GAO social scientist  reviewed each completed data collection instrument to verify the accuracy  of the information included. We determined that the studies were  sufficiently sound to support their results and conclusions. We excluded  articles that lacked enough information about their methodologies for us  to evaluate them. We then reviewed the citations and literature reviews of  the relevant articles for additional sources. After including these articles  and excluding others, 14 articles remained, covering cross-functional  teams in both the private and public sectors.", "We took several additional steps to identify leading practices. First, we  reviewed five case studies developed by subject-matter experts on cross- functional teams and interagency task forces employing similar  collaboration tactics for national security issues. We reviewed these  studies for academic rigor and determined that we could use them to  inform our leading practice development. Second, we reviewed three  relevant congressional testimonies from a Senate Armed Services  Committee hearing in June 2016 about the use of cross-functional teams  for improving strategic integration within DOD and incorporated them as  well into the identification of leading practices. Third, we interviewed six  subject-matter experts on cross-functional teams, utilizing a semi- structured set of questions, and used their responses to inform our cross- functional team leading practices.

We also solicited names of other cross-functional team experts  during our initial subject-matter expert interviews. Additionally, we  examined the top business programs and research institutes at  universities in the country identified in the top five rankings by U.S. News  & World Report and identified researchers with expertise in cross- functional teams.

Then the team  members independently reviewed the characteristics to identify themes.  They subsequently compared the themes and developed a series of  conceptual categories to be used as a coding structure for the content  analysis. To conduct the content analysis of all identified characteristics,  two analysts independently assigned each identified characteristic from  the sources to one or more categories and sub-categories. Then, the  team members met to compare their categorization decisions and to  discuss the differences. Any disagreements regarding the categorizations  of the characteristics were discussed and reconciled. The team members  then tabulated the number of characteristics in each category and sub- category and reached agreement on the final set of categories and sub- categories.
