When these goals are changed, the program is \"rebaselined\" to reflect current status. However, measuring current estimates against the most recent baseline without additional perspectives may obscure for Congress how programs are performing over time. Concerned over this, you asked GAO to examine how DOD's use of rebaselining has affected the adequacy of data provided to Congress on major defense acquisition programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD could be reporting more complete information beyond what is required by law on the unit cost performance of major defense acquisition programs to Congress for its authorization and appropriations deliberations. DOD does present Congress with valuable information about a program's performance by comparing the latest unit cost estimate against the most recent approved baseline. However, this provides only one perspective on performance because rebaselining shortens the period of performance reported and resets the measurement of cost growth to zero. Other meaningful perspectives are not reported. First, DOD does not report the cumulative unit cost growth, in constant dollars, that a program has experienced since the first full baseline was established. For example, DOD reported in the 2003 Selected Acquisition Report (SAR), the most recent available, that the F/A-22 Raptor program's unit cost decreased by 0.33 percent in the previous 4 months--since the latest rebaselining. DOD did not report that the program's unit cost had cumulatively increased by 72 percent in the last 143 months. Second, the change in unit cost between one budget request to Congress and the next is not measured or reported. For example, DOD reported in the 2003 SAR that unit cost for the Stryker program increased by 1.34 percent in the 2 months since the latest rebaselining; it did not report that unit cost had grown by 21 percent in the previous 12 months. DOD could be more timely in reporting to Congress that it has rebaselined individual programs. A key factor is that DOD is not required by statute or its own policies to report a program's rebaseline to Congress. Although DOD includes the latest rebaselining actions in the April SARs, a rebaseline approved after early April may not be reported to Congress before it enacts the authorization and appropriations legislation. For example, the DD(X) Destroyer program established a new baseline on April 23, 2002, but did not report this new baseline to Congress in a SAR until April 2003. As a result, between April 2002 and the passage of the fiscal year 2003 defense budget, the SAR provided Congress did not reflect the approved baseline for the DD(X) program. Congressional oversight of DOD's adherence to established cost and schedule baselines is unnecessarily constrained because DOD classifies about 50 percent of the SARs it submits to Congress, despite the fact that only a small amount of data in each of these SARs is actually classified. This reporting practice restricts access to the unclassified cost, quantity, and schedule data for congressional staff without security clearances and requires special handling procedures of that unclassified data by those with clearances."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) has more than $1 trillion worth of  major defense acquisition programs in development and production. For  the purposes of congressional oversight and decision making, DOD is  required by law to report to Congress the unit costs (costs divided by  quantities) for each program.  DOD reports this unit cost for both the  current budget estimate and the most recent acquisition program baseline,  which describes the cost, quantity, schedule, and performance goals of a  program. DOD reports these comparisons in a Selected Acquisition  Report (SAR).  These reports, typically provided in early April, aid the  Congress during its deliberations over the defense authorization and  appropriations legislation.", "As an acquisition program proceeds, DOD may determine that the original  baselined goals approved by decision makers are unachievable. Under  such circumstances, DOD will \u201crebaseline\u201d the program so the goals more  realistically reflect the program\u2019s current status. However, to the extent  that current estimates are only measured against the most recent baseline,  Congress may not be getting in each SAR a clear picture on just how well  programs are performing over time.", "Concerns over these issues led you to request that we evaluate how DOD\u2019s  use of rebaselining has affected the adequacy of data provided to Congress  on the performance of major defense acquisition programs. To address  this objective, we assessed SAR cost, schedule, and quantity data for  individual acquisition programs using federal control criteria such as  accuracy, completeness, timeliness, and accessibility.  This report focuses  on (1) the completeness of unit cost reporting and (2) the timeliness of  reporting on rebaselining and the accessibility of unclassified data.", "In conducting our review, we reviewed pertinent statutes and DOD  acquisition system guidance; analyzed more than 650 SARs, both quarterly  and annual, of all major defense acquisition programs for the period 1996  to 2003; and interviewed cognizant DOD officials.

The purpose was  to focus management attention on a program\u2019s performance and changes  to its acquisition plan. In 1975, Congress established the SAR as a statutory  reporting requirement to Congress.", "Consistent with statute, DOD requires an acquisition program baseline at  program initiation that establishes objective and threshold values for cost,  quantity, schedule, and performance parameters. Objective values  represent what the user desires and expects. Thresholds represent the  acceptable limits to those values that, in the user\u2019s judgment, still provide  the needed capability. The acquisition program baseline is derived from  the user\u2019s performance and schedule needs and the best estimates of total  program cost consistent with projected funding.", "A baseline, according to DOD acquisition guidance,  consists of the  following:    Performance parameters\u2014-The total number of performance  parameters should be the minimum number needed to characterize the  major drivers of operational performance. The number and specificity  of performance parameters may change over time.", "Schedule parameters\u2014-Schedule parameters should include, at a  minimum, the projected dates for program initiation, other major  decision points, and initial operating capability. The program manager  may propose, and the milestone decision authority may approve, other  critical system events.", "Cost parameters\u2014-Cost parameters should reflect realistic cost  estimates of the total program and/or increment, and should be  identified as life-cycle cost. The elements of program life-cycle cost  include   research, development, test, and evaluations;    procurement costs;    military construction costs;    acquisition-related operations and maintenance costs, if any;  total system quantity (to include both fully configured development  and production units);    average procurement unit cost (defined as total procurement cost  divided by total procurement quantity);    program acquisition unit cost (defined as the total of all acquisition- related appropriations divided by the total quantity of fully configured  end items); and    any other cost objectives established by the milestone decision  authority.", "The defense acquisition management framework defines the stages  through which typical programs proceed. As each stage concludes, a  decision must be made to initiate, continue, advance, adjust, or terminate  a project or program work effort or phase. The review associated with  each of these decision points typically addresses program progress and  risk, affordability, program trade-offs, acquisition strategy updates, and the  development of exit criteria for the next phase or effort. The milestone  decision authority is responsible for approving the program structure as  part of the acquisition strategy. Milestone decision points are Milestone A,  for entry into the technology development phase; Milestone B, for entry  into the system development and demonstration phase (acquisition  program initiation); and Milestone C, for entry into the production and  deployment phase.", "There are three fixed acquisition program baselines (APB) tied to these  milestone decisions. The concept baseline approved at Milestone A; the  development baseline approved at Milestone B; and the production  baseline approved at Milestone C. This first full estimate, generally  established at Milestone B, is sometimes referred to as the original  business case for the program. All estimates include a mix of both sunk  and projected remaining costs.", "Programs are rebaselined based on a change in requirements, a change in  acquisition phase, or a program restructuring. They are also rebaselined  when there is a realized cost overrun or schedule slip beyond certain  thresholds. Rebaselining can occur at any time and cover any phase of the  defense acquisition program. All rebaselines must be approved by the  milestone decision authority. A program may therefore have several  approved program baselines during development, but only one currently  approved program baseline. Programs also monitor a current estimate of  the elements of a baseline and report differences as they develop.", "Recognizing the need to establish a monitoring mechanism to provide  oversight of cost growth in DOD major defense acquisition programs,  Congress has required DOD to (1) notify Congress whenever unit cost  growth is at least 15 percent, and (2) \u201ccertify\u201d the program to Congress  when the unit cost growth is at least 25 percent above the latest approved  acquisition program baseline cost estimate. However, Congress did not  require DOD to report when a program has been rebaselined.", "The reporting requirement is commonly referred to as Nunn-McCurdy,  after the congressional leaders responsible for the requirement.  Exceeding either the 15 or 25 percent unit cost threshold is referred to as a  Nunn-McCurdy unit cost breach. The unit cost reporting includes two  elements\u2014program acquisition unit cost (PAUC) and procurement unit  cost (PUC). DOD refers to the PUC as the average procurement unit cost  (APUC). Unit cost is considered a key measure because it describes  buying power\u2014the average cost to buy each unit.", "Unit cost information is submitted to Congress in DOD\u2019s annual  comprehensive SARs.

Measuring change in constant dollars removes the effects of  inflation, which are beyond the control of individual programs, and is used  to measure real program cost growth.", "DOD reports to Congress on the unit cost growth of programs in two  different sections of the SAR.  One section reports the current estimate  against the latest approved baseline in both then-year and constant dollars.  However, because of rebaselining, the latest approved baseline may be in  place for only a short period of time and the measurement of unit cost  growth is reset to zero.   The other section reports the cumulative  historical change only in then-year dollars, which includes the effects of  inflation.", "Rebaselining can occur during each phase of acquisition, sometimes  frequently on individual programs. For example, in 2003, DOD reported on  81 programs; of this number, 49 or (60 percent) had multiple rebaselinings  over the life of the program. Table 1 provides examples of the highest  number of rebaselinings in individual DOD acquisition programs.", "As illustrated in table 2, DOD reports unit cost growth in constant dollars  only for the most recent period of performance.  It does not present a full  history of a program\u2019s unit cost growth in a single document. For example,  DOD reported in the December 2003 SAR that the Marine Corps\u2019 H-1  helicopter upgrade program\u2019s unit cost has shrunk by 1 percent in the last  20 months; however, DOD did not report that the program\u2019s unit cost had,  in constant dollars, doubled in the last 87 months.", "DOD reports in another section of the SAR the cumulative unit cost  change, but only in then-year dollars which includes the effects of  inflation.  The statute that requires submission of SARs to Congress calls  for reporting the history of the Program Acquisition Unit Cost and the  Procurement Unit Cost from the date the program was first included in the  SAR to the end of the quarter for which the current SAR is submitted.  Determining the change in constant dollars, which removes the effects of  inflation, provides more meaningful data.  For example, as shown in table  3, the unit cost growth reported to Congress for the F/A-18E/F was almost  zero percent because it was presented in then-year dollars.

For example, the Stryker armored vehicle program reported a  little over 1 percent unit cost growth in the 2 months since it rebaselined,  but DOD did not report the meaningful perspective that the program  experienced a 20 percent growth between annual budget requests.

As defined by law, unit costs  are determined by dividing total cost by total quantities. If quantities  decrease but costs stay the same or do not decrease proportionately, unit  costs would necessarily increase.", "For determining Nunn-McCurdy breaches, DOD policy allows the  exclusion of the unit cost increases associated with reductions in quantity  or increases in capabilities on individual programs. DOD refers to these  actions as programmatic adjustments, which require the approval of a new  acquisition program baseline. DOD believes that these adjustments clarify  legitimate cost growth and applies its exclusion policy to determine all  Nunn-McCurdy breaches.", "By making these adjustments, DOD reduced the number and the  magnitude of unit cost increases reported to Congress that would have  otherwise exceeded the Nunn-McCurdy thresholds. The effects of these  adjustments are generally not visible in the reports to Congress. As a  result, Congress may not be getting the information it sought on program  buying power in requiring unit cost reporting.", "For example, as seen in table 5, in December 2002, the Comanche  Helicopter program experienced a PAUC growth of about 62 percent over  27 months. However, after excluding the unit cost increases associated  with a program restructure and a reduction in quantity of 561 aircraft,  DOD reported a Nunn-McCurdy breach of 18 percent, less than the 25  percent threshold that would have triggered a certification. DOD  explained that the 18 percent cost growth was driven by weight growth,  functionality changes, overhead rates, and estimating differences. The  quantity reduction accounted for the other 44 percent of the cost growth.", "DOD would have reported or would have had to certify many more Nunn- McCurdy breaches if not for the adjustments made to unit cost growth to  account for reduced quantities or increased capabilities. The number of  programs that would have had Nunn-McCurdy breaches reported to  Congress between fiscal years 2001 and 2003 would have increased by  about 50 percent\u2014from 17 to 25 programs. The number of programs that  reported a breach of the 25 percent threshold, which requires a formal  certification by the Secretary of Defense to Congress, would have  increased by 90 percent, going from 10 to 19 programs during the same  period. Three of those programs\u2014the Joint Strike Fighter, Comanche, and  the MH-60R\u2014reported breaching the 15 percent level. These three  programs notified Congress of an APUC breach and therefore also  reported the PAUC changes.  Other than those three programs, the  adjustments made to unit costs in table 6 were not disclosed in the  relevant SAR. For example, the Bradley Upgrade program experienced a  PAUC growth of 16 percent, but reported to Congress a 0.4 percent PAUC  reduction.
