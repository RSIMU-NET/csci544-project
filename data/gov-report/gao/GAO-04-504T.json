Although TSA is in various stages of progress on addressing each of these eight issues, as of January 1, 2004, only one--the establishment of an internal oversight board to review the development of CAPPS II--has been completely addressed. However, concerns exist regarding the timeliness of the board's future reviews. Other issues, including ensuring the accuracy of data used by CAPPS II, stress testing, preventing unauthorized access to the system, and resolving privacy concerns have not been completely addressed, due in part to the early stage of the system's development. GAO identified three additional challenges TSA faces that may impede the success of CAPPS II. These challenges are developing the international cooperation needed to obtain passenger data, managing the possible expansion of the program's mission beyond its original purpose, and ensuring that identity theft--in which an individual poses as and uses information of another individual--cannot be used to negate the security benefits of the system.

As the volume of passengers requiring screening  increased and an awareness of terrorists\u2019 threats against the United States  developed, a computerized system was implemented in 1998 to help  identify passengers posing the greatest risk to a flight so that they could  receive additional security attention. This system, known as CAPPS, is  operated by air carriers in conjunction with their reservation systems.  CAPPS enables air carriers to separate passengers into two categories:  those who require additional security screening\u2014termed \u201cselectees\u201d\u2014and  those who do not. Certain information contained in the passenger\u2019s  reservation is used by the system to perform an analysis against  established rules and a government supplied \u201cwatch list\u201d that contains the  names of known or suspected terrorists. If the person is deemed to be a  \u201cselectee,\u201d the boarding pass is encoded to indicate that additional  security measures are required at the screening checkpoint. This system is  currently used by most U.S. air carriers to prescreen passengers and  prescreens an estimated 99 percent of passengers on domestic flights. For  those passengers not prescreened by the system, certain air carriers  manually prescreen their passengers using CAPPS criteria and the watch  list.", "Following the events of September 11, 2001, Congress passed the Aviation  and Transportation Security Act requiring that a computer-assisted  passenger prescreening system be used to evaluate all passengers, TSA\u2019s  Office of National Risk Assessment has undertaken the development of a  second-generation computer-assisted passenger prescreening system,  known as CAPPS II. Unlike the current system that is operated by the air  carriers, the government will operate CAPPS II. Further, it will perform  different analyses and access more diverse data, including data from  commercial and government databases, to classify passengers according  to their level of risk.", "TSA program officials expect that CAPPS II will provide significant  improvements over the existing system. First, they believe a centralized  CAPPS II that will be owned and operated by the federal government will  allow for more effective and efficient use of up-to-date intelligence  information and make CAPPS II more capable of being modified in  response to changing threats. Second, they also believe that CAPPS II will  improve identity authentication and reduce the number of passengers who  are falsely identified as needing additional security screening. Third,  CAPPS II is expected to prescreen all passengers on flights either  originating in or destined for the United States. Last, an additional  expected benefit of the system is its ability to aggregate risk scores to  identify higher-risk flights, airports, or geographic regions that may  warrant additional aviation security measures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "System Development Behind Schedule and Critical Plans Incomplete", "paragraphs": ["Key activities in the development of CAPPS II have been delayed, and TSA  has not yet completed key system planning activities. TSA plans to develop  CAPPS II in nine increments, with each increment providing increased  functionality. (See app. I for a description of these increments.) As each  increment is completed, TSA plans to conduct tests that would ensure the  system meets the objectives of that increment before proceeding to the  next increment. The development of CAPPS II began in March 2003 with  increments 1 and 2 being completed in August and October 2003,  respectively. However, TSA has not completely tested these initial two  increments because it was unable to obtain the necessary passenger data  for testing from air carriers. Air carriers have been reluctant to provide  passenger data due to privacy concerns. Instead, the agency deferred  completing these tests until increment 3.", "TSA is currently developing increment 3. However, due to the  unavailability of passenger data needed for testing, TSA has delayed the  completion of this increment from October 2003 until at least the latter  part of this month and reduced the functionality that this increment is  expected to achieve. Increment 3 was originally intended to provide a  functioning system that could handle live passenger data from one air  carrier in a test environment to demonstrate that the system can satisfy  operational and functional requirements. However, TSA officials reported  that they recently modified increment 3 to instead provide a functional  application of the system in a simulated test environment that is not  actively connected to an airline reservation system. Officials also said that  they were uncertain when the testing that was deferred from increments 1  and 2 to increment 3 will be completed. TSA recognizes that system testing  is a high-risk area and plans to further delay the implementation of the  system to ensure that sufficient testing is completed. As a result, all  succeeding increments of CAPPS II have been delayed, moving CAPPS II  initial operating capability\u2014the point at which the system will be ready to  operate with one airline\u2014from November 2003 to a date unknown. (See  app. II for a timeline showing the original and revised schedule for CAPPS  II increments.)", "Further, we found that TSA has not yet developed critical elements  associated with sound project planning, including a plan for what specific  functionality will be delivered, by when, and at what cost throughout the  development of the system. Our work on similar systems and other best  practice research have shown that the application of rigorous practices to  the acquisition and development of information systems improves the  likelihood of the systems\u2019 success. In other words, the quality of  information technology systems and services is governed largely by the  quality of the processes involved in developing and acquiring the system.  We have reported that the lack of such practices has contributed to cost,  schedule, and performance problems for major system acquisition efforts.", "TSA established plans for the initial increments of the system, including  requirements for increments 1 and 2 and costs and schedules for  increments 1 through 4. However, officials lack a comprehensive plan  identifying the specific functions that will be delivered during the  remaining increments; for example, which government and commercial  databases will be incorporated, the date when these functions will be  delivered, and an estimated cost of the functions. In addition, TSA officials  recently reported that the expected functionality to be achieved during  early increments has been reduced, and officials are uncertain when  CAPPS II will achieve initial operating capability. Project officials also said  that because of testing delays, they are unable to plan for future  increments with any certainty.", "By not completing these key system development planning activities, TSA  runs the risk that CAPPS II will not provide the full functionality promised.  Further, without a clear link between deliverables, cost, and schedule, it  will be difficult to know what will be delivered and when in order to track  development progress.

These eight issues are    establishing an internal oversight board,    assessing the accuracy of databases,  testing the system load capacity (stress testing) and demonstrating its  efficacy and accuracy, installing operational safeguards to protect the system from abuse, installing security measures to protect the system from unauthorized  access,   establishing effective oversight of the system\u2019s use and operations,    addressing all privacy concerns, and    creating a redress process for passengers to correct erroneous  information.", "While TSA is in various stages of progress to address each of these issues,  only the establishment of an internal oversight board to review the  development of CAPPS II has been fully addressed. For the remaining  issues, TSA program officials contend that their ongoing efforts will  ultimately address each issue. However, due to system development  delays, uncertainties regarding when passenger data will be obtained to  test the system, and the need to finalize key policy decisions, officials were  unable to identify a time frame for when all remaining issues will be fully  addressed.", "The following briefly summarizes the status of TSA\u2019s efforts to address  each of the eight issues.", "Establishment of a CAPPS II oversight board has occurred.", "DHS created an oversight board\u2014the Investment Review Board\u2014to  review the department\u2019s largest capital asset programs. The Board  reviewed CAPPS II in October 2003. Based on this review, the Board  authorized TSA to proceed with the system\u2019s development. However, DHA  noted some areas that the program needed to address. These areas  included addressing privacy and policy issues, coordinating with other  stakeholders, and identifying program staffing requirements and costs,  among others, and directed that these issues be addressed before the  system proceeds to the next increment.", "Although DHS has the Board in place to provide internal oversight and  monitoring for CAPPS II and other large capital investments, we recently  reported that concerns exist regarding the timeliness of its future reviews.  DHS officials acknowledged that the Board is having difficulty reviewing  all of the critical departmental programs in a timely manner. As of January  2004, DHS had identified about 50 of the largest capital assets that would  be subject to the Board\u2019s review. As CAPPS II\u2019s development proceeds, it  will be important for the Board to oversee the program on a regular and  thorough basis to provide needed oversight.", "In addition, on February 12, 2004, DHS announced its intentions to  establish an external review board specifically for CAPPS II. This review  board will be responsible for ensuring that (1) the privacy notice is being  followed, (2) the appeal process is working effectively, and (3) the  passenger information used by CAPPS II is adequately protected.  However, in announcing the establishment of this review board, DHS did  not set a date as to when the board will be activated or who would serve  on the board.", "The accuracy of CAPPS II databases has not yet been determined.", "TSA has not yet determined the accuracy\u2014or conversely, the error rate\u2014 of commercial and government databases that will be used by CAPPS II.  Since consistent and compatible information on database accuracy is not  available, TSA officials said that they will be developing and conducting  their own tests to assess the overall accuracy of information contained in  commercial and government databases. These tests are not intended to  identify all errors existing within a database, but rather assess the overall  accuracy of a database before determining whether it is acceptable to be  used by CAPPS II.", "In addition to testing the accuracy of commercial databases, TSA plans to  better ensure the accuracy of information derived from commercial  databases by using multiple databases in a layered approach to  authenticating a passenger\u2019s identity. If available information is  insufficient to validate the passenger\u2019s identification in the first database  accessed, then CAPPS II will access another commercial database to  provide a second layer of data, and if necessary, still other commercial  databases. However, how to better ensure the accuracy of government  databases will be more challenging. TSA does not know exactly what type  of information the government databases contain, such as whether a  database will contain a person\u2019s name and full address, a partial address,  or no address at all. A senior program official said that using data without  assessing accuracy and mitigating data errors could result in erroneous  passenger assessments; consequently government database accuracy and  mitigation measures will have to be developed and completed before the  system is placed in operation.", "In mitigating errors in commercial and government databases, TSA plans  to use multiple databases and a process to identify misspellings to correct  errors in commercial databases. TSA is also developing a redress process  whereby passengers can attempt to get erroneous data corrected.  However, it is unclear what access passengers will have to information  found in either government or commercial databases, or who is ultimately  responsible for making corrections. Additionally, if errors are identified  during the redress process, TSA does not have the authority to correct  erroneous data in commercial or government databases. TSA officials said  they plan to address this issue by establishing protocols with commercial  data providers and other federal agencies to assist in the process of getting  erroneous data corrected.", "Stress testing and demonstration of the system\u2019s efficacy and accuracy  have been delayed.", "TSA has not yet stress tested CAPPS II increments developed to date or  conducted other system-related testing to fully demonstrate the  effectiveness and accuracy of the system\u2019s search capabilities, or search  tools, to correctly assess passenger risk levels. TSA initially planned to  conduct stress testing on an early increment of the system by August 2003.", "However, stress testing was delayed several times due to TSA\u2019s inability to  obtain the 1.5 million Passenger Name Records it estimates are needed to  test the system. TSA attempted to obtain the data needed for testing from  three different sources but encountered problems due to privacy concerns  associated with its access to the data. For example, one air carrier initially  agreed to provide passenger data for testing purposes, but adverse  publicity resulted in its withdrawal from participation  Further, as the system is more fully developed, TSA will need to conduct  stress testing. For example, there is a stringent performance requirement  for the system to process 3.5 million risk assessment transactions per day  with a peak load of 300 transactions per second that cannot be fully tested  until the system is further along in development. Program officials  acknowledge that achieving this performance requirement is a high-risk  area and have initiated discussions to define how this requirement will be  achieved. However, TSA has not yet developed a complete mitigation  strategy to address this risk. Without a strategy for mitigating the risk of  not meeting peak load requirements, the likelihood that the system may  not be able to meet performance requirements increases.", "Other system-related testing to fully demonstrate the effectiveness and  accuracy of the system\u2019s search tools in assessing passenger risk levels  also has not been conducted. This testing was also planned for completion  by August 2003, but similar to the delays in stress testing, TSA\u2019s lack of  access to passenger data prevented the agency from conducting these  tests. In fact, TSA has only used 32 simulated passenger records\u2014created  by TSA from the itineraries of its employees and contractor staff who  volunteered to provide the data\u2014to conduct this testing. TSA officials said  that the limited testing\u2014conducted during increment 2\u2014has  demonstrated the effectiveness of the system\u2019s various search tools.  However, tests using these limited records do not replicate the wide  variety of situations they expect to encounter with actual passenger data  when full-scale testing is actually undertaken. As a result, the full  effectiveness and accuracy of the tools have not been demonstrated.", "TSA\u2019s attempts to obtain test data are still ongoing, and privacy issues  remain a stumbling block. TSA officials believe they will continue to have  difficulty in obtaining data for both stress and other testing until TSA  issues a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to require airlines to provide  passenger data to TSA. This action is currently under consideration within  TSA and DHS. In addition, TSA officials said that before the system is  implemented, a final Privacy Act notice will be published. According to  DHS\u2019s Chief Privacy Officer, the agency anticipated that the Privacy Act  notice would be finalized in March 2004. However, this official told us that  the agency will not publish the final Privacy Act notice until all 15,000  comments received in response to the August 2003 Privacy Act notice are  reviewed and testing results are available. DHS could not provide us a date  as to when this will be accomplished. Further, due to the lack of test data,  TSA delayed the stress and system testing planned for increments 1 and 2  to increment 3, scheduled to be completed by March 31, 2004. However,  since we issued our report last month, a TSA official said that they no  longer expect to conduct this testing during increment 3 and do not have  an estimated date for when these tests will be conducted. Uncertainties  surrounding when stress and system testing will be conducted could  impact TSA\u2019s ability to allow sufficient time for testing, resolving defects,  and retesting before CAPPS II can achieve initial operating capability and  may further delay system deployment.", "Security plans that include operational and security safeguards are not  complete.", "Due to schedule delays and the early stage of CAPPS II development, TSA  has not implemented critical elements of an information system security  program to reduce opportunities for abuse and protect against  unauthorized access by hackers. These elements\u2014a security policy, a  system security plan, a security risk assessment, and the certification and  accreditation of the security of the system\u2014together provide a strong  security framework for protecting information technology data and assets.  While TSA has begun to implement critical elements of an information  security management program for CAPPS II, these elements have not been  completed. Until a specific security policy for CAPPS II is completed, TSA  officials reported that they are using relevant portions of the agency\u2019s  information security policy and other government security directives as  the basis for its security policy. As for the system security plan, it is  currently in draft. TSA expects to complete this plan by the time initial  operating capability is achieved. Regarding the security risk assessment,  TSA has postponed conducting this assessment because of development  delays and it has not been rescheduled. The completion date remains  uncertain because TSA does not have a date for achieving initial operating  capability as a result of other CAPPS II development delays. As for final  certification and accreditation, TSA is unable to schedule the final  certification and accreditation of CAPPS II because of the uncertainty  regarding the system\u2019s development schedule.", "The establishment of a security policy and the completion of the system  security plan, security risk assessment, and certification and accreditation  process are critical to ensuring the security of CAPPS II. Until these efforts  are completed, there is decreased assurance that TSA will be able to  adequately protect CAPPS II information and an increased risk of  operational abuse and access by unauthorized users.", "Policies for effective oversight of the use and operation of CAPPS II are  not developed.", "TSA has not yet fully established controls to oversee the effective use and  operation of CAPPS II. However, TSA plans to provide oversight of CAPPS  II through two methods: (1) establishing goals and measures to assess the  program\u2019s strengths, weaknesses, and performance and (2) establishing  mechanisms to monitor and evaluate the use and operation of the system.", "TSA has established preliminary goals and measures to assess the CAPPS  II program\u2019s performance in meeting its objectives as required by the  Government Performance and Results Act. Specifically, the agency has  established five strategic objectives with preliminary performance goals  and measures for CAPPS II. While this is a good first step, these measures  may not be sufficient to provide the objective data needed to conduct  appropriate oversight. TSA officials said that they are working with five  universities to assess system effectiveness and management and will  develop metrics to be used to measure the effectiveness of CAPPS II. With  this information, officials expect to review and, as necessary, revise their  goals and objectives to provide management and the Congress with  objective information to provide system oversight.", "In addition, TSA has not fully established or documented additional  oversight controls to ensure that operations are effectively monitored and  evaluated. Although TSA has built capabilities into CAPPS II to monitor  and evaluate the system\u2019s operation and plans to conduct audits of the  system to determine whether it is functioning as intended, TSA has not  written all of the rules that will govern how the system will operate.", "Consequently, officials do not yet know how these capabilities will  function, how they will be applied to monitor the system to provide  oversight, and what positions and offices will be responsible for  maintaining the oversight. Until these policies and procedures for CAPPS  II are developed, there is no assurance that proper controls are in place to  monitor and oversee the system.", "TSA\u2019s plans address privacy protection, but issues remain unresolved.", "TSA\u2019s plans for CAPPS II reflect an effort to protect individual privacy  rights, but certain issues remain unresolved. Specifically, TSA plans  address many of the requirements of the Privacy Act, the primary  legislation that regulates the government\u2019s use of personal information.  For example, in January 2003, TSA issued a notice in the Federal Register  that generally describes the Privacy Act system of records that will reside  in CAPPS II and asked the public to comment. While TSA has taken these  initial steps, it has not yet finalized its plans for complying with the act.  For example, the act and related Office of Management and Budget  guidance state that an agency proposing to exempt a system of records  from a Privacy Act provision must explain the reasons for the exemption  in a published rule. In January 2003, TSA published a proposed rule to  exempt the system from seven Privacy Act provisions but has not yet  provided the reasons for these exemptions, stating that this information  will be provided in a final rule to be published before the system becomes  operational. As a result, TSA\u2019s justification for these exemptions remains  unclear. Until TSA finalizes its privacy plans for CAPPS II and addresses  such concerns, the public lacks assurance that the system will fully  comply with the Privacy Act.", "When viewed in the larger context of Fair Information Practices\u2014 internationally recognized privacy principles that also underlie the Privacy  Act\u2014TSA plans reflect some actions to address each of these practices.  For example, TSA\u2019s plan to not collect passengers\u2019 social security numbers  from commercial data providers and to destroy most passenger  information shortly after they have completed their travel itinerary  appears consistent with the collection limitation practice, which states  that collections of personal information should be limited. However, to  meet its evolving mission goals, TSA plans also appear to limit the  application of certain of these practices. For example, TSA plans to  exempt CAPPS II from the Privacy Act\u2019s requirements to maintain only  that information about an individual that is relevant and necessary to  accomplish a proper agency purpose. These plans reflect the  subordination of the use limitation practice and data quality practice  (personal information should be relevant to the purpose for which it is  collected) to other goals and raises concerns that TSA may collect and  maintain more information than is needed for the purpose of CAPPS II,  and perhaps use this information for new purposes in the future. Such  actions to limit the application of the Fair Information Practices do not  violate federal requirements. Rather, they reflect TSA\u2019s efforts to balance  privacy with other public policy interests such as national security, law  enforcement, and administrative efficiency. As the program evolves, it will  ultimately be up to policymakers to determine if TSA has struck an  appropriate balance among these competing interests.", "Redress process is being developed, but significant challenges remain.", "TSA intends to establish a process by which passengers who are subject to  additional screening or denied boarding will be provided the opportunity  to seek redress by filing a complaint; however, TSA has not yet finalized  this process. According to TSA officials, the redress process will make use  of TSA\u2019s existing complaint process\u2014currently used for complaints from  passengers denied boarding passes\u2014to document complaints and provide  these to TSA\u2019s Ombudsman. Complaints relating to CAPPS II will be  routed through the Ombudsman to a Passenger Advocate\u2014a position to  be established within TSA for assisting individuals with CAPPS II-related  concerns\u2014who will help identify errors that may have caused a person to  be identified as a false positive. If the passengers are not satisfied with  the response received from the Passenger Advocate regarding the  complaint, they will have the opportunity to appeal their case to the DHS  Privacy Office.", "A number of key policy issues associated with the redress process,  however, still need to be resolved. These issues involve data retention,  access, and correction. Current plans for data retention indicate that data  on U.S. travelers and lawful permanent residents will be deleted from the  system at a specified time following the completion of the passengers\u2019  itinerary. Although TSA\u2019s decision to limit the retention of data was made  for privacy considerations, the short retention period might make it  impossible for passengers to seek redress if they do not register  complaints quickly. TSA has also not yet determined the extent of data  access that will be permitted for those passengers who file a complaint.  TSA officials said that passengers will not have access to any government  data used to generate a passenger risk score due to national security  concerns. TSA officials have also not determined to what extent, if any,  passengers will be allowed to view information used by commercial data  providers. Furthermore, TSA has not yet determined how the process of  correcting erroneous information will work in practice. TSA documents  and program officials said that it may be difficult for the Passenger  Advocate to identify errors, and that it could be the passenger\u2019s  responsibility to correct errors in commercial databases at their source.", "To address these concerns, TSA is exploring ways to assist passengers  who are consistently determined to be false positives. For example, TSA  has discussed incorporating an \u201calert list\u201d that would consist of passengers  who coincidentally share a name with a person on a government watch list  and are, therefore, continually flagged for additional screening. Although  the process has not been finalized, current plans indicate that a passenger  would be required to submit to an extensive background check in order to  be placed on the alert list. TSA said that available remedies for all persons  seeking redress will be more fully detailed in CAPPS II\u2019s privacy policy,  which will be published before the system achieves initial operating  capability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Challenges Could Affect the Successful Implementation of CAPPS II", "paragraphs": ["In addition to facing developmental and operational challenges related to  key areas of interest to the Congress, CAPPS II faces a number of  additional challenges that may impede its success.

The  European Union, in particular, has objected to its citizens\u2019 data being used  by CAPPS II, whether a citizen of a European Union country flies on a U.S.  carrier or an air carrier under another country\u2019s flag. The European Union  has asserted that using such data is not in compliance with its privacy  directive and violates the civil liberties and privacy rights of its citizens.", "DHS and European Union officials are in the process of finalizing an  understanding regarding the transfer of passenger data for use by the  Bureau of Customs and Border Protection. However, this understanding  does not permit the passenger data to be used by TSA in the operation of  CAPPS II but does allow for the data to be used for testing purposes.  According to a December 16, 2003, report from the Commission of  European Communities, the European Union will not be in a position to  agree to the use of its citizens\u2019 passenger data for CAPPS II until internal  U.S. processes have been completed and it is clear that the U.S. Congress\u2019s  privacy concerns have been resolved. The Commission said that it would  discuss the use of European Union citizen passenger data in a second,  later round of discussions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expansion of Mission", "paragraphs": ["Our review found that CAPPS II may be expanded beyond its original  purpose and that this expansion may affect program objectives and public  acceptance of the system. The primary objective of CAPPS II was to  protect the commercial aviation system from the risk of foreign terrorism  by screening for high-risk or potentially high-risk passengers. However, in  the August 2003 interim final Privacy Act notice for CAPPS II, TSA stated  that the system would seek to identify both domestic and foreign terrorists  and not just foreign terrorists as previously proposed. The August notice  also stated that the system could be expanded to identify persons who are  subject to outstanding federal or state arrest warrants for violent crimes  and that CAPPS II could ultimately be expanded to include identifying  individuals who are in the United States illegally or who have overstayed  their visas.", "DHS officials have said that such changes are not an expansion of the  system\u2019s mission because they believe it will improve aviation security and  is consistent with CAPPS II\u2019s mission. However, program officials and  advocacy groups expressed concern that focusing on persons with  outstanding warrants, and possibly immigration violators, could put TSA  at risk of diverting attention from the program\u2019s fundamental purpose.  Expanding CAPPS II\u2019s mission could also lead to an erosion of public  confidence in the system, which program officials agreed is essential to  the effective operation of CAPPS II. This expansion could also increase  the costs of passenger screening, as well as the number of passengers  erroneously identified as needing additional security attention because  some of the databases that could be used to identify wanted felons have  reliability concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Identity Theft", "paragraphs": ["Another challenge facing the successful operation of CAPPS II is the  system\u2019s ability to effectively identify passengers who assume the identity  of another individual, known as identity theft. TSA officials said that while  they believe CAPPS II will be able to detect some instances of identity  theft, they recognized that the system will not detect all instances of  identity theft without implementing some type of biometric indicator, such  as fingerprinting or retinal scans. TSA officials said that while CAPPS II  cannot address all cases of identity theft, CAPPS II should detect  situations in which a passenger submits fictitious information such as a  false address. These instances would likely be detected since the data  being provided would either not be validated or would be inconsistent  with information in the databases used by CAPPS II. Additionally, officials  said that data on identity theft may be available through credit bureaus  and that in the future they expect to work with the credit bureaus to  obtain such data. However, the officials acknowledge that some identity  theft is difficult to spot, particularly if the identity theft is unreported or if  collusion, where someone permits his or her identity to be assumed by  another person, is involved.", "TSA officials said that there should not be an expectation that CAPPS II  will be 100 percent accurate in identifying all cases of identity theft.  Further, the officials said that CAPPS II is just one layer in the system of  systems that TSA has in place to improve aviation security, and that  passengers who were able to thwart CAPPS II by committing identity theft  would still need to go through normal checkpoint screening and other  standard security procedures. TSA officials believe that, although not fool- proof, CAPPS II represents an improvement in identity authentication over  the current system."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The events of September 11, 2001, and the ongoing threat of commercial  aircraft hijackings as a means of terrorist attack against the United States  continue to highlight the importance of a proactive approach to effectively  prescreening airline passengers. An effective prescreening system would  not only expedite the screening of passengers, but would also accurately  identify those passengers warranting additional security attention,  including those passengers determined to have an unacceptable level of  risk who would be immediately assessed by law enforcement personnel.  CAPPS II, while holding the promise of providing increased benefits over  the current system, faces significant challenges to its successful  implementation. Uncertainties surrounding the system\u2019s future  functionality and schedule alone result in the potential that the system  may not meet expected requirements, may experience delayed  deployment, and may incur increased costs throughout the system\u2019s  development. Of the eight issues identified by the Congress related to  CAPPS II, only one has been fully addressed. Additionally, concerns about  mission expansion and identify theft add to the public\u2019s uncertainty about  the success of CAPPS II.", "Our recent report on CAPPS II made seven specific recommendations that  we believe will help address these concerns and challenges. The  development of plans identifying the specific functionality that will be  delivered during each increment of CAPPS II and its associated milestones  for completion and the expected costs for each increment would provide  TSA with critical guidelines for maintaining the project\u2019s focus and  achieving intended system results and milestones within budget.  Furthermore, a schedule for critical security activities, a strategy for  mitigating the high risk associated with system and database testing, and  appropriate oversight mechanisms would enhance assurance that the  system and its data will be adequately protected from misuse. In addition  to these steps, development of results-oriented performance goals and  measures would help ensure that the system is operating as intended. Last,  given the concerns regarding the protection of passenger data, the system  cannot be fully accepted if it lacks a redress process for those who believe  they are erroneously identified as an unknown or unacceptable risk.", "Our recently published report highlighted each of these concerns and  challenges and contained several recommendations to address them. DHS  generally concurred with our findings and has agreed to address the  related recommendations. By adequately addressing these  recommendations, we believe DHS increases the likelihood of successfully  implementing this program. In the interim, it is crucial that the Congress  maintain vigilant oversight of DHS to see that these concerns and  challenges are addressed.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
