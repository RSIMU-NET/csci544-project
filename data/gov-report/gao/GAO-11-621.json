However, DOD does not have a departmentwide strategy that adequately defines roles and responsibilities for addressing gaps, aligns objectives with national strategy, and includes measures to guide the implementation of maritime domain awareness efforts, and to assess and manage risk associated with capability gaps. GAO has previously reported that it is standard practice to have a strategy that lays out goals and objectives, suggests actions for addressing those objectives, allocates resources, identifies roles and responsibilities, and measures performance against objectives. DOD and its components have developed a number of documents that incorporate some of these key elements of an overall strategy for maritime domain awareness such as a definition of the problem. However, collectively they do not have several key elements a strategy should contain. For example, neither DOD's Maritime Domain Awareness Joint Integrating Concept nor the DOD's Executive Agent Assessment of U.S. Defense Components Annual Maritime Domain Awareness Plans fully address organizational roles and responsibilities and resources, investments, performance measures, and risk management. Additionally, DOD leverages numerous capabilities to collect, fuse, and share maritime information to respond to global maritime challenges. DOD components have identified and started prioritizing capability gaps; however, DOD does not have a departmentwide risk assessment to address high priority capability gaps. DOD combatant commands and components prioritize maritime domain awareness differently based upon their respective missions and these component-level views may not provide a full view of the risks associated with these gaps at a departmentwide level. Prior GAO work has emphasized the importance of using a comprehensive risk assessment process. A strategy that includes a comprehensive, risk-based approach to managing maritime domain awareness may provide better information to decision makers about the potential implications of policy and resourcing decisions both within DOD and across the interagency. In the absence of a departmentwide strategy, DOD may not be effectively managing its maritime domain awareness efforts.

In the absence of a departmentwide  strategy for maritime domain awareness, including the prioritized  allocation of resources to maritime domain awareness, measures of  performance in meeting the goals and objectives, monitoring of progress  in addressing capability gaps, and assessing risk, DOD may not be  effectively managing its maritime domain awareness efforts. Efforts on the  part of DOD combatant commands, military services, the DOD Executive  Agent for Maritime Domain Awareness, and interagency working groups  resulted in the identification of several capability gaps, some identified by  multiple components. The next step in achieving effective departmentwide  maritime domain awareness would be a departmentwide strategy and risk  assessment that incorporates these efforts. As DOD and the rest of  government face increasing demand and competition for resources,  policymakers will confront difficult decisions on funding priorities.  Threats to the maritime domain are numerous and include the use of large  merchant vessels to transport weapons of mass destruction; explosive- laden suicide boats as weapons; and vessels to smuggle people, drugs,  weapons, and other contraband. The importance and vulnerabilities of the  maritime domain require that efforts be made to reduce the risk of  maritime threats and challenges, such as a terrorist attack or acts of  piracy. Additionally, a comprehensive, risk-based approach would help  DOD capitalize on the considerable effort it and its components have  already devoted to maritime domain awareness, make the best use of  resources in a fiscally constrained environment, and contribute to  interagency efforts to address maritime threats. A strategic, risk-based  approach is particularly important in light of emerging threats in the  maritime domain and an increased strain on government resources. Such a  departmentwide approach will provide DOD with important tools that can  assist in confronting the myriad policy and fiscal challenges the  department faces."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve DOD\u2019s ability to manage the implementation of maritime  domain awareness across DOD we recommend that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Secretary of the Navy, as DOD\u2019s Executive Agent, to  take the following two actions:    Develop and implement a departmentwide strategy for maritime  domain awareness that, at a minimum  Identifies DOD objectives and roles and responsibilities within DOD  for achieving maritime domain awareness, and aligns efforts and  objectives with DOD\u2019s corporate process for determining  requirements and allocating resources; and  Identifies responsibilities for resourcing capability areas and  includes performance measures for assessing progress of the  overall strategy that will assist in the implementation of maritime  domain awareness efforts.", "In collaboration with other maritime interagency stakeholders, such as  the Coast Guard and the National Maritime Intelligence Center,  perform a comprehensive risk-based analysis to include consideration  of threats, vulnerabilities, and criticalities relating to the management  of maritime domain awareness in order to prioritize and address DOD\u2019s  critical maritime capability gaps and guide future investments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of the prior, sensitive report, DOD  concurred with our recommendations and discussed actions they are  taking\u2014or plan to take\u2014to address them.

DOD also provided technical  comments, which we have incorporated into the report where appropriate.", "In concurring with the first recommendation, DOD stated that they have  completed the initial policy, goals, and objectives for maritime domain  awareness and promulgated it in a document to all DOD components.  DOD also stated their intent to identify responsibilities for resourcing  capability gaps and performance measures for assessing progress in  achieving maritime domain awareness. DOD identified further steps it is  taking to establish objectives for maritime domain awareness, assign  appropriate roles and responsibilities, and conduct a second assessment  of annual maritime domain awareness plans to inform DOD\u2019s overall effort  to develop a departmentwide strategy. We believe these actions will  address the intent of our recommendation and better enable DOD to  address maritime capability gaps.", "DOD also concurred with our second recommendation. DOD stated that it  will collaborate with the other principal members of the National Maritime  Domain Awareness Coordination Office to develop a comprehensive, risk- based approach for maritime domain awareness. The DOD Executive  Agent is also requesting that DOD components include risk assessments in  their annual maritime domain awareness plans. We believe these actions  will address the intent of our recommendation and help DOD prioritize its  maritime capability gaps and guide future investment decisions.", "We are distributing this report to the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary  of the Navy, and other relevant DOD officials.

We agreed with the  requesters to respond to this request with two reports. The first report  focuses on maritime capabilities and the second report will focus on  maritime homeland defense. However, we considered the homeland  defense perspective when we determined our site visits so we could gather  relevant data on maritime homeland defense where possible and feasible  to support the second report. As a result, we focused the scope of this  audit on geographic combatant commands that had both a maritime focus  and a homeland defense mission set. We determined that U.S. Northern  Command, U.S. Southern Command, and U.S. Pacific Command met this  criteria, and we conducted site visits to a facilities, such as operations  centers, engaged in both maritime domain awareness and homeland  defense that support these combatant commands.", "To determine what capabilities DOD currently uses to support maritime  domain awareness, what gaps still exist and how these gaps are  prioritized, we assessed capability needs established in national guidance  such as the National Plan to Achieve Maritime Domain Awareness and  DOD guidance such as the Joint Integrating Concept and DOD Directive  2005.02E, which establishes DOD policy for maritime domain awareness.  We compared this information with current capabilities and gaps  described by combatant command, military service, and supporting  intelligence agency\u2019s officials during interviews and site visits. For  example, we visited several combatant and joint operation centers to  observe what capabilities were used at maritime operations centers. In  addition, we evaluated DOD\u2019s efforts to prioritize capability gaps against  established DOD acquisition processes such as the Joint Capabilities  Integration and Development System. We reviewed prior GAO work on  risk management and compared it to existing DOD maritime domain  awareness capability documents to determine the extent to which DOD  applies a risk-based approach to managing capabilities and identified gaps  related to maritime domain awareness.", "To determine the extent to which DOD developed a strategy to address  maritime domain awareness capability gaps, we reviewed prior GAO work  on strategic planning including GAO\u2019s work on assessing specific  components of national strategies. Given that there is no established set of  requirements for strategies, we relied on GAO assessments of national  strategies and the criteria that were applied to assess these strategies. We  identified six desirable characteristics that national or departmentwide  strategies should contain. We assessed these criteria against existing DOD  and component-level documents such as the Joint Integrating Concept,  the DOD Executive Agent\u2019s Assessment of the U.S. Defense Components  Annual Maritime Domain Awareness Plans 2009, and the Department of  the Navy\u2019s capability assessment and roadmaps to determine the extent to  which these documents contain the elements of a departmentwide  strategy. We specifically focused our assessment on the two  departmentwide efforts to identify a maritime domain awareness strategy,  DOD\u2019s Maritime Domain Awareness Joint Integrating Concept and  DOD\u2019s Executive Agent for Maritime Domain Awareness\u2019s Assessment of  U.S. Defense Components Annual Maritime Domain Awareness Plans  2009. To determine the extent to which DOD has allocated resources,  measured performance and monitored progress in addressing identified  capability gaps, we reviewed the same documents noted above to see if  identified gaps were resourced within DOD, and if implementation and  monitoring programs were discussed in relation to these gaps. We also  assessed the information described in these documents against  information obtained from combatant command, military service, and  supporting intelligence agency\u2019s officials during interviews and site visits.", "To evaluate our reporting objectives, we obtained relevant national,  interagency, and DOD-level documentation and interviewed officials from  the following DOD components and interagency partners:    Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence)    Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and  America\u2019s Security Affairs    Defense Intelligence Agency    Defense Intelligence Operations Coordination Center    National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency    Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics)    Joint Chiefs of Staff    Department of the Navy    Executive Agent for Maritime Domain Awareness    Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (N3/N5)    Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, Information Dominance  Division (N2/N6)", "Office of the Chief Information Officer    Office of Naval Intelligence    Office of Naval Research    U.S. Navy Pacific Fleet    U.S. Navy Third Fleet    Naval Air Systems Command    Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command    Combatant Commands    Headquarters, U.S. Pacific Command    Headquarters, U.S. Northern Command    Headquarters, North American Aerospace Defense Command    Headquarters, U.S. Southern Command    Headquarters, Fleet Forces Command    Joint Forces Component Command for Intelligence, Surveillance and  Reconnaissance, U.S. Strategic Command    The United States Coast Guard    Headquarters    District Five, Sector Hampton Roads    District Eleven, Sector San Diego  Intelligence Coordination Center    Maritime Intelligence Fusion Center (Atlantic Area)    Maritime Intelligence Fusion Center (Pacific Area)    Joint Harbor Operations Center, Port of San Diego    The Office of Global Maritime Situational Awareness / National  Maritime Domain Awareness Coordination Office  We conducted this performance audit primarily from June 2009 through  November 2010, and coordinated with DOD from January to June 2011 to  produce this public version of the prior, sensitive report issued in  November 2010 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.
