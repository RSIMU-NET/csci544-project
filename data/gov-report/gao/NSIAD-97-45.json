The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) manages and operates all service commissaries located worldwide and has received an average of about $1 billion in federal government support annually over the past 5 years. DOD has proposed allowing reservists unlimited access to commissaries three times in the recent past. DOD officials view this policy change as a low or no cost way to increase military service benefits. Specifically, this report discusses the evolution of the policy on military reservists\u2019 access to the commissaries and proposals to change that policy, the sources of DeCA\u2019s funding, and the information needed to analyze the impact on appropriated funds of granting military reservists unlimited access to the commissary system."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Military commissaries have existed for many years and provide a nonpay benefit to U.S. military personnel.

It was established in October 1991 to consolidate the four separate commissary systems then operated by the military services. Headquartered at Fort Lee, Virginia, DeCA is organized into 7 regions and employs about 18,000 people. It operates a system of 309 stores\u2014209 in the continental United States and 100 overseas. According to DeCA, it is the ninth largest food retailer in the United States and has total annual sales of approximately $5 billion with U.S. stores generating about 75 percent of the sales.", "The eligible commissary customer base totals over 11 million people consisting of about 3.8 million active duty personnel and their family members; about 2.3 million Selected Reservists and their spouses and children; and almost 4.9 million retired military personnel, which includes their spouses and children. In addition, the customer base includes a number of \u201cGray Area\u201d retirees, some members of the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR), Medal of Honor recipients, veterans with a 100-percent disability, and civil servants (including diplomats) and their dependents overseas. The active duty community has unlimited access privileges to the commissaries as do the other members of the customer base. Reservists, on the other hand, are (1) authorized 12 visits per year if they have earned a minimum number of points creditable for retirement and (2) access during any period of active duty service. According to DeCA, military retirees account for almost half of its customer patronage.

In 1986, Selected Reservists were authorized to use the commissary once for each day of active duty training up to a maximum of 14 times. These commissary visits could be used anytime during the 1-year period following the completion date of active duty training.", "The current reservist access policy was established in 1990. That year, legislation set access for all members of the Ready Reserve\u2014Selected Reservists and certain members of the IRR\u2014who earn at least 50 retirement points per year the right to a minimum of 12 commissary visits per year. \u201cGray Area\u201d retirees were also authorized 12 visits each calendar year. Reservists entitled to commissary access are issued a special card that is punched each time a purchase is made at a commissary.", "Since 1993, DOD has proposed changing commissary policy three times to allow reservists unlimited access; however, neither DOD nor DeCA have performed any studies to examine or analyze the potential financial impact of these suggested policy changes. None of the proposals were adopted by Congress. The first was submitted for fiscal year 1994 and would have granted reservists, including \u201cGray Area\u201d retirees, the same unlimited access as active duty personnel. For fiscal year 1996, DOD proposed that \u201cGray Area\u201d retirees be granted permanent, unlimited commissary access and that the other reservists be provided unlimited access for a 1-year test period. For fiscal year 1997, DOD proposed a 1-year test of unlimited benefits for all reservists (including dependents) at one or more areas in the United States.

They stated that the proposed policy change was the \u201cright thing to do,\u201d and would not likely affect private sector grocers adversely. On the other hand, an official in the DOD Comptroller\u2019s office expressed reservations about the policy change because it could potentially lead to the hiring of additional personnel, thereby increasing the need for appropriated funding. DeCA officials stated that they did not know what the financial impact would be and that the agency would carry out any policy established by DOD and Congress.", "Representatives of the Reserve Officers\u2019 Association and the Military Coalition strongly support unlimited commissary access for reservists on the basis that this change would take away what they perceive as a \u201csecond class citizen\u201d stigma for reservists when compared to the active military. These groups also said that the proposed change would not greatly affect private sector supermarkets.", "Representatives from the Food Marketing Institute, a food industry association and lobby group, told us that their organization did not support the proposed change, had lobbied strongly against it, and believed the food industry would lose customers and sales if reservists were given unlimited commissary access.", "The Congressional Budget Office is conducting an overall review of DOD\u2019s resale operations, which include the exchange systems; commissaries; and morale, welfare and recreation activities.

In fiscal year 1997, DOD suggested another test at one or more areas in the United States. Both suggestions would require temporarily granting access to commissaries to all reservists or, at least, those in a certain area or areas. The primary concern with testing unlimited accessibility is that withdrawal of the benefit later could have a negative impact on morale and on the perception of the benefits of military service.", "We believe DOD and DeCA could develop reliable estimates of the potential impact of this policy change using a study and data analysis approach and that such an approach would be more appropriate than a field test.

This information could be developed by DeCA using recognized survey techniques. While DOD has conducted two surveys involving reservists in the past several years, neither has provided adequate or sufficient information regarding reservist usage.", "A 1992 DOD Reserve Components Survey was done to gain insight into the utilization of and satisfaction with military facilities by reserve officers, enlisted personnel, and their spouses. It did not attempt to estimate the overall commissary patronage level attributable to reservists or project their usage to the system as a whole. This survey disclosed that 39 percent of reservists reported that they used the commissary system; however, 61 percent said they did not. Sixty eight percent of all reservists surveyed cited distance from the commissary as a factor that limited their usage of the system while the policy restricting reservists\u2019 access to commissaries was reported by 25 percent.", "A 1994 Commissary Patron Demographic Survey developed information to describe certain aspects of the typical commissary customer and estimated that reservists represented about 5 percent of commissary patronage. However, according to DeCA officials as well as our analysis, the survey results were not projectable to a systemwide perspective because of flaws in methodology. Specifically, (1) the distribution of commissaries selected for the survey was based on the distribution of the general population\u2014not the population distribution of reservists in the United States\u2014and (2) the survey was conducted during a holiday period that did not represent normal operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Commissary Locations, Reservist Populations, and Increased Usage", "paragraphs": ["To identify locations where increased patronage is most likely, DeCA needs to analyze the locations of commissaries in relation to concentrations of reservists and the distances to individual stores. Reservists are located throughout the United States, but, only 209 stores were available within the continental United States in 1996. This means that many reservists are not located close to a store and, therefore, may not be able to use the system on a regular basis. Analyzing demographic data that reflects the location of reservists in relation to available commissary stores and baseline estimates of existing patronage levels in the overall system should identify those geographic areas where increased sales are likely or possible. The distribution of stores is shown in table 1.", "Stores likely to experience sales increases could be identified by analyzing the demographic data and determining the baseline estimates of existing patronage levels. Potential sales increases could be estimated by several approaches or a combination thereof. For example, (1) reservists could be surveyed by interview at commissary stores determined to be most likely to experience increased patronage, (2) reservists could be surveyed on a nationwide basis to gain insight into any anticipated changes in buying patterns and commissary usage, and (3) commissary store managers could be interviewed for their views and estimates of potential increases (if their estimates were thought to be reliable).

For example, comparing the personnel and other costs of a store with annual sales of $20 million to one with 10-percent higher sales, that is, one with sales of $22 million, provides valuable and reliable indications of the additional number of personnel hours needed to support a 10-percent increase at a store with historical sales of $20 million.", "Such a methodology could be applied to the commissary system to develop a range of estimates of the impact on personnel and other costs generated from various percentages of projected increased patronage and sales from reservists, that is, 5, 10, 15, 20, etc. The increased personnel costs, if any, calculated at store and regional levels for each projected sales increase would roughly equal the potential impact range on the level of appropriated fund support resulting from granting reservists unlimited commissary access."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense ensure that any future legislative proposal to expand commissary access for military reservists be supported by a methodologically sound analysis that estimates the potential impact on appropriated fund support for the commissary system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["DOD concurred with our recommendation and stated that DeCA and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Reserve Affairs) will jointly develop a survey targeted to ascertain the impact expansion of commissary access to military reservists will have on the commissary system.
