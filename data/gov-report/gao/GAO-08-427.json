Such repairs are sometimes beyond the capability of the ship's crew to perform; cannot be deferred; and must be made at a remote location. After the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended closing the former Naval Ship Repair Facility, Guam, the Navy leased the property at that facility to the Guam Economic Development and Commerce Authority, which sub-leased the property to a private shipyard. DOD has since begun planning for a military buildup on Guam. In January 2007 the Navy recommended allowing the private shipyard's lease on Navy land to expire in 2012. Consequently, the House Armed Services Committee asked GAO to determine the extent to which the Navy has (1) identified future ship repair requirements at Guam, and (2) identified and assessed options to address those requirements. GAO reviewed documents related to ship maintenance and interviewed officials affiliated with private contractors, the Guam government, the Marine Corps, Military Sealift Command, and the Navy in conducting this review."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Navy has not identified voyage surface ship repair requirements for 2012 and beyond for vessels operating near Guam, although some information is available on which to base estimated requirements for planning. Navy officials stated that they cannot estimate such requirements because the Navy expects to change its force structure, the Marine Corps has not finalized its plans for any additional vessels associated with the buildup, and Military Sealift Command expects changes to its force structure at Guam. Although the Navy, Marine Corps, and Military Sealift Command have not made final force structure decisions or operational plans for vessels operating at or near Guam, information is available to support an estimation of ship repair requirements as part of the multiyear planning and budgeting process. Specifically, the Navy (1) knows the history of voyage repairs conducted on Guam; (2) can identify vessels likely to operate near Guam based on planned force structure realignments in the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review; and (3) can identify ship repair capabilities available at other strategic locations in the Pacific area, including Yokosuka, Japan. Developing requirements is a prerequisite for planning, and without developing estimated repair requirements the Navy cannot adequately evaluate options for meeting them. Navy officials identified potential options for providing repairs in Guam, but have not fully assessed their viability or identified time-critical planning tasks. According to Navy officials, once the Navy identifies voyage ship repair requirements for the Guam area, they will choose from four options or a combination of options for providing voyage repairs. First, the Navy could try to expand existing organic repair capabilities to conduct voyage repairs. However, the existing ship maintenance capabilities and facilities have little excess capacity without augmentation, limiting their ability to perform additional work. Second, the Navy could rely on repair teams flown in from naval shipyards in the United States. Third, the Navy could build a new Navy ship repair facility, though that could require years of planning and new funding. Fourth, the Navy could contract out work to either or both of the private ship repair providers now operating in Guam, or to any other private ship repair facility that might choose to locate in Guam. Three of these options might require building new facilities or expanding existing facilities. Officials said they would not begin planning until preparations begin for submissions to the President's budget for fiscal year 2012. However, lead time is required to perform planning tasks necessary to provide repair capabilities from the Navy's suggested options. Without assessing the viability of each option for voyage repairs in a timely manner, the Navy increases the risk that voyage repair capabilities for ships operating in the Pacific may not be available when needed, potentially undermining ships' ability to accomplish their missions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Guam is a territory of the United States with strategic value to the  Guam is a territory of the United States with strategic value to the  Department of Defense (DOD).

The Navy pointed to the strategic value of having a private ship  repair capability in Guam as the rationale for noncompetitively awarding  contracts to Guam Shipyard from 1998 to 2007 to overhaul MSC ships and  conduct other Navy ship repair work, including voyage repairs. Guam  Shipyard continues to operate on the leased property. Guam Shipyard\u2019s  lease was to expire by October 1, 2007, although Guam Shipyard exercised  an option to extend its sub-lease with the Guam Economic Development  and Commerce Authority by 5 years, and they in turn exercised the option  to extend the lease by 5 years with the Navy. The lease terms gave the  Navy the power to terminate the lease at any time for cause, if cause  existed.", "DOD\u2019s planning effort for a military buildup on Guam, which could have  an impact on ship repair requirements in Guam, has begun. DOD plans to  (1) relocate about 8,000 Marines and 9,000 dependents from Okinawa to  Guam, (2) construct a new Navy pier to support visiting aircraft carriers,  (3) improve piers to support visiting amphibious vessels, (4) increase the  submarine presence on Guam and in the Pacific region generally, and (5)  locate an Army ballistic missile defense capability on Guam. Historically,  U.S. naval ships whose home port was Guam were permitted by U.S. law  to undergo overhaul, repair, or maintenance in shipyards outside the  United States or Guam. The John Warner National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (the Act) amended section 7310 of Title 10 of the  U.S. Code to prohibit U.S. naval vessels home-ported in Guam from  undergoing such work in shipyards outside the United States or Guam,  other than in the case of voyage repairs. The Act also required the Navy to  evaluate options for Guam Shipyard\u2019s lease and any anticipated future ship  repair workloads in Guam, and to report its findings to Congress. In  January 2007, the Navy issued its report and concluded that it would  prefer that future ship repair contracts on Guam be awarded  competitively, and that it would be premature to extend the lease with  Guam Shipyard as a result of the planned military build-up on Guam.  Specifically, the Navy recommended that the lease with the government of  Guam and with Guam Shipyard be allowed to expire on October 1, 2007,  and that negotiations be opened to terminate Guam Shipyard\u2019s option to  extend the lease by 5 years or to allow the lease to run to the 2012  expiration on a smaller acreage, if negotiations to terminate the extension  option failed. The Navy has not initiated negotiations since issuing its  recommendations, and has taken no action to terminate its lease with the  government of Guam for cause. Guam Shipyard exercised its option to  extend its lease with the government of Guam until 2012 without reducing  its acreage, and the government of Guam completed its lease extension  with the Navy for that time period.", "The Act also required GAO to evaluate the Navy report. On June 22, 2007,  we briefed your staff on our evaluation and concluded that the Navy\u2019s  recommendation to allow Guam Shipyard\u2019s lease to expire was logically  supported, and we could not disagree with the Navy\u2019s conclusion based on  the information available at that time. At that briefing, your staff asked  that we also determine the extent to which the Navy has (1) identified  future ship repair requirements for the Guam area, and (2) identified and  assessed options to address those requirements. This report responds to  that request.", "To determine the extent to which the Navy has identified future repair  requirements for ships operating in the Guam area and identified and  assessed options to address those requirements, we reviewed documents  related to past ship repair requirements in Guam, contracts associated  with ship repairs, and Navy records related to ship repair facilities and  activities. In addition, we interviewed officials at Guam Shipyard and  another private ship repair provider, Gulf Copper, Inc.; Guam government  officials; Navy officials in Washington, D.C., Hawaii, and Guam; and MSC  officials in Washington, D.C., Norfolk, Virginia, San Diego, California, and  Guam.

However, voyage repairs are occasionally  beyond the capability of ships\u2019 crews to complete, and must be performed  by an intermediate or depot-level ship repair activity.

First, the Navy submarine tender USS Frank Cable, which is a ship  home-ported in Guam, has provided voyage repair capabilities for  submarines when needed. Second, the Navy has relied on its Emergent  Repair Facility to repair submarines by using a repair crew left behind  from the USS Frank Cable when that ship is deployed.

For example, Guam Shipyard assisted U.S. Naval shipyards  with extensive voyage repairs on the USS San Francisco, a submarine that  struck an undersea mountain, by providing dry-dock services and selected  support services. Voyage repairs have averaged about 17 percent of the  total annual workload performed at Guam Shipyard. While Guam Shipyard  officials told us that the voyage repair work would not be sufficient to  support its current infrastructure and personnel, in 2007 it won a  competition for the overhaul of the USNS Bridge, an MSC Pacific fleet  support vessel. Competitions for overhaul of other MSC ships operating  near Guam are scheduled beyond 2008.", "While Guam Shipyard has been the only commercial shipyard capable of  supporting Navy ship repair and overhaul requirements on Guam since  1998, a private ship repair provider new to Guam, Gulf Copper, has  initiated ship repair operations there.

Moreover, the service has plans for a 313-ship Navy, but it has not  yet identified the specific ships that will comprise the force structure in  the Pacific beyond 2012. Officials stated that operational plans will dictate  the number and type of vessels that will visit Guam, but those plans are  periodically adjusted due to changes in the global security environment.  As a result, Navy officials stated that they cannot yet develop requirements  for voyage ship repairs at Guam for 2012 and beyond.", "Similarly, the Marine Corps\u2019 plans for additional vessels in Guam have not  been finalized, but conceptual plans for relocating Marines from Okinawa  to Guam may include the home-porting of four new High-Speed Vessels  and two new Littoral Combat Ships at Guam. In addition to the possibility  of adding vessels, the Marine Corps\u2019 force relocation from Okinawa to  Guam is expected to result in visits by amphibious vessels home-ported in  Japan. These vessels are to deploy to Guam to support training exercises  for the Marines stationed on Guam, and they may generate demands for  voyage repairs during these operations.", "MSC also expects changes to its force structure operating near Guam, but  the timeline for these changes is uncertain. Current MSC vessels, such as  ammunition ships and combat stores ships, are expected to be replaced  by new dry cargo/ammunition ships on a one-for-one basis. MSC officials  believe that these new vessels will require less maintenance than the  vessels they replace, thus potentially reducing repair requirements. For  example, these vessels use new technology, including propulsion and  electrical systems that are thought to require less frequent maintenance  and different repair capabilities. Guam\u2019s first new dry cargo/ammunition  ship is to arrive on station sometime in 2008, but acquisition schedules for  additional such ships indicate deployment delays.

Nonetheless, the Navy has not used these records to forecast  estimated surface ship repair requirements for Guam beyond 2012.", "Further, extensive ship repair capabilities exist in other locations in the  Pacific, such as Pearl Harbor. Given that future ship repair capabilities on  Guam may need to support a larger number and different mix of ships, the  Navy could use ship repair data from Pearl Harbor and other strategic  forward-deployed locations\u2014such as the Navy Ship Repair Facility,  Yokosuka, Japan, and the facility that repairs the Navy amphibious ships  that support the Marine Corps at Sasebo, Japan\u2014to help it develop  estimated voyage repair forecasts for Guam.", "DOD guidance requires that maintenance programs be clearly linked to  strategic and contingency planning, and that a determination be made as  to whether a specific industrial capability is required to meet DOD needs.

Navy officials have stated that they do not intend to develop  plans for a voyage ship repair capability on Guam until preparations for  the 2012 budget cycle begin. However, in response to our inquiries, the  Navy identified four potential options for meeting future voyage ship  repair requirements on Guam and acknowledged that it cannot avoid  doing some voyage repairs there. First, the Navy could use existing Navy- owned voyage repair capabilities in Guam, though these face certain  limitations in their ability to take on additional voyage repairs. Second, fly- away teams could be brought in from Navy-owned shipyards in the United  States, and these teams would rely on facilities and infrastructure in place  on Guam.

First, the primary mission for the USS Frank  Cable is to provide maintenance and support for the three fast attack  submarines home-ported on Guam, and to address the needs of visiting  submarines. At the time of our review, the submarine tender\u2019s repair crew  was operating at full capacity in meeting its primary mission. As a result,  the Navy contracted with Guam Shipyard to complete $1.2 million in  voyage repairs on submarines between fiscal years 2002 and 2007, mostly  to provide additional manpower to augment the submarine tender\u2019s repair  crew. Although the Navy has not developed voyage repair plans for  surface ships, it has developed some plans for the provision of voyage and  other repairs for submarines. For example, current plans will require the  USS Frank Cable to provide support for the new guided missile submarine  that will visit Guam for rotational crewing. Additionally, the Navy plans to  use part of the repair crew from the USS Frank Cable to perform repair  services for the submarine tender USS Emory S. Land, which will be  stationed at Diego Garcia in the British Indian Ocean Territories. The  repair crew on the USS Frank Cable will be increased by about 170  personnel to enable about 160 to rotate for workload assignments on the  USS Emory S. Land, leaving no more than 10 repair personnel to take on  additional work. As a result, according to Navy officials, it is unlikely that  the USS Frank Cable could provide voyage repairs for surface vessels in  Guam in the future without adding capability and capacity beyond the 170  additional personnel already planned.", "Second, the Emergent Repair Facility on Guam that supports submarines  when the USS Frank Cable is away from port lacks the capability to meet  surface voyage repair requirements. This facility is used by a stay-behind  repair crew from the USS Frank Cable when that ship is away from its  home port. According to Navy officials, the Emergent Repair Facility is not  adequate even for its current role. Officials estimated that the Navy would  need about $21 million to expand and equip the facility just to meet its  current submarine mission requirements, without taking on additional  voyage repairs for surface ships. For example, the facility has no  communications capabilities; repair personnel must use personal cellular  telephones for any necessary communications. Navy officials acknowledge  that it would have to be expanded to meet any future surface voyage  repair requirements.

Given its unique  location and the changing circumstances that will impact voyage repair  requirements in and around that location, we continue to believe that a  specific assessment of requirements for providing surface vessel voyage  repairs in Guam represents a necessary baseline for planning for the  provision of ship repair capabilities beyond 2012 and for the selection of  an option or combination of options to provide those capabilities.", "In concurring with our second recommendation regarding the need for an  assessment of the benefits and limitations of each of the options for  providing repairs to ships operating near Guam, the department\u2019s response  was that the Navy has already identified a plan for providing repair  capabilities for ships operating near Guam and that the Navy has  determined that establishing a new repair facility on Guam is not viable  since the expenditure of funds to do this is not necessary. The  department\u2019s response also noted that the Navy is already developing a  military construction project to expand the existing repair capabilities on  Guam in fiscal year 2010, that the Navy intends to continue the practice of  utilizing repair teams from U.S. Naval shipyards and private shipyards as  needed, and that the Navy intends to continue the practice of contracting  voyage repair work to one or more private ship repair providers.  The  Navy may have determined that a new repair capability on Guam is not  necessary, but much of the existing repair equipment currently used to  support voyage repair on surface vessels\u2014including floating dry dock,  floating crane, and industrial equipment\u2014are owned by Guam Shipyard  and could potentially be removed at the conclusion of the existing lease, if  a new lease were not negotiated. We continue to believe that it is essential  that the department determine whether it will have continued need for  expensive capital equipment such as the floating dry dock and crane, and  whether the capability provided by such equipment will be available from  the private sector. Finally, it is commendable that the Navy has a plan for  providing ship repair capabilities on Guam and is moving forward to  implement it. However, at the time of our exit briefing with the Navy in  January, the Navy did not inform us of this plan. Moreover, Navy officials  have told us that this plan was developed in February, subsequent to our  exit briefing and in response to our recommendations.", "In concurring with our third recommendation regarding selection of the  best option or combination of options for providing repair capabilities to  support surface ships operating near Guam, the department stated again  that the Navy\u2019s plan for providing repair capabilities to support surface  ships operating near Guam has already been determined, and that  direction from the Secretary of Defense to the Secretary of the Navy is not  needed. The response also stated that committing the Navy to a lease  agreement in 2008 for a capability in 2012 is premature. While we agree  that committing the Navy to a lease in 2008 for a capability required in  2012 is premature, it is not premature to decide whether or not there will  be an industrial activity\u2014either owned and operated by the government or  leased by a private contractor\u2014within the Navy installation. The  department stated in its response that the Navy intends to use private- sector capability, but it did not state whether that would be on the Navy  installation on Guam. Given the detailed planning that is required to  support the planned buildup of military personnel expected over the next  few years in Guam, we believe it is essential that the Navy determine  whether or not it expects to continue to have an industrial activity  operating as a part of the Guam Master Plan, and that it determine what  acreage this activity would occupy.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Secretary of the Navy; the  Commandant of the Marine Corps; and the Director of the Office of  Management and Budget.", "If you or your staff has any questions about this report, please contact me  on (202) 512-4523 or at leporeb@gao.gov.

We also performed  work at the offices of several private ship repair providers to determine  the extent to which private-sector repair capabilities may be available on  Guam in the future. We also examined Department of Defense (DOD)  policy and Joint Guidance for providing maintenance and repair of DOD  assets afloat.
