U.S. workers and firms must now  succeed in a world of fast-paced technological change and constantly  evolving global competition. This raises two sets of questions about the  corporate income tax. The first is about reforming the overall U.S. tax  system and perhaps changing the role of corporate taxes. The second set  of questions is about how to administer and enforce the existing corporate  income tax in a changing world.

It also includes net income that  corporations earn in the form of interest, dividends, rent, royalties, and  realized capital gains. The statutory rate of tax on net corporate income  ranges from 15 to 35 percent, depending on the amount of income earned.", "The United States taxes the worldwide income of domestic corporations,  regardless of where the income is earned, with a foreign tax credit for  certain taxes paid to other countries. However, the timing of the tax  liability depends on several factors, including whether the income is from  a U.S. or foreign source and, if it is from a foreign source, whether it is  earned through direct operations or through a subsidiary.", "Statutory and effective tax rates are not necessarily the same. An effective  tax rate, which is often lower\u2014even substantially lower\u2014than the  statutory rate, measures the amount of tax that a corporation actually pays  on a dollar of its economic income, when all aspects of the tax  (deductions, credits, deferrals, etc.) are taken into account. Statutory and  effective rates may differ, for example, because depreciation allowances  for specific types of capital investments exceed (or fall short of) the true  (economic) depreciation. Other differences arise because income from  foreign subsidiaries is generally not taxed until it is repatriated to the  United States. Special incentives, such as the research tax credit, that are  designed to encourage certain behavior, also cause the effective rate of the  tax to differ from its statutory rate. A recent Congressional Budget Office  (CBO) study found that the United States\u2019 statutory corporate tax rates are  high relative to Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  (OECD) countries but comparable with the rates for what were then the G- 7 countries. Comparisons of effective rates depend on the type of  investment and the type of financing. According to CBO, U.S. effective  corporate tax rates in 2003 were the G-7 median for equity-financed  investments in machinery, second lowest for debt-financed investment in  machinery, and second highest for equity-financed investment in industrial  structures.", "Differences in effective tax rates across types and sources of income are  pervasive, reflecting the complexity of the tax code. The corporate income  tax (1) reduces the after tax return on capital income and, therefore,  affects the incentive individuals have to save and invest; (2) taxes  corporations differently than partnerships and sole proprietorships; (3)  taxes U.S. corporations operating in foreign countries differently than  those operating domestically and differently than foreign governments tax  corporations; (4) taxes different types of corporate investments, such as  machinery or structures, unevenly; and (5) taxes debt-financed investment  at lower rates than equity-financed investment. These differences in  effective tax rates alter both investment decisions and the reporting of  corporate income as firms try to minimize their taxes. Such tax avoidance,  much of it legal but some illegal, reduces tax revenue. Guiding investments  to lightly taxed activities rather than those with high before tax  productivity may reduce economic growth, further reducing tax revenue  from what it otherwise would have been."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corporate Income Taxes Are a Significant Source of Federal Revenue and Must Be Part of the Overall Considerations for Fiscal Reform", "paragraphs": ["At about $277 billion, corporate income taxes are far smaller than the $841  billion in social insurance taxes and $998 billion in individual income taxes  that OMB estimates will be paid in fiscal year 2006 to fund the federal  government.

Tax  experts have written that corporate tax revenues fell from the 1960s to the  early 1980s for several reasons. For example, corporate income became a  smaller share of national income during these years, partly due to the fact  that corporate debt, and therefore deductible interest payments, increased  relative to corporate equity, reducing the tax base. In addition, tax  expenditures, such as more generous depreciation rules and corporate tax  rate reductions lowered corporate taxes. Since the early 1980s corporate  tax revenues have fluctuated in a narrower range, reflecting changes in  corporate profits, tax laws, and other factors.", "Since the early 1980s the corporate tax has accounted for from about 6 to  13 percent of federal revenue, as shown in figure 2. Consequently,  although not the largest, it remains an important source of federal  revenue. Relative to the gross domestic product (GDP), the corporate tax  has ranged from a little over 1 percent to just under 2.5 percent during  those same years. CBO has recently projected that despite the recent  uptick, corporate tax revenue for the next 10 years as a percentage of GDP  is expected to stay within this same range.", "Corporate tax revenues of the magnitude shown in figure 2 make them  relevant to considerations about how to address the nation\u2019s long-term  fiscal imbalance. Over the long term, the United States faces a large and  growing structural budget deficit primarily caused by demographic trends  and rising health care costs as shown in figure 3, and exacerbated over  time by growing interest on the ever larger federal debt. Continuing on this  imprudent and unsustainable fiscal path will gradually erode, if not  suddenly damage, our economy, our standard of living, and ultimately our  national security.", "We cannot grow our way out of this long-term fiscal challenge because the  imbalance between spending and revenue is so large. We will need to  make tough choices using a multipronged approach: (1) revise budget  processes and financial reporting requirements; (2) restructure entitlement  programs; (3) reexamine the base of discretionary spending and other  spending; and (4) review and revise tax policy, including tax expenditures,  and tax enforcement programs. Corporate tax policy, corporate tax  expenditures, and corporate tax enforcement need to be part of the overall  tax review because of the amount of revenue at stake.", "Corporate tax expenditures reduce the revenue that would otherwise be  raised from the corporate income tax. As already noted, to reduce their  tax liabilities, corporations can take advantage of preferential provisions  in the tax code, such as exclusions, exemptions, deductions, credits,  preferential rates, and deferral of tax liability. Tax preferences\u2014which are  legally known as tax expenditures\u2014are often aimed at policy goals similar  to those of federal spending programs. For example, there are different tax  expenditures intended to encourage economic development in  disadvantaged areas and stimulate research and development, while there  are also federal spending programs that have similar purposes. Also, by  narrowing the tax base, corporate tax expenditures have the effect of  raising either corporate tax rates or the rates on other taxpayers in order  to generate a given amount of revenue.", "The sum of estimated forgone revenue for the federal government because  of corporate tax expenditures was $80 billion for fiscal year 2005. In its  most recent report, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) listed 27  tax expenditures for corporate taxpayers only and another 52 provisions  available to both corporations and other businesses. As of fiscal year 2005,  the two largest tax expenditures used by corporations were the  accelerated depreciation of machinery and equipment ($15.9 billion) and  the deferral of income of controlled foreign corporations ($10.5 billion);  these two accounted for a third of the sum of corporate revenue losses  estimated by Treasury.", "We reported in September 2005 that the effectiveness of many tax  expenditures is not subject to a level of review similar to that of programs  that spend money directly. Although some corporate income tax  expenditures are reviewed by government agencies, academics, and  others, all should be reviewed periodically to ensure they have not  outlived their usefulness, are not redundant, or are not inefficient in  accomplishing their intended purpose. In that report, we recommended  that the OMB and Treasury take steps to ensure regular reexamination of  tax expenditures, including the corporate provisions. OMB disagreed with  the recommendations, citing methodological and conceptual issues. Our  report discusses in detail the issues that OMB raised and why we continue  to believe that our recommendations are valid. Also, as far back as 1994,  we have suggested that Congress should review these tax expenditures,  considering such things as how well the corporate tax expenditures are  achieving their purposes and whether they should remain, given the  potential benefits of a simpler corporate tax code, possibly with reduced  tax rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opportunities Exist to Improve Corporate Tax Compliance", "paragraphs": ["Ensuring corporate income tax compliance is challenging because much  corporate tax avoidance is legal and the true tax liability for large  corporations is difficult to determine.

Tax avoidance has become such a  concern that some tax experts say corporate tax departments have  become \u201cprofit centers\u201d as corporations seek to take advantage of the tax  laws in order to maximize shareholder value. Some corporate tax  avoidance is clearly legal, some falls in gray areas of the tax code, and  some is clearly noncompliance or illegal. Tax code simplification has the  potential to reduce at least some of this avoidance.", "Often corporate tax avoidance is legal. For example, multinational  corporations can locate active trade or business operations in jurisdictions  that have lower effective tax rates than does the United States and, unless  and until they repatriate the income, defer taxation in the United States on  that income, thus reducing their effective tax rate. Similarly, making  investments that qualify for accelerated depreciation can lower a  corporation\u2019s current effective tax rate, although in the future its rate  would be higher.", "Corporate tax planners may find legal ways to exploit tax code complexity  to play one provision of the code off another in ways that Congress never  intended. In response, Congress has sometimes acted to address what it  considered to be abusive tax shelters. For example, the American Jobs  Creation Act of 2004 limited the tax benefits of leasing transactions  involving tax-exempt entities, such as transit authorities. One type of  transaction the act limited was the sale-in/lease-out (SILO) arrangement,  which involved a taxable entity buying assets, such as railcars, from a tax- exempt entity, for example, a metropolitan transit system, and leasing  them back to the tax-exempt entity. The estimated revenue gain from the  2004 act\u2019s provision covering leasing transactions with tax-indifferent  parties was about $26.6 billion for 2005 through 2014.", "Complicating corporate tax compliance is the fact that in many cases the  law is unclear or subject to differing interpretations. In fact, some have  postulated that major corporations\u2019 tax returns are actually just the  opening bid in an extended negotiation with IRS to determine a  corporation\u2019s tax liability. An illustration is transfer pricing. Transfer  pricing involves setting the appropriate price for such things as goods,  services, or intangible property (such as patents, trademarks, copyrights,  technology, or \u201cknow-how\u201d) that is transferred between the U.S.-based  operations of a multinational company and a foreign affiliate. If the price  paid by the affiliate to the U.S. operation is understated, the profits of the  U.S. operation are reduced and U.S. taxable income is inappropriately  reduced or eliminated. The standard for judging the correct price is the  price that would have been paid between independent enterprises acting  at \u201carm\u2019s length.\u201d However, it can be extremely difficult to establish what  an arm\u2019s length price would be. Given the global economy and the number  of multinational firms with some U.S.-based operations, opportunities for  transfer pricing disputes are likely to grow.", "Tax shelters are one example of how tax avoidance, including corporate  tax avoidance, can shade into the illegal. Some tax shelters are legal  though perhaps aggressive interpretations of the law, but others cross the  line. In a 2003 testimony, we reported that IRS had identified 27 kinds of  abusive shelter transactions\u2014called listed transactions\u2014promoted to  corporations and others. As of June 2006, IRS\u2019s web site lists 31 such listed  transactions. IRS also had a number of other transactions that had to be  reported to IRS and may have had some characteristics of abusive shelters  but were not, and possibly never would be, listed.", "Abusive shelters often are complex transactions that manipulate many  parts of the tax code or regulations and are typically buried among  legitimate transactions reported on tax returns. Because these  transactions are often composed of many pieces located in several parts of  a complex tax return, they are essentially hidden from plain sight, which  contributes to the difficulty of determining the scope of the abusive shelter  problem. Often lacking economic substance or a business purpose other  than generating tax benefits, abusive shelters have been promoted by  some tax professionals, often in confidence, for significant fees,  sometimes with the participation of tax-indifferent parties, such as foreign  or tax-exempt entities. These shelters may involve unnecessary steps and  flow-through entities, such as partnerships, which make detection of these  transactions more difficult.", "For example, a company had a sizable gain from the sale of a subsidiary  and wanted to avoid or minimize paying tax on the gain. An investment  bank proposed forming an offshore partnership with a foreign corporation  (a tax-indifferent party) for the express purpose of sheltering the capital  gains of its corporate client. The partnership purchased and quickly resold  notes in a contingent installment sale transaction. The partnership earned  a large capital gain, most of which it allocated to the foreign corporate  partner. Later, related losses were allocated to the U.S. corporation,  generating approximately $100 million in capital loss for the investment  bank\u2019s client. The corporation used this capital loss to shelter its U.S.- based capital gains. Both the Tax Court and the Third Circuit Court of  Appeals ruled that the transaction lacked economic substance. The Third  Circuit, in addition to requiring economic substance, held that a  transaction must have a subjective nontax business motive to be respected  for tax purposes. For this transaction, the investment bank was to earn a  fee of $2 million.", "In part because tax shelters are intentionally hidden, IRS has not been able  to produce a reliable estimate of the revenues lost because of shelters. As  we reported in October 2003, one estimate, which had a number of  methodological limitations, suggested an average annual tax gap because  of tax shelters (both corporate and individual) that could have been from  about $11.6 billion to about $15.1 billion for the years 1993 through 1999.  Because the methodological limitations were serious, the true amount of  the revenue loss could be lower or higher than this range. Furthermore,  this estimate does not cover non-abusive tax shelters.", "Establishing a presence in a low-tax country is another technique for  avoiding corporate income tax. Some low-tax countries are called tax  havens. The company\u2019s presence in a tax haven in some cases may be  nominal, nothing more than a file in an office. Use of a tax haven can be  questionable when combined with abusive transfer pricing or techniques,  such as interest stripping, to artificially shift income to the tax haven. In  several reports since 2002, we reported on federal contractors\u2019 use of tax  havens. We reported that 4 of the top 100 federal contractors that were  publicly traded corporations in 2001 were located in tax havens and that 3  of these were originally U.S.-headquartered corporations. Later, we  reported that large tax haven contractors in both 2000 and 2001 had a tax  cost advantage compared to large domestic contractors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS\u2019s Incomplete and Dated Estimates of Corporate Tax Noncompliance Can Be Improved", "paragraphs": ["In large part because of the complexity and uncertainty in the application  of tax laws, the actual level of corporate income tax noncompliance  (illegal tax avoidance) is poorly understood. IRS estimates a corporate tax  gap in the tens of billions of dollars, but also acknowledges that this  estimate is not based on robust, recent, and reliable research.", "As noted above, IRS\u2019s published estimate of the corporate tax gap\u2014the  difference between what corporations pay voluntarily and on time in taxes  and what they are required to pay under the law\u2014is $32 billion for tax  year 2001. This is out of an overall gross tax gap of $345 billion for that  year. Underreporting of income was the largest component of the  corporate tax gap, contributing an estimated $30 billion. The IRS estimate  included both small corporations (those reporting assets of $10 million or  less) and large corporations (those reporting assets of over $10 million).  Underpayment of taxes due accounted for $2 billion of the corporate tax  gap for tax year 2001. IRS has no estimate for nonfiling of corporate  income tax returns for tax year 2001.", "However, the available tax gap estimates are highly uncertain and  incomplete. IRS has not systematically measured the level of compliance  for large corporations, and the last measure of noncompliance for small  corporations was from the 1980s. IRS\u2019s level of certainty with regard to the  accuracy of the corporate tax gap estimate is low for reasons such as use  of incomplete and old data, interpretation of complex laws, and resource  constraints. The 2001 estimate used data from the 1970s and 1980s to  estimate underreporting of corporate income taxes. For large corporate  income tax underreporting, IRS based its estimate on the amount of tax  recommended from operational examinations. As we reported in July  2005, according to IRS officials, IRS relies on the amount of tax  recommended because it is difficult to determine the true tax liability of  large corporations because of complex and ambiguous tax laws that  create opportunities for differing interpretations and that complicate the  determination. Because these examinations do not cover all firms and do  not test all items on a tax return, the estimate produced from the  examinations is incomplete. IRS officials also explained that because of  these complexities and the costs and burdens of collecting complete and  accurate data, IRS has not systematically measured large corporation tax  compliance through statistically valid studies.", "As of June of this year, IRS did not have approved plans to update the  corporate tax gap estimate. Although measuring corporate tax compliance  can be challenging and costly, such compliance data aid in identifying new  or growing types of noncompliance, identifying changes in tax laws and  regulations that may improve compliance, more effectively targeting  examinations of tax returns, understanding the effectiveness of its  programs to promote and enforce compliance, and properly determining  its resource needs and allocations. In order to improve efforts to reduce  the tax gap, we have recommended that IRS develop plans to periodically  measure tax compliance for areas that have been measured, and study  ways to cost effectively measure compliance for other components of the  tax gap that have not been measured, such as excise taxes and corporate  taxes. IRS agreed with our recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Has Strengthened Corporate Tax Compliance Efforts, but Continued Oversight Will Be Warranted", "paragraphs": ["IRS has recently increased the number of corporate audits and  recommended tax assessments.

IRS notes,  not surprisingly, that a large portion of the recommended taxes were not  agreed to by the corporations. In the past, we found that under IRS\u2019s  examination program of the nation\u2019s largest corporations, the amount of  taxes IRS actually assessed has been about 20 percent of the amount  initially recommended during examinations. Further, the amounts  assessed often are not ultimately collected after cases are reviewed in  IRS\u2019s Appeals function or in the courts. Because the various review and  appeal options can be time consuming, it may be a number of years before  actual collection occurs on some cases.", "The shelter-related results come from IRS\u2019s multiyear effort to attack tax  shelters. In 2003 we reported that IRS had shifted resources to create a  broad-based strategy to combat what it considered to be a high priority  challenge\u2014abusive tax shelters. IRS had adopted a broad-based strategy  for addressing abusive shelters, including  targeting promoters to head off the proliferation of shelters;    making efforts to deter, detect, and resolve abuse;    offering inducements to businesses to disclose their use of  questionable tax practices; and    using performance indicators to measure outputs and some outcomes  and intending to go down the path it had started and develop long-term  performance goals and measures linked to those goals. We said that  without these latter elements, Congress would find gauging IRS\u2019s  progress difficult.", "In addition to examinations, IRS has undertaken a number of initiatives to  address corporate tax compliance. Some of these initiatives are intended  to resolve tax issues beyond the examination process. The Advance  Pricing Agreement (APA) program, the Fast Track Settlement program,  the Pre-Filing Agreement program, and the Industry Issue Resolution  program all work to some degree to resolve contentious tax issues outside  of the examination process. For example, the APA program is intended to  address transfer pricing issues up front so that they do not arise during  subsequent examinations.", "IRS has also been revising the corporate tax examination process. For  instance, IRS reports that it has shortened the cycle time of examinations.  According to IRS, reducing cycle time allows IRS to examine additional  taxpayers and reduces administrative burdens on taxpayers. Similarly,  IRS\u2019s Limited Issue Focused Examination process seeks to have IRS and  corporations reach a formal agreement to govern key aspects of the  examination.", "Future success in following through on these initiatives will require  replenishment of IRS\u2019s staff, which could be challenging given the  increasing numbers of key employees who are eligible for retirement or  who are otherwise leaving key occupations. The Large and Mid-Size  Business Division (LMSB), which is responsible for the compliance of the  largest corporations, reported in its fiscal year 2006 strategic assessment  that it will continue to lose substantial experience as revenue agents leave.  The Small Business and Self Employed Division, which covers the rest of  corporations, also has growing numbers of employees eligible for  retirement or leaving their enforcement positions. Although hiring to fill  positions is occurring, past experience suggests that training these new  employees and giving them on-the-job experience will take time and likely  adversely affect the divisions\u2019 overall productivity to some extent. The  Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration has designated  managing human capital a management and performance challenge for  IRS.", "In part because IRS does not have a reliable measure of corporate tax  compliance, it will be challenged to demonstrate the effectiveness of the  increased audits and the various initiatives it has undertaken. The  effectiveness of IRS\u2019s efforts will depend on the extent to which the taxes  recommended are actually collected given past data showing that a  relatively small portion of recommended assessments is ultimately  collected.

In February 2004, we reported that some Department of Defense (DOD)  contractors abuse the federal tax system with little consequence.

Misreporting such  income contributes to the annual tax gap, which is the gap between tax  amounts that taxpayers should pay under the law and do pay voluntarily  and on time. For tax year 2001, the IRS estimated a gross tax gap of $345  billion, of which at least $11 billion is attributed to individual taxpayers  who misreported their income from capital gains or losses. Taxpayers are  to determine their capital gains or losses by subtracting the \u201cbasis\u201d  amount, which is generally the cost for an asset, from the gross proceeds  amount when selling the asset.", "For tax year 2001, an estimated 36 percent (over 7 million) of  individual taxpayers who sold securities misreported capital gains or  losses. Using the wrong cost basis for the securities was a primary type  of noncompliance leading to this misreported income. About two-thirds  of the misreporting taxpayers understated gains or overstated losses,  while about one-third overstated gains or understated losses.  Additionally, a few taxpayers with securities sales misreported whether  their gains or losses were short-term or long-term.", "IRS attempts to address misreported securities sales\u2019 income through  enforcement and taxpayer service programs, which are to find  noncompliance or help taxpayers comply voluntarily. Various  challenges limit the impact of these programs, such as that IRS  enforcement programs contact relatively few taxpayers and the lack of  cost basis information impedes efficient use of IRS\u2019s enforcement  resources. IRS also faces difficulties in ensuring that taxpayers  understand their obligations for determining and reporting their capital  gains and losses.", "Expanding information reporting to taxpayers and IRS on securities  sales to include cost basis has potential to improve taxpayer voluntary  compliance and help IRS verify securities gains or losses. Basis  reporting would raise challenges, many of which can be mitigated to  some extent. For example, broker costs would increase but could be  constrained by limiting the scope of any reporting requirement and by  building on the basis reporting to taxpayers that many brokers already  do. For example, reporting basis for only future purchases would  mitigate challenges when brokers do not know the basis for securities  purchased in the past. To the extent that actions to mitigate the  challenges to basis reporting delay its implementation or limit coverage  to only certain types of securities, the resulting improvements to  taxpayers\u2019 voluntary reporting compliance would be somewhat  constrained. IRS\u2019s broad authority to require information reporting for  securities sales may not be enough to require all the actions necessary  to implement cost basis reporting and mitigate the challenges.", "Based on these results, our report includes matters that Congress may  want to consider, including requiring brokers to report to both taxpayers  and IRS the adjusted basis of sold securities and ensuring that IRS has  sufficient authority to implement the requirement. Congress could also  require brokers to report whether the securities sold were short- or long- term and IRS to work with brokers to develop rules that mitigate the  challenges. Further, we recommend that IRS modify the instructions for  the individual tax return to (1) clarify the appropriate use of capital losses  to offset capital gains or other income and (2) provide guidance on  resources available to taxpayers to determine basis. IRS agreed with our  recommendations.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
