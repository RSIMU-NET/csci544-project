Some DHS components have programs that focus on chemical defense, such as the Science and Technology Directorate's (S&T) chemical hazard characterization. Others have chemical defense responsibilities as part of their broader missions, such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which interdicts chemical agents at the border. DHS recently consolidated some chemical defense programs and activities into a new Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Office.", "However, GAO found and DHS officials acknowledged that DHS has not fully integrated and coordinated its chemical defense programs and activities. Several components\u2014including CBP, U.S. Coast Guard, the Office of Health Affairs, and S&T\u2014have conducted similar activities, such as acquiring chemical detectors or assisting local jurisdictions with preparedness, separately, without DHS-wide direction and coordination. As components carry out chemical defense activities to meet mission needs, there is a risk that DHS may miss an opportunity to leverage resources and share information that could lead to greater effectiveness addressing chemical threats. It is too early to tell the extent to which the new CWMD Office will enhance the integration of DHS's chemical defense programs and activities. Given the breadth of DHS's chemical defense responsibilities, a strategy and implementation plan would help the CWMD Office (1) mitigate the risk of fragmentation among DHS programs and activities, and (2) establish goals and identify resources to achieve these goals, consistent with the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010. This would also be consistent with a 2012 DHS effort, since abandoned, to develop a strategy and implementation plan for all chemical defense activities, from prevention to recovery. DHS officials stated the 2012 effort was not completed because of leadership changes and competing priorities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Assistant Secretary for the CWMD Office develop a strategy and implementation plan to help DHS guide, support, integrate, and coordinate chemical defense programs and activities.

Donovan, Jr.  Chairman  Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and  Communications  Committee on Homeland Security  House of Representatives  Recent chemical attacks in Malaysia and Syria, a thwarted chemical  attack in Australia, and the threat of using chemical weapons against the  West by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) have sparked concerns  about the potential for chemical attacks occurring in the United States. In  March 2017, an exiled relative of the leader of North Korea was killed in  Malaysia after he was allegedly exposed to the chemical nerve agent VX.  In April 2017, a chemical attack in Syria using the nerve agent sarin killed  approximately 100 people and injured hundreds more. In July 2017,  Australian police foiled an alleged terrorist plot to bring down a plane by  using a device that would have generated an explosion and released a  toxic gas inside the plane. Similarly, according to Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) officials, ISIS has become increasingly  interested in conducting and inspiring chemical attacks in the West, with  the goal of increasing fear, enhancing the lethal nature of attacks, and  adding greater complexity into response efforts.", "According to the National Academies and DHS, chemical attacks involve  releasing toxic chemicals with the intent to do harm. In addition,  according to DHS, ISIS-inspired homegrown extremists or other domestic  actors who choose to pursue chemical attacks could use toxic chemicals  and crude methods to release them, such as releasing toxic gases from a  pressurized tank by breaching the tank with an improvised explosive  device. For example, facilities containing toxic chemicals or the trucks,  vessels, or rail cars used to transport these chemicals could be attacked  to cause a chemical release. Toxic chemicals that could be used in an  attack include industrial and commercial chemicals, such as chlorine or  ammonia, and chemical toxins of biological origin, such as ricin.", "DHS has a number of chemical defense responsibilities, programs, and  activities spread across its various components. They include, for  example, being responsible for managing domestic chemical incidents;  developing and implementing chemical detection technology; providing  chemical preparedness guidance and support to state, local, territorial,  and tribal partners; and regulating and supporting the security of facilities  that use or store certain chemicals. DHS\u2019s efforts to address a terrorist  chemical attack involve a wide range of components including the  Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Office, the National  Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), the Science and  Technology Directorate (S&T), the Federal Emergency Management  Agency (FEMA), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the  Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and the U.S. Coast Guard.", "In light of the range of DHS components involved in chemical defense  and concerns that some terrorist organizations have threatened to use  chemical agents to attack the United States, you asked us to examine  DHS\u2019 chemical defense efforts and whether these programs and activities  are positioned to address the threat of chemical terrorism. This report  examines (1) DHS programs and activities to prevent and protect against  domestic chemical attacks and (2) the extent to which DHS has  integrated and coordinated all of its chemical defense programs and  activities.", "To meet our two objectives, we reviewed and discussed with DHS  officials relevant legislation, presidential directives, and DHS  documentation to understand DHS\u2019s responsibilities related to domestic  chemical defense. We reviewed, among others, the Homeland Security  Act of 2002; the DHS Appropriations Act, 2007; the Protecting and  Securing Chemical Facilities from Terrorist Attacks Act of 2014; the 2007  Homeland Security Presidential Directive on domestic chemical defense;  the 2003 Homeland Security Presidential Directive on management of  domestic incidents; the 2011 Presidential Policy Directive on national  preparedness; the 2007 Homeland Security Presidential Directive on  medical countermeasures against weapons of mass destruction; the 2013  Presidential Policy Directive on critical infrastructure security and  resilience; the 2004 Homeland Security Presidential Directive on defense  of U.S. agriculture and food; the 2014 DHS Quadrennial Homeland  Security Review; the Fiscal Years 2014\u20132018 DHS Strategic Plan; the  2013 DHS National Infrastructure Protection Plan; and the 2016 DHS  National Response Framework.", "To identify the programs and activities that DHS has to prevent and  protect against chemical attacks, we reviewed DHS documentation and  interviewed DHS officials.

Also, we reviewed documentation provided by DHS and  interviewed officials from the following components: the Office of Health  Affairs (OHA), S&T, NPPD, FEMA, CBP, TSA, the Office of Intelligence  and Analysis, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Secret Service. For  example, we reviewed documentation and interviewed officials from  OHA\u2019s Chemical Defense Program about chemical defense  demonstration projects it conducted from fiscal year 2009 through fiscal  year 2017 in five jurisdictions: Baltimore, Maryland; Boise, Idaho;  Houston, Texas; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Nassau County, New York.  We also reviewed documentation and interviewed officials from S&T\u2019s Chemical and Biological Defense Division on its chemical detection work  conducted in 2016 and 2017 in New York and New Jersey. In addition,  we reviewed documentation and interviewed officials from S&T\u2019s  Chemical Security Analysis Center on its work analyzing chemical threats  and risks, such as the Chemical Terrorism Risk Assessment, which is  used to determine the risk associated with different terrorist scenarios and  to assess how proposed measures might reduce that risk. Further, we  reviewed documentation and interviewed officials from NPPD\u2019s  Infrastructure Security Compliance Division on its Chemical Facility Anti- Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program, which regulates security at  certain chemical facilities, and reviewed our related body of work,  including recent reports. Moreover, we reviewed documentation and  interviewed officials from NPPD\u2019s Office of Infrastructure Protection on its  Sector Outreach and Programs Division (SOPD) that represents DHS as  the sector-specific agency for the chemical sector and works in  conjunction with other NPPD divisions to assure the security of the  chemical sector. In addition, we reviewed documentation and  interviewed officials representing NPPD\u2019s Federal Protective Service.  Moreover, we reviewed documentation and interviewed officials from the  new CWMD Office on its efforts to consolidate some of DHS\u2019s chemical,  biological, radiological, and nuclear programs, including the status of  initial steps to establish the office\u2019s mission, integrated strategic goals,  structure, plans, processes, and procedures.", "To assess the extent to which DHS has integrated and coordinated all of  its chemical defense programs and activities, we reviewed DHS  documentation and interviewed DHS officials on the department\u2019s efforts.

In so doing, we reviewed the 2012 DHS strategy  for responding to and recovering from a chemical attack, which the  department approved for limited departmental use and distribution. In  addition, we examined the extent of DHS\u2019s efforts to integrate and  coordinate its chemical defense programs and activities relative to the  laws and presidential directives cited above that set forth DHS  responsibilities regarding chemical defense, national preparedness, and  critical infrastructure protection, and the DHS chemical response and  recovery strategy and other planning documents cited above.

These were the Office of Health Affairs\u2019  (OHA) Chemical Defense Program; the Science and Technology  Directorate\u2019s (S&T) Chemical and Biological Defense Division and  Chemical Security Analysis Center (CSAC); and the National Protection  and Programs Directorate\u2019s (NPPD) Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism  Standards (CFATS) program and Sector Outreach and Programs  Division. Each component had dedicated funding to manage the  particular chemical defense program or activity (with the exception of the  Sector Outreach and Programs Division because this division funds DHS  activities related to all critical infrastructure sectors, including the chemical  sector). On December 7, 2017, DHS established the Countering  Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Office, which incorporated most  of OHA and selected elements of S&T, together with other DHS programs  and activities related to countering chemical, biological, radiological, and  nuclear threats. According to DHS, the CWMD Office was created to,  among other things, elevate and streamline DHS\u2019s efforts to prevent  terrorists and other national security threat actors from using harmful  agents, such as chemical agents, to harm Americans and U.S. interests."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Office of Health Affairs, Chemical Defense Program", "paragraphs": ["OHA, which was subsumed by the CWMD Office in December 2017, was  responsible for enhancing federal, state, and local risk awareness and  planning and response mechanisms in the event of a chemical incident  through the Chemical Defense Program. This program provided medical  and technical expertise to OHA leadership and chemical defense  stakeholders including DHS leadership, DHS components, the  intelligence community, federal interagency partners, and professional  and academic preparedness organizations. The program\u2019s efforts focused  on optimizing local preparedness and response to chemical incidents that  exceed the local communities\u2019 capacity and capability to act during the  first critical hours by providing guidance and tools for first responders and  supporting chemical exercises for preparedness. DHS\u2019s Chief Medical  Officer was responsible for managing OHA.", "The Chemical Defense Program expended about $8.3 million between  fiscal years 2009 and 2017 in chemical demonstration projects and  follow-on funding to assist five jurisdictions in their chemical  preparedness: Baltimore, Maryland; Boise, Idaho; Houston, Texas; New  Orleans, Louisiana; and Nassau County, New York. For example, in  Baltimore, OHA assisted the Maryland Transit Administration with the  selection and installation of chemical detection equipment to integrate  new technology into community emergency response and planning. In the  other four locales, OHA assisted these partners in conducting multiple  scenarios specific to each city based on high-risk factors identified by the  Chemical Terrorism Risk Assessment (CTRA), which is a risk  assessment produced by CSAC every 2 years. Such scenarios included  indoor and outdoor scenarios in which persons were \u201cexposed\u201d to either  an inhalant or a substance on their skin. Figure 4 summarizes the  scenarios conducted in each city and some of the lessons learned.", "According to OHA summary documentation, a key finding from this work  was that timely decisions and actions save lives and manage resources in  response to a chemical incident. Since the completion of the five-city  project, OHA has been working to, among other things, continue to  develop a lessons learned document based on the project, as well as a  related concept of operations, that state and local jurisdictions could use  to respond to chemical incidents.", "As of December 7, 2017, OHA was consolidated into the CWMD Office  and its functions transferred to the new office, according to officials from  the CWMD Office.

CSAC is responsible for producing, among  other things, the CTRA, a comprehensive evaluation of the risks  associated with domestic toxic chemical releases produced every 2  years. CSAC officials chair the Interagency Chemical Risk Assessment  Working Group that meets to develop the CTRA, identify chemical  hazards, and produce a list of priority chemicals. This working group is  comprised of DHS components, federal partners, and private industry  officials that share industry information to ensure accurate and timely  threat and risk information is included in the CTRA. To complement the  CTRA, CSAC developed a standalone CTRA desktop tool that DHS  components can use to conduct risk-based modeling of a potential  chemical attack and provide results to DHS components, such as the  U.S. Secret Service, for advance planning of large-scale events.", "In addition, CSAC conducts tailored risk assessments addressing  emerging threats such as fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that has caused  numerous deaths across the United States. CSAC sends these  assessments, along with other intelligence and threat information, to  relevant DHS components, federal agencies, state and local partners,  and private entities so this information can be used in planning and  decision making. Officials from eight DHS components we spoke with  said they use CSAC information in their work and that CSAC products are  useful.", "CSAC conducted two exercises, known as Jack Rabbit I and II, to  experimentally characterize the effects of a large-scale chemical release  and to understand the reason for the differences seen between real-world  events and modeling predictions. These exercises were intended to  strengthen industry standards in chemical transportation, as well as  response and recovery plans. Outputs and data from these exercises  have been used to write first responder guidelines for these types of  events and are being taught in nationwide fire and hazmat courses. The  fiscal year 2018 President\u2019s Budget request did not ask for an  appropriation to fund CSAC. However, the Consolidated Appropriations  Act, 2018, did provide funding for CSAC.

CFATS program officials said they also use CSAC  data as part of the process for making decisions about which facilities  should be covered by CFATS, and their level of risk. If CFATS officials  make a determination that a facility is high-risk, the facility must submit a  vulnerability assessment and a site security plan or an alternative security  program for DHS approval that includes security measures to meet risk- based performance standards. We previously reported on various  aspects of the CFATS program and identified challenges that DHS was  experiencing in implementing and managing the program. We made a  number of recommendations to strengthen the program to include, among  other things, that DHS verify that certain data reported by facilities is  accurate, enhance its risk assessment approach to incorporate all  elements of risk, conduct a peer review of the program to validate and  verify DHS\u2019s risk assessment approach, and document processes and  procedures for managing compliance with site security plans.
