The Department of Commerce's EDA administers the $15.8 million program through 11 TAA Centers throughout the United States. In 2009, the Trade and Globalization Adjustment Assistance Act, as part of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, amended the TAA for Firms program and mandated that GAO review its operation and effectiveness.

The changes resulted in reduced time to certify firms, new performance reporting, and increased participation. For example, officials told GAO that creating a director position and other full-time positions for the program reduced time to certify firms. In fulfilling new reporting requirements, the Economic Development Administration (EDA) collected information on performance measures and issued three annual reports. Also, EDA certified 26 services firms not previously eligible, as well as 32 additional firms based on more flexible certification requirements to demonstrate trade impacts. Although EDA increased the number of certified petitions and approved business recovery plans from fiscal years 2008 through 2010, the lapse in the legislative changes from February to October 2011 and uncertainty about program funding contributed to a decline in certified petitions and approved plans in fiscal year 2011.", "EDA's performance measures and data collection for the TAA for Firms program provide limited information about the program's outcomes, although GAO's economic analysis found that participation in the program is statistically associated with an increase in firm sales. EDA collects data to report on 16 measures to gauge the program's performance, such as the number of firms that inquired about the program and the number of petitions filed, but most of these measures do not assess program outcomes. EDA is exploring better ways to assess the effect of their efforts on firms. In addition, EDA does not systematically maintain data collected by the TAA Centers on the firms they assist, resulting in gaps in centralized data that EDA could use to evaluate the program and meet reporting requirements. However, GAO's analysis of data collected from the centers showed that the program was associated with increased sales and productivity for manufacturing firms, although some factors were more strongly correlated with improved performance than was participation in the TAA for Firms program. GAO's survey of and interviews with firms participating in the program found that many firms reported satisfaction with the program's impacts. Notably, 73 percent reported that the program helped them with profitability; 71 percent that it helped them retain employees; and 57 percent that it helped them hire new employees.", "To allocate funding to the TAA Centers, EDA uses a formula of weighted factors, such as each center's share of approved business recovery plans. However, the formula does not factor in differences in program need and costs in centers' service regions, even though centers varied in their use of program funds. For example, the formula does not take into account potential need for the program based on its objective of assisting firms that have lost sales and employment due to import competition. The formula also does not take into account the considerable differences in the costs of operating the centers to assist firms. As a result, some centers had spent their entire allocation by the conclusion of the most recent grant period, while other centers had not. Although EDA de-obligates and reallocates any unspent funds, it uses its allocation funding formula to do so, thus perpetuating the deficiency of failing to consider variable needs and costs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Commerce establish more effective measures of program outcomes, improve its data collection, and allocate funds in a way that considers program needs and costs.

The World Trade Organization  also admitted China, Vietnam, and 11 other members during this time. In  2012, bilateral free trade agreements with South Korea and Colombia  went into effect. Further trade liberalization is being pursued, including a  Transpacific Partnership among 11 nations in the Asia-Pacific region and  North America regions.", "Although trade expansion can enhance the economic welfare of all trade  partners, many firms and workers experience difficulties adjusting to  import competition. Congress has responded to concerns about these  difficulties with trade adjustment assistance (TAA) programs, including  the TAA for Firms program administered by the Department of  Commerce\u2019s (Commerce) Economic Development Administration (EDA).Established in 1962, the TAA for Firms program provides technical  assistance to help trade-impacted, economically distressed firms make  adjustments that may enable them to remain competitive in the global  economy. In fiscal years 2009 through 2012, EDA received $15.8 million  annually for the TAA for Firms program, an amount far smaller than the  funding provided for other TAA programs. EDA uses its appropriation for  the TAA for Firms program to fund 11 TAA Centers, which provide  assistance to U.S. manufacturing, production, and service firms in all 50  states, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  We last examined the TAA for Firms program in 2000.", "Congress authorized and amended the TAA for Firms program under the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act\u2019s Trade and Globalization  Adjustment Assistance Act (TGAAA) of 2009 and mandated that we  review the operation and effectiveness of these amendments by  September 30, 2012. In response, this report examines (1) the results of  the legislative changes on program operations and participation, (2) the  performance measures and data that EDA uses to evaluate the program  and what these tell us about the program\u2019s effectiveness, and (3) how  program funding is allocated and spent.", "To describe the results of the legislative changes on program operations  and participation, we reviewed relevant program legislation, regulations,  and agency documentation, including those outlining the operational and  administrative changes to implement the program amendments in the  TGAAA. We analyzed agency data on firms\u2019 program participation and  interviewed EDA officials, including the Director of the TAA for Firms  program, the Chief Counsel, and certifying officials, to determine the  impact of the legislative changes on the program\u2019s operations. We  conducted site visits or teleconferences with the 11 TAA Centers. During  these visits, we interviewed staff, firm representatives, and consultants to  learn about their procedures for conducting outreach and assisting firms  and to learn about the results of the legislative changes on the program.  We selected the eight site-visit locations to take into account geographic  diversity and a mix of nonprofit and university-affiliated TAA Centers, as  well as a range of industries, and number of submitted and approved  petitions and business recovery plans. In addition, we collected and  analyzed data from EDA and the 11 TAA Centers to determine the  number of firms receiving assistance from fiscal years 2008 through  2011. We assessed the reliability of the data by checking for accuracy  and completeness. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of reporting numbers of submitted and approved  petitions and business recovery plans.", "To determine the extent to which EDA\u2019s performance measures capture  program effectiveness, we used criteria from our prior work. We also  reviewed EDA guidance and conducted interviews with EDA officials to  identify their data collection procedures and to learn how program data  are used. We reviewed two prior studies of the effectiveness of the TAA  for Firms program\u2014our 2000 report and a report issued by the Urban  Institute in 1998. To gauge the impact of the program, we collected data  on a group of firms that completed at least one project in their business  recovery plans during fiscal years 2009 through 2011, as well as data on  general economic indicators, and conducted a regression analysis with  these data. Because the data we collected did not include any information  about firms that did not participate in the program, this analysis allows us  to make inferences from the regression estimates only for the firms that  participated in the program during this time period. In addition, we  conducted a survey of 163 firms to obtain their views about the quality of  the assistance received and its impact. We received usable responses  from 117 of them, for a final response rate of 72 percent. We conducted  an analysis of our survey results to identify potential sources of  nonresponse bias by comparing respondents with nonrespondents on key  characteristics. Our analysis did not identify any large differences  between respondents and nonrespondents for these characteristics. As a  result, we determined that the survey results for the 117 respondents  were sufficiently reliable to present in our report. This report does not  contain all of the results from the survey. The survey and a more  complete tabulation of the results can be viewed online in an   e-supplement to this report at GAO-12-935SP.", "To examine how EDA allocates and spends program funding, we  interviewed EDA officials and TAA Center staff, reviewed EDA and TAA  Center program data and reports, and analyzed documentation of the  funding formula and the allocation of program funding.

The program delivers technical assistance to firms  by developing business recovery plans and providing matching funds to  implement the projects in the plans. EDA uses its appropriation for the  TAA for Firms program to fund 11 TAA Centers, signing a cooperative  agreement with each center. The centers provide assistance to U.S.  manufacturing, production, and service firms in all 50 states, the District  of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Each TAA Center  uses the funding that EDA allocates under the cooperative agreement to  cover its administrative and operational costs and works directly with  firms in its geographic region to provide assistance on a cost-share basis.  None of the program funds go directly to firms; instead, funds go to third- party consultants to implement firms\u2019 projects. The centers cover  geographic regions of varying size, composed of one to eight states. A  TAA Center may be affiliated with a university, private firm, or nonprofit  organization; however, as shown in figure 1, nonprofit organizations  currently manage four centers, while the other seven centers are affiliated  with universities.", "Staff at the TAA Centers generally target their outreach to small and  medium-sized firms in the manufacturing, agricultural, and service  sectors.firms, including the following:   They use a variety of outreach methods to identify potential analyzing industry databases;  conducting cold calls and providing information via websites, e-mail,  and mail; presenting at seminars and meetings hosted by banking consortia,  business and trade associations, and members of Congress;  collaborating with state and local entities, including local departments  of commerce and agriculture, economic and small business  development centers, and chambers of commerce;  targeting firms with workers who qualify for the TAA for Workers  program or firms involved with International Trade Commission  antidumping lawsuits; and acting on referrals from program consultants and current and former  clients.", "Once a firm connects with a TAA Center, staff may use various methods  to determine whether firms are financially able to participate in the  program. Some centers review preliminary financial documentation in an  effort to help ensure that firms are eligible for assistance and committed  to participating in the program. One center developed a series of eligibility  questions on its website, so that firms can determine whether they are  eligible for the program before applying for assistance.", "The TAA for Firms program process has three phases\u2014petition for  certification, recovery planning, and business recovery plan  implementation\u2014requiring collaboration among firms, TAA Centers, and  EDA. Figure 2 presents a flowchart summary of the process.", "A firm seeking TAA program benefits must submit a petition to EDA to  receive certification of its eligibility to participate in the program. TAA  Center staff collect documentation from a firm to demonstrate in the  petition each of the following:  1.  A significant number or proportion of the firm\u2019s workers have been or  are threatened to be totally or partially separated.  2.  Total sales and/or production or sales and/or production of a product  that represents at least 25 percent of the firm\u2019s total have decreased  absolutely during the 12-month period preceding the most recent 12- month period; or total sales and/or production, or that of a product that  represents at least 25 percent of the firm\u2019s total, have decreased  during the most recent 12-month period compared with the preceding  12-, 24-, or 36-month period.  3.  Increases in imports of articles or services comparable to, or directly  competitive with, the firm\u2019s articles or services contributed importantly  to worker separations (or threat thereof) and the declines in sales or  production. Firms must generally demonstrate that import impact has  occurred, using a combination of import data or statements from their  customers to certify that imports were a factor in the decreased  purchase of the firm\u2019s products.", "Once EDA approves the petition and certifies the firm, the firm and TAA  Center staff have 2 years to develop a business recovery plan and submit  it to EDA for approval. Center staff work closely with the firm\u2019s  management to identify the firm\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and develop  a customized plan designed to stimulate its recovery and growth. EDA  requires standard information in each business recovery plan, such as a  description of the firm\u2019s competitive problems, prospects for recovery, and  specific technical assistance projects. However the length, level of detail,  and amount of information provided in the plans vary across the TAA  Centers.

Prior to the legislative  changes, firms were allowed to compare sales and production data in  the most recent 12 months only with data from the immediately  preceding 12-month period. Staff at the TAA Centers told us that it  was difficult to certify some firms with the 12-month look-back period,  because that amount of time was often not adequate to demonstrate  declines in sales and production. Center staff said that the expanded  look-back period was particularly helpful during the recent recession,  because it enabled more firms to demonstrate the requisite declines.", "Although these legislative changes generally improved the program and  increased participation, TAA Center staff noted some challenges in  assisting service sector firms. For example, some service sector firms  had difficulty establishing import impact along with requisite declines in  sales and production. Because service sector firms do not have industry- specific codes that allow TAA Center staff to analyze import data, EDA  allowed the use of certification letters from firm customers to demonstrate  import impact in lieu of import data. However, many of the firms\u2019  customers did not want to certify in writing that they were outsourcing  services, according to center staff.

Additionally, EDA officials and TAA Center staff stated that  the 2009 legislative changes increased interest in, and demand for, the  program by prospective firms. For example, EDA officials and TAA Center  staff said the news of the increased funding authorization generated  many inquiries from firms, and one TAA Center official noted that the  large increase in authorized funding in the TGAAA led to the expectation  that the program would be able to service a greater number of firms. EDA  officials also stated that demand for the program increased because more  firms were eligible under the expanded look-back period.", "In total, EDA certified 878 petitions and approved 761 business recovery  plans for fiscal years 2008 through 2011. Because TAA Centers use a  variety of methods prior to completing a petition to determine if a firm is  financially able to participate in the program, center staff told us that EDA  approved almost all of the finalized petitions they received.

However, in its 2011  Annual Report on the TAA for Firms program, the primary analysis that  EDA offers for its data on performance measures notes how the  program\u2019s participants fared relative to the nationwide average for all  manufacturing firms. Specifically, employment for participating firms  decreased less for TAA for Firms participants than for firms nationwide   (a 1.9 percent decrease for program participants, compared with a 4.5  percent decrease nationwide, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics  data). Likewise, productivity for TAA for Firms participants increased by  less than 1 percent, whereas average productivity increased by 10  percent nationwide since 2009. However, comparing performance data  for trade-impacted firms with data for the nationwide manufacturing  industry is not sufficient for determining whether the program is effective  in helping firms. TAA for Firms recipients are in distress, having already  been certified as adversely impacted by international trade. These firms  demonstrated lost sales and employees to qualify for the program and  cannot be expected to perform at the same level as the national average,  which includes firms not impacted by trade competition. Nevertheless,  EDA has not attempted to isolate the impact of the program\u2019s assistance  on firms from other influences. In November 2009, we reported that using  program evaluation methods to rule out plausible alternative explanations  for outcomes that may be influenced by a variety of external factors, such  as changes in the economy, can help strengthen evaluations.

However, the  evaluation was not implemented because of a lack of funding for it,  according to the program\u2019s director.", "Several TAA Center officials noted that data from the performance  measures do not adequately show the effect that the program has on its  participants, and they further commented that they do not find these  measures particularly useful for improving program management. For  example, a representative from one TAA Center said that an important  measure of success is firm survival, which determines the number of jobs  that are saved or created, but firm survival is not measured in the annual  performance metrics. A representative of another TAA Center noted that  a weakness in measuring sales, employment and productivity 2 years  after program completion is that the nature of the business cycle is such  that sales and production must increase to the point where orders cannot  be filled before the firm believes it is justified in hiring new staff. As a  result, there is a time lag between increased sales and production and  increased employment that might not be reflected in the 2-year data.", "EDA acknowledges that the program\u2019s performance measures should be  improved and has made improving the measures a goal and taken steps  toward it. According to the director of the program, EDA has entered into  a partnership with economists from the George Washington University  and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill to improve the  performance metrics for all EDA programs under the Government  Performance and Results Act. Planned activities include the creation of a  new logic model that will map out inputs, outputs, and outcomes for  EDA\u2019s programs.

Many participating firms that were negatively impacted by trade have  recorded gains in sales and productivity since starting the program.

We also conducted a site visit or  teleconference with each of the 11 TAA Centers, interviewing staff,  representatives of participant firms, and consultants to understand  procedures for identifying and assisting eligible trade-impacted firms and  to obtain their opinions and observations on the legislative changes\u2019  effects on the program.", "We conducted site visits to eight TAA Centers\u2014in Ann Arbor, Michigan;  Atlanta, Georgia; Blue Bell, Pennsylvania; Boulder, Colorado; Chicago,  Illinois; Los Angeles, California; North Billerica, Massachusetts; and  Seattle, Washington. We conducted teleconferences with the remaining  three centers\u2014in Binghamton, New York; Blue Springs, Missouri; and  San Antonio, Texas. We selected our site visit locations to achieve  geographic diversity and a mix of nonprofit and university-affiliated  centers, as well as a range of industries, numbers of submitted and  approved petitions, and numbers of business recovery plans. To  determine how the TAA for Firms program relates to other economic  development programs that assist manufacturers, including Commerce\u2019s  Manufacturing and Extension Partnership (MEP) program, we interviewed  TAA Center staff, MEP consultants, and officials at Commerce  headquarters. We also reviewed documentation of program objectives,  eligibility requirements, and services provided.", "We assessed EDA\u2019s performance measures and data for the program.  We analyzed the two performance measures reported for the TAA for  Firms program in the agency\u2019s performance and accountability reports as  well as the 14 measures specified by TGAAA and included in the TAA for  Firms annual reports. Using criteria from prior GAO work, we assessed  the extent to which the program\u2019s performance measures reflect the  characteristics of effective performance measures. We reviewed other  reports about the program: one conducted by the Urban Institute in  November 1998 and our prior report on the program. To examine how  program data are collected and used to manage the program, we  interviewed EDA officials and TAA Center staff and reviewed EDA and  TAA Center program data and reports. We interviewed EDA officials  responsible for collecting and reporting program data, as well as TAA  Center staff, to determine the procedures for collecting, validating, and  reporting data on program operations. We also reviewed data and  documents, including quarterly and annual reports from EDA and the  centers, to understand the types of program data collected and the  purposes for which the data are used.", "To estimate the impact that the TAA for Firms program assistance has  had on firm performance, we collected data on a group of participant firms  with business recovery plans approved in fiscal years 2009 through 2011  and data on general economic indicators, and we conducted a regression  analysis with these data to assess the effects of the assistance on this  group of participating firms, controlling for firm, industry, and  economywide factors. From each of the 11 TAA Centers, we obtained  financial data on firms that had an approved business recovery plan and  had completed at least one project in their approved recovery plan in  fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011. We assessed the reliability of the data  we received from the centers by testing the data for obvious errors and  completeness. In addition, we interviewed and received written responses  from staff at the centers who had knowledge of the data, to obtain  information on the procedures for collecting and verifying the data  reported. The centers drew their responses to our data collection  instrument primarily from the petition and business recovery plan  approval data they collect from firms. In doing so, they used the data that  they had previously compiled for a conference report on Commerce  appropriations for fiscal year 2012. This helped ensure the accuracy,  completeness, and consistency of the data. We found the data sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our analysis. For our dependent variable or  outcome variable, we used data on yearly firm sales during this period as  a proxy for firm performance. We combined these data with data on  industry-wide and firm-specific variables that determine performance,  such as firm-specific financial data, growth rates, firm size, age, and other  qualitative firm and industry indicators. To control for factors in the  general economy, we incorporated macroeconomic variables in our  analysis, including the Census Bureau\u2019s regional unemployment rates  and a yearly time trend. In addition, to estimate the effects of trade on firm  performance, we calculated and incorporated an international trade  variable\u2014the import penetration ratio for each firm\u2019s industry. Our  regression model determined whether participation in the TAA for Firms  program had a statistically significant effect on firm performance after the  firm received assistance under the program. Because the data we  collected did not include any information about firms that did not  participate in the program, this analysis allows us to make inferences  from the regression estimates only for the firms that participated in the  program during this time period. We present more complete information  about the data and methodology of the analysis in appendix III.", "To report the views of certified firms on program operations and on the  quality and impact of program services, we interviewed firm representatives  and consultants during our site visits to TAA Centers. We also conducted a  survey of firms that had a business recovery plan approved by the Trade  Adjustment Assistance for Firms program in fiscal year 2009. We selected  this population to ensure that those surveyed had received assistance from  one of the TAA Centers and had some experience with implementing a  recovery plan. Our research at the beginning of our review indicated that it  would be feasible to survey these firms within our time frame and achieve  an acceptable response rate. We conducted formal pretests with  representatives of three firms and considered comments from EDA officials  to ensure that our questions were appropriate and could be understood by  respondents. Our survey covered the following topics:how the firms learned  of the program, the types of assistance the firms received from the TAA  Centers, the level of the firms\u2019 satisfaction with the assistance, and the  impact of the assistance on the firms. We administered our survey between  March 2012 and April 2012. We surveyed the 163 firms for which we  obtained contact information, of the 171 firms that had a business recovery  plan approved in fiscal year 2009. We received responses from 117 of the  163 firms, with a final response rate of 72 percent. However, because we  did not randomly select the firms we surveyed, the survey results do not  permit us to draw conclusions about all firms participating in the TAA for  Firms program. We conducted an analysis of our survey results to identify  potential sources of nonresponse bias by comparing respondents to  nonrespondents on three key characteristics: total sales, number of  employees, and total amount of technical assistance approved. This  analysis did not indicate any large differences between respondents and  nonrespondents for these three characteristics, and we determined that the  survey results for the 117 respondents were sufficiently reliable to present  in our report. The survey and a more complete tabulation of the results can  be viewed online at GAO-12-935SP.", "To examine the funding formula EDA uses to allocate program funds and  to examine how funds were spent, we reviewed EDA\u2019s 2003 spending  plan, which defines the factors included in the formula as well as the data  used to measure each of the factors. In addition, we analyzed EDA\u2019s  available spending plans covering cooperative agreement years 2009  through 2011 to assess the measures used to allocate program funding to  the TAA Centers during each of those cooperative agreement years. We  used equity standards from social science research for evaluating and  designing funding allocation formulas to assess the TAA for Firms  formula. To determine the amount of funding allocated to each of the 11  centers, as well as the centers\u2019 direct and indirect costs, we analyzed  EDA\u2019s budget data for cooperative agreement years 2008 through 2011.  We also analyzed centers\u2019 data on the amount of approved, unfunded  assistance for cooperative agreement years from fiscal year 2008 to April  2012, and the number of firms affected.

In contrast, the MEP program does not require applicant  firms to go through a certification process. Firms must only demonstrate  they are a manufacturer under industry-specific codes, according to MEP  officials. Officials from the TAA for Firms program said that in some  instances, trade-impacted firms may choose to participate in the MEP  program rather than the TAA for Firms program because they can receive  faster assistance. In addition, officials confirmed that participant firms in  the TAA for Firms program have subsequently participated in the MEP  program for additional services, and vice versa. However, officials from  both programs did not have data to determine the extent to which this has  occurred.", "Although trade-impacted firms can qualify for both programs, and some  trade-impacted firms have received assistance from both programs, TAA  for Firms and MEP program officials said that the programs are more  complementary than duplicative in nature.

At the state and regional levels, MEP consultants  often bid on and win contracts to implement projects in the TAA  participant firms\u2019 business recovery plans, according to TAA Center and  MEP staff. Staff from both programs also said that MEP consultants  sometimes refer firms to the TAA for Firms program and that TAA for  Firms officials sometimes refer firms to the MEP program.
