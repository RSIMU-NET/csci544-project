Officials from the defense intelligence community\u2014intelligence organizations within the Department of Defense (DOD)\u2014told GAO this is because they are currently overextended due to an increased demand for threat assessments from a recent upsurge in threat missile activity, as well as uncertainties related to their transition to new threat processes and products. The delays are exacerbated because MDA does not collectively prioritize the various types of threat assessment requests submitted to the defense intelligence community or provide resources for unique requests, as other major defense acquisition programs are generally required to do. Without timely threat assessments, MDA risks making acquisition decisions for weapon systems using irrelevant or outdated threat information, which could result in performance shortfalls.", "MDA has increased its outreach to the defense intelligence community over the past few years, but opportunities remain for further engagement on key threat\u00adrelated processes and decisions. Specifically, MDA provides the defense intelligence community with limited insight into how the agency uses threat assessments to inform its acquisition decisions. MDA is not required to obtain the defense intelligence community's input, and instead has discretion on the extent to which it engages the defense intelligence community. However, the defense intelligence community is uniquely positioned to assist MDA and its involvement is crucial for helping MDA keep pace with rapidly emerging threats. Moreover, this limited insight has, in part, prevented the defense intelligence community from validating the threat models MDA builds to test the performance of its weapon systems. Without validation, any flaws or bias in the threat models may go undetected, which can have significant implications on the performance of MDA's weapon systems. MDA and the defense intelligence community recently began discussing a more suitable level of involvement in the agency's acquisition processes and decisions.", "Note: the threat missile coverage depicted is notional and not representative of MDA's actual threat coverage."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations to improve how MDA: prioritizes and resources its threat assessment needs; obtains input from the defense intelligence community on key threat-related processes and decisions for missile defense acquisitions; and validates its threat models.

Ultimately, the challenge for  the United States is how to contend with these foreign adversaries\u2019 threat  capabilities, which are becoming more mobile, reliable, accurate, and  capable of achieving longer ranges. The Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD)  Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is working to address this challenge by  developing the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to detect, track,  and defend against these threats to the homeland and abroad. MDA uses  information on foreign adversaries\u2019 missile capabilities, which is primarily  derived from threat assessments prepared by the defense intelligence  community (Defense Intelligence Agency and the military services\u2019  intelligence production centers), to inform its BMDS acquisition decisions.  Defense acquisition and intelligence leaders have recognized that greater  consideration of threat capabilities in design and testing decisions  throughout a weapon system\u2019s lifecycle can reduce developmental costs  and operational risk. With today\u2019s rapidly evolving threat capabilities, it is  not only fiscally prudent to ensure that weapon systems are informed by  defense intelligence community threat assessments, it is also vital to our  national security, as each decision shapes future defensive capabilities.", "Various National Defense Authorization Acts since 2002 have included  provisions for us to prepare annual assessments of MDA\u2019s progress  toward meeting its acquisition goals.

To date, we have issued 16 reports citing MDA\u2019s progress  and challenges in developing and delivering the BMDS, including our most recent report issued in June 2019. For this review, we assessed (1)  what challenges, if any, MDA and the defense intelligence community  face in meeting the agency\u2019s threat assessment needs and (2) the extent  to which MDA engages the defense intelligence community on BMDS  acquisition. This report is a public version of a classified report that we  issued May 1, 2019.

Although the information provided in this report is  more limited, the report addresses the same objectives as the classified  report and uses the same methodology.", "To assess the challenges that MDA and the defense intelligence  community face in meeting the demands for threat assessments, we  reviewed summaries of meetings, requested responses from both MDA  and the defense intelligence community via a questionnaire, and  examined other documentary evidence. We compared this information to  GAO best practices on inter-governmental agency collaboration,  scheduling, and cost estimating.

The configuration of a ballistic  missile is also largely determined by the range a missile is expected to  travel. For example, longer range ballistic missiles typically have two or  three distinct sections, known as stages, that separate during flight and  each has an independent propulsion system to ensure the warhead  reaches its target. Shorter range ballistic missiles generally only have one  section, or a single stage, that remains intact until the warhead reaches  its intended target and detonates.", "Ballistic missiles may also carry countermeasures or adversaries may  employ tactics and techniques, both of which are intended to confuse  missile defense systems. For example, countermeasures can include  penetration aids that are released during flight, such as decoys, which are  intended to complicate the ability of missile-tracking sensors and missile  defense interceptors to identify the warhead among the multiple objects.  Challenging tactics and techniques can include structured attacks, such  as simultaneously launching a number of missiles or outfitting a single  missile with multiple warheads. In addition, some newer missiles are  capable of traveling at greater speeds, performing maneuvers during all  phases of flight, and remaining in the atmosphere for longer durations of  their flight. These newer missiles, generally referred to as hypersonics,  possess a combination of high speed, maneuverability, and relatively low  altitude that can make them a challenging target for missile defense  systems to track and engage.

The memorandum notes  that DOD acquisition program officials expressed concerns about the  timeliness of threat assessments due to the lengthy process and varying  timelines that sometimes left them with threat assessments that did not  contain the most up-to-date information. In addition, the defense  intelligence community noted its concerns with the significant duplication  in producing certain threat assessments, which placed a huge burden on  its manpower and resources. Consequently, DOD leadership directed the  acquisition customers and defense intelligence community to work  together to improve threat assessments and in 2016 the defense  intelligence community set forth its planned revisions to threat  assessment processes and products. Subsequent revisions include  creating a library of threat modules and replacing a former type of threat  assessment with a new Validated Online Lifecycle Threat (VOLT) report,  among others. These revisions were codified in the defense intelligence  community\u2019s policies in September 2016 and in DOD policy in August  2017.

The BMDS elements, when integrated, are  designed to destroy enemy missiles of various ranges, speeds, sizes, and  performance characteristics in different phases of flight, as seen in figure  3 below.", "When MDA was established in 2002, the agency was granted exceptional  flexibilities to diverge from DOD\u2019s traditional acquisition lifecycle and defer  the application of acquisition policies and laws designed to facilitate  oversight and accountability until a mature capability is ready to be  handed over to a military service for production and operational use. In  particular, MDA was exempted from DOD\u2019s standard requirements-setting  process and instead uses a unique and flexible requirements-setting  process that is intended to enable MDA to quickly develop and field useful  but limited capabilities, which can be incrementally improved over time  and adapted to address changes in the threat.", "MDA also implemented a tailored process that is intended to use defense  intelligence community threat assessments in a way that enables the  BMDS to defend against a broad range of uncertain and evolving threats.  MDA uses defense intelligence community threat assessments as the  foundation for developing threat models and establishing wide-ranging  critical threat parameters upon which to design, develop, and test the  BMDS.

MDA uses these threat models to verify that the element\u2019s system  design has the capability necessary to defend against its assigned  threat space.", "Test: Toward the end of BMDS element development, MDA  coordinates with the warfighter and test and evaluation communities  to select specific threat models for use in testing to assess the  performance of the BMDS elements. MDA also uses its threat models  to prepare for flight tests to help ensure that the BMDS elements have  a high probability of achieving their test objectives, such as  successfully intercepting the target.", "Operational capability: MDA uses its threat models as the  foundation for algorithms, which are embedded into the BMDS to  enable its sensors and interceptors to determine which object(s)  amongst a group of objects (e.g., countermeasures, debris, etc.) is  lethal.

Defense intelligence community officials say they are  contending with all of these challenges without the provision of additional  manpower or resources. Consequently, defense intelligence community  officials have stated that their manpower and resources are constrained,  which can affect the timely delivery of threat assessments to customers,  such as MDA.

For example, ballistic missile flight testing has more than  doubled from 2005 to 2016, from about 70 tests in 2005 to nearly 180  tests in 2016, and the most notable increases have occurred since 2010  (see figure 4).", "This upsurge of threat missile activity increases the urgency for the  defense intelligence community to provide the requisite type of threat  assessments to MDA to enable the agency to counter and defeat such  threats; however, defense intelligence community officials have said that  manpower and resource constraints have limited their ability to do so. In  2016, we reported on how the defense intelligence community\u2019s  manpower and resource constraints have impacted its ability to provide  threat assessments. Since then, defense intelligence community  officials have said that the manpower and resource constraints have not  been resolved, but threat missile activity has increased. For example,  some countries have recently displayed or flight tested new threat  missiles capable of reaching the United States. When new threat missiles  emerge, MDA requests missile-specific threat assessments\u2014known as  reference documents\u2014from the defense intelligence community to  understand their size, performance characteristics, and signature when  detected by a sensor. This detailed information on the threat missiles  enables MDA to build the threat models used to design, develop, and test  BMDS weapon systems.", "Defense intelligence community officials have said that, although  important, missile-specific threat assessments utilize considerable  manpower and resources because they can be labor-intensive, lengthy,  and take months, and at times a year or longer, to prepare. According to  these officials, one way to minimize the workload and shorten the  preparation timeframe is for MDA to differentiate the specific information  that it needs from anything that might be extraneous. As a simplified and  hypothetical example, defense intelligence community officials explained  that MDA may only need some simple, general information about a  missile or conversely it may need complex, highly-detailed information on  everything about the missile from tip to tail. The amount of time and effort  it would take defense intelligence community officials to gather the  information in these two scenarios would vary significantly. MDA officials  have acknowledged that some extraneous information may be gathered  and included in these threat assessments but noted that, at the time they  request a threat assessment, they may not yet fully understand what  information is essential for their purposes. Therefore, they prefer to have  as much information as possible, with the ability to determine whether  and how to use it.

In 2016, in  response to the November 2013 memorandum from DOD\u2019s acquisition  leadership, the defense intelligence community began overhauling its  threat assessment processes and products to produce more timely,  efficient, and relevant information. See table 2 for an overview of these  revisions.", "While each of these revisions has potential benefits, defense intelligence  community officials have said that implementing the revisions has been  more time-consuming and difficult than anticipated, which has affected  their ability to provide certain threat assessments to MDA when needed.  For example, MDA and the defense intelligence community were initially  uncertain about the responsibilities and processes for creating a VOLT  report for the BMDS. Although it took some time to resolve these  uncertainties, MDA is now compiling its own country-specific threat  assessments\u2014known as the BMDS VOLT report\u2014which DIA then  validates. The military services generally have their own defense  intelligence production centers, and therefore, a means for compiling  VOLT reports. MDA, however, uses information from multiple defense  intelligence production centers and does not possess its own production  center. In September 2017, MDA reached out to DIA on this matter and  DIA responded that, per the DOD policy update, it does not see anything  that would preclude MDA, as a DOD component, from compiling VOLT  reports. DIA stated that MDA compiling its own VOLT report aligns the  agency with the rest of the DOD acquisition community.", "MDA is waiting on threat modules from the defense intelligence  community to prepare its preliminary BMDS VOLT report, which MDA will  use to inform acquisition decisions. MDA needs specific threat modules  from the defense intelligence community, including those for six specific  countries, in order to compile its preliminary BMDS VOLT report.  However, defense intelligence community officials have said that they are  still in the process of creating some of the digitized threat modules MDA  needs, because it has taken more time and effort than they expected to  standardize the threat modules\u2019 content and coordinate production across  multiple defense intelligence community production centers.  Consequently, MDA is planning to publish its preliminary BMDS VOLT  report in 2019 (table 3).", "In the meantime, without the preliminary BMDS VOLT report or digitized  threat modules used to compile the BMDS VOLT report, MDA is reliant on  threat assessments written between 2014 and 2016 for some of its  acquisition decisions. For example, MDA recently made design decisions  for certain BMDS elements using these threat assessments, although  these threat assessments have not yet been updated. Consequently,  these weapon systems that MDA recently made design decisions for  could have capability gaps or performance shortfalls that present risks for  the warfighter. MDA has attempted to fill the void for digitized threat  modules and the preliminary BMDS VOLT report by submitting ad hoc  requests for threat assessments to the defense intelligence community,  but this has only added to the defense intelligence community\u2019s workload  and exacerbated delays."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Request for Accelerated Delivery of Threat Modules", "paragraphs": ["Moving forward, MDA has asked the defense intelligence community to  provide the digitized threat modules on an accelerated schedule to  ensure the agency can compile BMDS VOLT reports in a timely manner  to inform its acquisition decisions; however, some defense intelligence  production centers have said that an accelerated schedule will be difficult,  if not impossible, without additional manpower and resources.  Specifically, MDA wants the defense intelligence community to provide  the digitized threat modules every year, as opposed to every two years as  required by DOD policy. MDA has stressed the importance of having  these digitized threat modules on an accelerated schedule in order to be  responsive to threat advancements and mitigate the potential for  capability gaps or performance shortfalls in its weapon systems. Defense  intelligence community officials have acknowledged MDA\u2019s need to have  the digitized threat modules on an accelerated schedule but are  concerned about their ability to provide them due to personnel and  resourcing issues at some defense intelligence production centers. For  example, two defense intelligence production centers have said that  MDA\u2019s request for an accelerated schedule is currently unrealistic due to  their manpower and resource levels.

According to MDA, the individual lanes are as follows:  1.  Country-specific threat assessments (i.e., threat modules for  BMDS VOLT reports) are prioritized via the VOLT Threat Steering  Group, which is co-chaired by MDA and DIA. The VOLT Threat  Steering Group\u2019s objectives are to determine MDA\u2019s threat module  requirements, to achieve concurrence on the threat modules used in  the BMDS VOLT report, and to review the BMDS VOLT production  schedule. The first VOLT Threat Steering Group meeting was held in  April 2018 and during that meeting, MDA presented its prioritized list  of threat assessments by adversary country to the defense  intelligence community personnel in attendance.  2.  Missile-specific threat assessments (i.e., reference documents  used to build threat models) are prioritized via an annual intelligence  mission data process managed by the Joint Staff. Through the  intelligence mission data process, MDA prioritizes the data it needs  for threat missiles by most to least critical\u2014119 total threat missiles in  2018.", "With these two individual lanes for prioritization, MDA treats each type of  threat assessment as independent and unrelated. According to MDA, the  agency maintains these individual lanes for prioritizing its threat  assessment requests because the requests can be more easily managed  by the defense intelligence community components that develop the  threat assessments. For example, MDA stated that requests for  missile-specific threat assessments are often routed to intelligence  production centers while requests for country-specific threat assessments  are often routed to DIA\u2019s regional centers (see appendix I for more  information on defense intelligence community components). According  to MDA, the vast majority of new requirements submitted to the defense  intelligence community are also accompanied by an informal verbal  discussion and if MDA\u2019s priorities shift because a new threat emerges,  MDA stated that it can convey that shift to the defense intelligence  community in an effort to work out the best path forward.", "If the defense intelligence community cannot meet MDA\u2019s needs, MDA  stated that it works with the defense intelligence community to determine  the best course of action for resolving prioritization issues. For example,  MDA cited a recent example where it had worked with the U.S. Navy\u2019s  Office of Naval Intelligence to develop a threat model production schedule  for two threat systems; however, the emergence of a new threat shifted  MDA\u2019s priorities. MDA was able to understand the effect of choosing one  system ahead of the others based on the priority and projected production  timelines. MDA cited another recent example where it had similarly  worked with the U.S. Air Force\u2019s National Air and Space Intelligence  Center to prioritize production of a threat model for a new, unique threat.  After some initial informal discussions and questions about whether the  threat model production effort was a top priority for MDA, both agreed in a  meeting in January 2019 to lower the priority for the model production  effort. The specific threats referenced in the examples above have been  omitted because they are classified.", "However, MDA\u2019s approach of prioritizing its threat assessment needs  through individual lanes creates the potential for unresolved, competing  priorities because the defense intelligence community produces threat  assessments collaboratively rather than disparately. Defense intelligence  community officials told us that the underlying analyses that support both  country-specific and missile-specific threat assessments are developed  and reviewed by many of the same subject matter experts and managers  within the defense intelligence community. Defense intelligence  community officials told us that they have no way of knowing whether the  information to build a specific threat model is a greater or lesser priority  than updating a particular threat module needed to support the BMDS  VOLT report. Our prior best practices work found that successful  commercial companies employ a formal process for prioritizing their  investments collectively rather than as independent and unrelated  initiatives. MDA instead stovepipes its threat assessment prioritization  through individual lanes and informally discusses its collective priorities  with the defense intelligence community. Consequently, MDA\u2019s requests,  and resulting output from the defense intelligence community, may not be  based on the collective order of importance, as depicted in figure 5.", "MDA relies on both country- and missile-specific threat assessments for  its acquisitions, as each characterizes threats in unique ways and for  different purposes, and it uses other requests to fill information gaps, as  needed. Thus, all of MDA\u2019s requests are important, but one among them  may be the most important or urgent due to the timing of an upcoming  design or testing decision. In the example illustrated above in figure 5, the  most important request is for a country-specific threat assessment;  however, it will not likely be the next one out of the defense intelligence  community\u2019s queue because there is a missile-specific request ahead of  it. Hence, MDA may have the information it needs to build the threat  model used to test one weapon system\u2019s performance, but it may delay  the country-specific information it needs to make design decisions for  another. This delay in the country-specific information could put MDA in a  position of moving forward with design decisions without the requisite  information or relying on outdated information, which increases the risk  for performance shortfalls and costly retrofits.", "One opportunity that MDA has to address the availability of threat  assessments from the defense intelligence community is to collectively  prioritize its threat assessment requests based on the order of  importance. We have previously identified collective prioritization as a  best practice\u2014specifically, that it is important for an agency to regularly  evaluate the totality of its needs or tasks, to determine whether specific  ones should be prioritized ahead of others, based on the costs, benefits,  and risks. While MDA has no formal requirement to collectively prioritize  its threat assessment requests, defense intelligence community officials  said that they have had discussions with MDA through existing venues  and requested that it do so to ensure it has the most urgently needed  information.", "MDA has the capability to collectively prioritize its threat assessment  requests because all of the requests go through a centralized intelligence  requirements group within the agency\u2019s engineering directorate. This  group has insight into the totality of the agency\u2019s threat assessment  requests and is uniquely positioned to make determinations about the  order of importance among them. As the group submits requests to the  defense intelligence community, the defense intelligence community  responds to the requests in the order that they were received, because,  as we previously found, the defense intelligence community is not  required to prioritize the requests, does not currently possess the  capability to do so, and would not be in a position to dictate to an agency  what is most important.", "Another opportunity for MDA to address the availability of threat  assessments is through further collaboration with the defense intelligence  community to determine the extent of additional resources that would be  needed to enable accelerated support. When intelligence support  requirements exceed the defense intelligence community\u2019s  responsibilities, DOD acquisition programs are generally required to  account for resources to augment intelligence support. For example,  according to defense intelligence community officials, the Air Force is  providing one of the defense intelligence community\u2019s production centers  with additional resources to collect data and devise tools primarily to  support a specific major defense acquisition program via a military  interdepartmental purchase request because the program\u2019s request  exceeds the defense intelligence community\u2019s responsibilities.  According to MDA, intelligence mission data shortfalls are currently  identified through an annual departmental review process. MDA stated  that in fiscal year 2019 DOD approved budgeting additional funding in the  future to help address intelligence mission data shortfalls for all of the  military services, including MDA.", "MDA has not provided the defense intelligence community with additional  resources for an accelerated schedule to update threat modules more  frequently. MDA has requested that the defense intelligence community  update the digitized threat modules it needs to compile a BMDS VOLT  report every year to ensure that it has the updated threat information  needed for acquisition decisions; however, the defense intelligence  community is only required to update the digitized threat modules every  two years. Some defense intelligence community officials have  acknowledged MDA\u2019s need to have an accelerated schedule, but have  communicated to MDA that given its current manpower and resource constraints, the accelerated schedule is unrealistic without additional  resources. Thus, MDA\u2019s request for the defense intelligence community  to update the digitized threat modules faster exceeds what the defense  intelligence community is currently able to do given its manpower and  resource constraints.", "With existing venues, like the VOLT Threat Steering Group, MDA and the  defense intelligence community have a forum to further collaborate and  identify what additional resources are needed and the potential funding  scenarios to support an accelerated schedule for threat module  production. Without collaboration through these existing venues, MDA  and the defense intelligence community may not be utilizing an available  method to ensure their individual needs are met. According to our best  practices for inter-governmental agency collaboration, it is important for  the inter-reliant agencies to collaboratively identify the resources\u2014 information, manpower, and funding\u2014needed to accomplish their  respective missions.

Even with MDA using its own  threat models, DOT&E has found that integrating the various BMDS  models and presenting them with a common threat scene has been an  extremely challenging task for MDA.

Defense intelligence community officials  stated that they generally do not need the same level of detail MDA  requires for the types of analyses the defense intelligence community  performs. In addition, according to a March 2018 MDA memorandum, the  agency was previously told by representatives of the DIBMAC that they  do not have the staff or resources to produce the high volumes of detailed  threat models that MDA needs to support BMDS development and  testing.

According to a briefing MDA presented to the defense  intelligence community in September 2018, every target, model, and test  can be traced back to defense intelligence data. However, in August  2018, the U.S. Army issued a memorandum for MDA stating that the  BMDS Operational Test Agency (OTA)\u2014the agency responsible for  independently analyzing the verification and validation data for models  used in operational testing\u2014was only able to certify some of the threat  models used in a recent ground test. In other ground tests, though, the  BMDS OTA was able to trace MDA\u2019s threat models back to defense  intelligence community threat assessments. In February 2019, DOT&E  reported that (a) credible threat models are the linchpins of BMDS models  and simulation; (b) reducing threat model uncertainty is a high priority;  and (c) MDA and the BMDS OTA should ensure that MDA-developed  threat models are representative of the defense intelligence community\u2019s  understanding of the threat.", "MDA also has not implemented best practices established by DOD\u2019s  Models and Simulation Coordination Office that would enable DIA to be in  a position to validate MDA\u2019s threat models.

Conversely, defense intelligence community officials stated  that they lack sufficient insight into and input on how MDA builds and  uses threat models. For example, the defense intelligence community has  emphasized to MDA that caveats need to be carried through with the  model data and voiced concerns about the engineering judgments the  agency makes in its threat models, because these judgments could lead  to the BMDS performing well or poorly for reasons not based on the  actual threat. Given these uncertainties and the defense intelligence  community\u2019s lack of insight into the purposes for which MDA uses its  threat models, DIA lacks the insight and input necessary to validate  MDA\u2019s threat models.", "Although MDA has previously expressed interest in validating its threat  models with the defense intelligence community, long-standing obstacles  remain. During a May 2018 meeting between MDA and the DIBMAC,  defense intelligence community officials identified the lessons they have  learned from working with other acquisition programs to validate threat  models. Model validation can be achieved if the acquisition program: establishes a partnership with the defense intelligence community; prioritizes its threat modeling needs;  recognizes there are limits to how many threat models can be built in  a given time; provides in-depth insight into its threat modeling needs and weapon  system\u2019s capabilities; discusses how the models will be applied;  jointly defines model acceptance criteria early in the process; provides resources, including funding and staff; and  invests in the defense intelligence community\u2019s capability and  capacity.", "MDA officials stated that the agency desires to have its threat models  validated but noted that the defense intelligence community does not  validate models produced by other organizations. MDA officials also  emphasized that the defense intelligence community cannot meet MDA\u2019s  timeline for building threat models, whereas the agency can. In addition,  MDA officials indicated to us that they do not believe it is practical to  provide the amount of insight defense intelligence community officials told  us they would need in order to validate MDA\u2019s threat models. MDA  officials told us that the only way in which the defense intelligence  community could obtain such insight is by being co-located with MDA\u2019s  threat modelers as the models are being built. However, the 2010 JASON  study found that this type of close working arrangement between MDA  engineers and defense intelligence analysts is necessary to effectively  plan for emerging threats. Defense intelligence community officials also  clarified for MDA that the defense intelligence community can validate  models produced by another agency but it would require the defense  intelligence community having detailed knowledge of everything used to  produce the model.", "As a result, although DOD policy generally requires that threat models  used to support acquisition decisions be validated by DIA, MDA has yet to  validate any of the numerous threat models it has developed since  2004. Without independent validation, MDA runs the risk that DOD and  congressional decisionmakers may not have confidence that the agency\u2019s  plans and proposals for developing the BMDS are appropriate and  sufficient to address the threat because any flaws or bias in MDA\u2019s threat  models can have significant implications on the BMDS\u2019s overall  performance. According to a Federally Funded Research and  Development Center publication describing its efforts supporting MDA  threat modeling, acquisition influences can place pressure on MDA threat  modelers to tailor the missile threats to suit the currently feasible BMDS  design. In May 2017, we found a parallel circumstance where, in the  absence of warfighter validation of MDA-established requirements, the  agency made critical design choices for three new BMDS efforts. These  design choices reflected the needs and preferences of MDA ahead of the  warfighter, potentially compromising performance to the extent of not  being able to defeat current and future threats."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MDA Has Steadily Increased Its Outreach to DOD Stakeholders Over the Past Few Years, but Opportunities Remain for Further Engagement", "paragraphs": ["MDA has undertaken a number of efforts over the past few years to  generally increase stakeholder involvement in BMDS acquisition.

MDA officials also acknowledged that the defense  intelligence community would benefit from having a better understanding  of how the BMDS responds to threats and agreed to work towards  providing such information. Defense intelligence community officials  stated that increased insight would allow them to better focus their  intelligence collection, analysis, and production by knowing which threat  parameters MDA most often uses and the specificity of those parameters.  The defense intelligence community and MDA also agreed that providing  defense intelligence community engineers with MDA program-level  access would improve the support the defense intelligence community  provides to MDA.", "MDA has also recently increased its outreach to the defense intelligence  community on some early BMDS planning decisions, although  opportunities for more comprehensive engagement remain. For example,  MDA engaged the defense intelligence community on an analysis of  alternatives the agency completed in February 2017 that assessed future  sensor options for the BMDS. According to MDA officials, they are also  engaging the defense intelligence community on another analysis of  alternatives pertaining to defense against hypersonic missiles. In addition, MDA worked with the defense intelligence community to establish threat  space parameters for some specific threat systems. Also, as noted  earlier, over the last nine years, MDA has held 18 \u201cimmersion day\u201d events  with the defense intelligence community, half of which occurred in the last  two years.

According to an internal MDA  memorandum signed by the MDA Director in April 2018, a culture exists  within the agency that generally tolerates the use of models that have not  been sufficiently vetted and is too willing to accept the associated risk.  The memorandum states that the agency\u2019s goal is for all MDA personnel  to help address this culture problem and that model verification,  validation, and accreditation is a high priority for MDA. During a meeting  with the BMDS OTA in October 2018, officials confirmed that MDA is  taking steps to address the challenges raised in the memorandum.", "MDA also increased its outreach to the defense intelligence community in  2016 to coordinate on threat modeling efforts.

In addition, MDA is working with the defense  intelligence community to address compatibility issues that currently  prevent MDA from directly using the defense intelligence community\u2019s  threat models in BMDS ground testing. MDA plans to include a few  missile trajectory models produced by the defense intelligence community  in the models and simulation framework for the agency\u2019s upcoming  Ground Test-08 campaign.", "The Technical Interchange Meetings and pathfinder efforts for MDA  directly using defense intelligence community threat models are  improving collaboration between MDA and the defense intelligence  community on threat modeling efforts. However, they do not provide MDA  with a pathway for validating its threat models with DIA. Even if  compatibility issues that currently prevent MDA from using defense  intelligence community threat models could be resolved, the defense  intelligence community is currently not resourced to build threat models  for MDA. Moreover, although MDA has indicated that the Technical  Interchange Meetings can include any topic of interest, the meetings do  not provide defense intelligence officials with sufficient insight into how  MDA builds its models, including the assumptions, caveats, or intended  use of the models.", "According to MDA, the agency continues to hold discussions with the  defense intelligence community and explore process improvements, as  well as technical and resource requirements, to ensure the creation of  valid, threat-representative models for BMDS development. In March  2018, the MDA Director told us that one of his priorities was to ensure  that the agency was using appropriately validated models and  acknowledged the importance of ensuring its threat models are  sufficiently representative. In April 2018, MDA subsequently began  holding meetings with the DIBMAC to define the issues preventing the  defense intelligence community from validating MDA\u2019s threat models.  MDA and the defense intelligence community met five times in 2018 to  identify actions that would facilitate working together to develop threat  models the defense intelligence community would be comfortable  validating. During these meetings, both organizations agreed on specific  actions intended to increase the defense intelligence community\u2019s  involvement in MDA\u2019s threat modeling process. To achieve threat model  validation, an initial plan was developed that included a combination of (a)  MDA directly using aspects of defense intelligence community threat  models; and (b) MDA partnering with the defense intelligence community  to build threat models.

If MDA does not have the threat  assessments it needs, when needed, the agency\u2019s weapon systems are  at risk of being designed or tested against irrelevant or outdated  information, which could result in performance shortfalls and costly  retrofits. MDA has opportunities to mitigate these challenges and risks by  collectively prioritizing its threat assessment requests and working  through existing venues with the intelligence community to determine if  and to what extent additional resources may be needed to secure the  support that it needs. If MDA does not take advantage of these  opportunities, the defense intelligence community\u2019s challenges will likely  continue, which will impact the availability of threat assessments and  increase the likelihood that MDA\u2019s weapon systems will not be designed  or tested against the most up-to-date threat information.", "In addition, MDA faces a steep challenge in developing the BMDS and  fielding capabilities at a rate that keeps pace with the threat. MDA was  previously informed by expert panels and senior defense leaders that it  needed to work more closely with the defense intelligence community to  better prepare for future threats or risk falling behind the threat. Given  these challenges, it is imperative for MDA to make the most out of its  available resources.

The defense intelligence community is uniquely qualified to assist  MDA on fundamental and critically important BMDS acquisition processes  and decisions, such as establishing the BMDS threat space and the  threat parameters and models it assigns to the BMDS elements.  Moreover, after nearly 15 years of building numerous threat models, MDA  has yet to fully implement a plan for DIA to validate these threat models,  as generally required by DOD policy. However, MDA has recently begun  laying the groundwork for more comprehensive engagement with the  defense intelligence community through efforts which have the potential  to address long-standing obstacles that have prevented DIA from  validating MDA\u2019s threat models.

In addition, although MDA has participated in the  department\u2019s intelligence mission data review process since 2016, the  agency has yet to provide the defense intelligence community with  additional resources to address known funding and manpower shortages.  Moreover, this review process is limited to intelligence mission data and  does not cover all of the other types of threat assessments that MDA  needs.

To be clear, our review did, in fact, find that, until  recently, MDA did not sufficiently coordinate with DIA on establishing a  process for creating valid threat models for use in MDA simulations.  Furthermore, we explain in our report that MDA was told that the defense  intelligence community can validate MDA\u2019s threat models if it has  sufficient insight into how MDA builds its models\u2014insight which MDA  officials previously told us was unnecessary. Additionally, although MDA  may internally validate its threat models for each ground test, the BMDS  OTA was not able to certify many of those threat models, in part, because  some models could not be traced back to the defense intelligence  community\u2019s threat assessments.
