Direct costs are specifically attributed to  research projects sponsored by NIH grants, whereas indirect costs are  not directly attributable to a specific project or function, such as  administrative expenses.

The resulting percentage is the proposed indirect  cost rate. This proposed rate is then negotiated with the cognizant agency  until they agree upon a negotiated indirect cost rate.", "To determine how much of the research organization\u2019s indirect costs  should be allocated to each research grant, each grant\u2019s direct cost  amount is multiplied by the negotiated indirect cost rate. In this way, if a  particular research grant contributes a higher percentage of the  organization\u2019s direct costs, it will share in a proportionally higher  percentage of the indirect costs as well.

CAS and NIH-DFAS review proposals whereas ONR  generally sends proposals to the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA)  to be audited. When reviewing a proposal, the cognizant agency is to  verify the mathematical accuracy of the rates proposed, confirm  unallowable costs have been excluded, reconcile the cost proposal to the  audited financial statements, and determine the reasonableness of the  proposed costs. After the proposal has been reviewed or audited, the  cognizant agency and the research organization negotiate and come to  an agreement on the rate.

The  standards also state that information should be recorded and  communicated to staff within a time frame that enables the staff to carry  out their responsibilities. We found that CAS and ONR had not updated  their internal guidance to reflect a majority of the federal regulations  issued as the Uniform Guidance, which became effective for grants  awarded on or after December 26, 2014. Working with the Council on  Financial Assistance Reform, OMB consolidated its grants management  circulars into the Uniform Guidance to streamline its guidance, promote  consistency among grantees, and reduce administrative burden on  nonfederal entities. New requirements include, for example, (1) the  option for research organizations that currently have a negotiated rate to  apply for a onetime extension of that rate for a period of up to 4 more  years, (2) the option for research organizations that have never  negotiated an indirect cost rate to use a de minimis indirect cost rate of 10  percent in lieu of negotiating an indirect cost rate with the cognizant  agency, and (3) additional provisions for administrative costs to be  counted as direct costs when allocable to a specific grant.", "CAS officials stated that they issued a memo in July 2015 to the  negotiators providing guidance covering one of the new Uniform  Guidance requirements which allows for a one-time rate extension.   However, they have not updated their internal guidance to reflect other  new applicable requirements from the Uniform Guidance. According to  officials at CAS and ONR, they were waiting for OMB to finalize the  corresponding technical corrections and frequently asked questions and  thus had not updated their internal guidance to reflect the changes in the  Uniform Guidance as of June 2016. Further, CAS officials stated that in  addition to waiting for technical corrections and frequently asked  questions to be finalized, they were also waiting for HHS\u2019s Office of  Grants Policy, Oversight and Evaluation to update the HHS Grants Policy  Statement to reflect the changes in the Uniform Guidance. The Grants  Policy Statement covers indirect cost policy for HHS grants and has not  been updated since 2007. However, OMB officials stated that in meetings  held in 2015 with the cognizant agencies, they requested that the  cognizant agencies update their internal guidance to reflect the  requirements of the Uniform Guidance. Figure 4 displays a timeline of key  milestones during the implementation process of the Uniform Guidance.", "If they do not incorporate the new Uniform Guidance and its applicable  regulatory requirements in their internal guidance, CAS and ONR risk not  properly and consistently negotiating indirect cost rates\u2014potentially  leading to waste of government resources. CAS and ONR as well as  research organizations stand to benefit from incorporating elements of the  Uniform Guidance, such as ONR extending negotiated rates for up to 4  years and both allowing the use of a de minimis indirect cost rate of 10  percent. These two options reduce administrative burden to both parties,  making the process more efficient and potentially reducing the waste of  government resources. Also, while OMB guidance has allowed for  charging salaries of administrative and clerical staff as a direct cost when  appropriate and when certain conditions in the guidance are met, the  Uniform Guidance has clarified the existing conditions and added new  requirements describing when administrative costs can be charged as  direct. For example, a new requirement states that costs must now be  explicitly included in the budget or have the prior written approval of the  federal awarding agency before they can be charged as direct costs.  Without updated internal guidance to reflect those provisions, CAS and  ONR may incorrectly negotiate this element as direct in cases where it  does not meet the conditions outlined in federal guidance.", "Further, we found that the cognizant agencies changed certain agency  requirements, such as documentation requirements, when reviewing  indirect cost rate proposals, but did not update their internal guidance to  reflect such changes. For example:  Individual CAS field offices have established checklists, which provide  procedural steps for the negotiators to follow and acknowledge  completion of during their review of the research organization\u2019s  indirect cost proposal. These checklists include steps such as  reconciling the proposal to the audited financial statements,  confirming that the rates are mathematically accurate, verifying the  consistency of the distribution base with prior years, and confirming  that unallowable expenses have been removed from the indirect costs  claimed. We found that although CAS considers use of these  checklists to be a control over the negotiation process, CAS has not  updated its internal guidance to require negotiators to use a checklist  or established a standardized checklist for all offices to use when  negotiating indirect cost rates.", "Our walk-throughs of CAS case files determined that field offices have  developed their own checklists based on their interpretations of  negotiation requirements found in CAS\u2019s internal guidance, and that  these interpretations were not always consistent. Although these  checklists contained similar review steps that the negotiators were to  perform, we found differences in instructions for performing trend  analyses and reviewing the indirect and direct costs claimed for  allowable and unallowable costs, which are two key controls for  minimizing the potential for fraud, waste, and abuse. Without a  standardized checklist and agency-wide internal guidance instructing  negotiators to use the standardized checklist during negotiation,  management cannot reasonably assure that negotiators and  supervisors are consistently and fairly negotiating indirect cost rates  across all CAS field offices. According to CAS officials, they are in the  process of finalizing review checklists for nonprofit organizations,  which include research institutes and universities using the simplified  proposal method and they expect the checklists to be implemented by  the end of the fiscal year 2016.", "For NIH-DFAS, we were unable to determine when primary guidance  was last updated because NIH-DFAS did not have formalized internal  guidance with official dates and signatures. Its internal guidance  lacked key characteristics\u2014such as a policy number, purpose of the  policy, effective date, and approving official\u2014that are normally  included in formal policies and procedures. NIH-DFAS officials  acknowledged that their internal guidance did not contain the key  characteristics of internal control. These officials stated that in June  2014, NIH\u2019s Administrative and Program Resources Office finalized  the standard operating procedures for developing formalized internal  guidance, and in October 2015, NIH-DFAS hired an outside contractor  to formalize NIH-DFAS\u2019s internal guidance, which the officials  anticipate will be completed by December 2016.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government requires  management to ensure that internal guidance and practices are integral  to their operations. We found that these deficiencies occurred because  the cognizant agencies had not designed monitoring controls to ensure  that internal guidance had been reviewed and updated to reflect changes  in federal regulations and internal procedures. According to CAS officials,  they have not designed monitoring controls to establish time frames for  periodic review and assign related roles and responsibilities because     (1) they update internal guidance as needed and (2) staff already know  their roles and responsibilities. According to ONR officials, in May 2014,  ONR issued a policy that requires staff to review and update their internal  guidance annually. However, ONR\u2019s internal guidance was last reviewed  and updated in January 2011, so the Uniform Guidance and its applicable  regulatory requirements have not been incorporated. Without established  controls for reviewing and updating internal guidance, including setting  time frames and assigning roles and responsibilities, there is an  increased risk that management will not hold staff accountable. The  officials acknowledged that their current internal guidance needed to be  updated to reflect changes to applicable federal guidance, regulations, or  agency procedural changes, such as formalizing internal guidance. By not  ensuring that their internal guidance reflects current regulations and  procedures, the agencies increase their risk that their indirect cost rate- setting processes may not be properly and consistently carried out by the  negotiators, which in turn increases the risk that rates negotiated will not  be in accordance with federal guidance and regulations, thus increasing  the potential for fraud, waste, and abuse of federal resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ONR Did Not Design Adequate Review Procedures over the DCAA Advisory Audit Function", "paragraphs": ["Unless other arrangements have been made, ONR negotiators request a  DCAA advisory audit on all indirect cost rate proposals and rely on DCAA  to issue an opinion on the adequacy and compliance of a research  organization\u2019s indirect cost proposal prior to negotiating the indirect cost  rate.

While ONR\u2019s internal guidance requires taking into account  DCAA results and comments, it does not specify review procedures to  take when DCAA (1) is unable to complete its advisory audit within a  reasonable time frame, (2) issues a qualified opinion, or (3) rescinds one  of its previously issued audit opinions.", "To negotiate indirect cost rates timely, ONR\u2019s internal guidance  requires its negotiators to provide DCAA with 45 days to complete its  advisory audit report on behalf of ONR, unless arrangements have  been made for a due date beyond 45 days (e.g., DCAA requests an  extension). In a March 2015 report to Congress, DCAA officials stated  that depending on the type of audit, the average elapsed time to  complete an audit ranges from 95 to 1,006 days. This high number  is the result of a growing backlog of DCAA audits. In light of this  backlog, ONR officials told us that their current procedure is to  routinely give DCAA additional time to complete its initial audit report  of a research organization\u2019s cost proposals. For example, in our walk- through of ONR case files, we found that ONR initially granted as  many as 363 days\u2014about a year\u2014for DCAA to complete its audit,  well beyond the 45 days period in ONR\u2019s internal guidance. In many  cases, DCAA requested and received an extension to complete its  audit of a research organization\u2019s cost proposal. Our walk-throughs  identified instances in which ONR granted up to 139 days on top of  what was initially given to DCAA to complete its audit. ONR\u2019s internal  guidance does not reflect this change in procedure of routinely  granting DCAA more than 45 days to prepare an advisory audit report,  and it does not include parameters defining a reasonable period for  the initial extensions beyond the 45 days. In addition, ONR\u2019s internal  guidance does not provide procedures for negotiators to perform the  necessary audit steps if DCAA does not complete its audit within the  required time frames or a reasonable and accepted extended period.  By not including in its internal guidance reasonable and acceptable  audit completion time frames and procedures for ONR negotiators  who perform audit steps when DCAA does not complete an audit,  management cannot reasonably assure that indirect cost rate  negotiations will be accurate and completed in a timely manner.", "Furthermore, we found that although ONR\u2019s internal guidance  requires negotiators to review DCAA\u2019s audit results, it does not  contain procedures for the negotiators to perform supplemental review  steps when DCAA\u2019s audit results contain qualified opinions or when  DCAA rescinds one of its previously issued audit opinions. DCAA  issues a qualified opinion when it is unable to perform detailed  transaction testing on the incurred costs that are often used as the  research organization\u2019s basis of estimate or when it does not have  enough time to complete an audit. Our walk-throughs identified  several instances of DCAA audit reports with qualified opinions (in  which DCAA was not able to perform detailed transaction testing on  incurred costs used as a basis of estimate) and one instance in which  DCAA rescinded an audit opinion (when DCAA\u2019s Integrity and Quality  Assurance Directorate review found that DCAA\u2019s audit was not  performed in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards). In those cases, ONR\u2019s guidance does not require  the negotiator to perform any supplemental procedures to validate  costs. Without internal guidance regarding supplemental procedures  to be taken when DCAA issues a qualified opinion or rescinds one of  its previously issued audit opinions, ONR cannot reasonably assure  that its negotiators take consistent and appropriate steps, potentially  increasing the risk that ONR\u2019s negotiated indirect cost rates could  include reimbursement for unallowable, unallocable, and  unreasonable costs.", "We found that these deficiencies occurred because ONR had not  designed sufficient review procedures for those situations when DCAA   (1) is unable to complete its advisory audit within a reasonable time  frame, (2) issues a qualified opinion, or (3) rescinds one of its previously  issued audit opinions. According to ONR officials, they believe that the  procedures listed in their internal guidance will allow negotiators to  validate costs prior to negotiating an indirect cost rate. However, by not  including in its internal guidance reasonable and acceptable audit  completion time frames and supplemental procedures to be taken to  review cost proposals when DCAA cannot perform its audits in a timely  manner, issues a qualified opinion, or rescinds one of its previously  issued audit opinions, there is an increased risk that the negotiated  indirect cost rate may not comply with applicable regulations, thus  increasing the risk of fraud, waste, and abuse of federal resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cognizant Agencies\u2019 Internal Guidance Lacks Detailed Procedures on Supervisory Review over the Indirect Cost Rate- Setting Process", "paragraphs": ["Although the cognizant agencies\u2019 internal guidance describes broad  procedures for supervisory review, such as requiring that the supervisors  review and approve workpapers and applicable rates, these documents  do not include detailed procedures for supervisors to monitor the  negotiators\u2019 processes.

These controls are meant to provide reasonable assurance  that only allowable, allocable, and reasonable indirect costs have been  proposed and that appropriate distribution bases were selected for  allocating such costs to federally funded grants. However, the cognizant  agencies\u2019 internal guidance did not specifically require supervisors to  reasonably assure that negotiators perform those steps. In fact, as  illustrated by the examples below, our walk-throughs of case files for the  three cognizant agencies found a few instances in which supervisors  approved rates that were set by negotiators who did not perform one or  more of the controls required by the cognizant agencies\u2019 internal  guidance.", "As a tool used to assess risk, CAS\u2019s internal guidance requires  negotiators to complete a detailed trend analysis of nonprofit and long  form research organizations\u2019 indirect cost rates and distribution bases  for the last 3 years, including the proposal year. According to CAS\u2019s  internal guidance, a trend analysis provides the negotiator with an  insight into the areas of the proposal needing a more detailed review.  During our walk-through of CAS case files, we found that the  negotiators did not always review the indirect cost rates and the  distribution bases for the last 3 years, including the proposal year,  when preparing a trend analysis. Additionally, CAS\u2019s internal guidance  requires the negotiator to compare the accounting policies delineated  in the research organization\u2019s Disclosure Statement to the indirect  cost proposal to ensure consistency in the proposal\u2019s preparation.  However, during our walk-through of CAS case files, we found that  when the supervisors reviewed supporting documentation, they did  not confirm that the negotiators had performed this comparison.", "OMB guidance states that each institution must describe the process  it uses to ensure that federal funds are not used to subsidize industry  and foreign government programs. To meet this requirement, ONR\u2019s  submission requirements checklist states that institutions must  complete and submit several certifications and assurances, including  a Statement of Assurance attesting that federal funds are not used to  subsidize industry and foreign government programs, which cites the  OMB guidance.

However, we found that CAS and ONR lack  internal guidance for negotiating indirect cost rates with certain types of  research organizations.", "CAS has not developed internal guidance that describes procedures  required for negotiating indirect cost rates for hospitals, which  represented $511 million in indirect cost reimbursements in fiscal year  2015. Currently, CAS uses a policy that the Department of Health,  Education, and Welfare (now HHS) published in 1974 (policy OASC- 3) for establishing indirect cost and patient care rates with hospitals  for grants and contracts. An HHS Office of Inspector General  memorandum from 1993 recommended that the hospital cost  principles be modernized and strengthened, as OASC-3 does not  always provide clear guidance for determining what types of costs  should be allowed and how costs should be allocated. However,  HHS has not updated OASC-3, and CAS continues to rely on this  policy for negotiating indirect cost rates with hospitals. According to  CAS officials, they have not created internal guidance for hospitals  because CAS\u2019s national specialist\u2014who was responsible for creating  and updating internal guidance\u2014resigned and they have not filled the  vacancy. Without up-to-date and clear guidance for negotiating  indirect cost rates for hospitals, there is an increased risk that  negotiators will allow unallowable costs claimed by hospitals.", "Additionally, CAS does not have internal guidance related to the types  of distribution bases allowed for small universities using the simplified  method (also known as the short form) for preparing facilities and  administrative cost rate proposals. According to CAS officials, they  consider the internal guidance for the long form to be sufficient and  have instructed negotiators to use the long form best practice manual  for all university proposals. However, under the simplified method,  universities are given greater flexibility in choosing between two  different types of distribution bases, whereas the long form proposal  requires universities to submit proposals using only a modified total  direct cost base. Further, OMB guidance restricts the use of the  simplified method when it produces results that appear inequitable to  the federal government. Therefore, without internal guidance for  proposals using the simplified method, there is an increased risk that  indirect costs will not be fairly distributed to grants. For example, a  distribution base that is understated will result in an inflated indirect  cost rate.", "Although OMB has issued separate guidance specific to universities  and nonprofits, ONR\u2019s only internal guidance on negotiating indirect  cost rates applies to both types of research organizations and does  not address certain key differences in OMB guidance applicable to  each type of research organization. Specifically, the distribution bases  allowed for calculating indirect cost rates differ for universities (short  and long form) and for nonprofits. For example, under the OMB  guidance, universities may use only two different types of distribution  bases, whereas nonprofit organizations are given greater flexibility as  they are instructed to select a distribution base best suited for  assigning the indirect costs to the project. However, ONR\u2019s internal  guidance applicable to both types of research organizations does not  distinguish between the different provisions of OMB guidance. After  we identified this issue, ONR officials acknowledged that the internal  guidance needs to be updated to distinguish procedures between the  different provisions of OMB guidance and reported that they are in the  process of making the necessary revisions. ONR officials stated that  they anticipate that the draft internal guidance will be updated and  ready for final management review in June 2016. To reduce the risk  that the negotiators could use an inappropriate distribution base,  resulting in a rate calculation that is not in compliance with federal  guidance, it is important that ONR implement and issue the internal  guidance timely.

In contrast, NIH-DFAS and ONR officials reported that they  do not have systems capable of generating these types of reports. ONR  officials stated that they do maintain a spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel for  universities and nonprofit organizations, which tracks information such as  whether rate agreements have been signed and whether a proposal is  awaiting an audit or management review.

Generally, the agency that provides the  most funding to a particular research organization has rate-setting  cognizance for that organization. However, the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  have designated three primary cognizant agencies to negotiate indirect  cost rates for grants funded by NIH: (1) HHS\u2019s Cost Allocation Services  (CAS), (2) NIH\u2019s Division of Financial Advisory Services (NIH-DFAS), and  (3) the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) Office of Naval Research (ONR).  Specifically, OMB guidance (OMB Circular No. A-21, Cost Principles for  Educational Institutions, whose provisions have been incorporated in  OMB\u2019s Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit  Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance)) specifically  assigns responsibility for negotiating rates for universities to either HHS\u2019s  CAS or DOD\u2019s ONR. OMB guidance (OMB Circular No. A-122, Cost  Principles for Non-Profit Organizations, whose provisions have been  incorporated in the Uniform Guidance) assigns responsibility for  negotiating rates for research institutes to the cognizant agency with the  largest dollar value of grants with an organization, unless different  arrangements are agreed to by the agencies concerned. HHS Acquisition  Regulations Part 342, Contract Administration, assigns the responsibility  for negotiating indirect cost rates for hospitals to HHS\u2019s CAS.  Furthermore, the Secretary of HHS authorized NIH-DFAS to have HHS- wide cognizance of the indirect cost rate negotiation function with for- profit grantees, which are not covered by the OMB circulars on grant cost  principles.
