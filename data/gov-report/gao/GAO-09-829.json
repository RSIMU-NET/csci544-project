GAO's work for this report is focused on 16 states and certain localities in those jurisdictions as well as the District of Columbia--representing about 65 percent of the U.S. population and two-thirds of the intergovernmental federal assistance available. GAO collected documents and interviewed state and local officials.

More than 90 percent of the $29 billion in federal outlays has been provided through the increased Medicaid Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) and the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF) administered by the Department of Education. GAO's work focused on nine federal programs that are estimated to account for approximately 87 percent of federal Recovery Act outlays in fiscal year 2009 for programs administered by states and localities. Increased Medicaid FMAP Funding All 16 states and the District have drawn down increased Medicaid FMAP grant awards of just over $15 billion for October 1, 2008, through June 29, 2009, which amounted to almost 86 percent of funds available. Medicaid enrollment increased for most of the selected states and the District, and several states noted that the increased FMAP funds were critical in their efforts to maintain coverage at current levels. States and the District reported they are planning to use the increased federal funds to cover their increased Medicaid caseload and to maintain current benefits and eligibility levels. Due to the increased federal share of Medicaid funding, most state officials also said they would use freed-up state funds to help cope with fiscal stresses. Highway Infrastructure Investment As of June 25, DOT had obligated about $9.2 billion for almost 2,600 highway infrastructure and other eligible projects in the 16 states and the District and had reimbursed about $96.4 million. Across the nation, almost half of the obligations have been for pavement improvement projects because they did not require extensive environmental clearances, were quick to design, obligate and bid on, could employ people quickly, and could be completed within 3 years. State Fiscal Stabilization Fund As of June 30, 2009, of the 16 states and the District, only Texas had not submitted an SFSF application. Pennsylvania recently submitted an application but had not yet received funding. The remaining 14 states and the District had been awarded a total of about $17 billion in initial funding from Education--of which about $4.3 billion has been drawn down. School districts said that they would use SFSF funds to maintain current levels of education funding, particularly for retaining staff and current education programs. They also said that SFSF funds would help offset state budget cuts. Accountability States have implemented various internal control programs; however, federal Single Audit guidance and reporting does not fully address Recovery Act risk. The Single Audit reporting deadline is too late to provide audit results in time for the audited entity to take action on deficiencies noted in Recovery Act programs. Moreover, current guidance does not achieve the level of accountability needed to effectively respond to Recovery Act risks. Finally, state auditors need additional flexibility and funding to undertake the added Single Audit responsibilities under the Recovery Act. Impact Direct recipients of Recovery Act funds, including states and localities, are expected to report quarterly on a number of measures, including the use of funds and estimates of the number of jobs created and the number of jobs retained. The first of these reports is due in October 2009. OMB--in consultation with a broad range of stakeholders--issued additional implementing guidance for recipient reporting on June 22, 2009, that clarifies some requirements and establishes a central reporting framework."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As federal funds provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment  Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) flow into the U.S. economy, state fiscal  conditions continue to be stressed. Actual declines in sales, personal  income, and corporate income tax revenues influenced state actions to  begin to fill an estimated $230 billion in budget gaps for fiscal years 2009  through 2011. The national unemployment rate also increased to 9.5  percent in June 2009, and high unemployment can place greater stress on  state budgets as demand for services, such as Medicaid, increases. Some  economists have pointed to signs of economic improvement, although  associations representing state officials have also reported that state fiscal  conditions historically lag behind any national economic recovery.", "The Recovery Act specifies several roles for GAO, including conducting  bimonthly reviews of selected states\u2019 and localities\u2019 use of funds made  available under the act. This report, the second in response to the act\u2019s  mandate, addresses the following objectives: (1) selected states\u2019 and  localities\u2019 uses of Recovery Act funds, (2) the approaches taken by the  selected states and localities to ensure accountability for Recovery Act  funds, and (3) states\u2019 plans to evaluate the impact of the Recovery Act  funds they received.

Our bimonthly reviews examine how Recovery Act  funds are being used and whether they are achieving the stated purposes  of the act. These purposes include  to preserve and create jobs and promote economic recovery; to assist those most impacted by the recession;  to provide investments needed to increase economic efficiency by  spurring technological advances in science and health; to invest in transportation, environmental protection, and other  infrastructure that will provide long-term economic benefits; and to stabilize state and local government budgets, in order to minimize and  avoid reductions in essential services and counterproductive state and  local tax increases.", "The states selected for our bimonthly reviews contain about 65 percent of  the U.S. population and are estimated to receive collectively about two- thirds of the intergovernmental federal assistance funds available through  the Recovery Act. We selected these states and the District on the basis of  federal outlay projections, percentage of the U.S. population represented,  unemployment rates and changes, and a mix of states\u2019 poverty levels,  geographic coverage, and representation of both urban and rural areas.

However, our analysis of the  latest information available on actual federal outlays reported on  www.recovery.gov indicates that in the 4 months since enactment, the  federal Treasury has paid out approximately $29 billion to states and  localities, which is about 60 percent of payments estimated for fiscal year  2009. Although this pattern may not continue for the remaining 3-1/2   months, at present spending is slightly ahead of estimates. More than 90  percent of the $29 billion in federal outlays has been provided through the  increased Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) grant awards  and the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund administered by the Department of  Education. Figure 1 shows the original estimate of federal outlays to states  and localities under the Recovery Act compared with actual federal  outlays as reported by federal agencies on www.recovery.gov. The 16  states and the District of Columbia covered by our review account for  about two-thirds of the Recovery Act funding available to states and  localities. According to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), an  estimated $149 billion in Recovery Act funding will be obligated to states  and localities in fiscal year 2009.", "Our work for this bimonthly report focused on nine federal programs,  selected primarily because they have begun disbursing funds to states and  include programs with significant amounts of Recovery Act funds,  programs receiving significant increases in funding, and new programs.

The federal  government matches state spending for Medicaid services according to a  formula based on each state\u2019s per capita income in relation to the national  average per capita income. The rate at which states are reimbursed for  Medicaid service expenditures is known as the FMAP, which may range  from 50 percent to no more than 83 percent. The Recovery Act provides  eligible states with an increased FMAP for 27 months between October 1,  2008, and December 31, 2010.  On February 25, 2009, CMS made increased  FMAP grant awards to states, and states may retroactively claim  reimbursement for expenditures that occurred prior to the effective date  of the Recovery Act. Generally, for fiscal year 2009 through the first  quarter of fiscal year 2011, the increased FMAP, which is calculated on a  quarterly basis, provides for (1) the maintenance of states\u2019 prior year  FMAPs, (2) a general across-the-board increase of 6.2 percentage points in  states\u2019 FMAPs, and (3) a further increase to the FMAPs for those states  that have a qualifying increase in unemployment rates. The increased  FMAP available under the Recovery Act is for state expenditures for  Medicaid services. However, the receipt of this increased FMAP may  reduce the funds that states would otherwise have to use for their  Medicaid programs, and states have reported using these available funds  for a variety of purposes.", "For the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, the increases in FMAP for the 16  states and the District of Columbia compared with the original fiscal year  2009 levels are estimated to range from 6.2 percentage points in Iowa to  12.24 percentage points in Florida, with the FMAP increase averaging  almost 10 percentage points. When compared with the first two quarters of  fiscal year 2009, the FMAP in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 is  estimated to have increased in 12 of the 16 states and the District.", "From October 2007 to May 2009, overall Medicaid enrollment in the 16  states and the District increased by 7 percent. In addition, each of the  states and the District experienced an enrollment increase during this  period, with the highest number of programs experiencing an increase of 5  percent to 10 percent. However, the percentage increase in enrollment  varied widely ranging from just under 3 percent in California to nearly 20  percent in Colorado. (Figure 3.)", "Overall enrollment growth was the most rapid in early 2009\u2014generally  from January through April 2009\u2014an enrollment trend that was mirrored  in several states and the District; however, variation existed. For example,  while Colorado and Mississippi experienced a nearly 5 percent increase in  Medicaid enrollment during this time, Medicaid enrollment in Illinois  remained relatively stable, growing at less than 1 percent. Most of the  increase in overall enrollment was attributable to populations that are  sensitive to economic downturns\u2014primarily children and families  Nonetheless, enrollment growth in other population groups, such as  disabled individuals, also contributed to enrollment growth.", "With regard to the states\u2019 receipt of the increased FMAP, all 16 states and  the District had drawn down increased FMAP grant awards totaling just  over $15.0 billion for the period of October 1, 2008 through June 29, 2009  which amounted to 86 percent of funds available.  (See table 2.) In  addition, except for the initial weeks that increased FMAP funds were  available, the weekly rate at which the sample states and the District have  drawn down these funds has remained relatively constant.", "While the increased FMAP available under the Recovery Act is for state  expenditures for Medicaid services, the receipt of these funds may reduce  the state share for their Medicaid programs. As such, states reported that  they are using or are planning to use the funds that have become freed up  as a result of increased FMAP for a variety of purposes. Most commonly,  states reported that they are using or planning to use freed-up funds to  cover their increased Medicaid caseload, to maintain current benefits and  eligibility levels, and to help finance their respective state budgets. Several  states noted that given the poor economic climate in their respective  states, these funds were critical in their efforts to maintain Medicaid  coverage at current levels. For example, officials from Georgia, Michigan,  and Pennsylvania reported that the increased FMAP funds have allowed  their respective states to maintain their Medicaid programs, which could  have been subject to cuts in eligibility or services without the increased  funds. Additionally, Medicaid officials in five states and the District  indicated that they used the funds made available as a result of the  increased FMAP to maintain program expansions or local health care  reform initiatives, which in some states would have otherwise been  vulnerable to program cuts. Lastly, all but Texas and the District reported  they are using or planning to use the freed-up funds to help finance their  state budgets. Five states\u2014Arizona, California, Colorado, North Carolina,  and Ohio\u2014-reported using or planning to use these funds solely for this  purpose.", "For states to qualify for the increased FMAP available under the Recovery  Act, they must meet a number of requirements, including the following:     States generally may not apply eligibility standards, methodologies, or  procedures that are more restrictive than those in effect under their state  Medicaid programs on July 1, 2008.", "States must comply with prompt payment requirements.", "States cannot deposit or credit amounts attributable (either directly or  indirectly) to certain elements of the increased FMAP into any reserve or  rainy-day fund of the state.", "States with political subdivisions\u2014such as cities and counties\u2014that  contribute to the nonfederal share of Medicaid spending cannot require  the subdivisions to pay a greater percentage of the nonfederal share than  would have been required on September 30, 2008.", "Medicaid officials from many states and the District raised concerns about  their ability to meet these requirements and, thus, maintain eligibility for  the increased FMAP. While officials from several states spoke positively  about CMS\u2019s guidance related to FMAP requirements, at least nine states  and the District reported they wanted CMS to provide additional guidance  regarding (1) how they report daily compliance with prompt pay  requirements, (2) how they report monthly on increased FMAP spending,  and (3) whether certain programmatic changes would affect their  eligibility for funds. For example, Medicaid officials from several states  told us they were hesitant to implement minor programmatic changes,  such as changes to prior authorization requirements, pregnancy  verifications, or ongoing rate changes, out of concern that doing so would  jeopardize their eligibility for increased FMAP. In addition, at least three  states raised concerns that glitches related to new or updated information  systems used to generate provider payments could affect their eligibility  for these funds. Specifically, Massachusetts Medicaid officials said they  are implementing a new provider payment system that will generate  payments to some providers on a monthly versus daily basis and would  like guidance from CMS on the availability of waivers for the prompt  payment requirement. A CMS official told us that the agency is in the  process of finalizing its guidance to states on reporting compliance with  the prompt payment requirement of the Recovery Act, but did not know  when this guidance would be publicly available. However, the official  noted that, in the near term, the agency intends to issue a new Fact Sheet,  which will include questions and answers on a variety of issues related to  the increased FMAP.", "Due to the variability of state operations, funding processes, and political  structures, CMS has worked with states on a case-by-case basis to discuss  and resolve issues that arise. Specifically, communications between CMS  and several states indicate efforts to clarify issues related to the  contributions to the state share of Medicaid spending by political  subdivisions or to rainy-day funds. For example, in a May 20, 2009, letter,  CMS clarified that California would not fail to meet the provision of the  Recovery Act related to contributions by political subdivisions if a county  voluntarily used its funds to make up for a decrease in the amount the  state appropriated for the Medicaid payment of wages of personal care  service providers. Similarly, Mississippi clarified with CMS its  understanding that it would not be permissible to deposit general fund  savings resulting from the increased FMAP into the rainy-day fund in state  fiscal year 2010 in order to use those funds in state fiscal year 2011.", "Regarding the tracking of the increased FMAP, most of the states and the  District use existing processes to track the receipt of the increased FMAP  separately from regular FMAP, and almost half of the states reported using  existing processes to reconcile these expenditures. In addition, we  reviewed the 2007 Single Audits for the states and the District and  identified material weaknesses related to Medicaid, including weaknesses  related to provider enrollment processes and subrecipient monitoring, for  most of them. The Single Audits indicated that many states and the  District planned or implemented actions to correct identified weaknesses.", "According to CMS officials, CMS regional offices work with states to  address single audit findings related to Medicaid."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Are Using Highway Infrastructure Funds Mainly For Pavement Improvements and Are Generally Complying with Recovery Act Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The Recovery Act provides funding to the states for restoration, repair,  and construction of highways and other activities allowed under the  Federal-Aid Highway Surface Transportation Program and for other  eligible surface transportation projects. The act requires that 30 percent of  these funds be suballocated for projects in metropolitan and other areas of  the state. Highway funds are apportioned to the states through federal-aid  highway program mechanisms, and states must follow the requirements of  the existing program, which include ensuring the project meets all  environmental requirements associated with the National Environmental  Policy Act (NEPA), paying a prevailing wage in accordance with federal  Davis-Bacon requirements, complying with goals to ensure disadvantaged  businesses are not discriminated against in the awarding of construction  contracts, and using American-made iron and steel in accordance with Buy  America program requirements. However, the maximum federal fund  share of highway infrastructure investment projects under the Recovery  Act is 100 percent, while the federal share under the existing federal-aid  highway program is generally 80 percent.", "In March 2009, $26.7 billion was apportioned to all 50 states and the  District of Columbia (District) for highway infrastructure and other  eligible projects. As of June 25, 2009, $15.9 billion of the funds had been  obligated for over 5,000 projects nationwide, and $9.2 billion had been  obligated for nearly 2,600 projects in the 16 states and the District that are  the focus of our review.", "Almost half of Recovery Act highway obligations have been for pavement  improvements. Specifically, $7.8 billion of the $15.9 billion obligated  nationwide as of June 25, 2009, is being used for projects such as  reconstructing or rehabilitating deteriorated roads, including $3.6 billion  for road resurfacing projects. Many state officials told us they selected a  large percentage of resurfacing and other pavement improvement projects  because they did not require extensive environmental clearances, were  quick to design, could be quickly obligated and bid, could employ people  quickly, and could be completed within 3 years. For example, Michigan  began a $22 million project on Interstate 196 in Allegan County that  involves resurfacing about seven miles of road. Michigan Department of  Transportation officials told us they focused primarily on pavement  improvements for Recovery Act projects because they could be obligated  quickly and could be under construction quickly, thereby employing  people this calendar year. Since many of the environmental clearances had  been completed, Michigan could accelerate the construction of these  projects when Recovery Act funds became available. Table 4 shows  obligations by the types of road and bridge improvements being made.", "As table 4 shows, in addition to pavement improvements, $2.7 billion, or  about 17 percent of Recovery Act funds nationally, has been obligated for  pavement-widening projects. These projects provide for reconstructing  and improving existing roads as well as increasing the capacity of the road  to accommodate traffic, which can reduce congestion. In Florida, around  47 percent of Recovery Act funds were obligated for widening projects  that increase capacity, while about 9 percent was obligated for pavement  improvements such as resurfacing.", "As of June 25, 2009, around 10 percent of the funds apportioned  nationwide have been obligated for the replacement or improvement or  rehabilitation of bridges. Funding for bridge rehabilitation and  replacement has been a growing national concern since the I-35 bridge  collapse in Minnesota in 2007. Eleven of the states we visited had less  than 10 percent of their Recovery Act funds obligated for bridge  replacement and rehabilitation, while two states\u2014New York and  Pennsylvania\u2014and the District each had more than one-quarter of their  funds obligated for bridge replacement and rehabilitation. In the District,  about 36 percent of its obligations are for rehabilitating bridges, including  the District\u2019s largest Recovery Act project\u2014a bridge that has been  identified as having potentially significant safety concerns. Around 2.6  percent of apportioned funds have been obligated for construction of new  bridges.", "As of June 25, 2009, $233 million had been reimbursed nationwide by the  Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and $96.4 million had been  reimbursed to the 16 states and the District. States are just beginning to  get projects awarded so that contractors can begin work, and U.S.  Department of Transportation officials told us that although funding has  been obligated for more than 5,000 projects, it may be months before  states can request reimbursement. Once contractors mobilize and begin  work, states make payments to these contractors for completed work, and  may request reimbursement from FHWA. FHWA told us that once funds  are obligated for a project, it may take 2 or more months for a state to bid  and award the work to a contractor and have work begin. According to  FHWA, depending on the type of project, it can take days or years from the  date of obligation for those funds to be reimbursed. For example, the  North Carolina Department of Transportation (as of June 30, 2009) had  advertised 65 contracts representing $335 million in Recovery Act funding.  Of the 65 contracts, 55, representing $309 million, had been awarded; of  these contracts, 33, representing $200 million, are under way. North  Carolina has been reimbursed about $4 million of Recovery Act funding  for projects as of June 25, 2009. Approximately 27 of the 65 projects,  representing $70 million, are anticipated to be complete by December 1,  2009.", "According to state officials, because an increasing number of contractors  are looking for work, bids for Recovery Act contracts have come in under  estimates. State officials told us that bids for the first Recovery Act  contracts were ranging from around 5 percent to 30 percent below the  estimated cost. For example in California, officials reported they have had  8 to 10 bidders for each contract bid, compared with 2 to 4 bids per  contract prior to the economic downturn, and that bids are generally  coming in 30 percent below estimates. Arizona officials told us that  contractors are willing to bid for contracts with little profit margin in  order to cover overhead and put people to work, while Mississippi officials  told us that material costs had decreased. Several state officials told us  they expect this trend to continue until the economy substantially  improves and contractors begin taking on enough other work.", "Funds appropriated for highway infrastructure spending must be used as  required by the Recovery Act. States are required to do the following:    Ensure that 50 percent of apportioned Recovery Act funds are obligated  within 120 days of apportionment (before June 30, 2009) and that the  remaining apportioned funds are obligated within 1 year. The 50 percent  rule applies only to funds apportioned to the state and not to the 30  percent of funds required by the Recovery Act to be suballocated,  primarily based on population, for metropolitan, regional, and local use.  The Secretary of Transportation is to withdraw and redistribute to other  states any amount that is not obligated within these time frames.", "Give priority to projects that can be completed within 3 years and to  projects located in economically distressed areas (EDA).

As part of this certification,  the governor of each state is required to identify the amount of funds the  state plans to expend from state sources from February 17, 2009, through  September 30, 2010.", "All states have met the first Recovery Act requirement that 50 percent of  their apportioned funds are obligated within 120 days.

The percentage of funds obligated nationwide and in each  of the states included in our review is shown in figure 4.", "The second Recovery Act requirement is to give priority to projects that  can be completed within 3 years and to projects located in economically  distressed areas. Officials from almost all of the states said they  considered project readiness, including the 3-year completion  requirement, when making project selections, and, according to officials  from just fewer than half of the states, project readiness was the single  most important consideration for selecting projects. Officials from most  states reported they expect all or most projects funded with Recovery Act  funds to be completed within 3 years, with the exception of some larger or  more complex projects that may take longer to complete. For example,  Massachusetts chose to use Recovery Act funds to construct a new  highway interchange in Fall River. Although this project will take longer  than other projects to complete, Massachusetts officials said they selected  it because it was located in the state\u2019s only EDA.", "We found that due to the need to select projects and obligate funds  quickly, many states first selected projects based on other factors and only  later identified to what extent these projects fulfilled the EDA  requirement. According to the American Association of State Highway and  Transportation Officials, in December 2008, states had already identified  more than 5,000 \u201cready-to-go\u201d projects as possible selections for federal  stimulus funding, 2 months prior to enactment of the Recovery Act.  Officials from several states also told us they had selected projects prior to  the enactment of the Recovery Act and that they only gave consideration  to EDAs after they received EDA guidance from DOT. For instance,  officials in New York said that in anticipation of the Recovery Act being  enacted the state initially selected projects that were ready to go and were  distributed throughout the state, without regard to their location in EDAs.  Since then, the state has emphasized the need to identify and fund projects  in EDAs, pushing such projects to the \u201chead of the line.\u201d Officials in  Pennsylvania said they selected projects before federal guidance was  available and that after reviewing project selections for compliance with  the EDA requirement, decided to make no changes because their choices  provided the greatest potential to provide jobs in an expeditious manner.", "States also based project selection on priorities other than EDAs. State  officials we met with said they considered factors based on their own state  priorities, such as geographic distribution and a project\u2019s potential for job  creation or other economic benefits. The use of state planning criteria or  funding formulas to distribute federal and state highway funds was one  factor that we found affected states\u2019 implementation of the Recovery Act\u2019s  prioritization requirements. According to officials in North Carolina, for  instance, the state used its statutory Equity Allocation Formula to  determine how highway infrastructure investment funds would be  distributed. Similarly, in Texas, state officials said they first selected  highway preservation projects by allocating a specific amount of funding  to each of the state\u2019s 25 districts, where projects were identified that  addressed the most pressing needs. Officials then gave priority for funding  to those projects that were in EDAs.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, DOT agreed that states must give  priority to projects located in EDAs, but said that states must balance all  the Recovery Act project selection criteria when selecting projects  including giving preference to activities that can be started and completed  expeditiously, using funds in a manner that maximizes job creation and  economic benefit, and other factors. DOT stated that the Recovery Act  does not give EDA projects absolute primacy over projects not located in  EDAs. However we would note that the Recovery Act contains both  general directives, such as using funds in a manner that maximizes job  creation and economic benefit, and specific directives which we believe  must be seen as taking precedence. While we agree with DOT that there is  no absolute primacy of EDA projects in the sense that they must always be  started first, the specific directives in the act that apply to highway  infrastructure are that priority is to be given to projects that can be  completed in 3 years, and are located in EDAs.", "We also found some instances of states developing their own eligibility  requirements using data or criteria not specified in the Public Works and  Economic Development Act, as amended. According to the act, the  Secretary of Commerce, not individual states, has the authority to  determine the eligibility of an area that does not meet the first two criteria  of the act. In each of these cases, FHWA approved the use of the states\u2019  alternative criteria, but it is not clear on what authority FHWA approved  these criteria. For example:    Arizona based the identification of EDAs on home foreclosure rates and  disadvantaged business enterprises\u2014data not specified in the Public  Works Act. Arizona officials said they used alternative criteria because the  initial determination of economic distress based on the act\u2019s criteria  excluded three of Arizona\u2019s largest and most populous counties, which  also contain substantial areas that, according to state officials, are clearly  economically distressed and include all or substantial portions of major  Indian reservations and many towns and cities hit especially hard by the  economic downturn. The state of Arizona, in consultation with FHWA,  developed additional criteria that resulted in these three counties being  classified as economically distressed.", "Illinois based EDA classification on increases in the number of  unemployed persons and the unemployment rate, whereas the act bases  this determination on how a county\u2019s unemployment rate compares with  the national average unemployment rate. According to FHWA, Illinois  opted to explore other means of measuring recent economic distress  because the initial determination of economic distress based on the act\u2019s  criteria was based on data not as current as information available within  the state and did not appear to accurately reflect the recent economic  downturn in the state. Using the criteria established by the Public Works  Act, 30 of the 102 counties in Illinois were identified as not economically  distressed. Illinois\u2019s use of alternative criteria resulted in 21 counties being  identified as EDAs that would not have been so classified following the  act\u2019s criteria.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, DOT stated that the basic  approach used in Arizona and Illinois is consistent with the Public Works  Act and its implementing regulations on EDAs because it makes use of  flexibilities provided by the Act to more accurately reflect changing  economic conditions. DOT recognizes that the Public Works Act provides  the definition of EDAs that states are to follow. DOT believes, however,  that it is appropriate to interpret the requirements of the Public Works Act  flexibly by applying the EDA special needs criteria to areas that are  experiencing unemployment or economic adjustment problems. We  recognize that states may want to reflect their own particular  circumstances in defining EDAs. However, the Public Works Act states  that to apply the definition to a special needs area, the area must be one  \u201cthat the Secretary of Commerce determines has experienced or is about  to experience a special need arising from actual or threatened severe  unemployment or economic adjustment problems . . .\u201d The result of DOT\u2019s  interpretation would be to allow states to prioritize projects based on  criteria that are not mentioned in the highway infrastructure investment  portion of the Recovery or the Public Works Acts without the involvement  of the Secretary or Department of Commerce. We plan to continue to  monitor states\u2019 implementation of the EDA requirements and interagency  coordination at the federal level in future reports.", "Some states\u2019 circumstances served to largely ensure compliance with the  EDA requirement. For instance, all areas within the District of Columbia,  which the Recovery Act treats as a state, are a single EDA, assuring that  the selection of any project that can be completed within 3 years satisfies  the statutory priority rules. Mississippi has 75 of 82 counties that qualify as  EDAs, and Mississippi reported to FHWA that 87 percent of the funds  obligated to date had been obligated for to projects located in areas  classified as economically distressed. Likewise in Ohio, where 90 percent  of all counties qualify as EDAs, a substantial number of Recovery Act  highway projects are located in EDAs.", "DOT and FHWA have yet to provide clear guidance regarding how states  are to implement the EDA requirement. In February 2009, FHWA  published replies to questions from state transportation departments on its  Recovery Act Web site stating that because states have the authority to  prioritize and select federal-aid projects, it did not intend to develop or  prescribe a uniform procedure for applying the Recovery Act\u2019s priority  rules. Nonetheless, FHWA provided a tool to help states identify whether  projects were located in EDAs. Further, in March 2009, FHWA provided  guidance to its division offices stating that FHWA would support the use of  \u201cwhatever current, defensible, and reliable information is available to  make the case that  has made a good faith effort to consider  EDAs\u201d and directed its division offices to take appropriate action to  ensure that the states gave adequate consideration to EDAs. FHWA  officials we spoke with said they discussed the priority requirements with  states and that the requirements were taken into consideration when  approving projects. They also stated that whether a state has satisfied the  EDA priority requirement will not be finally determined until the funds  apportioned to the state under the Recovery Act are all obligated, which  may not be completed until 2010. According to FHWA the states have until  then to address future compliance with the EDA priority requirement. By  2010, however, it will be too late to take corrective action. In each of the  cases where a state used its own criteria, state officials told us they did so  with the approval of the FHWA division office in that state. Without  clearer guidance to the states, it will be difficult to ensure that the act\u2019s  priority provision is applied consistently.", "Finally, the states are required to certify that they will maintain the level of  state effort for programs covered by the Recovery Act. With one  exception, the states have completed these certifications, but they face  challenges. Maintaining a state\u2019s level of effort can be particularly  important in the highway program. We have found that the preponderance  of evidence suggests that increasing federal highway funds influences  states and localities to substitute federal funds for funds they otherwise  would have spent on highways. In 2004, we estimated that during the 1983  through 2000 period, states used roughly half of the increases in federal  highway funds to substitute for funding they would otherwise have spent  from their own resources and that the rate of substitution increased during  the 1990s. The federal-aid highway program creates the opportunity for  substitution because states typically spend substantially more than the  amount required to meet federal matching requirements. As a  consequence, when federal funding increases, states are able to reduce  their own highway spending and still obtain increased federal funds. As  we previously reported, substitution makes it difficult to target an  economic stimulus package so that it results in a dollar-for-dollar increase  in infrastructure investment.", "Most states revised the initial certifications they submitted to DOT. As we  reported in April, many states submitted explanatory certifications\u2014such  as stating that the certification was based on the \u201cbest information  available at the time\u201d\u2014or conditional certifications, meaning that the  certification was subject to conditions or assumptions, future legislative  action, future revenues, or other conditions. The legal effect of such  qualifications was being examined by DOT when we completed our  review. On April 22, 2009, the Secretary of Transportation sent a letter to  each of the nation\u2019s governors and provided additional guidance, including  that conditional and explanatory certifications were not permitted, and  gave states the option of amending their certifications by May 22. Each of  the 16 states and District selected for our review resubmitted their  certifications. According to DOT officials, the department has concluded  that the form of each certification is consistent with the additional  guidance, with the exception of Texas. Texas submitted an amended  certification on May 27, 2009, which contained qualifying language  explaining that the Governor could not certify any expenditure of funds  until the legislature passed an appropriation act. According to DOT  officials, as of June 25, 2009, the status of Texas\u2019 revised certification  remains unresolved. Texas officials told us the state plans to submit a  revised certification letter, removing the qualifying language. For the  remaining states, while DOT has concluded that the form of the revised  certifications is consistent with the additional guidance, it is currently  evaluating whether the states\u2019 method of calculating the amounts they  planned to expend for the covered programs is in compliance with DOT  guidance.", "States face drastic fiscal challenges, and most states are estimating that  their fiscal year 2009 and 2010 revenue collections will be well below  estimates. In the face of these challenges, some states told us that meeting  the maintenance-of-effort requirements over time poses significant  challenges. For example, federal and state transportation officials in  Illinois told us that to meet its maintenance-of-effort requirements in the  face of lower-than-expected fuel tax receipts, the state would have to use  general fund or other revenues to cover any shortfall in the level of effort  stated in its certification. Mississippi transportation officials are  concerned about the possibility of statewide, across-the-board spending  cuts in 2010. According to the Mississippi transportation department\u2019s  budget director, the agency will try to absorb any budget reductions in  2010 by reducing administrative expenses to maintain the state\u2019s level of  effort.", "Other states have faced challenges calculating an appropriate level of  effort. For example, Georgia officials told us the state does not routinely  estimate future expenditures and had to develop an alternative method for  its revised certification using past expenditures to extrapolate future  expenditures. In Pennsylvania, transportation officials told us that  calculating the amounts for the amended certification involved making  estimates over three state fiscal years and making assumptions about  proposed budgets that are subject to future legislative action.", "As discussed earlier, states using Recovery Act funds must comply with  the requirements of the federal-aid highway program, including  environmental requirements, paying a prevailing wage in accordance with  federal Davis-Bacon requirements, complying with goals to ensure  disadvantaged business enterprises are not discriminated against in  awarding construction contracts, and using American-made iron and steel  in accordance with Buy America program requirements. We discussed the  impact these requirements were having on project costs and time frames  with officials in three states. Transportation officials in Arizona,  Mississippi, and New Jersey each reported that these requirements were  not causing increases in project costs and were not delaying projects from  moving forward. For example, New Jersey officials stated that since these  requirements apply to all highway construction using federal highway  funds, not solely to Recovery Act funding, they were accustomed to  complying with these requirements and had a process in place for quickly  documenting compliance. In addition, these officials stated that to meet  the Recovery Act\u2019s requirements to spend the funds quickly, the state  selected projects that had already completed the environmental review  process or that were relatively simple projects that would have limited  environmental impact."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Fiscal Stabilization Fund", "paragraphs": ["The Recovery Act created a State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF) in part  to help state and local governments stabilize their budgets by minimizing  budgetary cuts in education and other essential government services, such  as public safety. Stabilization funds for education distributed under the  Recovery Act must be used to alleviate shortfalls in state support for  education to school districts and public institutions of higher education  (IHEs). The U.S. Department of Education (Education), the federal agency  charged with administration and oversight of the SFSF, distributes the  funds on a formula basis, with 81.8 percent of each state\u2019s allocation  designated for the education stabilization fund for local educational  agencies (LEA) and public IHEs. The remaining 18.2 percent of each  state\u2019s allocation is designated for the government services fund for public  safety and other government services, which may include education.  Consistent with the purposes of the Recovery Act\u2014which include, in  addition to stabilizing state and local budgets, promoting economic  recovery and preserving and creating jobs\u2014the SFSF can be used by  states to restore cuts to state education spending. In return for SFSF  funding, a state must make several assurances, including that it will  maintain state support for education at least at fiscal year 2006 levels. In  order to receive SFSF funds, each state must also assure it will implement  strategies to advance education reform in four specific ways as described  by Education:  1.  Increase teacher effectiveness and address inequities in the  distribution of highly qualified teachers; 2.  Establish a pre-K-through-college data system to track student  progress and foster improvement; 3.  Make progress toward rigorous college- and career-ready standards  and high-quality assessments that are valid and reliable for all students,  including students with limited English proficiency and students with  disabilities; and 4.  Provide targeted, intensive support and effective interventions to turn  around schools identified for corrective action or restructuring.", "Along with these education reform assurances, additional state assurances  must address federal requirements concerning accountability,  transparency, reporting, and compliance with certain federal laws and  regulations.", "Beginning in March 2009, the Department of Education issued a series of  fact sheets, letters, and other guidance to states on the SFSF. Specifically,  a March fact sheet, the Secretary\u2019s April letter to Governors, and program  guidance issued in April and May mention that the purposes of the SFSF  include helping stabilize state and local budgets, avoiding reductions in  education and other essential services, and ensuring LEAs and public IHEs  have resources to \u201cavert cuts and retain teachers and professors.\u201d The  documents also link educational progress to economic recovery and  growth and identify four principles to guide the distribution and use of  Recovery Act funds: (1) spend funds quickly to retain and create jobs; (2)  improve student achievement through school improvement and reform;  (3) ensure transparency, public reporting, and accountability; and (4)  invest one-time Recovery Act funds thoughtfully to avoid unsustainable  continuing commitments after the funding expires, known as the \u201cfunding  cliff.\u201d", "After meeting assurances to maintain state support for education at least  at fiscal year 2006 levels, states are required to use the education  stabilization fund to restore state support to the greater of fiscal year 2008  or 2009 levels for elementary and secondary education, public IHEs, and, if  applicable, early childhood education programs. States must distribute  these funds to school districts using the primary state education formula  but maintain discretion in how funds are allocated to public IHEs. If, after  restoring state support for education, additional funds remain, the state  must allocate those funds to school districts according to the Elementary  and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), Title I, Part A funding  formula. On the other hand, if a state\u2019s education stabilization fund  allocation is insufficient to restore state support for education, then a state  must allocate funds in proportion to the relative shortfall in state support  to public school districts and public IHEs. Education stabilization funds  must be allocated to school districts and public IHEs and cannot be  retained at the state level.", "Once education stabilization funds are awarded to school districts and  public IHEs, they have considerable flexibility over how they use those  funds. School districts are allowed to use education stabilization funds for  any allowable purpose under ESEA, the Individuals with Disabilities  Education Act (IDEA), the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act, or the  Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (Perkins Act),  subject to some prohibitions on using funds for, among other things,  sports facilities and vehicles. In particular, Education\u2019s guidance states  that because allowable uses under the Impact Aid provisions of ESEA are  broad, school districts have discretion to use education stabilization funds  for a broad range of things, such as salaries of teachers, administrators,  and support staff and purchases of textbooks, computers, and other  equipment. The Recovery Act allows public IHEs to use education  stabilization funds in such a way as to mitigate the need to raise tuition  and fees, as well as for the modernization, renovation, and repair of  facilities, subject to certain limitations. However, the Recovery Act  prohibits public IHEs from using education stabilization funds for such  things as increasing endowments; modernizing, renovating, or repairing  sports facilities; or maintaining equipment. Education\u2019s SFSF guidance  expressly prohibits states from placing restrictions on LEAs\u2019 use of  education stabilization funds, beyond those in the law, but allows states  some discretion in placing limits on how IHEs may use these funds.", "The SFSF provides states and school districts with additional flexibility,  subject to certain conditions, to help them address fiscal challenges. For  example, the Secretary of Education is granted authority to permit waivers  of state maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirements if a state certified that  state education spending will not decrease as a percentage of total state  revenues. Education issued guidance on the MOE requirement, including  the waiver provision, on May 1, 2009. Also, the Secretary may permit a  state or school district to treat education stabilization funds as nonfederal  funds for the purpose of meeting MOE requirements for any program  administered by Education, subject to certain conditions. Education, as of  June 29, 2009, has not provided specific guidance on the process for states  and school districts to apply for the Secretary\u2019s approval.", "States have broad discretion over how the $8.8 billion in the SFSF  government services fund are used. The Recovery Act provides that these  funds must be used for public safety and other government services and  that these services may include assistance for education, as well as  modernization, renovation, and repairs of public schools or IHEs.", "On April 1, 2009, Education made at least 67 percent of each state\u2019s SFSF  funds available, subject to the receipt of an application containing state  assurances, information on state levels of support for education and  estimates of restoration amounts, and baseline data demonstrating state  status on each of the four education reform assurances. If a state could not  certify that it would meet the MOE requirement, Education required it to  certify that it will meet requirements for receiving a waiver\u2014that is, that  education spending would not decrease relative to total state revenues. In  determining state level of support for elementary and secondary  education, Education required states to use their primary formula for  distributing funds to school districts but also allowed states some  flexibility in broadening this definition. For IHEs, states have some  discretion in how they establish the state level of support, with the  provision that they cannot include support for capital projects, research  and development, or amounts paid in tuition and fees by students. In order  to meet statutory requirements for states to establish their current status  regarding each of the four required programmatic assurances, Education  provided each state with the option of using baseline data Education had  identified or providing another source of baseline data. Some of the data  provided by Education was derived from self-reported data submitted  annually by the states to Education as part of their Consolidated State  Performance Reports (CSPR), but Education also relied on data from third  parties, including the Data Quality Campaign (DQC), the National Center  for Educational Achievement (NCEA), and Achieve. Education has  reviewed applications as they arrive for completeness and has awarded  states their funds once it determined all assurances and required  information had been submitted. Education set the application deadline  for July 1, 2009.

Most of the states\u2019 applications show that they plan to provide the  majority of education stabilization funds to LEAs, with the remainder of  funds going to IHEs. Several states and the District of Columbia estimated  in their application that they would have funds remaining beyond those  that would be used to restore education spending in fiscal years 2009 and  2010. These funds can be used to restore education spending in fiscal year  2011, with any amount left over to be distributed to LEAs.

Florida and Mississippi allocated  funds among their IHEs, including universities and community colleges,  using formulas based on factors such as enrollment levels. Other states  allocated SFSF funds taking into consideration the budget conditions of  the IHEs. For example, Georgia allocated funds to universities based on  the degree to which each institution\u2019s budget had been cut, and Illinois  allocated funds among universities to provide each university a share of  SFSF funds proportionate to its share of state support in fiscal year 2006.  New York provided all SFSF funds slated for IHEs to community colleges  to avoid cutting community college budgets. On the other hand, California  planned to provide SFSF funds to its state university systems and not to  community colleges because the universities had received significant  budget cuts. However, California may change this plan because budget  cuts at community colleges are now likely.", "Regarding LEAs, most states planned to allocate funds based on states\u2019  primary funding formulae.  Many states are using a state formula based on  student enrollment weighted by characteristics of students and LEAs. For  example, Colorado\u2019s formula accounts for the number of students at risk  while the formula used by the District of Columbia allocates funds to LEAs  using weights for each student based on the relative cost of educating  students with specific characteristics. For example, an official from  Washington, D.C., Public Schools said a student who is an English  language learner may cost more to educate than a similar student who is  fluent in English.", "States may use the government services portion of SFSF for education but  have discretion to use the funds for a variety of purposes. Officials from  Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, and New York reported that their states plan  to use some or most of their government services funds for educational  purposes.

However, many school district officials also reported  that using SFSF funds for education reforms was challenging given the  other more pressing fiscal needs.", "Although their plans are generally not finalized, officials in many school  districts we visited reported that their districts are preparing to use SFSF  funds to prevent teacher layoffs, hire new teachers, and provide  professional development programs. Most school districts will use the  funding to help retain jobs that would have been cut without SFSF  funding. For example, Miami Dade officials estimate that the stabilization  funds will help them save nearly two thousand teaching positions. State  and school district officials in eight states we visited (California, Colorado,  Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, and North Carolina)  also reported that SFSF funding will allow their state to retain positions,  including teaching positions that would have been eliminated without the  funding. In the Richmond County School System in Georgia, officials  noted they plan to retain positions that support its schools, such as  teachers, paraprofessionals, nurses, media specialists and guidance  counselors. Local officials in Mississippi reported that budget-related  hiring freezes had hindered their ability to hire new staff, but because of  SFSF funding, they now plan to hire. In addition, local officials in a few  states told us they plan to use the funding to support teachers. For  example, officials in Waterloo Community and Ottumwa Community  School Districts in Iowa as well as officials from Miami-Dade County in  Florida cited professional development as a potential use of funding to  support teachers.", "Although school districts are preventing layoffs and continuing to provide  educational services with the SFSF funding, most did not indicate they  would use these funds to pursue educational reform. School district  officials cited a number of barriers, which include budget shortfalls, lack  of guidance from states, and insufficient planning time. In addition to  retaining and creating jobs, school districts have considerable flexibility to  use these resources over the next 2 years to advance reforms that could  have long-term impact. However, a few school district officials reported  that addressing reform efforts was not in their capacity when faced with  teacher layoffs and deep budget cuts. In Flint, Michigan, officials reported  that SFSF funds will be used to cope with budget deficits rather than to  advance programs, such as early childhood education or repairing public  school facilities. According to the Superintendent of Flint Community  Schools, the infrastructure in Flint is deteriorating, and no new school  buildings have been built in over 30 years. Flint officials said they would  like to use SFSF funds for renovating buildings and other programs, but  the SFSF funds are needed to maintain current education programs.", "Officials in many school districts we visited reported having inadequate  guidance from their state on using SFSF funding, making reform efforts  more difficult to pursue. School district officials in most states we visited  reported they lacked adequate guidance from their state to plan and report  on the use of SFSF funding. Without adequate guidance and time for  planning, school district officials told us that preparing for the funds was  difficult. At the time of our visits, several school districts were unaware of  their funding amounts, which, officials in two school districts said, created  additional challenges in planning for the 2009-2010 school year. One  charter school we visited in North Carolina reported that layoffs will be  required unless their state notifies them soon how much SFSF funding  they will receive.

Officials at most of the IHEs we  visited told us that, due to budget cuts, their institutions would have faced  difficult reductions in faculty and staff if they were not receiving SFSF  funds. In California and North Carolina, according to the IHE officials, the  states instructed their IHEs to use the funds to cover IHE payroll expenses  in certain months in spring 2009. Other IHEs expected to use SFSF funds  in the future to pay salaries of certain employees during the year. For  example, according to an official at Hillsborough Community College in  Florida, to avoid using the nonrecurring SFSF money for recurring  expenses, the IHE expects to use the funds to pay salaries of about 400  nonpermanent adjunct faculty members. Georgia Perimeter College plans  to use its SFSF funds to retain 51 full-time and 17 part-time positions in its  science department, and the University of Georgia plans to use the funds  to retain approximately 160 full-time positions in various departments.", "Several IHEs we visited are considering other uses for SFSF funds.  Officials at the Borough of Manhattan Community College in New York  City want to use some of their SFSF funds to buy energy saving light bulbs  and to make improvements in the college\u2019s very limited space such as, by  creating tutoring areas and study lounges. Northwest Mississippi  Community College wants to use some of the funds to increase e-learning  capacity to serve the institution\u2019s rapidly increasing number of students.  Several other IHEs plan to use some of the SFSF funds for student  financial aid. For example, Hudson Valley Community College plans to use  some SFSF funds to provide financial aid to 500 or more low-income  students who do not qualify for federal Pell Grants or New York\u2019s Tuition  Assistance Program.", "Because many IHEs expect to use SFSF funds to pay salaries of current  employees that they likely would not have been able to pay without the  SFSF funds, IHEs officials said that SFSF funds will save jobs. Officials at  several IHEs noted that this will have a positive impact on the educational  environment such as, by preventing increases in class size and enabling  the institutions to offer the classes that students need to graduate. In  addition to preserving existing jobs, some IHEs anticipate creating jobs  with SFSF funds. For example, New York IHEs we spoke with plan to use  SFSF funds to hire additional staff and faculty. The University of South  Florida is considering using some SFSF money to hire postdoctoral  fellows to conduct scientific research, and Florida A&M University plans  to use the funds to hire students for assistantships. Besides saving and  creating jobs at IHEs, officials noted that SFSF monies will have an  indirect impact on jobs in the community. For example, University of  Mississippi officials noted that, without the SFSF funds, the university  probably would have shut down ongoing capital projects building  dormitories and upgrading campus heating and cooling systems, and this  would have had a negative impact on construction and engineering jobs in  the community. Jackson State University officials said SFSF monies will  help local contractors and vendors who conduct business with the  university because the funds will enable the university to recover from  severe budget cuts and resume normal spending. IHE officials also noted  that SFSF funds will indirectly improve employment because some faculty  being paid with the funds will help unemployed workers develop new  skills, including skills in fields, such as health care, that have a high  demand for trained workers.", "State and IHE officials also believe that SFSF funds are reducing the size  of tuition and fee increases. For example, Florida officials said that the 8  percent tuition increase approved by the Florida Legislature likely would  have been much higher if the state had not received SFSF funds. Officials  estimated that without SFSF funds, the increase in tuition necessary to  compensate for decreases in state funding would have been 21 percent for  students at community colleges and 35 percent for students at universities.  A University of California official stated that, if the university system had  not received SFSF funds and had to use fee increases to cover its budget  shortfall, system-wide fees would have increased by about 24 percent  instead of the approved 9.3 percent increase."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education Provided Preliminary Baseline Data to States to Ease the Application Process but Plans to Implement a New Approach for the Second Round of Applications", "paragraphs": ["U.S. Department of Education officials told us that to benchmark states\u2019  current position on the four education reform assurances and to ease the  application process, they had provided base-line data for each state and  asked states to certify their acceptance of these data as part of their  application for SFSF funding, or provide alternate data. In their  applications to Education for SFSF funds, states were required to provide  assurances that they were committed to advancing education reform in  these four areas.

One staff  member said that since many states were already poised to make  substantial progress in implementing improved data systems in the next  two years, it would not be appropriate to automatically attribute state  progress in implementing the elements of a longitudinal data system to  Recovery Act funds. Staff at the Data Quality Campaign said that they have  told Education that it was fine to use their survey as a baseline, but that  they were not comfortable with the survey becoming a primary auditing  tool; doing so could change the incentives for states to respond to the  survey.

The Recovery Act requires  these additional funds to be distributed through states to local educational  agencies (LEAs) using existing federal funding formulas, which target  funds based on such factors as high concentrations of students from  families living in poverty. In using the funds, local educational agencies are  required to comply with current statutory and regulatory requirements and  must obligate 85 percent of these funds by September 30, 2010. The  Department of Education is advising LEAs to use the funds in ways that  will build the agencies\u2019 long-term capacity to serve disadvantaged youth,  such as through providing professional development to teachers.

The Single Audit  identified a number of significant deficiencies or material weaknesses,  including continued problems with CDE ESEA Title I cash management\u2014 specifically, that CDE routinely disburses Title I funds to districts without  determining whether the LEAs need program cash at the time of the  disbursement.", "According to California officials, the California Department of Education  has developed an improvement plan to address cash management  concerns. It involves LEAs reporting federal cash balances on a quarterly  basis using a Web-based reporting system.

Youth will receive debit cards to access the account and will  receive basic financial counseling.", "Administration of summer employment activities. Many local areas are  using contracted providers to operate key aspects of the WIA summer  youth employment activities, such as recruiting youth and work sites and  administering payroll. In some cases, officials report they have been able  to extend existing contracts with their WIA year-round program service  providers to cover the stand-alone summer employment activities. In other  cases, they have conducted new competitions, in part, because they  needed additional contractors to cover the expansion of services. All  thirteen of our states applied for and received a waiver from Labor relating  to procurement requirements for youth summer employment providers.  The waivers allow local areas to expand existing competitively procured  contracts or conduct an expedited, limited competition to select service  providers.  Labor approved 10 of these waivers in April or May 2009, and  the other 3 in June 2009.", "While using contracted providers to operate the program was more  common, in a few states at least some local areas were operating the  entire program in-house. In New Jersey, for example, the local areas we  visited are relying mostly on internal staff to carry out program  responsibilities; however, one area plans to use contracted providers for  some specific roles. In Ohio, two of the four local areas we visited had  decided to operate the program in-house. Officials in one of the local areas  in Ohio told us they made the decision for two reasons\u2014they wanted to be  able to exercise greater control over the program and they were seeking to  avert staff layoffs due to funding cuts in other programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States and Local Areas Experienced Multiple Challenges in Quickly Implementing Summer Youth Employment Activities", "paragraphs": ["State and local officials reported challenges in implementing their stand- alone summer youth employment activities that generally reflected three  key themes\u2014tight time frames for implementing the program, lack of  staffing capacity to meet the expanding needs, and difficulty in  determining and documenting youth eligibility.", "Tight time frames. Many state and local officials commented that the  biggest challenge in implementing the program was the limited time frame  they had for making the program operational. Once the Recovery Act was  passed, states and local areas had only about 4 months to get their new  summer youth employment activities up and running\u2014a process that  officials told us would normally begin many months earlier. And local  areas often lacked recent experience in operating such a stand-alone  program. In implementing the year-round service requirements of WIA (in  which summer employment is a component rather than a stand-alone  program), many states and local areas had greatly reduced their summer  youth employment programs and no longer offered a stand-alone summer  program\u2014or they had found other funding sources, such as state, local, or  foundation funds, to cover it. Unlike WIA, its predecessor, the Job Training  Partnership Act, required local areas to provide a stand-alone summer  youth employment program. The local areas we reviewed represented a  mix of experiences. Those without recent experience had to build the  program from the ground up. These areas had to quickly confront many  basic decisions\u2014how to structure the program, how to recruit work sites  and participants, whether to use contracted providers (and for what  functions) or whether to administer the program in house. Other areas,  however, had well-developed summer youth employment programs. These  areas already had some of these basic structures in place, but often still  found it challenging to quickly expand their existing programs.", "Staffing capacity. Across the local areas we visited, many officials told us  staff were challenged to address the needs of the growing number of youth  they needed to serve. In some cases, states had been downsizing or did not  have the flexibility to hire additional staff due to hiring freezes and budget  cuts. For example, Essex County, New Jersey, operating with two full-time  staff, said the inability to hire additional staff posed challenges for  recruiting youth and monitoring the program. In the local areas we visited  in Ohio, the expected increases in enrollments were leaving local areas\u2019  staff stretched thin. To address this challenge, some counties were  reassigning employees from other programs to work on WIA summer  youth employment activities. One county had arranged for additional staff  to monitor the summer program by using a temporary placement agency.  Similarly, Chicago officials said that, despite having had experience in  implementing a stand-alone summer program, they found implementing  the WIA summer youth employment activities challenging because, in  order to adequately ramp up their programs and prepare for  implementation, they had to borrow staff from other sections who do not  typically work on the WIA Youth program.", "Determining and documenting youth eligibility. Several states and local  areas commented that it was challenging to determine youth applicants\u2019  eligibility and to obtain supporting documentation, especially for the  increased number of youth they are planning to serve. New Jersey officials  told us that the youth targeted for the program generally have difficulty  providing the kinds of documents required in order to prove WIA Youth  program eligibility. For example, to determine that youth meet the  eligibility requirements, local officials in New Jersey require  documentation that includes public assistance identification cards to  support total household income, birth certificates for proof of citizenship,  Social Security numbers, and documentation of selective service  registration for males age 18 and over. Officials in a few states also  expressed concern that the income eligibility standards were more  restrictive than for other programs, particularly those operated using state  funds, and that the standards may be excluding a significant number of  youth who need the services. For example, officials in Philadelphia  reported that some of their youth applicants whose parents had recently  lost their jobs were not eligible for the program because eligibility was  based on income earned during the period just prior to dislocation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Plan to Use Various Procedures to Monitor Local Areas\u2019 Summer Youth Activities", "paragraphs": ["With regard to program oversight, all 13 of our states and the District  reported they had the capacity to track and report on Recovery Act funded  WIA Youth expenditures separately from those not funded by the  Recovery Act. The states also reported plans to use a variety of procedures  to monitor local areas\u2019 summer youth employment activities, such as risk  assessments, on-site monitoring, and periodic meetings with local program  directors. For example, Ohio state officials sent a survey to the local  workforce areas in May 2009 to help identify local areas with greater risk  due to factors such as critical timing issues, larger program scope, or  substantial changes from past programs, and the state planned to initially  focus its attention on these local areas. Massachusetts state officials said  they planned to conduct on-site visits to each local workforce area at least  twice during the summer and that the state\u2019s monitoring efforts would  include file reviews of information pertaining to topics such as eligibility,  standard operating procedures, contracts, statements of work, and  subrecipient monitoring. Michigan state officials said they planned to hold  monthly meetings with all local program directors to encourage the  reporting of consistent information and that their on-site monitoring  would focus especially on private sector components of the program, such  as private sector worksites.", "Department of Labor officials said that they have efforts underway to  understand the experiences of those operating summer youth activities  through regular interaction with state and local service providers,  monitoring, identifying any issues, and providing assistance to address the  issues. For example, they said that Labor\u2019s regional offices have begun  visiting local areas to monitor and gather information and will be visiting  about two areas in each of their states this summer.

Under Department of Labor guidelines, states and  local areas are permitted to determine the specific assessment tools and  the methodology they use to determine improvements in work readiness,  but it must be measured at the beginning and completion of the summer  experience. Not all areas had finalized their plans for assessing work  readiness at the time of our visits but were considering various pre- and  post-test options. For example, officials in Mississippi plan to do a written  pre- and post-test but will also assess youth at the midpoint through an  interview with an employment adviser. All three areas we visited in  Florida plan to supplement the pre- and post-tests with feedback from  businesses and work site supervisors.", "To monitor and report on progress made in implementing the program,  Labor has instituted new reporting requirements on youth participating in  Recovery Act-funded activities.  Under WIA, states have been required to  report quarterly to Labor on aggregate counts of youth participants,  activities, and outcomes.  However, since these reports are not submitted  in time for Labor to comply with Recovery Act requirements to make  information readily available to the public, states will be required,  beginning on July 15, to submit a supplemental monthly report on youth.   In this supplemental report, states will submit aggregate counts of all  Recovery Act youth participants, including the characteristics of  participants, the number of participants in summer employment, services  received, attainment of a work readiness skill, and completion of summer  youth employment.", "In addition to Labor\u2019s reporting requirements, a few states were  developing plans for additional assessments of the program.

HUD allocated Capital Fund  formula dollars to public housing agencies shortly after passage of the  Recovery Act and, after entering into agreements with over 3,100 public  housing agencies, obligated these funds to public housing agencies on  March 18, 2009. Although HUD has allocated and obligated almost $3  billion in formula capital grants to 3,123 public housing agencies, and  1,483 agencies have begun obligating relatively less, little funding has been  drawn down by housing agencies. Specifically, as of June 20, 2009, $466  million, or 16 percent, of the funds allocated by HUD to the housing  agencies has actually been obligated by the housing agencies, and $32  million, or 1.1 percent, has been drawn down (see figure 7).", "For this report, we visited 47 public housing agencies in the 16 states and  the District of Columbia, which had received formula grant awards  totaling $531 million. These housing agencies have identified projects and  are just beginning to obligate and draw down Recovery Act funds for  project expenses. As of June 20, 2009, these public housing agencies had  obligated almost $66 million, or about 12 percent of their $531 million  allocation, and had drawn down $2.6 million, or 0.5 percent of the $531  million. Thirty of the 47 agencies had obligated funds (including 3 small  agencies and 1 medium agency that had obligated 100 percent of their  funds), indicating that contracts had been awarded and signed and that  work was beginning, of which 20 had drawn down funds (see figure 8).", "Several of the 17 public housing agencies we spoke to that had neither  obligated nor drawn down any funds stated that they had not done so  because they were awaiting approval from HUD on their plans for using  Recovery Act funds, or they were still soliciting bids and finalizing  contracts. Others were developing project plans or completing  environmental reviews. In addition, some public housing agency officials  stated that their status as a \u201ctroubled performer\u201d\u2014based on HUD\u2019s Public  Housing Assessment System (PHAS)\u2014meant they faced more oversight  and monitoring from HUD, which was preventing them from obligating the  Recovery Act funds as quickly as they would like. However, many of these  17 agencies expected to begin awarding contracts, obligating funds, and  working on projects by July 2009. This timeline is in line with HUD  headquarters officials\u2019 expectations that activity involving obligating  Recovery Act funds will increase substantially during the next quarter  (July to September 2009)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Planned Use of Recovery Act Funds by Housing Agencies", "paragraphs": ["For the 47 housing agencies that we visited, officials indicated that they  were planning to use their Recovery Act funds for various types of  activities, ranging from parking lot repaving to complete rehabilitation of  multi-unit structures. Among the most common Recovery Act project  types mentioned by public housing agency officials were roof and window  replacements; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system  upgrades or replacements; and interior rehabilitation work, such as  kitchen or bathroom renovations and flooring or carpet replacements. For  example, Athens Housing Authority in Georgia plans to replace water  heaters and kitchen cabinets at 23 scattered sites (see figure 9). According  to the public housing agencies we visited, more than 15,000 units will be  rehabilitated, including more than 1,500 vacant units.", "Relatively small-scale projects were already underway or had been  completed, such as the 10 bathroom remodels and 105 window  replacements that Ferris Housing Authority in Texas had finished. In  contrast, some major projects requiring planning and design work had yet  to begin. In fact, some public housing agencies avoided large, complex  projects because they believed the projects would take too long. However,  some of the large public housing agencies are funding major activities,  such as demolishing a public housing structure, constructing new  structures, or completely renovating hundreds of units across many  properties. For example, Philadelphia Housing Authority plans to spend  over $29 million to rehabilitate 300 vacant units at various sites\u2014one of  which is shown in figure 10\u2014and another $14.6 million to completely  reconfigure a 71-unit mid-rise building into a 53-unit building with new  community spaces, elevators, and energy-efficient electrical and  mechanical systems. Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority in Ohio is  using $12 million of Recovery Act funds to pay for part of a $65 million  redevelopment initiative that involves demolishing existing structures and  building new structures. HUD has informed housing agencies that they  may use the Recovery Act funds for demolition and construction of new  units, provided that they can meet the Act\u2019s obligation and expenditure  deadlines.", "Prioritization: The Recovery Act requires public housing agencies to give  priority to projects involving the rehabilitation of vacant units, projects  already underway or on the agency\u2019s latest 5-year plan, and projects that  could be awarded based on bids within 120 days of the Recovery Act funds  becoming available. Public housing agency officials we spoke to generally  prioritized projects that were on their 5-year plan, that could be initiated  quickly, and that were, in their judgment, the most critical projects to be  completed.", "Only a few of the largest public housing agencies we visited stated that  they had relatively large numbers of vacant units they were going to  rehabilitate. More than 1,200 of the over 1,500 vacant units that agencies  we visited had slated for rehabilitation using Recovery Act funds were  identified by just five public housing agencies: Chicago Housing Authority,  Philadelphia Housing Authority, San Francisco Housing Authority,  Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority in Ohio, and Newark Housing  Authority. However, for some agencies facing relatively few vacancies,  rehabilitating vacant units was not the highest priority in selecting  projects. Instead, they focused on meeting other Recovery Act priorities,  such as selecting projects already underway or selecting projects for  which contracts could be awarded within 120 days.", "An additional priority for public housing agencies in selecting projects was  finding ways to improve energy efficiency in their buildings. Some are  seeking to accomplish this by making exterior improvements, such as  replacing roofs, siding, or windows, while others will be replacing  appliances or HVAC equipment with more energy-efficient models. For  example, Rahway Housing Authority in New Jersey is in the process of  replacing siding on some of its buildings to increase the energy efficiency  (see figure 11). Another example of an exterior improvement is from the  District of Columbia Housing Authority. Agency officials told us they used  Recovery Act funds to install solar panels on top of one of the residential  buildings as part of its effort to \u201cgreen retrofit\u201d all the housing units in the  complex. These panels will help heat water for the building.", "Barriers and Challenges: Public housing agency officials noted a few  barriers and challenges they had confronted or anticipated related to  Recovery Act funds and projects, but in most cases no single concern was  widely shared among the officials with whom we spoke. In a few cases,  public housing agencies mentioned that they had experienced delays in  accessing their funds in HUD\u2019s Electronic Line of Credit Control System  (ELOCCS) due to problems with or confusion about the requirement to  obtain a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number and to  register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system. For  example, two housing agencies had trouble registering because their  actual location (city or county) was different from the information  associated with the DUNS number in the system. However, once agencies  were properly registered, they did not anticipate any problems using the  system. According to HUD officials, registering in the CCR has been a  substantial problem nationwide, despite efforts by HUD to communicate  these requirements to public housing agencies. HUD officials estimated  that about 380 public housing agencies (out of approximately 3,100) had  not properly registered in CCR and were therefore unable to obligate or  draw down Recovery Act funds as of June 15, 2009. HUD officials are  working with these agencies to resolve the problems as quickly as  possible.", "Another challenge raised by public housing agency officials and HUD  officials was the \u201cBuy American\u201d provision of the Recovery Act. Several  officials noted that depending on how this provision was interpreted, it  could pose a barrier to getting contracts in place and completing projects.  For example, HUD officials noted that agencies may have difficulty in  finding an adequate selection of goods and materials for improving energy  efficiency that meet the \u201cBuy American\u201d requirement and are  competitively priced. For other public housing agencies, however, this  provision was not a concern. For example, two agencies stated they had  revised their procurement policy to include \u201cBuy American\u201d requirements,  while another agency required its contractors to certify the materials they  use are American-made.", "An additional potential challenge that some officials had identified  involved the requirements HUD had placed on agencies in order to use  Recovery Act funds for administration. HUD\u2019s guidance states that public  housing agencies may use 10 percent of their grant funds for  administration but that agencies can only draw down 10 percent of each  invoice submitted for administration. In addition, one public housing  agency official stated that he expected the documentation requirements  for drawing down these funds would require so much extra work that he  believed it would be better to use non-Recovery Act funds to cover all  administration expenses and devote his agency\u2019s entire Recovery Act  award to the identified projects. HUD officials stated that these  requirements were intended to provide public housing agencies with an  incentive to use Recovery Act funds immediately on projects that would  create jobs.", "Troubled housing agencies may also experience delays in obligating and  expending Recovery Act funds. Some officials from public housing  agencies that HUD has identified as troubled performers in PHAS stated  that additional requirements placed on them by HUD had hindered these  agencies\u2019 ability to obligate and expend funds as quickly as they believe  necessary. At one public housing agency, officials stated that they were  designated as troubled because of the physical condition of their housing  units and that they were in need of the Recovery Act funding to address  these deficiencies. HUD has identified 172 housing agencies as troubled  under PHAS that will be subject to increased monitoring for the Recovery  Act. These 172 troubled housing agencies have obligated and expended  Recovery Act funds at a slower rate than the overall group of housing  agencies receiving Recovery Act funding. Specifically, troubled performing  public housing agencies were allocated nearly $186 million of Recovery  Act funding, and as of June 20, 2009, 61 (35.5 percent) of these housing  agencies had obligated $15.1 million (8 percent) and 22 (13 percent) of  these housing agencies had drawn down almost $926,000 (0.5 percent).   Overall housing agencies have obligated and expended funds at about  double this rate.", "One reason for these delays is the additional monitoring required by HUD  for housing agencies that are designated as troubled performers under  PHAS. HUD has informed these troubled public housing agencies that for  Recovery Act purposes they would receive increased monitoring and  placed them in either a high, medium, or low-risk category. Of these 172  troubled housing agencies, 106 (61.6 percent) were considered low-risk  troubled, 53 (30.8 percent) were considered medium-risk troubled, and the  remaining 13 (7.6 percent) were considered high-risk troubled. HUD has  established and is implementing a strategy for monitoring these troubled  housing agencies that have received Recovery Act funds. HUD stated to us  that they have disseminated this strategy to its field offices and it is  currently being administered to the 172 troubled housing agencies. For  example, according to HUD, all 172 troubled public housing agencies\u2014 regardless of risk category\u2014have been placed on a \u201czero threshold\u201d status  and therefore cannot draw down Recovery Act funds without HUD Field  Office approval.  HUD stated to us that the ability to place housing  agencies on \u201czero threshold\u201d has always been available, and has been used  for housing agencies that have had problems obligating and expending  their Capital Fund grants appropriately.  However, HUD has stated that  housing agencies that are troubled will be subject to additional monitoring  and oversight as deemed necessary to ensure proper uses of Recovery Act  funds. Specifically, HUD Field Offices notified troubled housing agencies  that prior to obligation of Recovery Act funding, all award documents (i.e.,  solicitations, contracts, or board resolutions, where applicable) must be  submitted to their respective Field Office for review. Further, housing  agencies that HUD considers to be high-risk troubled are to be assigned to  a HUD designated team that will provide additional monitoring, oversight  and technical assistance. HUD further stated that the effect of any  increased requirements on obligating Recovery Act funds should be short- lived since Recovery Act funds must be obligated within one year, and  much of the funds should be obligated in the next few months.", "The officials with whom we spoke generally did not anticipate that they  would face internal challenges with meeting the accelerated obligation and  expenditure requirements under the Recovery Act. Several cited the large  backlogs of projects that were ready to begin in welcoming the additional  funds. In Ohio, Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority officials stated  that they began preparing projects in December 2008 in anticipation of the  Recovery Act\u2019s passage. Two of the larger agencies, Tampa Housing  Authority and the District of Columbia Housing Authority, stated that they  had in place \u201cjob order contracting,\u201d which establishes long-term contracts  with several contractors for a variety of routine construction projects, and  they had found that this strategy aided in their ability to award contracts  quickly and begin projects. Similarly, housing agency officials we  interviewed generally did not expect to encounter any challenges meeting  the Davis-Bacon local prevailing wage requirements because they were  used to complying with Davis-Bacon."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Agencies Expect Few Monitoring Problems, and HUD Systems Can Monitor Controls And Safeguards Over Recovery Act Funds", "paragraphs": ["For public housing agencies, the responsibility for establishing and  maintaining internal controls rests with each housing agency and is  typically not part of the state\u2019s overall system of internal controls that is  discussed in other parts of the report. GAO visited 47 housing agencies in  the 16 states plus the District of Columbia to discuss what internal  controls were in place to track the appropriate use of Recovery Act funds.  The housing agencies stated that they did not anticipate internal control  problems as a result of receiving Recovery Act funds because they would  use their existing accounting systems to track the use of these funds. They  noted that they have experience with tracking funding\u2014including Capital  Fund grants awarded prior to the Recovery Act\u2014and would simply add  specific funding codes to their system to track the use of the Recovery Act  funds.", "Many housing agencies are subject to the Single Audit requirements that  have been discussed in this report. Single Audits provide federal agencies  with information on the use of federal funds, internal control deficiencies,  and compliance with federal program requirements. In addition, the HUD  Inspector General (HUD OIG) conducts audits of individual housing  agencies. Although we did not systematically review audit reports for  those housing agencies we visited and they did not anticipate problems  with monitoring Recovery Act funds, it is important to note that both  single audits and HUD OIG\u2019s audits have identified instances of internal  control deficiencies and noncompliance with HUD programs\u2014including  the Capital Fund grants provided prior to the Recovery Act. In our June  2009 report, we reported that housing agency audits do report findings of  inappropriate use and mismanagement of public housing funds, including  problems with accounting, documentation, and internal controls.  That  report recommended that HUD better leverage the information in housing  agency audits to identify emerging issues, and evaluate its overall  monitoring and oversight processes.

As recipients of Recovery Act funds,  public housing agencies are expected to track and report on jobs created  and jobs retained through projects funded by the agency. Most public  housing agencies told us they plan to collect payroll data from contractors,  existing project management systems, or Davis-Bacon wage reports to  calculate the number of jobs created and retained. Some of the public  housing agencies told us they would include job-measurement  requirements in bid specifications, so that prospective contractors would  be aware that they would have to measure jobs if they won the bid. Other  agencies said they plan to employ agency employees or public housing  residents\u2014whose jobs could be easily counted\u2014on projects funded by the  Recovery Act. While some public housing agencies viewed calculating jobs  created or retained as straightforward, others expressed concerns about  the number of work hours defining jobs created or retained. One agency  reported that they had hired a third-party firm to provide tracking and  reporting services related to the Recovery Act. The firm will provide  analyses of construction-related items and contractor payroll records to  satisfy the requirement to report on jobs created and retained with  Recovery Act funding.

Public  housing agencies are selecting projects that they expect will reduce energy  costs, support energy efficiency, and decrease usage of electricity and  water. For example, one public housing agency plans to replace older  appliances with newer, more energy-efficient models. Another agency  plans to replace all light bulbs with energy-efficient bulbs. To measure the  impact of these projects, several public housing agencies plan to compare  utility bills over time to assess the amount of dollar savings realized. One  public housing agency official told us that she plans to read the electric  meters in the public housing development to determine the change in  energy usage.", "Public housing agencies also plan to track a number of other performance  measures. Many public housing agencies told us they regularly track the  budget control, timeliness, and quality of work of projects they fund and  that they plan to continue tracking these measures with Recovery Act- funded projects. In addition, some public housing agencies monitor the  number of contracts they have with minority- and women-owned  businesses, and they expect to be able to use Recovery Act-funded  projects to continue to meet their goals of contracting with such entities.  Lastly, public housing agencies anticipate that they may see improvement  in other measures\u2014such as tenant satisfaction, occupancy rates, crime  rates, and employment among residents\u2014as a result of the projects  funded through Recovery Act funds.

If any such  deficiencies were identified, they were highlighted in the states\u2019 award  letter from BJA for Recovery Act JAG funding as special conditions  requiring resolution by the state. According to BJA, 4 of the 16 states and  the District in our review had at least one special condition requiring  resolution that prohibited them from obligating or expending funds until  the specific issues were resolved. As of June 30, 2009, 3 of these states and  the District had resolved the issues and had received written approval  from BJA releasing the funds. OJP is working with the remaining state to  resolve the issues to release the special conditions.", "With respect to monitoring grants once they are awarded, OJP\u2019s plans  include, among others, taking steps to track Recovery Act funds and  assessing the performance of projects funded by these grants. For  example, OJP\u2019s financial system allows it to track grantees\u2019 use of funds by  program and project code, where project codes align with a grantee\u2019s  program areas. As of June 30, 2009, project codes have been developed for  the JAG program for Recovery Act funds. In addition, OJP plans to  conduct programmatic, administrative, and financial monitoring of its  Recovery Act grantees. This monitoring, among other activities, includes  ongoing reviews of grantee compliance with program guidelines, as well as  on-site monitoring of grantee performance. OJP has reported plans to  conduct on-site monitoring of no less than 30 percent of open, active  Recovery Act grant funding. Further, the Office of Audit, Assessment, and  Management, within OJP, plans to collaborate with BJA to update  monitoring procedures. For example, the office plans to develop  guidance that focuses on monitoring Recovery Act grants by July 31, 2009.  In addition, this office plans to complete quarterly reports on grantee data,  such as reporting compliance with requirements to submit performance  measure data and how grantees are obligating funds, to identify grantees  not complying with reporting requirements or program guidelines to  enable timely follow-up with grantees to correct such deficiencies. In  addition to other available courses, OJP plans to develop Web-accessible  training for grantees, which are to cover topics such as Recovery Act  reporting requirements, writing grant applications, and an orientation for  new grantees. OJP also reported that it facilitated training sessions in the  spring of 2009 for its employees on topics such as grant fraud detection  and how to create grant award packages, and it has plans to facilitate  training on monitoring Recovery Act grantees during fiscal year 2009.", "In addition to two performance measures on the number of jobs created  and preserved that are to be collected under the Recovery Act, BJA  requires JAG grantees to report on additional performance measures for  the specific activities that apply to the programs being funded through the  Recovery Act. As of June 30, 2009, OJP has updated JAG program  performance measures for grants awarded with Recovery Act funds. For  example, if JAG Recovery funds are used to support a drug treatment  program, the grantee would be required to report on the number of  participants who completed the program, among other measures. BJA  requires that these reports be submitted by grant recipients within 30 days  after the end of each quarter. OJP has also developed an online  performance measurement tool for JAG grantees to use to report these  data, which it anticipates JAG fund recipients can begin to use to report on  updated measures in July 2009."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "BJA Has Approved State-Level Recovery Act JAG Awards for the District of Columbia and All States in Our Review, and Eight States Have Obligated Funds", "paragraphs": ["As of June 30, 2009, all 16 states and the District in our review have  received their state award letter from BJA.

Specifically:    Four states are early in the request for proposal (RFP) process for local  entities to apply for state pass-through funds. For example, Mississippi and  New Jersey are developing their RFPs, while Pennsylvania and Illinois are  beginning to collect proposals. New Jersey officials stated they are in the  process of developing RFPs for local jurisdictions while Mississippi  officials similarly stated they plan to have a final RFP done in time to make  awards by August 1, 2009. Pennsylvania issued its RFP on June 18, 2009,  and plans to collect proposals from local entities until July 24, 2009, while  Illinois officials stated they plan to begin soliciting applications from local  law enforcement agencies in the first part of July 2009 and plan to notify  applicants of funding recommendations in early August 2009.", "Eight states\u2014Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Massachusetts, New York,  Ohio, and Texas\u2014and the District of Columbia have received applications  or letters of intent submitted by local entities for pass-through funding and  are in the process of reviewing and in some cases also approving them.  For example, according to Colorado officials, the state received 193  applications and is reviewing them for allowable costs, budgets, and a  description of how the funds are to help create or retain jobs, among other  items. Staff are also ranking the applications in preparation for their  presentation and scoring by the state\u2019s JAG board in early July 2009. In  Massachusetts, an official noted the state is in different stages of reviewing  and finalizing agreements with state agencies that are to receive a share of  JAG funds and, for some funds, are awaiting final processing through the  state comptroller. In Ohio, officials stated they are performing compliance  reviews on the more than 500 applications received for JAG funding and  plan to notify subrecipients of their awards by July 31, 2009.", "Three states have selected potential projects for funding and are awaiting  final governing body approval. For example, according to state officials in  California, the Legislature must approve the planning document for how  JAG funds are to be used in the state in order for funds to be allocated to  local agencies, and this approval has not yet occurred as of June 30, 2009.  In North Carolina, the SAA has selected 85 eligible projects for JAG  funding and is awaiting approval by the governor to proceed with  allocating those funds. Similarly, in Michigan, an official stated that  recommendations for grant awards have been sent to the Governor\u2019s office  for final approval and that contracts are to have a July 1, 2009, start date.", "One state has finalized and approved a list of projects to receive the state\u2019s  JAG award.

BJA officials stated they intend to award all of these  local JAG funds by September 30, 2009.", "While Recovery Act JAG funds are calculated and administered using the  same rules and structure of the existing JAG program, the Recovery Act  introduces some new requirements for recipients. For example, recipients  are required to track performance measures on the number of jobs created  and preserved as a result of Recovery Act funds and must report certain  financial and programmatic information\u2014such as the amount of Recovery  Act funds expended or obligated and an evaluation of the project\u2019s  completion status\u2014to the Recovery Act central reporting Web site 10 days  after the end of each quarter.", "Officials from several of the 17 state administering agencies we visited  noted concerns about subrecipients\u2019 ability to meet the act\u2019s reporting  requirements for determining the number of jobs created and preserved,  and the majority noted challenges to meeting the 10-day deadline for  submitting quarterly reports on Recovery Act data. For example, state  officials noted the need for additional guidance on how to determine  whether JAG funds are contributing to job creation or job preservation.  Specifically, officials in three states raised questions about how, if at all,  grantees were to measure jobs that may be indirectly related to JAG fund  expenditures. For example, if a grantee purchased three new police  cruisers, how might it determine how many secondary jobs were retained  or created at the car manufacturer. On June 22, 2009, the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) issued guidance on, among other things,  how to report on job creation performance measures, which included  clarification that recipients should not attempt to report on the  employment impact on material suppliers and central service providers  (i.e., indirect jobs) that may be related to Recovery Act supported  activities.", "Further, officials from the majority of states shared concerns over the  Recovery Act requirement that recipients submit reports within 10 days of  the end of each quarter. In previous years, JAG award recipients were  required to provide programmatic reports to BJA on an annual basis\u2014 rather than on a quarterly basis, as required by the Recovery Act.  Specifically, state officials were concerned that subrecipients would not  be able to meet that deadline or that they may do so at the risk of quality  and accuracy of reporting. For example, officials in North Carolina stated  they were concerned about programs, specifically first-time subrecipients  from nonprofit and faith-based organizations, not being prepared for  compliance responsibilities, due to limitations in the numbers and  experience of staff that are to complete the reports. Officials stated that  many of the subrecipients\u2019 offices do not have the resources to prepare  detailed reporting documents. Officials in Iowa expressed similar  concerns about the 10-day reporting requirement and noted that some  potential recipients\u2014small law enforcement agencies with five or fewer  officers or staff\u2014may not apply for Recovery Act funds if they believe the  reporting requirements are burdensome relative to the amount of JAG  funds they might receive. Alternatively, officials noted that some  recipients may choose to apply for funds and then spend them quickly  because the reporting requirement ends after the funds have been  expended, reported on, and the grant closed. Officials stated they are  concerned about the accuracy of the information the administering  agencies are to receive if the data are reported so quickly. For example,  officials in Michigan noted that to meet performance measurement  reporting on time, subrecipients are to submit reports within 5 days of the  end of the quarter to allow time for the state administering agency to  prepare and submit these reports. Officials in North Carolina noted that  with an increased number of localities receiving the awards compared  with previous years, compliance with tracking and consolidating reporting  requirements is expected to be more difficult. BJA officials stated they  recognized these concerns and agreed that states may face challenges  should they have hundreds of subrecipients for pass-through funds.", "To help facilitate subrecipients in meeting the reporting requirements,  officials in many of the states and the District described plans to prepare  entities for reporting, such as conducting training, implementing Web- based reporting, and clarifying the requirements with potential  subrecipients. For instance, officials in North Carolina stated they plan to  sponsor workshops to provide additional information about the Recovery  Act reporting requirements to potential subrecipients. Officials in Illinois  stated that while they had some concerns about timely reporting, they plan  to require subrecipients to report on a monthly basis to the SAA, conduct  training for subrecipients, and transition to an electronic system to  facilitate tracking and reporting of funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The District of Columbia and States Reported Plans to Use Existing Processes to Safeguard the Use of JAG Funds", "paragraphs": ["The District of Columbia and states in our review reported they plan to use  existing grants management processes to ensure that subrecipients are  using JAG funds in accordance with BJA and Recovery Act requirements,  as can be seen in the following examples:    Arizona SAA officials reported that as an established process they used a  peer-reviewed, risk-based scoring matrix to select subrecipients that  considered, among other things, the applicant\u2019s most recent Single Audit  results, plans for evaluating the impact resulting from the use of such  funds, and funding history with the SAA including any past compliance  issues. Once grants are awarded, SAA officials stated that they have a  compliance team of six staff that are to perform ongoing financial and  programmatic compliance reviews to ensure that subrecipients comply  with grant guidance. For example, program compliance staff are to review  subrecipients\u2019 monthly and quarterly financial reports and identify any  areas of concern, such as if funds are expended too slowly or too quickly,  if there are questionable expenses, or if monthly and quarterly reports do  not agree. Financial compliance staff are to also perform annual on-site  visits that include financial audits in addition to internal controls  inspections of, among other things, the accounting system and key  financial documentation.

The SAA requires  subrecipients to provide detailed, separate monthly or quarterly financial  reports on their federal funding that includes supporting documentation  on all expenses. These financial reports and reimbursement requests are  tracked separately by the SAA in a grants management database as well as  through the District\u2019s financial system; additionally, the Office of the Chief  Financial Officer is responsible for completing separate financial reports  on each federal grant and for drawing down funds in line with grant  expenditures.", "New Jersey SAA officials reported that they plan to monitor the use of JAG  funds in several ways. First, the SAA plans to track expenditures through a  separate code in its accounting system for Recovery Act funds, as required  by the state and federal government. Second, the SAA plans to educate  subrecipients on how to comply with funding rules by holding postaward  conferences with subrecipients prior to the receipt of funds. Subsequently,  subrecipients are to be required to submit monthly financial and  programmatic reports to the SAA. Internally, the SAA plans to use existing  program and fiscal analysts to track spending and compliance with  financial and programmatic requirements. Officials said that they are  exploring ways to increase the number of staff monitoring subrecipients,  but because New Jersey is under a hiring freeze, any increase in staff to  conduct this monitoring would likely come as a result of reassignments  from other agencies or offices. Finally, SAA officials noted that an audit by  the Office of the State Auditor should provide another layer of review  regarding the use of JAG Recovery Act funds.", "Texas SAA officials report that they plan to monitor performance and  financial aspects of awarded funds to ensure that funds are used for  authorized purposes. Also, the SAA, in coordination with the Office of the  Governor\u2019s Financial Services Division, plans to able to account for, track,  and report on federal funds resulting from the Recovery Act separately  from other fund sources. According to the SAA officials, this will allow  each award to be directly tied to accounting codes to give the Governor\u2019s  office the ability to account for, track, and report separately on these  funds.

Of the 16 states and the District, 15 estimate fiscal year 2009 general fund  revenue collections will be less than in the previous fiscal year.  For  example, in Georgia, the state\u2019s net revenue collections for May 2009 were  14.4 percent less than they were in May 2008, representing a decrease of  approximately $212 million in total tax and other collections.

New York\u2019s enacted budget for fiscal  year 2009-2010 closed what state officials described as the largest budget  gap ever faced by the state.

States took a number of  actions to balance their budgets in fiscal year 2009-2010, including staff  layoffs, furloughs, and program cuts. The use of Recovery Act funds  affected the size and scope of some states\u2019 budgeting decisions, and many  of the selected states reported they would have had to make further cuts  to services and programs without the receipt of Recovery Act funds. For  example, California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan,  New York, and Pennsylvania budget officials all stated that current or  future budget cuts would have been deeper without the receipt of  Recovery Act funds.", "Recovery Act funds helped cushion the impact of states\u2019 planned budget  actions but officials also cautioned that current revenue estimates indicate  that additional state actions will be needed to balance future-year budgets.  Future actions to stabilize state budgets will require continued awareness  of the maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirements for some federal  programs funded by the Recovery Act. For example, Massachusetts  officials expressed concerns regarding MOE requirements attached to  federal programs, including those funded through the Recovery Act, as  future across-the-board spending reductions could pose challenges for  maintaining spending levels in these programs. State officials said that  MOE requirements that require maintaining spending levels based upon  prior-year fixed dollar amounts will pose more of a challenge than  upholding spending levels based upon a percentage of program spending  relative to total state budget expenditures.", "States\u2019 current uses of Recovery Act funds helped fund and maintain  staffing for existing programs. In Arizona, state budget officials said that  Recovery Act funding enabled the state to, among other things, reduce the  number of furloughs and layoffs, avoid some service reductions, maintain  the level of state employee benefit levels, and prevent some contract  delays and reductions that otherwise would have occurred. Similarly,  officials in Mississippi plan to use Recovery Act funds to help Mississippi  stabilize its budget and support local governments, particularly school  districts. For example, officials at the two local education agencies and  three institutions of higher education we visited told us that they plan to  use Recovery Act funds to avoid layoffs and hire new staff. Officials in the  District told us that because they knew the Recovery Act funds were  coming while they were developing the fiscal year 2010 budget, they did  not have to create a budget scenario in which additional actions, such as  furloughs, were necessary to fill the anticipated revenue gap. Similarly,  Colorado officials also knew early on that Recovery Act funds were  coming\u2014particularly the increased federal share of Medicaid\u2014thereby  making state funds that would have been used to pay the state share of  Medicaid available for avoiding certain budget actions including additional  furloughs. In New Jersey, although budget officials anticipated receiving  Recovery Act funds before the state finalized its 2010 budget, this did not  preclude the state from including personnel actions such as furloughs and  wage freezes to aid in closing the projected budget gap. In Iowa, for the  fiscal year 2009 budget, Recovery Act funding allowed state agencies to  avoid program cuts as well as mandatory layoffs and furloughs.", "In addition to these budget actions, some states also reported accelerating  their use of Recovery Act funds to stabilize deteriorating budgets. For  example, in Georgia, lower-than-expected revenue numbers caused the  state to use more Recovery Act funds in state fiscal year 2009 than it had  anticipated using. In Massachusetts, state officials said that accelerating  their use of Recovery Act and state rainy-day funds was the most viable  solution to balance their budget. Massachusetts officials reported that the  state had hoped to leave a sizable amount of its State Fiscal Stabilization  Fund (SFSF) allocation available for 2011 but changed its planned  approach because of its deteriorating fiscal condition. Using more of these  funds in the 2008-2009 state fiscal year may make it more difficult for the  state to balance its budget after Recovery Act funds are no longer  available. California\u2019s dire fiscal condition prompted the state to  accelerate the use of its Recovery Act funds, along with the use of a  number of additional measures to reduce the state\u2019s 2008-2009 budget gap.", "Many states, such as Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, New Jersey, and  North Carolina, also reported tapping into their reserve or rainy-day funds  in order to balance their budgets.

For example, officials had expressed some confusion about how to count  less than full-time jobs and indirect jobs. Over the last several months  OMB met regularly with state and local officials, federal agencies, and  others to gather input on the reporting requirements and implementation  guidance.

The new  guidance articulates once again that under the Recovery Act, there are two  distinct types of job reports. First, the Council of Economic Advisers  (CEA), in consultation with OMB and the Department of the Treasury, is  required to submit quarterly reports to Congress that detail the impact of  programs funded through the Recovery Act on employment, economic  growth, and other key economic indicators. In order to fulfill this mandate,  CEA has developed macroeconomic methodologies to estimate  employment effects for both the national and state levels. These macro- level employment estimates will attempt to capture the full employment  impact of the Recovery Act. OMB and federal agencies will coordinate  with CEA on these quarterly reports and other questions regarding macro- level jobs estimates.", "The second type of job report is part of the \u201crecipient reports\u201d required  under section 1512 of the Recovery Act. Specifically, section 1512(c)(3)(D)  requires recipients of Recovery Act funds to report an estimate of the  direct jobs created or retained by the Recovery Act project or activity.  These reporting requirements apply only to nonfederal recipients of  funding, including all entities receiving Recovery Act funds directly from  the federal government such as state and local governments, private  companies, educational institutions, nonprofits, and other private  organizations. However, the recipient reporting requirement only covers a  defined subset of the Recovery Act\u2019s funding. OMB\u2019s guidance, consistent  with the statutory language in the Recovery Act, states that these reporting  requirements apply to recipients who receive funding through  discretionary appropriations, not recipients receiving funds through  entitlement programs, such as Medicaid, or tax programs. Recipient  reporting also does not apply to individuals. These reports are to provide  information on direct job creation and retention, and OMB expects they  will be useful in the overall estimation and evaluation of the employment  effects of the Recovery Act, such as the employment reporting undertaken  by CEA.", "The OMB guidance also clarifies that recipients of Recovery Act funds are  required to report only on jobs directly created or retained by Recovery  Act-funded projects, activities, and contracts. Recipients are not expected  to report on the employment impact on materials suppliers (\u201cindirect\u201d  jobs) or on the local community (\u201cinduced\u201d jobs). According to OMB,  recipients are to report only direct jobs because they may not have  sufficient insight or consistent methodologies for reporting indirect or  induced jobs.

This  calculation is designed to increase consistency in reported data by  converting part-time and temporary jobs into FTE-jobs. By doing so, it  seeks to avoid overstating the number of jobs that could occur through  other methods or reporting of part-time, partial-time, or nonpermanent  jobs.", "The new guidance restates from earlier guidance the definitions of jobs  created and jobs retained. According to OMB guidance, a job created is a  new position created and filled or an existing unfilled position that is filled  as a result of the Recovery Act; a job retained is an existing position that  would have been eliminated were it not for Recovery Act funding. A job  cannot be counted as both created and retained, and only compensated  employment in the United States should be counted.", "OMB\u2019s guidance for reporting on job creation aims to shed light on the  immediate uses of Recovery Act funding; however, reports from recipients  of Recovery Act funds must be interpreted with care.

For example, the Department of  Transportation (DOT) through the Federal Highway Administration  (FHWA) has provided guidance specifying the data to be reported when  complying with the requirements in section 1201(c) of division A of the  Recovery Act, which stipulates, among other requirements, that each  highway infrastructure grant recipient submit periodic reports on the use  of the funds. For example, California state transportation officials said that  contractors will be required to report on the number of workers and  payroll amounts on a monthly basis to the California Department of  Transportation.

DOT said that grantees will not be expected to estimate employment data  other than the direct on-site jobs and noted that the reporting to FHWA is  in addition to the recipient reporting to OMB. DOT economists in  coordination with CEA plan to compute the number of indirect jobs and  induced jobs using direct on-site job data provided by the state  transportation departments.", "OMB guidance also states that federal agencies must have a process in  place for senior managers to regularly review the progress and  performance of major programs. To achieve this objective, OMB has  encouraged federal agencies to leverage their existing Senior Management  Councils to oversee Recovery Act performance. OMB states that the  councils should review Recovery Act reporting and performance across  each agency; establish and oversee development and implementation of  agency guidance to identify and mitigate risk; and ensure the correction of  weaknesses relating to the Recovery Act.

More broadly, these concerns also pertain to recipient financial  reporting in accordance with the Recovery Act and its federal reporting  vehicle, www.FederalReporting.gov, currently under development.", "Our recommendation: To strengthen the effort to track the use of funds,  the Director of OMB should (1) clarify what constitutes appropriate quality  control and reconciliation by prime recipients, especially for subrecipient  data, and (2) specify who should best provide formal certification and  approval of the data reported.", "Agency-specific guidance: DOT and FHWA have yet to provide clear  guidance regarding how states are to implement the Recovery Act  requirement that economically distressed areas (EDA) are to receive  priority in the selection of highway projects for funding.  We found  substantial variation both in how states identified areas in economic  distress and how they prioritized project selection for these areas.  As a  result, it is not clear whether areas most in need are receiving priority in  the selection of highway infrastructure projects, as Congress intended.   While it is true that states have discretion in selecting and prioritizing  projects, it is also important that this goal of the Recovery Act be met.", "Our recommendation: To ensure states meet Congress\u2019s direction to give  areas with the greatest need priority in project selection, the Secretary of  Transportation should develop clear guidance on identifying and giving  priority to economically distressed areas that are in accordance with the  requirements of the Recovery Act and the Public Works and Economic  Development Act of 1965, as amended, and more consistent procedures  for the Federal Highway Administration to use in reviewing and approving  states\u2019 criteria."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received comments on a draft of this report from the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Department of  Transportation (DOT) on our report recommendations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Office of Management and Budget", "paragraphs": ["OMB concurs with the overall objectives of GAO\u2019s recommendations made  to OMB in this report.

However, our report points out that OMB has not yet completed  critical guidance in these areas.  Unless OMB plans to change the risk  assessment process conducted for federal programs under Circular A-133,  smaller, but significantly risky programs under the Recovery Act may not  receive adequate attention and scrutiny under the Single Audit process.", "OMB acknowledged that acceleration of internal control reviews could  cause more work for state auditors, for which OMB and Congress should  explore potential options for relief. This is consistent with the  recommendations we make in this report.  OMB also noted that our draft  report did not offer a specific recommendation for achieving acceleration  of internal control reporting.  Because there are various ways to achieve  the objective of early reporting on internal controls, we initially chose not  to prescribe a specific method; however, such accelerated reporting could  be achieved in various ways.  For instance, OMB could require specific  internal control certifications from federal award recipients meeting  certain criteria as of a specified date, such as December 31, 2009, before  significant Recovery Act expenditures occur.  Those certifications could  then be reviewed by the auditor as part of the regular single audit process.   Alternatively, or in addition, OMB could require that the internal control  portion of the single audit be completed early, with a report submitted 60  days after the recipient\u2019s year end.  We look forward to continuing our  dialog with OMB on various options available to achieve the objective of  early reporting on internal controls.

In  particular, we agree with OMB\u2019s statements that it requires agencies to  post guidance and funding information to agency Recovery Act websites,  disseminates guidance broadly, and seeks out and responds to stakeholder  input. In addition, OMB is planning a series of interactive forums to offer  training and information to Recovery Act recipients on the process and  mechanics of recipient reporting and they could also serve as a vehicle for  additional communication. Moving forward and building on the progress it  has made, OMB can take the following additional steps related to funding  notification and guidance.", "First, OMB should require direct notification to key state officials when  funds become available within a state. OMB has improved Funding  Notification reports by providing a standard format across disparate  programs, making it easier for the public to track when funds become  available.  However, it does not provide an easily accessible, real-time  notification of when funds are available.  OMB recognized the shared  responsibilities of federal agencies and states in its April 3, 2009 guidance  when it noted that federal agencies should expect states to assign a  responsible office to oversee data collection to ensure quality,  completeness, and timeliness of data submissions for recipient reporting.  In return, states have expressed a need to know when funds flow into the  state regardless of which level of government or governmental entity  within the state receives the funding so that they can meet the  accountability objectives of the Recovery Act. We continue to recommend  more direct notification to (1) prime recipients in states and localities  when funds are made available for their use, and (2) states-where the state  is not the primary recipient of funds but has a statewide interest in this  information.", "Second, OMB should provide a long range time line for the release of  federal guidance. In an attempt to be responsive to emerging issues and  questions from the recipient community, OMB\u2019s preferred approach is to  issue guidance incrementally. This approach potentially produces a more  timely response and allows for mid-course corrections; however, this  approach also creates uncertainty among state and local recipients. State  and local officials expressed concerns that this incremental approach  hinders their efforts to plan and administer Recovery Act programs. As a  result, we continue to believe OMB can strike a better balance between  developing timely and responsive guidance and providing some degree of  a longer range time line so that states and localities can better anticipate  which programs will be affected and when new guidance is likely to be  issued. OMB\u2019s consideration of a master schedule and its  acknowledgement of the extraordinary proliferation of program guidance  in response to Recovery Act requirements seem to support a more  structured approach. We appreciate that a longer range time line would  need to be flexible so that OMB could also continue to issue guidance and  clarifications in a timely manner as new issues and questions emerge.", "OMB also offered suggestions for several technical clarifications which we  have made when appropriate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Department of Transportation", "paragraphs": ["DOT generally agreed to consider the recommendation that it develop  clear guidance on identifying and giving priority to economically  distressed areas and more consistent procedures for reviewing and  approving states\u2019 criteria.  As discussed in the highways section of this  report, in commenting on a draft of this report, DOT agreed that states  must give priority to projects located in economically distressed areas  (EDAs), but said that states must balance all the Recovery Act project  selection criteria when selecting projects including giving preference to  activities that can be started and completed expeditiously, using funds in a  manner that maximizes job creation and economic benefit, and other  factors. While we agree with DOT that there is no absolute primacy of  EDA projects in the sense that they must always be started first, the  specific directives in the act that apply to highway infrastructure are that  priority is to be given to projects that can be completed in 3 years, and are  located in EDAs.  DOT also stated that the basic approach used by  selected states to apply alternative criteria is consistent with the Public  Works and Economic Development Act and its implementing regulations  on EDAs because it makes use of flexibilities provided by the Public  Works Act to more accurately reflect changing economic conditions.  However the result of DOT\u2019s interpretation would be to allow states to  prioritize projects based on criteria that are not mentioned in the highway  infrastructure investment portion of the Recovery or the Public Works  Acts without the involvement of the Secretary or Department of  Commerce.
