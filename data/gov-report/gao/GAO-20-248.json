Funeral directors are  responsible for providing demographic information about the deceased  individual, while physicians, coroners, and medical examiners are  responsible for providing information on cause of death. The local  registrar of vital statistics is responsible for verifying the information, and  then transferring copies of the death certificate to the city or county health  department in some jurisdictions, and to the state registrar. The state vital  registration office is responsible for verifying the information, maintaining  official copies, and creating an electronic record. According to CDC  officials we interviewed, state vital records offices submit their death  certificate information to CDC electronically.", "In 2003, CDC revised the standard death certificate to include a checkbox  to indicate whether a woman was pregnant at the time of her death or up  to 1 year after delivery or end of pregnancy. (See fig. 3)", "The checkbox is part of the medical portion of the death certificate that is  completed by a physician, coroner, or medical examiner. According to  CDC officials, there has been staggered adoption of the revised death  certificate by states, and not every state death certificate included the  pregnancy checkbox until 2019."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CDC Has Two National Surveillance Systems Related to Maternal Mortality and Has Created a Resource to Facilitate State Efforts", "paragraphs": ["CDC collects maternal mortality data using two national surveillance  systems, NVSS and PMSS. In addition, CDC has developed a data  application that state or local MMRCs can use to centrally collect  information abstracted from various sources about each death.", "Federal law directs CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics to collect  statistics on maternal mortality. According to CDC officials, the National  Center for Health Statistics receives copies of electronic records for  deaths from all states and jurisdictions, such as the District of Columbia. It  uses this death certificate information to assign ICD-10 codes based on  the cause of death. According to CDC officials, the National Center for  Health Statistics uses these coded records to compile national vital  statistics files in NVSS, which is the source of official statistics on  mortality in the United States, including maternal deaths. NVSS data are  used to identify national trends and make international comparisons.", "CDC published national maternal mortality rates for deaths that occurred  in 2007 based on data collected in NVSS in its report on all deaths in the  United States. CDC also made these data publicly available in microdata  files that can be downloaded through website applications and, according  to officials, in response to specific requests when additional details, such  as geography, are sought. However due to staggered implementation of  the 2003 revised death certificate by the states and reliability concerns  about the use of the pregnancy checkbox, CDC officials said that as of  September 2019, they have not published NVSS statistics on maternal  mortality in the agency\u2019s annual mortality reports since the report on  deaths that occurred in 2007. For example, as specified in the technical  notes of a June 2019 CDC report on national vital statistics for deaths in  2017, CDC noted evidence of an increase in false reporting of maternal  deaths as a result of incorrect completion of the pregnancy checkbox on  death certificates. According to CDC officials, the individual who  completed the pregnancy checkbox may have incorrectly noted that a  woman was pregnant or had been pregnant within 1 year of her death,  and as a result, the death would have been recorded as a maternal death  or late maternal death. However, prior to the addition of the pregnancy  checkbox, there was a general concern that the United States was not  identifying all of the maternal deaths and thus did not have a full picture of  maternal mortality.", "According to CDC officials, the agency has recently taken steps to  improve NVSS data on maternal mortality. For example, in 2018, CDC  developed training for individuals who complete the cause of death  portion of a death certificate, and in 2019 was developing guidance on  completing the pregnancy checkbox. The agency also participated in a  quality assurance pilot from January 2016 through March 2017 with four  states, Georgia, Louisiana, Michigan, and Ohio, to test processes that  may improve state-level data on maternal mortality. The results of the  pilot were made available in articles in 2019, and CDC officials said the  agency is currently disseminating the findings from the pilot to other  states. According to agency officials, one of the findings from the pilot  was that a greater proportion of deaths where the pregnancy checkbox on  the death certificate was marked incorrectly were for women aged 45 and  older. As a result, CDC officials said they plan to use additional criteria  when classifying deaths for these women. Specifically, they will only code  the death as a maternal death or late maternal death if the cause of death  is explicitly reported on the death certificate as due to pregnancy or an  obstetric cause.", "CDC officials stated that the changes they made improved the accuracy  of data on maternal mortality, and they will implement the new reporting  criteria for 2018 data. On January 30, 2020, CDC published maternal  mortality statistics in a National Vital Statistics Report. For data on  maternal mortality accessible through CDC\u2019s website, CDC officials said  they will direct users of these data to its limitations that are noted in the  annual report. Officials said they will also publish guidance on the  limitations of the maternal mortality statistics, and they will continue to  monitor the accuracy of the data. Taking these steps to improve the  NVSS data on maternal mortality and noting their limitations should help  provide federal, state, and local organizations with accurate data. For  example, CDC notes on its CDC WONDER website that state, local, and  county health departments rely on this source of publicly accessible data  to review their community\u2019s population health trends, evaluate their  program\u2019s performance for planning purposes, and compare their  community with other locations.", "In 1986, CDC initiated a second national surveillance system for maternal  mortality, PMSS. Unlike NVSS, PMSS is exclusively focused on  pregnancy-related deaths. According to CDC, the system was developed  because more clinical classification of the causes of these deaths was  needed in order to fill data gaps and help clinicians and public health  professionals to better understand circumstances surrounding pregnancy- related deaths, including the causes and appropriate actions to prevent  them. This collection effort included expanding the scope of deaths under  surveillance to those up to 1 year after the end of pregnancy, which is  beyond the international standard of up to 42 days after the end of a  pregnancy.", "To collect the additional data, CDC officials annually send requests to  vital records offices for all 50 states and other applicable jurisdictions to  provide the following: death certificates, linked live birth or fetal death  certificates, and any other supporting information for 1) deaths with an  ICD-10 Chapter O code for the previous year, and 2) all deaths from any  cause (including injury or trauma) among women who were pregnant or  were within 1 year of pregnancy as identified by matching the death  certificate to a birth or fetal death certificate or by a pregnancy checkbox  on the death certificate. According to CDC officials and related literature,  linking information on death certificates to information on infant birth or  fetal death certificates can help confirm that the pregnancy checkbox on  the death certificate was completed accurately. In addition to confirming  validity of a pregnancy-related death as indicated by the checkbox, linking  information on death certificates to infant birth or fetal death certificates  can identify pregnancy-related deaths where the checkbox did not  indicate a pregnancy but should have (false negatives). CDC officials said  that PMSS data are considered the most reliable source of national data  on pregnancy-related deaths because (1) PMSS links death certificates  with birth or fetal death certificates and additional information when  available (e.g., hospital records), and (2) these files are reviewed by  medically trained epidemiologists to determine if the cause and time of  death are related to the pregnancy.", "CDC publishes national data from PMSS on the leading causes of  pregnancy-related deaths and pregnancy-related mortality ratios using  this system. However, the data are not published annually\u2014such as is  generally the case with NVSS data on deaths\u2014and only national level  data are made publicly available from PMSS in annual updates on the  website and periodically in reports. According to agency officials, states  and jurisdictions voluntarily provide the records in response to CDC\u2019s  request that specifies that PMSS analyses will only be published at the  national and regional level, and those records are subject to  confidentiality protections. Additionally, according to CDC officials,  because of the time involved in collecting documentation from states, the  most recent data available from PMSS as of September 2019 were for  deaths in 2016.", "To improve the timeliness of PMSS data, CDC is taking steps to gain  access directly to the records that states have been submitting to the  agency. Specifically, CDC entered into a contract, effective August 2019,  for a pilot project with the National Association for Public Health Statistics  and Information Systems to become an approved user of the State and  Territorial Exchange of Vital Events system. According to the National  Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems, this vital  events system provides timely access to state vital records, including  records on deaths, to federal and state data partners for use in authorized  public health and administrative programs, like those at CDC. According  to the contract, over the next 5 years, select CDC staff will receive  training on the use of the system and will coordinate phased access to  state and jurisdiction vital records. At the conclusion of the contract,  authorized CDC staff are expected to have access to electronic vital  records data from up to 51 states and jurisdictions. CDC officials said this  should allow them to link birth and death certificate information and no  longer rely on states and jurisdictions to conduct vital records linkages for  PMSS. According to CDC officials, being able to access the vital events  system will allow them to confirm and report pregnancy-related deaths  with improved timeliness.", "In 2017, CDC released MMRIA, in which MMRCs\u2014 multidisciplinary  committees at the state and other jurisdictional level that review  pregnancy-related deaths\u2014can collect and review data from various  sources (e.g., medical records, social service records, autopsy reports,  and vital records) to determine preventability, and identify factors that  contributed to these deaths as well as prevention strategies to address  these factors. As of June 2019, CDC officials said that 25 states and  one other jurisdiction were using this system.", "While MMRCs provide the information collected in MMRIA, federally  published reports only include aggregate information from select states  collected through the application. For example, in May 2019, CDC  published a study using information from 13 states. In the study, state  MMRCs identified an average of three to four contributing factors per  pregnancy-related death based on information collected through MMRIA,  such as:  community factors (e.g., unstable housing and limited access to  transportation); health facility factors (e.g., limited experience with obstetric  emergencies and lack of appropriate personnel or services); patient factors (e.g., lack of knowledge of warning signs and  nonadherence to medical regimens); provider factors (e.g., missed or delayed diagnosis); and  system-level factors (e.g., inadequate access to care and poor case  coordination).", "Similar to PMSS data, the most current aggregated data that CDC  publishes from the MMRIA can be for deaths that occurred 2 or more  years prior to the date of the report. As noted in the May 2019 article, the  most recent information from states contributing to the article varied with  some state data on these deaths being as recent as 2017 while the most  recent data from other states was from 2014.
