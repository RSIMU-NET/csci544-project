Among other things, CPSIA required CPSC to establish a database on the safety of consumer products that is publicly available, searchable, and accessible through the CPSC website. In response, CPSC launched SaferProducts.gov (http:// www.saferproducts.gov ) in March 2011, which has two main functions--to provide (1) a mechanism for online reporting of product safety issues and (2) the ability to search for these issues or others, such as recalls. CPSIA also required GAO to study the general utility of the website. This report examines (1) CPSC's efforts to inform the public about SaferProducts.gov, (2) who is using the website and to what extent, and (3) the extent to which consumers have found the website to be useful. To do this, GAO analyzed agency documents and data from 2011 to 2012; interviewed CPSC officials, researchers, and consumer and industry groups; reviewed federal standards, guidance, and best practices for website usability; and conducted website usability tests with 37 consumers in three locations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has used various approaches to inform the public about SaferProducts.gov, including using social media, public service announcements, and printed materials, and promoting the site during speeches and events. CPSC's efforts to inform the public about SaferProducts.gov have been part of a larger effort to raise awareness about the agency as a whole. While CPSC has employed many key practices for consumer education planning, it has not established metrics for measuring the success of its efforts. Without such metrics, the agency cannot determine which efforts have had the most impact on increasing awareness and use of the site.", "While CPSC collects some data on the category of persons, such as consumers or health care professionals, who submit reports (one of the main functions of the site), it does not collect data about who is using the site to search for information (the other main function). In addition, to minimize the reporting burden on users, CPSC has not asked for demographic data about the users (such as their age, gender, or income level). Therefore, it was difficult for GAO to assess, as mandated by Congress, whether a broad range of the public has used the site. Moreover, without such data, CPSC has been limited in its ability to target its marketing and outreach efforts to increase use of the site.", "Many consumers in GAO's usability tests thought the site generally was easy to use and had helpful information, but identified areas for improvement. The consumers generally could perform basic searches and follow instructions to report an unsafe product, and although none were aware of the site before the tests, most said they would use the site again. However, some of the search functions posed challenges. In addition, some consumers expressed concern about registering with the site and said this might prevent them from completing a report. Other consumers were not clear about the site's purpose, thinking it would focus on safe rather than unsafe products. By addressing the usability challenges GAO identified, CPSC could help users take full advantage of all the available features of SaferProducts.gov. Furthermore, cost-effective federal resources exist across the government to help agencies improve the usefulness of their sites."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["CPSC should (1) establish and incorporate metrics to assess efforts to increase awareness and use of SaferProducts.gov, (2) look for cost-effective ways of gathering additional data about site use, and (3) implement cost-effective usability improvements to the site.

In response to these concerns, Congress enacted the  Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) on August 14, 2008,  to strengthen CPSC\u2019s authority to enforce safety standards and provide  greater public access to product safety information. CPSIA required  CPSC to establish a publicly available, searchable database of consumer  and other products and substances the Commission regulates that are  reported to be unsafe.", "On March 11, 2011, CPSC launched the mandated database at  SaferProducts.gov (http://www.saferproducts.gov).

SaferProducts.gov also shows  manufacturers\u2019 comments alongside incident reports if the manufacturer  requests their comments be published. The act also requires that GAO  analyze the utility of the website, including an assessment of its use by  consumers and efforts by CPSC to inform the public about the database.  In this report, we examine (1) CPSC\u2019s efforts to inform the public about  SaferProducts.gov, (2) who has used SaferProducts.gov and to what  extent, and (3) the extent to which consumers have found  SaferProducts.gov to be useful.", "To address the first objective, we reviewed CPSC marketing materials  and budget, evaluation, and planning documents, and interviewed CPSC  officials to determine the status of the agency\u2019s efforts for  SaferProducts.gov. This included reviewing the targets of CPSC\u2019s  outreach, how the agency evaluated the outcomes of these efforts, and  any future plans. We compared CPSC\u2019s efforts with key practices for  consumer education planning identified in a prior report and interviewed  other entities (such as consumer groups) to determine what additional  steps, if any, CPSC could take to better inform the public about  SaferProducts.gov. For context, we reviewed documentation and interviewed officials about CPSC\u2019s strategies to increase overall public  awareness of the agency. To address the second objective, we analyzed  data for 2011 through 2012 on users who filed incident reports through  various methods, including SaferProducts.gov, phone, e-mail, postal mail,  and fax, and analyzed other data CPSC maintains to measure the  amount of website use. To assess data reliability, we drew on our prior  work assessing SaferProducts.gov and reviewed relevant documentation,  performed manual tests to look for errors, and interviewed CPSC officials  responsible for the data. We determined that, for the purposes of this  report, the data were sufficiently reliable. We also interviewed CPSC  officials about efforts to collect any demographic data\u2014such as age,  gender, and income\u2014about users, and reviewed existing studies,  including those by consumer groups and a law firm, related to use of  SaferProducts.gov.", "To address the third objective, we conducted website usability tests with  37 consumers in three locations\u2014Washington, D.C., Dallas, Texas, and  San Francisco, California\u2014to obtain their views on how easy it was to  use SaferProducts.gov and how helpful the information on the website  was. We chose these locations for geographic dispersion and ease of  testing. We followed the protocols and used the Washington, D.C.,  facilities of the General Services Administration (GSA) for our testing  conducted through the First Fridays Usability Testing Program. At this  location, we conducted three one-on-one tests with consumers whom  GSA recruited. We asked consumers to complete usability tasks we  developed and discuss their general experiences using the site. In the  other two locations, we worked with a contractor to recruit prospective  website testers having a mix of characteristics in terms of age, gender,  education, and ethnicity. We conducted two separate focus groups (of 8-9  consumers) in each of the other locations, asking them to complete  specified usability tasks and discuss their experiences using the website.  While the results of the tests are not generalizable to all U.S. consumers,  they provided us with in-depth interactive feedback and detailed  perspectives from a range of consumers about the usability challenges  associated with SaferProducts.gov.

In addition, 5 of the 37 consumers  who participated in our tests said that the purpose of SaferProducts.gov  was not clear based on its name and the initial information on the home  page. In our testing sessions, roughly a third of the consumers  commented that the name of the website\u2014SaferProducts.gov\u2014and the  home page did not accurately convey what consumers could and could  not do on the site. For example, when asked about their impressions of  SaferProducts.gov, over a quarter of the testers thought that they would  find information about safe products, such as a list of products that meet  certain standards or a rating of products. These consumers did not  appear to notice information on the home page indicating that they would  only find information on unsafe products (see fig. 7). In our testing  sessions, several consumers commented that the website would be more  aptly named UnsafeProducts.gov. In addition, during our one-on-one  testing sessions in Washington, D.C., two of the testers had difficulty  distinguishing between recall notices and incident reports, which serve   Likewise, although the expert evaluator from GSA  different purposes.was able to obtain a general sense of the purpose of the site, he noted  that a tagline (brief text that gives users an immediate idea of what the  site does) would help reinforce the site\u2019s purpose.", "In one testing session, a few consumers also said that it was not apparent  from looking at the home page that CPSC did not regulate certain  categories of products, such as automobiles and medications, although  more than half of the consumers in our testing sessions said at the outset  that they routinely searched online for safety information on particular  products. Similarly, none of the consumers in our testing sessions noticed  that they could be directed to the agency\u2019s main site, CPSC.gov, by  clicking on certain links in SaferProducts.gov. Only the expert evaluator  noticed that by opening a recall notice, the website user would leave  SaferProducts.gov and go to CPSC.gov.", "However, as consumers completed the various tasks in the testing  sessions, they better understood the website\u2019s features and functions. In  responding to our closing questions about their overall experiences in  using the site, most said that they would use SaferProducts.gov again  now that they were aware of it. For example, some consumers found  information about product recalls the most useful component of the site  and said they would give more weight to this information. In our testing  sessions, about one-quarter of the consumers also found value in the  incident reports, noting that they helped website users understand  whether products that had not yet been recalled had safety issues. Two of  the consumers commented that they found the content of the reports to  be more credible than other websites that provide a forum for consumer  complaints. In addition, a few consumers pointed to the amount of detail  in the reports, such as the incident description, location, and date as  particularly helpful.", "Nevertheless, because of the usability issues in the areas we identified  (for example, not having a clear and \u201cup-front\u201d statement of what the site  contains and how it can be used), consumers may not use all of the site\u2019s  available features and be dissuaded from completing and submitting  reports.

Incorporating the promotion of SaferProducts.gov  into its broader effort to increase awareness of the agency has  represented a logical approach that has prevented duplication. However,  our work confirms CPSC\u2019s perception that public awareness of  SaferProducts.gov is likely low. For example, none of the participants in  our usability tests had heard of SaferProducts.gov prior to the testing.  Although CPSC has employed many of the key practices for consumer  education planning, it has not established metrics to measure the success  of its efforts. By establishing such metrics, the agency would be better  able to determine which of its outreach efforts had the most impact on  increasing awareness and use of the site and thus could more effectively  target its limited resources to increase use of the site.", "In addition to establishing and using metrics, more data about the use of  SaferProducts.gov could help CPSC target its marketing and outreach.  Currently, CPSC collects limited data about the use of SaferProducts.gov.  For example, it collects data on the number of visitors, but not whether  they are using the site to search for information\u2014one of the main  functions of the site. It also does not collect demographic data about the  users\u2019 age, gender, or income. These types of data could help CPSC  identify groups, populations, or areas on which to focus to further  increase use of the site.", "Our usability testing with consumers identified other ways in which CPSC  may increase the use of SaferProducts.gov. Although our testing revealed  that many consumers found the site generally easy to use, it also  revealed that certain search functions, site registration, and lack of a clear  statement of purpose posed challenges for some users. By improving the  site in these areas, CPSC could help ensure that consumers take  advantage of all the features of the site and are able to search for and  report information in an easy and convenient manner. Making these  improvements also may provide CPSC with additional reports from  consumers to inform its safety assessments and other regulatory efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the awareness, use, and usefulness of SaferProducts.gov,  CPSC should take the following three actions: establish and incorporate metrics to assess efforts to increase  awareness and use of SaferProducts.gov,  look for cost-effective ways of gathering additional data about the  users and their use of SaferProducts.gov, and  implement cost-effective usability improvements to  SaferProducts.gov, taking into account the results of any existing  usability testing or any new testing CPSC may choose to conduct."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to CPSC for review and comment.

We sought to determine  whom CPSC had been targeting; how, if at all, the agency was evaluating  the outcomes of its efforts; and any future plans to promote awareness  and use of the site. We compared CPSC\u2019s efforts with criteria on key  practices for consumer education planning. We interviewed consumer  product safety experts from nine groups representing consumers,  researchers, and various industries to determine what additional steps, if  any, CPSC could take to better inform the public about  SaferProducts.gov. We identified these experts through our prior work or  based on recommendations from those we interviewed.

We conducted the tests in Washington, D.C., Dallas, Texas, and  San Francisco, California. We chose these locations for geographic  dispersion and ease of testing. We followed the protocols and used the  Washington, D.C. facilities of the General Services Administration (GSA)  for our testing conducted through the First Fridays Usability Testing  Program. At this location, GSA recruited three volunteer testers on our  behalf. Consistent with the GSA program protocols, a moderator  facilitated the testers\u2019 execution of various website tasks, such as  searching for recalled products and submitting mock incident reports. We  followed similar protocols in San Francisco and Dallas. To identify the  participants in San Francisco and Dallas, we worked with a contractor to  recruit prospective testers who had a mix of demographic characteristics.  We held two focus groups in each location, for a total of four groups. Two  groups had eight participants per group and the other two groups had  nine participants per group. In all four groups, a moderator facilitated the  testers\u2019 execution of various tasks, as was done in Washington, D.C.  Although the results of our usability tests are not generalizable to all U.S.  consumers, they provided us with in-depth, interactive feedback and  detailed perspectives from a range of website users about the usability  challenges associated with SaferProducts.gov.", "To supplement our approach, we requested and reviewed an expert  evaluation conducted by the First Fridays program manager. The GSA  official evaluated SaferProducts.gov based on the following criteria: (1)  accessibility\u2014the ability of people with physical or mental disabilities to  use the site; (2) identity and purpose\u2014whether the site clearly presents  its purpose, including what the site offers and what a user can do on it; (3)  clarity\u2014the ability to read and digest content; (4) navigation\u2014how easily  users can find information; and (5) design and content\u2014focusing on the  layout, headers, and design. Another GSA official provided a more in- depth accessibility review of SaferProducts.gov to identify issues that  users with disabilities might encounter when navigating the site.  According to GSA, although an expert evaluation can be a useful starting  point for determining a website\u2019s usability strengths and weaknesses, the  expert evaluation emphasizes the importance of the user experience.
