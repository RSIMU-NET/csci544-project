Congress has made it clear, through enactment of a statutory framework with the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 as its centerpiece, that it expects agencies to improve their accountability for resources, including human resources, in accomplishing agency missions. In addition, the National Performance Review (NPR), now called the National Partnership for Reinventing Government, in 1993, recommended that agencies reduce by half the costs of administrative positions, including personnel positions, by 1999.", "Between September 1993 and September 1997, the number of civilian personnelists across government decreased by about 8,900 employees (or about 21 percent). In order to gain an understanding of the initial effects of this reduction, we reviewed four major federal departments to (1) describe the activities they have undertaken in restructuring personnel offices and operations; (2) ascertain what, if any, performance measures are in place to gauge results of the restructuring efforts; and (3) identify issues agencies may commonly encounter when, in restructuring their personnel operations, they consider outsourcing automated personnel and/or payroll services to another agency or the private sector.", "The four departments whose personnel offices we reviewed were the Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Health and Human Services (HHS), the Interior (DOI), and Veterans Affairs (VA), which together employ roughly one-fourth of the nonpostal federal workforce. These four departments provide or plan to provide personnel or payroll services to other federal agencies. All four departments took slightly different approaches to streamlining personnel operations and were in the early stages of implementing restructuring plans in late 1997, when we were completing our work. We use the term \u201crestructuring\u201d broadly to capture major changes occurring in an organization, including reorganizations, consolidations, downsizing (reducing the size of the workforce), quality improvements, streamlining efforts, the use of new technologies, and reengineering personnel processes, such as the process used to hire employees."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In the 1990s, Congress constructed a statutory framework to address long-standing weaknesses in federal operations, improve federal management practices, and provide greater accountability for the use of resources and achieving results. This framework included as its essential elements the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 and key financial management and information technology reform legislation: the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990\u2014as expanded by the Government Management Reform Act of 1994\u2014and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, respectively.", "In 1993, NPR recommended to the President that agencies reduce by half the costs related to central management control positions, by 1999. NPR targeted administrative costs and positions, such as managers, personnel specialists, budget analysts, procurement specialists, and other headquarters staff positions to reduce administrative layers at headquarters and streamline field structures. NPR estimated that these central control positions cost about $35 billion a year in salaries and benefits. To achieve NPR\u2019s streamlining goals, in 1994, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) required agencies to prepare streamlining plans detailing, in addition to other things, how they planned to reduce these targeted positions.", "The typical federal personnel office carries out a wide range of functions related to the management of an organization\u2019s people, from the time they apply for a position to the time they leave. This includes establishing policies and carrying out activities, many of which are prescribed by federal law. The range of personnel functions generally includes, but is not limited to, recruitment and employment (including workforce diversity), classification (i.e., determining the appropriate grade and classification series of a position), merit promotion, and employee and labor relations. A personnel office collects and maintains data related to the employment process. Personnel activities include such tasks as advertising positions to be filled, verifying candidate information, processing paperwork on health insurance and other employee benefits, and processing paperwork on employee discipline and promotions.", "Although agencies use automation to store and analyze various pieces of personnel information (e.g., employees\u2019 occupations, grades, and performance ratings) and process payroll data, personnel administration has been largely a paper-based, labor-intensive operation, as often is the case with administrative functions. Each year, hundreds of federal personnel offices process millions of personnel actions that affect the federal workforce of almost 1.9 million civilian, nonpostal employees. For example, nearly every official personnel action affecting a specific employee, such as a promotion, begins with the preparation of a Standard Form 52, \u201cRequest for Personnel Action.\u201d And when the request is approved, it is followed by the preparation of a Standard Form 50, \u201cNotification of Personnel Action.\u201d Figure 1 shows various processes that typically are included in personnel operations.", "Federal efforts to reduce administrative overhead positions, including personnel, somewhat parallel streamlining efforts in the private sector. For example, human resource managers in the private sector have been asked to integrate the company\u2019s personnel management practices with its business goals and objectives while also providing cost-effective, traditional personnel services. Private sector human resource managers increasingly are expected to quantify their operations\u2019 return on investment or what \u201cvalue-added\u201d the function provides. In the federal sector, cost concerns have forced managers to reexamine the role of the personnel function and its relationship as a support function to the mission of the agency. For example, the Results Act recognizes the importance of human resource management as a key element for achieving performance goals as part of agencies\u2019 strategic and annual performance plans. We have suggested that agencies\u2019 performance plans that contain a description of how workforce knowledge, skills, and abilities can contribute to the achievement of program performance goals would be most useful to congressional decisionmakers.", "In addition to the reexaminations that are taking place about the role of the personnel function and its relationship to mission accomplishment, the departments\u2019 restructuring efforts also were taking place within a context of evolving concerns about the federal human resource management system\u2019s statutory and regulatory framework. These concerns, which have been expressed by agencies, OPM, NPR, and Congress, center on striking the best balance among the priorities of managerial flexibility and decentralization on the one hand, and systemwide consistency and adherence to merit principles on the other. How these priorities are balanced and any changes to current regulatory or statutory requirements may have important implications for federal human resource management and personnel offices, as well as how personnel services are provided to line managers.", "In planning how to restructure personnel operations and what personnel processes to automate, agencies are now required by the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 to reassess their work processes to determine whether their administrative and mission-related business processes should be improved before investing in major information systems to support them. As federal agencies decide how to streamline administrative support functions, they must choose among options for providing automated personnel and payroll services. Such options include purchasing personnel and/or payroll services from another government agency (or franchise, also called cross-servicing) or contracting with the private sector."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To meet our first objective in this self-initiated review\u2014to describe the activities that have taken place in restructuring personnel offices and operations\u2014we first surveyed 24 CFO agencies (as designated by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990), which employ most executive branch employees\u2014to identify those that were restructuring personnel operations. These 24 CFO agencies represent about 97 percent of the nonpostal, full-time workforce of the executive branch. From among those that were restructuring personnel operations, we reviewed USDA, DOI, HHS, and VA to obtain further information about restructuring activities at these agencies. We selected these agencies primarily because they said they were using business process reengineering as an approach to restructuring and/or were providing or planning to provide personnel and payroll services to other agencies. We interviewed personnel officials from the four departments and selected component agencies to obtain information on the reasons for restructuring, the planning in preparation for restructuring, the activities undertaken to restructure, and the status of restructuring efforts. We also reviewed the restructuring plans of the four departments and component agencies. (The component agencies we reviewed are listed in app. I.)", "To address our second objective\u2014to ascertain what, if any, performance measures are in place to gauge the results of restructuring activities\u2014we discussed with responsible officials of the four departments and component agencies whether their organizations had or were developing measures to assess the performance of the restructured personnel offices and operations. Where measures were said to exist, we reviewed the documentation that described and supported the measure. In addition, to better understand the major issues associated with restructuring personnel operations and performance measurement, we reviewed current literature on the two subjects and spoke with performance measurement experts from the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) and the Saratoga Institute.", "In connection with our second objective, we computed one common measure\u2014the personnel servicing ratio\u2014to assess progress in restructuring. To compute the ratios, we obtained September 1993 and September 1997 data from OPM\u2019s Central Personnel Data File (CPDF) on the number of employees and personnelists at the 24 agencies we surveyed. These personnelists were in the federal Personnel Management and Industrial Relations occupational group\u2014GS-200s\u2014that NPR specifically targeted for reduction. We used the NPR definition of personnel specialist with the understanding that some agencies classify some employees working in personnel offices in other occupations, such as program analysts (GS-345) or management analysts (GS-343). In addition, all personnel specialists in the GS-200 group may not have worked in personnel offices; some may have worked in allied offices, such as training and counseling.", "To address our third objective\u2014to identify issues agencies may commonly encounter as they consider purchasing automated personnel and payroll services\u2014we interviewed officials from the departments and component agencies who were involved in the development or purchase of computer hardware and/or software for use in personnel/payroll operations. We obtained information from these interviews on the decision processes for acquiring new technology, the challenges that surface in acquiring new technology, and the status of implementing the new technology at their departments and agencies.

Other major factors were the governmentwide reality of operating with reduced budgets, exemplified by a succession of budget agreements between Congress and the administration, as well as the requirement in the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act to reduce governmentwide full-time equivalent positions. USDA was also responding to 1994 legislation that directed it to reorganize and to reduce its workforce. There were also cases, such as VA, where the departments or their agencies started their restructuring efforts to improve customer service before governmentwide efforts began in the 1990s. In deciding how to restructure, each department had to confront its own particular set of circumstances and challenges.", "As of late 1997, officials in each of the four departments characterized the status of their personnel office restructuring as generally nearing the end of its initial stages of implementation.

In contrast to the large reductions in the number of personnelists, however, the personnel servicing ratios for the departments, except for DOI, did not change as substantially from September 1993 to September 1997 because of downsizing in other parts of the agencies. For example, although USDA reduced the number of personnelist by 17 percent, USDA\u2019s personnel servicing ratio decreased from 55 employees served by 1 personnelist (55:1) to 54 employees served by 1 personnelist (54:1), which was still below the federal average of 56 employees served by 1 personnelist (56:1).

To this end, each department was developing or purchasing new technology for automating personnel transactions. In some cases, the departments had begun to automate the processes for classifying and staffing positions, which streamlined those processes and reduced the time necessary to process certain transactions, such as employee hiring and promotions. However, across all four departments, much of the new automation was not in place even though personnel staff reductions had occurred.", "As of late 1997, the departments were behind their original milestones for implementing the new personnel and payroll systems. For example, USDA officials were deciding whether to provide an automated \u201cfront-end processing\u201d supplement to its core payroll/personnel system by developing software in-house or purchasing commercially available software. Pilot tests of both software products were planned to develop information on which to base the decision. HHS\u2019 Program Support Center, which is to serve all of HHS, was converting its existing system to use commercially available software to upgrade its personnel and payroll system, as well as testing the converted system. DOI had been developing a system for processing personnel and payroll transactions, including automating SF-52s, since the late-1980s, but it was not fully operational departmentwide as of January 1998. VA had rescheduled the opening of its national service center from September 1997 to March 1998 to allow more time for programming and testing the new information system. However, VA officials remained confident that the new system would be implemented departmentwide by December 1999, as projected, because key implementation steps were being done in parallel rather than in sequence.", "Officials of the four departments and their agencies told us that efforts to upgrade technology have been resource intensive and have taken longer than expected. Specifically, some officials said that when restructuring efforts began they had not fully appreciated the need to (1) assess existing automated systems before making changes, (2) have technology in place before downsizing personnel staff, and (3) allow sufficient time for testing the new technology. One option these officials recommended to other agencies to facilitate the conversion process was to consider purchasing commercially available software rather than building new personnel information and payroll systems in-house. Few commercial software programs suitable to the departments\u2019 needs, according to officials at two departments, were available when the departments began to develop their automated systems in-house.", "Further complicating the system delays in the agencies is their need to comply with the Year 2000 date conversion. In both the public and private sectors, the way dates are recorded and computed in many computer systems is at the root of the Year 2000 compliance problem. For the past several decades, systems have typically used two digits to represent the year, such as \u201c97\u201d representing 1997, to conserve electronic data storage space and reduce operating costs. With this two-digit format, however, the year 2000 is indistinguishable from 1900, 2001 from 1901, and so on. As a result of this ambiguity, system or application programs that use dates to perform calculations, comparisons, or sorting may generate incorrect results. Payroll and personnel information systems and programs clearly fit those categories. All four departments were aware of this problem and were taking steps to address the issue.

For example, data were not usually gathered to measure the costs of personnel and payroll processes or the level of satisfaction customers had with the quality and timeliness of the services they received.

As previously stated, the departments had all fallen behind schedule in bringing their proposed systems to operational status. This situation had already affected the plans of certain agencies to obtain services. For example, DOI had agreed to provide payroll services to DOE if it were feasible to build an interface with DOE\u2019s human resource information system under development using commercially available software. Upon completion of a feasibility study, DOI estimated that it would take at least 15 months beyond the scheduled delivery date to provide payroll services to DOE because of the need to develop a computer interface. DOI estimated that the interface would cost at least $3.4 million to develop and between $450,000 and $675,000 annually to operate. Because of the estimated time lag in the delivery of services and the associated costs, DOE decided to cancel its agreement with DOI. DOE plans to upgrade its existing payroll system and develop its own interface to DOE\u2019s new HR system, which, according to DOE officials, is Year 2000 compliant.", "The situation of an agency waiting for an uncertain length of time to receive automated services is further complicated by the need for all agencies to comply with the Year 2000 date conversion.

However, agency officials told us that the available information on operational performance and costs for personnel and payroll services from other federal agencies were limited (e.g., information on whether the systems work together without costly interfaces). This lack of information may be due in some measure to the less-than-fully operational status of new systems that agencies may be installing to provide cross-servicing or franchise services, such as was the status in the four departments we reviewed. The four departments had limited processes to routinely capture specific costs of their personnel and payroll activities but were beginning to capture more cost data.

Upgrading system technology was a primary element of the restructuring plans because the departments planned to increase operating efficiencies and improve services by automating paper-based personnel processes. Each department reduced the number of personnelists it employed, with reductions ranging from 14 percent at HHS to 41 percent at DOI. Each department as well was working to improve its automated systems. However, the automation efforts were not completed as planned before reductions in personnel staffing occurred. Automation efforts had not been fully implemented throughout the departments, as of late 1997.", "Although some agencies were beginning to develop and implement performance measures for personnel operations, it was difficult for them to assess the performance of their restructured personnel offices because the offices generally lacked baseline measures to gauge changes in performance. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 requires federal agencies to assess how well they are performing and to do so with appropriate performance measures. Without performance measures, departments and agencies will be unable to determine the timeliness of personnel services, the satisfaction levels of those who use the services, and other attributes that they may associate with personnel operations. Because personnel offices, regardless of department or agency, generally carry out the same activities, some performance measures would appear to have widespread application across agencies, could be used to compare performance among agencies, and could help to identify best practices in the delivery of federal personnel services. Performance measures also provide a benchmark to assess the effectiveness of reform efforts such as those taken by the four departments we examined.", "The lagging schedule at the four departments in upgrading the personnel and payroll systems has had consequences beyond the four, since each department is providing or plans to provide personnel and payroll services to other agencies. An agency may sign up to use these services, in part, because its own personnel information and payroll systems are not Year 2000 compliant. As discussed earlier, DOE changed its plans to use DOI\u2019s payroll services. One of the factors, which influenced that decision, was the high cost to develop and maintain the DOI interface with DOE\u2019s new HR information system. The second factor was DOE\u2019s lack of a \u201ccomfort zone\u201d between the projected date to complete the interface and the year 2000, in the event delays were encountered in developing and testing the interface, since DOE\u2019s payroll system was not Year 2000 compliant. It is imperative that payroll and personnel information systems, which use dates for many computations and analyses, be Year 2000 compliant or that the agencies have some backup means of accurately making the necessary computations when 2000 arrives.", "As agencies decide to use alternative approaches for delivering personnel and payroll services, such as cross-servicing arrangements, they will need to be assured that the services they are to receive under these arrangements can and will meet their data and information needs. The administration has recognized that a governmentwide framework for cross-servicing arrangements is needed as agencies restructure personnel operations. OPM\u2019s Human Resources Technology Council has begun to focus interagency efforts to develop such a framework. Agency officials have suggested that the framework could include consistent policies, data formatting requirements, and pricing structures for cross-servicing. The Council\u2019s current efforts do not include developing common performance measures.

In fact, to be most effective, we would expect that work on our two recommendations would be done in tandem, thus building synergies from efforts at both agency and governmentwide levels. As OMB points out in its letter, the Merit Systems Protection Board has noted that 24 federal agency strategic plans identified at least one specific human resource management objective and one or more implementing strategies, and about half of those plans included performance measures that could be used to assess whether the objectives were being met. We also point out in our report that agencies were making progress in developing performance measures for their personnel operations. Given the level of investment in new HR information systems and the movement to cross-servicing among agencies for HR and payroll services, we continue to believe that it is important that agencies move quickly to develop baseline measures to gauge their progress and performance.

We identified and focused on the 24 agencies that have financial reporting responsibilities under the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act. These 24 agencies represent about 97 percent of the career, full-time employees of the executive branch, and account for over 99 percent of the federal government\u2019s net dollar outlay in fiscal year 1996. We surveyed officials in the 24 agencies, asking a series of questions such as (1) which administrative functions, if any, were being restructured and what methods were used to restructure; (2) how they were measuring or planned to measure the results of these efforts; and (3) whether new technology (computer hardware and/or software) was part of the restructuring plan. Information the officials provided to our questions served as the basis for selecting the four departments we reviewed.

The personnel officials we interviewed were from the central offices of the departments and agencies, and regional and other field offices. Specifically, at the field level, we interviewed personnel officials of the Bureau of Reclamation in Denver, Colorado; the Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Indian Health Service in Albuquerque, New Mexico; the Bureau of Land Management\u2019s state office in Santa Fe, New Mexico; and the Veterans Health Administration in Bath, New York.", "In addition, we reviewed the restructuring plans and other documentation on restructuring provided by the four departments and their agencies.

Where departments and agencies had developed performance measures, we examined documents to determine what measures had been developed. In addition, since the restructuring and integration of human resource management is an evolving area in the private and public sectors, we reviewed current literature and spoke with experts in the human resource management area, including officials from NAPA and the Saratoga Institute, to develop an understanding of the major issues associated with restructuring personnel operations and performance measurement.", "In discussing performance measures with the officials, we learned that the one measure the departments and agencies all used was the personnel servicing ratio, which compares the number of employees to the number of personnelists serving them. To compute personnel servicing ratios for the four departments and governmentwide and to determine how those ratios may have changed because of restructuring, we obtained September 1993 and September 1997 data from OPM\u2019s Central Personnel Data File (CPDF). The CPDF is a database that contains individual records for most civilian federal employees and is a primary source of information on the civilian workforce of the executive branch. Data in the CPDF are supplied by the individual departments and agencies. We did not verify the data we obtained from the CPDF database, although we have a review in process that is examining the reliability of the CPDF database in general.", "In obtaining information on staffing from the CPDF, we extracted data governmentwide and for each of the 24 CFO agencies, which employ most of the nonpostal civilian employees in the executive branch. In addition, when extracting data on the staffing of personnel offices, we identified only employees in occupational series GS-200-299, Personnel Management and Industrial Relations, which was the personnel series that NPR had targeted for downsizing. We did not determine whether all of those who were in the occupational series worked in a personnel office; some unknown number may have worked in other human resource organizations such as training offices. On the other side, we did not identify employees who worked in personnel offices but who were not in the GS-200 occupational series; for example, we did not identify secretaries and clerks who worked in personnel offices. We extracted CPDF data on all employees, including part-time and temporary employees. The staffing numbers we use in this report provide approximate rather than exact reflections of the changes in staffing (overall and in personnel offices) at the four departments and governmentwide. Alternative definitions of whom to count as personnelists could change the personnel servicing ratio.", "Finally, to address our third objective (i.e., to identify issues agencies encountered as they purchased automated personnel and payroll services from another agency or the private sector), we interviewed officials from the departments and component agencies who were involved in the development and/or purchase of new technology (hardware and software) for personnel and/or payroll operations. From these interviews, we obtained information on decision processes for acquiring new technology, the challenges that surface in acquiring new technology, and status of technology implementation. To observe agencies\u2019 new technology, we visited the Natural Resources Conservation Service\u2019s automation test site in Riverdale, Maryland, and the operations of automated administrative service centers in Topeka, Kansas (operated by VA); Denver, Colorado (operated by DOI); and Rockville, Maryland (operated by HHS).
