The  commission recommended, among other things, that watch-list matching  be performed by the federal government rather than by air carriers.  Consistent with this recommendation and as required by law, TSA has  undertaken to develop a program\u2014Secure Flight\u2014to assume from air  carriers the function of watch-list matching.

The matching settings include   (1) the relative importance of each piece of passenger information (e.g.,  name versus date of birth); (2) the numeric threshold over which a  passenger will be flagged as a potential match (e.g., a scoring threshold of  95 would result in fewer matches than a scoring threshold of 85); and   (3) the criteria used to determine whether an element of passenger  information is a potential match to the watch list (e.g., the types of name  variations or the date-of-birth range that the system considers a match).  The Secure Flight matching system will use this information to assign each  passenger record a numeric score that indicates its strength as a potential  match to a watch-list record.", "Raising the scoring threshold would result in more names cleared and  fewer names identified as possible matches, which would raise the risk of  the subject of a watch-list record being allowed to board an airplane  (false-negative matches). Conversely, lowering the scoring threshold  would raise the risk of passengers being mistakenly matched to the watch  list (false-positive matches).

For the Secure Flight program,  TSA plans to use the existing redress process that is managed by the DHS  Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (TRIP). TRIP, which was established in  February 2007, serves as the central processing point within DHS for  travel-related redress inquiries. TRIP refers redress inquiries submitted by  airline passengers to TSA\u2019s Office of Transportation Security Redress  (OTSR) for review. This process provides passengers who believe their  travels have been adversely affected by a TSA screening process with an  opportunity to be cleared if they are determined to be an incorrect match  to watch-list records, or to appeal if they believe that they have been  wrongly identified as the subject of a watch-list record. Specifically, air  travelers who apply for redress and who TSA determines pose no threat to  aviation security are added to a list that should automatically \u201cclear\u201d them  and allow them to board an aircraft (the \u201ccleared list\u201d), thereby reducing  any inconvenience experienced as a result of the watch-list matching  process. After a review of the passenger\u2019s redress application, if OTSR  determines that an individual was, in fact, misidentified as being on the  No-Fly or Selectee list, it will add the individual to the cleared list. If OTSR  determines that an individual is actually on the No-Fly or Selectee list, it  will refer the matter to the Terrorist Screening Center, which determines  whether the individual is appropriately listed and should remain on the list  or is wrongly assigned and should be removed from the list.", "Although Secure Flight will use the same redress process that is used by  the current air carrier-run watch-list matching process, some aspects of  the redress process for air travelers are to change as the program is  implemented. For example, individuals who apply for redress are issued a  redress number by TRIP that they will be able to submit during future  domestic air travel reservations that will assist in the preclearing process  before they arrive at the airport. TSA expects this will reduce the  likelihood of travel delays at check-in for those passengers who have been  determined to pose no threat to aviation security. According to TSA  officials, individuals who have applied for redress in the past and were  placed on the cleared list will need to be informed of their new ability to  use their redress number to preclear themselves under Secure Flight.  These officials stated that they intend to send mailings to past redress  applicants with information on this change.", "TSA has also coordinated with key stakeholders to identify and document  shared redress processes and to clarify roles and responsibilities,  consistent with relevant GAO guidance for coordination and  documentation of internal controls. In addition, Secure Flight, TSA  OTSR, and TSA\u2019s Office of Intelligence (OI) have jointly produced  guidance that clarifies how the entities will coordinate their respective  roles in the redress process, consistent with GAO best practices on  coordinating efforts across government stakeholders.", "See GAO/GGD/AIMD-99-69. TSA OI is responsible for disseminating the cleared list. guidance clarifies the roles and responsibilities for each entity with  respect to reviewing potential watch-list matches.", "Furthermore, TSA is developing performance measures to monitor the  timeliness and accuracy of Secure Flight redress, as we recommended in  February 2008. TRIP and OTSR\u2019s performance goals are to process  redress applications as quickly and as accurately as possible. In February  2008, we reported that TRIP and OTSR track only one redress  performance measure, related to the timeliness of case completion. We  further reported that by not measuring all key defined program objectives,  TRIP and OTSR lack the information needed to oversee the performance  of the redress program.

For example, the  Secure Flight Final Rule requires air carriers to (1) collect date-of-birth  information from airline passengers and (2) be capable of collecting  redress numbers from passengers. Collecting date-of-birth information  should improve the system\u2019s ability to correctly match passengers against  watch-list records since each record contains a date of birth. TSA  conducted a test in 2004 that concluded that the use of date-of-birth  information would reduce the number of false-positive matches. In  addition, airline passengers who have completed the redress process and  are determined by DHS to not pose a threat to aviation security can submit  their redress number when making a flight reservation. The submission of  redress numbers by airline passengers should reduce the likelihood of  passengers being mistakenly matched to watch list records, which in turn  should reduce the overall number of false-positive matches.", "TSA has established a performance measure and target for the system\u2019s  false-positive rate, which should allow the agency to track the extent to  which it is minimizing false-positive matches and whether the rate at any  point in time is consistent with the program\u2019s goals. TSA officials stated  that they tested the system\u2019s false-positive performance during Secure  Flight\u2019s parallel testing with selected air carriers in January 2009 and  found that the false-positive rate was consistent with the established target  and program\u2019s goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Condition 3: Efficacy and Accuracy of the System and Stress Testing", "paragraphs": ["Condition 3 requires TSA to demonstrate the efficacy and accuracy of the search tools  used as part of Secure Flight and to perform stress testing on the Secure Flight  system.", "We addressed efficacy and accuracy separately from stress testing  because they require different activities and utilize different criteria.", "Efficacy and Accuracy of the System  TSA has generally achieved the part of Condition 3 that requires TSA to  demonstrate the efficacy and accuracy of the search tools used as part of  Secure Flight. According to TSA, as a screening system, Secure Flight is  designed to identify subjects of watch-list records without generating an  unacceptable number of false-positive matches. To accomplish this goal,  TSA officials stated that Secure Flight\u2019s matching system and related  search parameters were designed to identify potential matches to watch- list records if a passenger\u2019s date of birth is within a defined range of the  date of birth on a watch-list record. According to TSA officials, the  matching system and related search parameters were designed based on  TSA OI policy and in consultation with TSA OI, the Federal Bureau of  Investigation, and others.", "TSA conducted a series of tests\u2014using a simulated passenger list and a  simulated watch list created by a contractor with expertise in watch-list  matching\u2014that jointly assessed the system\u2019s false-negative and false- positive performance. However, in conducting these tests, the contractor  used a wider date-of-birth matching range than TSA used in designing the  Secure Flight matching system, which the contractor determined was  appropriate to test the capabilities of a name-matching system. The tests  showed that the Secure Flight system did not identify all of the simulated  watch-list records that the contractor identified as matches to the watch  list (the false-negative rate). Officials from TSA OI reviewed the test  results and determined that the records not matched did not pose an  unacceptable risk to aviation security. These officials further stated that  increasing the date-of-birth range would unacceptably increase the  number of false positives generated by the system.", "Moving forward, TSA is considering conducting periodic reviews of the  Secure Flight system\u2019s matching capabilities and results (i.e., false  positives and false negatives) to determine whether the system is  performing as intended. However, final decisions regarding whether to  conduct such reviews have not been made. Relevant guidance on internal  controls identifies the importance of ongoing monitoring of programs,  documenting control activities, and establishing performance measures to  assess performance over time. By periodically monitoring the system\u2019s  matching criteria as well as documenting and measuring any results to  either (1) confirm that the system is producing effective and accurate  matching results or (2) modify the settings as needed, TSA would be able  to better assess whether the system is performing as intended. Without  such activities in place, TSA will not be able to assess the system\u2019s false- negative rate, which increases the risk of the system experiencing future  performance shortfalls. Given the inverse relationship between false  positives and false negatives\u2014that is, an increase in one rate may lead to a  decrease in the other rate\u2014it is important to assess both rates  concurrently to fully test the system\u2019s matching performance. In our  January 2009 briefing, we recommended that TSA periodically assess the  performance of the Secure Flight system\u2019s matching capabilities to  determine whether the system is accurately matching watch-listed  individuals while minimizing the number of false positives. TSA agreed  with our recommendation.", "Separate from the efficacy and accuracy of Secure Flight search tools, a  security concern exists. Specifically, passengers could attempt to provide  fraudulent information when making an airline reservation to avoid  detection.

In our January 2009 briefing to the Senate and  House Appropriations Committees\u2019 Subcommittees on Homeland Security,  we reported that TSA had generally not achieved this part of the condition  because despite provisions for stress testing in Secure Flight test plans,  such stress testing had not been performed at the time DHS certified that  it had met the 10 statutory conditions, or prior to the completion of our  audit work on December 8, 2008. However, TSA has since generally  achieved this part of the condition.", "According to the Secure Flight Test and Evaluation Master Plan, the  system was to be stress tested in order to assess performance when  abnormal or extreme conditions are encountered, such as during periods  of diminished resources or an extremely high number of users. Further,  the Secure Flight Performance, Stress, and Load Test Plan states that the  system\u2019s performance, throughput, and capacity are to be stressed at a  range beyond its defined performance parameters in order to find the  operational bounds of the system. In lieu of stress testing, program  officials stated that Release 2 performance testing included \u201climit testing\u201d  to determine if the system could operate within the limits of expected  peak loads (i.e., defined performance requirements). According to the  officials, this testing would provide a sufficient basis for predicting which  system components would experience degraded performance and  potential failure if these peak loads were exceeded. However, in our view,  such \u201climit testing\u201d does not constitute stress testing because it focuses on  the system\u2019s ability to meet defined performance requirements only, and  does not stress the system beyond the requirements. Moreover, this \u201climit  testing\u201d did not meet the provisions for stress testing in TSA\u2019s own Secure  Flight test plans. Program officials agreed that the limit testing did not  meet the provisions for stress testing in accordance with test plans and  revised program test plans and procedures for Release 3 to include stress  testing.", "Beyond stress testing, our analysis at the time of our January 2009 briefing  showed that TSA had not yet sufficiently conducted performance testing.  According to the Secure Flight Test and Evaluation Master Plan,  performance and load tests should be conducted to assess performance  against varying operational conditions and configurations. Further, the  Secure Flight Performance, Stress, and Load Test Plan states that each test  should begin within a limited scope and build up to longer runs with a  greater scope, periodically recording system performance results. These  tests also should be performed using simulated interfaces under real-world  conditions and employ several pass/fail conditions, including overall  throughput. However, Secure Flight Release 2 performance testing was  limited in scope because it did not include 10 of the 14 Secure Flight  performance requirements. According to program officials, these 10  requirements were not tested because they were to be tested as part of  Release 3 testing that was scheduled for December 2008. Moreover, 2 of  the 10 untested performance requirements were directly relevant to stress  testing. According to program officials, these 2 requirements were not  tested as part of Release 2 because the subsystems supporting them were  not ready at that time. Further, the performance testing only addressed the  4 requirements as isolated capabilities, and thus did not reflect real-world  conditions and demands, such as each requirement\u2019s competing demands  for system resources. Program officials agreed and stated that they  planned to employ real world conditions in testing all performance  requirements during Release 3 testing.", "In our January 2009 briefing, we recommended that TSA execute  performance and stress tests in accordance with recently developed plans  and procedures and report any limitations in the scope of the tests  performed and shortfalls in meeting requirements to its oversight board,  the DHS Investment Review Board. Since then, based on our analysis of  updated performance, stress, and load test procedures and results, we  found that TSA has now completed performance testing and significantly  stress tested the vetting system portion of Secure Flight. For example, the  stress testing demonstrated that the vetting system can process more than  10 names in 4 seconds, which is the system\u2019s performance requirement.

This is important  because Release 3 is the version that is to be placed into production.  Moreover, Release 3 provides for (1) a change in the Secure Flight  operating environment from a single operational site with a \u201chot\u201d backup  site to dual processing sites where each site processes passenger data  simultaneously, and (2) the eSecure Flight Web portal, which provides an  alternative means for air carriers to submit passenger data to Secure  Flight.

In addition, TSA had not updated or  completed certain security documents for Release 3, such as its security  plan, disaster recovery plan, security assessment report, and risk  assessment, nor had it certified and accredited Release 3 of the Secure  Flight environment it plans to put into production. Further, TSA had also  not demonstrated that CBP had implemented adequate security controls  over its hardware and software devices that interface with the Secure  Flight system to ensure that Secure Flight data are not vulnerable to abuse  and unauthorized access.", "Finally, TSA had not corrected 6 of 38 high- and moderate-risk  vulnerabilities identified in Release 1 of the Secure Flight program. For  example, TSA did not apply key security controls to its operating systems  for the Secure Flight environment, which could then allow an attacker to  view, change, or delete sensitive Secure Flight information. While TSA  officials assert that they had mitigated 4 of the 6 uncorrected  vulnerabilities, we determined the documentation provided was not  sufficient to demonstrate that the vulnerabilities were mitigated.

For example, TSA had completed security testing of the  most recent release of Secure Flight (Release 3), updated security  documents, certified and accredited Release 3, received an updated  certification and accreditation decision from CBP for its interface with the  Secure Flight program, and mitigated the high- and moderate-risk  vulnerabilities related to Release 1. In addition, TSA had prepared plans of  actions and milestones (POA&M) for the 28 high-risk and 32 moderate-risk  vulnerabilities it identified during security testing of Release 3. The  POA&Ms stated that TSA would correct the high-risk vulnerabilities within  60 days and the moderate-risk vulnerabilities within 90 days.

According to  TSA, the agency has modified the CAPPS rules to address air carriers  operating in states with unique transportation needs and passengers who  might otherwise regularly trigger primary selectee status. However, our  review found that TSA lacked data on the effect of its modifications on air  carrier selectee rates.

Specifically, while TSA had made  improvements to its life-cycle cost estimate and schedule, neither were  developed in accordance with key best practices outlined in our Cost  Assessment Guide. Our research has identified several practices that are  the basis for effective program cost estimating. We have issued guidance  that associates these practices with four characteristics of a reliable cost  estimate: comprehensive, well documented, accurate, and credible. The  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) endorsed our guidance as being  sufficient for meeting most cost and schedule estimating requirements. In  addition, the best practices outlined in our guide closely match DHS\u2019s own  guidance for developing life-cycle cost estimates. Reliable cost and  schedule estimates are critical to the success of a program, as they provide  the basis for informed investment decision making, realistic budget  formulation, program resourcing, meaningful progress measurement,  proactive course correction, and accountability for results.", "As we reported at our January 2009 briefing, Secure Flight\u2019s $1.36 billion  Life Cycle Cost Estimate (LCCE) is well documented in that it clearly  states the purpose, source, assumptions, and calculations. However, it is  not comprehensive, fully accurate, or credible. As a result, the life-cycle  cost estimate does not provide a meaningful baseline from which to track  progress, hold TSA accountable, and provide a basis for sound investment  decision making. In our January 2009 briefing, we recommended that DHS  take actions to address these weaknesses. TSA agreed with our  recommendation.", "The success of any program depends in part on having a reliable schedule  specifying when the program\u2019s set of work activities will occur, how long  they will take, and how they relate to one another. As such, the schedule  not only provides a road map for the systematic execution of a program,  but it also provides the means by which to gauge progress, identify and  address potential problems, and promote accountability. As we reported in  January 2009, the November 15, 2008, TSA\u2019s Integrated Master Schedule  (IMS) for Secure Flight\u2014which provided supporting activities leading up  to the program\u2019s initial operations in January 2009\u2014was a significant  improvement over its February 2008 version. For example, after meeting  with GAO and its schedule analysis consultant, TSA took actions to  improve the Secure Flight schedule, including adding initial efforts for  domestic and international cutover activities, removing constraints that  kept its schedule rigid, and providing significant status updates.", "Our research has identified nine practices associated with effective  schedule estimating, which we used to assess Secure Flight. These  practices are: capturing key activities, sequencing key activities,  establishing duration of key activities, assigning resources to key  activities, integrating key activities horizontally and vertically, establishing  critical path, identifying float time, performing a schedule risk analysis,  and distributing reserves to high risk activities. In assessing the  November 15, 2008, schedule against our best practices, we found that  TSA had met one of the nine best practices, but five were only partially  met and three were not met. Despite the improvements TSA made to its  schedule for activities supporting initial operational capability, the  remaining part of the schedule associated with implementing Secure Flight  for domestic and international flights was represented as milestones  rather than the detailed work required to meet milestones and events. As  such, the schedule was more characteristic of a target deliverable plan  than the work involved with TSA assuming the watch-list matching  function. Moreover, likely program completion dates were not being  driven by the schedule logic, but instead were being imposed by the  program office in the form of target dates. This practice made it difficult  for TSA to use the schedule to reflect the program\u2019s status. Without fully  employing all key scheduling practices, TSA cannot assure a sufficiently  reliable basis for estimating costs, measuring progress, and forecasting  slippages. In our January 2009 briefing, we recommended that DHS take  actions to address these weaknesses. TSA agreed with our  recommendation.", "In January 2009, TSA provided us with a new schedule, dated December  15, 2008. Our analysis showed that this new schedule continued to not  follow best practices, did not correct the deficiencies we previously  identified, and therefore could not be used as a reliable management tool.  For example, a majority of the scheduled activities did not have baseline  dates that allow the schedule to be tracked against a plan moving forward.  In addition, best practices require that a schedule identify the longest  duration path through the sequenced list of key activities\u2014known as the  schedule\u2019s critical path\u2014where if any activity slips along this path, the  entire program will be delayed. TSA\u2019s updated schedule did not include a  critical path, which prevents the program from understanding the effect of  any delays. Further, updating the Secure Flight program\u2019s schedule is  important because of the significant cost and time that remains to be  incurred to cutover all domestic flights to operations as planned by March  2010 and to develop, test, and deploy the functionality to assume watch- list matching for international flights.", "After we submitted a copy of our draft report to DHS for formal agency  comment on March 20, 2009, TSA provided us its plan of action, dated  April 2009, that details the steps the Secure Flight program management  office intends to carry out to address weaknesses that we identified in the  program\u2019s cost and schedule estimates. With regard to the program\u2019s cost  estimate, TSA\u2019s plan has established a timeline of activities that, if  effectively implemented, should result in (1) a more detailed work  breakdown structure that would define the work necessary to accomplish  the program\u2019s objectives; (2) the cost estimate and schedule work  breakdown structures being aligned properly; (3) an independent cost  estimate performed by a contractor; (4) an assessment of the life-cycle  cost estimate by the DHS Cost Analysis Division; and (5) cost uncertainty  and sensitivity analyses. In addition, TSA\u2019s plan has estimated government  costs that were originally missing from its cost estimate. According to  TSA, these costs will be addressed in its life-cycle cost estimate  documentation.", "With regard to the Secure Flight program\u2019s schedule, TSA\u2019s plan of action  has established a timeline of activities that, if effectively implemented,  should result in, most notably: (1) a sequenced and logical schedule that  will accurately calculate float time and a critical path; (2) a fully resource- loaded schedule based on subject-matter-expert opinion that does not  overburden resources; (3) a schedule that includes realistic activity  duration estimates; and (4) a schedule risk analysis that will be used by  TSA leadership to distribute reserves to high-risk activities. According to  TSA, this revised schedule will forecast the completion date for the project  based on logic, duration, and resource estimates rather than artificial date  constraints.", "The plan of action provides the Secure Flight program management office  with a clearer understanding of the steps that need to be taken to address  our concerns regarding the Secure Flight life-cycle cost estimate and  schedule. Based on our review of the plan and the associated  documentation provided, we therefore now consider this legislative  requirement to be conditionally achieved and the related  recommendations that we made at our January 2009 briefing to be met. It  should be noted that a significant level of effort is involved in completing  these activities, yet the actions\u2014with the exception of the independent  cost estimate\u2014are planned to be completed by June 5, 2009. According to  TSA, the independent cost estimate is to be completed by October 2009.", "While TSA\u2019s ability to fully meet the requirements of Condition 10 does not  affect the Secure Flight system\u2019s operational readiness, having reliable  cost and schedule estimates allows for better insight into the management  of program resources and time frames as the program is deployed.

TSA addressed this principle by  issuing privacy notices that define a specific purpose for the collection of  passenger information. According to TSA privacy notices, the purpose of  the Secure Flight Program is to identify and prevent known or suspected  terrorists from boarding aircraft or accessing sterile areas of airports and  better focus passenger and baggage screening efforts on persons likely to  pose a threat to civil aviation, to facilitate the secure and efficient travel of  the public while protecting individuals\u2019 privacy.", "The Data Quality principle states that personal information should be  relevant to the purpose for which it is collected, and should be accurate,  complete, and current as needed for that purpose. TSA addressed this  principle through its planned use of the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s (DHS) Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (TRIP), collecting  information directly from passengers, and setting standard data formats.  More specifically, TSA is planning to use DHS TRIP as a mechanism to  correct erroneous data. TSA also believes that relying on passengers to  provide their own name, date of birth, and gender will further help ensure  the quality of the data collected. Moreover, TSA has developed a  Consolidated User Guide that provides standard formats for air carriers to  use when submitting passenger information to reduce variance and  improve data quality. We reported previously that the consolidated  terrorist watch list, elements of which are matched with passenger data to  make Secure Flight screening decisions, has had data- quality issues.  However, this database is administered by the Terrorist Screening Center  and is not overseen by TSA.", "The Openness principle states that the public should be informed about  privacy policies and practices, and that individuals should have a ready  means of learning about the use of personal information. TSA addressed  this principle by publishing and receiving comments on required privacy  notices. TSA has issued a Final Rule, Privacy Impact Assessment, and  System of Records Notice that discuss the purposes, uses, and protections  for passenger data, and outline which data elements are to be collected  and from whom. TSA obtained and responded to public comments on its  planned measures for protecting the data a passenger is required to  provide.", "The Individual Participation principle states that individuals should have  the following rights: to know about the collection of personal information,  to access that information, to request correction, and to challenge the  denial of those rights. TSA addressed this principle through its planned  use of DHS TRIP and its Privacy Act access and correction process. As  previously mentioned, TSA plans to use DHS TRIP in order to allow  passengers to request correction of erroneous data. Passengers can also  request access to the information that is maintained by Secure Flight  through DHS\u2019s Privacy Act request process. As permitted by the Privacy  Act, TSA has claimed exemptions from the Privacy Act that limit what  information individuals can access about themselves. For example,  individuals will not be permitted to view information concerning whether  they are in the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB). However, TSA has  stated that it may waive certain exemptions when disclosure would not  adversely affect law enforcement or national security.", "The Use Limitation principle states that personal information should not  be used for other than a specified purpose without consent of the  individual or legal authority. TSA addressed this principle by identifying  permitted disclosures of data and establishing mechanisms to ensure that  disclosures are limited to those authorized. The Secure Flight system  design requires that data owners initiate transfers of information, a  provision that helps to assure that data is being used only for specified  purposes. According to TSA privacy notices, the Secure Flight Records  system is intended to be used to identify and protect against potential and  actual threats to transportation security through watch-list matching  against the No-Fly and Selectee components of the consolidated and  integrated terrorist watch list known as the Terrorist Screening Database.  TSA plans to allow other types of disclosures, as permitted by the Privacy  Act. For example, TSA is permitted to share Secure Flight data with  federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, foreign, or international agencies  responsible for investigating, prosecuting, enforcing, or implementing a  statute, rule, regulation, or order regarding a violation or potential  violation of civil or criminal law or regulation; and international and foreign governmental authorities in accordance with law  and formal or informal international agreements.", "The Collection Limitation principle states that the collection of personal  information should be limited, should be obtained by lawful and fair  means, and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the  individual. TSA addressed this principle by conducting a data-element  analysis, developing a data retention schedule, and establishing technical  controls to filter unauthorized data and purge data. TSA has performed a  data element analysis to determine the least amount of personal  information needed to perform effective automated matching of  passengers with individuals on the watch list. As a result, TSA has limited  collection by only requiring that passengers provide their full name,  gender, and date of birth. In addition, TSA requires air carriers to request  other specific information, such as a passenger\u2019s redress number, and to  provide TSA with other specific information in the airline\u2019s possession,  such as the passenger\u2019s passport information. TSA established a data- purging control to rid the system of data according to its data-retention  schedule. Further, TSA established technical controls to filter  unauthorized data to ensure that collection is limited to authorized data  fields. TSA is also developing a data-retention schedule which was issued  for public comment and is in accordance with the Terrorist Screening  Center\u2019s National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)\u2014- approved record-retention schedule for TSDB records.", "The Accountability principle states that individuals controlling the  collection or use of personal information should be accountable for taking  steps to ensure the implementation of these principles.
