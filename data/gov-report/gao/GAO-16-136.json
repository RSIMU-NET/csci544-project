This report addresses, among other objectives, (1) GSA's role in identifying and reducing underutilized leased vehicles and (2) the extent to which the processes used by selected federal agencies facilitate the identification and removal of underutilized leased vehicles, and any cost savings that could be achieved by reducing underutilized vehicles. GAO selected five agencies using factors such as fleet size, and analyzed over 15,500 fiscal-year 2014 vehicle records. At the five agencies, GAO surveyed fleet managers with at least 20 leased vehicles; reviewed fleet policies and guidance; and interviewed federal officials. These findings are not generalizable to all agencies or fleet managers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The General Services Administration (GSA) provides guidance to agencies to assist them in reducing underutilized leased vehicles. This guidance can be written (such as bulletins) or advice from GSA's fleet service representatives (FSR) to agency fleet managers. FSRs assist agencies with leasing issues, and GSA expects its FSRs to communicate with fleet managers about vehicle utilization at least annually. However, 18 of 51 fleet managers GAO surveyed reported that they had never spoken to their FSR about vehicle utilization. GSA has no mechanism to ensure these discussions occur and therefore may miss opportunities to help agencies identify underutilized vehicles.", "While the selected agencies\u2014the Air Force, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Park Service (NPS) and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA)\u2014took steps to manage vehicle utilization, their processes did not always facilitate the identification and removal of underutilized vehicles. Certain selected agencies (1) could not determine if all vehicles were utilized, (2) could not locate justifications for vehicles that did not meet utilization criteria, or (3) kept vehicles that did not undergo or pass a justification review. These agencies paid GSA about $8.7 million in fiscal year 2014 for leased vehicles that were retained but did not meet utilization criteria and did not have readily available justifications (see table).", "Of the selected agencies, NASA and VHA did not apply their utilization criteria to nearly 400 vehicles, representing about $1.2 million paid to GSA in fiscal year 2014. However, these agencies have taken steps to rectify the issue. The Air Force, BIA, NPS, and VHA could not readily locate justifications for over 1,500 leased vehicles that did not meet utilization criteria, representing about $5.8 million. BIA and NPS are planning action to ensure justifications are readily available in the future. As of May 2015, NPS and VHA had retained more than 500 vehicles\u2014costing $1.7 million in fiscal year 2014\u2014that were not subjected to or did not pass agency justification processes. While costs paid to GSA may not equal cost savings associated with eliminating vehicles, without justifications and corrective actions, agencies could be spending millions of dollars on vehicles that may not be needed."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that GSA develop a mechanism to help ensure that FSRs speak with fleet managers about vehicle utilization, that the Air Force and VHA modify their processes for vehicle justifications, and that NPS and VHA take corrective action for vehicles that do not have readily accessible written justification or did not pass a justification review. Each agency concurred with the recommendations and discussed actions planned or underway to address them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2014, federal agencies paid over $1 billion to lease over  186,000 vehicles from the General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) Fleet  Leasing program to carry out agencies\u2019 missions. Ranging from busses to  compact sedans, these vehicles transport personnel, haul equipment, and  ferry clients to agency-provided service locations, among other activities.  GSA\u2019s Fleet Leasing Program (GSA Fleet) is responsible for meeting the  vehicle leasing needs of federal agencies. As the lessor, GSA Fleet  collects information on leased vehicles\u2014such as fuel use, vehicle type,  and mileage\u2014from a variety of sources, including vehicle manufacturers  and fleet cards (i.e., credit cards used by agencies to purchase fuel and  other services). This information is offered to federal agencies to help  them make critical fleet management decisions, including whether or not  to eliminate vehicles. From fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2014, the total  amount paid by agencies for GSA-leased vehicles decreased from $1.06  billion to $1.03 billion, but the actual number of leased vehicles grew  slightly. In recent years, Members of Congress and the President have  raised questions about the size and cost of the federal fleet, and  legislative proposals have been aimed at reducing the size and cost of  agencies\u2019 fleets.", "As agencies continue to seek opportunities to reduce costs associated  with their vehicle fleets, it is important to understand the practices used to  assess the utilization of leased vehicles and the ways in which those  practices may hinder or enhance opportunities for agencies to reduce  costs associated with their fleet sizes. You asked us to review federal  leased-vehicle data and agencies\u2019 efforts to measure vehicle utilization.  This report addresses: (1) the extent to which GSA data on leased  vehicles are reliable, (2) GSA\u2019s role in identifying and reducing  underutilized leased vehicles, and (3) the extent to which the assessment  processes used by selected federal agencies facilitate the identification  and removal of underutilized leased vehicles, and any cost savings that  could be achieved by reducing any underutilized vehicles.", "To determine the extent to which GSA\u2019s data on leased vehicles are  reliable, we reviewed documentation of GSA\u2019s efforts to ensure the  reasonableness of data in two databases: Drive-thru and FAST (Federal  Automotive Statistical Tool). For the purposes of this review, reliability is  defined by two key components: reasonableness and indications of  accuracy. While there is no single federal criterion for determining  reasonableness, we assessed reasonableness by comparing GSA  practices against federal internal control standards; Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) guidance; and GAO standards for  assessing data reliability set forth in prior GAO work. See appendix I for  more details on how we defined reasonableness. We also evaluated  Drive-thru for indications of accuracy. Specifically, we analyzed  approximately two dozen Drive-thru data elements from May 2015\u2014such  as odometer readings, vehicle identification numbers (VINs), and type of  fuel purchased.", "To determine GSA\u2019s role in identifying and reducing underutilized leased  vehicles, we reviewed applicable federal laws, fleet management  regulations, GSA\u2019s fleet guidance, and other pertinent GSA  documentation and described GSA\u2019s role based on the responsibilities  delineated in these documents. We also administered a survey regarding  the frequency and helpfulness of utilization-related conversations held  between GSA Fleet Service Representatives (FSR) and leasing  customers (i.e., agency fleet managers or personnel with similar  responsibilities) to a non-generalizable selection of 68 leasing customers  from five agencies. More details on our selection process are included in  appendix I. We received 51 responses (a 75 percent response rate).  While not generalizable to all of GSA\u2019s leasing customers or the five  agencies that we reviewed, the survey responses provide insight into  interactions between agency officials and FSRs. These were the same  five agencies that we selected to examine agencies\u2019 utilization processes:  the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Air  Force (Air Force), and the Veterans Heath Administration (VHA). BIA and  NPS are both sub-agencies under of the Department of the Interior  (Interior), and VHA is a sub-agency under the Department of Veterans  Affairs (VA). We selected these five agencies to include a mix of: (1) fleet  sizes, but none smaller than 1,000 vehicles, (2) military and civilian fleets,  (3) fleets with varying annual mileage compared to federal miles-traveled  guidelines, and (4) agencies\u2019 use of telematics, among other  considerations.", "To determine the extent to which the selected agencies\u2019 assessment  processes facilitate the identification and removal of underutilized leased  vehicles, we analyzed the agencies\u2019 regulations and other relevant  documentation on their utilization review processes. We compared  agency processes to the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government (Green Book).We also obtained fiscal year 2014 data from  Drive-thru for a selection of vehicles from each of the five agencies under  this review, and asked each agency to identify whether or not the vehicles  had justification documentation or had passed a justification review,  among other categorization requests. We analyzed the costs paid to  GSA for any selected vehicles where agency processes did not facilitate  the identification and removal of potentially underutilized vehicles.", "To address all of our objectives, we interviewed officials from GSA and  each of the selected five agencies. For more information about our scope  and methodology, please see appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2015 to January  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Agencies use vehicles in many ways, as vehicles support agency efforts  to achieve various mission needs. These needs can be diverse, as  demonstrated by the vehicle uses of the five agencies we selected for  review: ferrying clients, conveying repair equipment, hauling explosive  materials, and transporting employees, among others (see table 1.)", "Agencies may own or lease the vehicles in their fleets and are  responsible for managing their vehicles\u2019 utilization in a manner that allows  them to fulfill their missions and meet various federal requirements. For  example, agencies determine the number and type of vehicles they need  to own or lease and when a vehicle is no longer needed to achieve the  agency\u2019s mission. Statutes, executive orders, and policy initiatives direct  federal agencies to, among other things, collect and analyze data on  costs and eliminate non-essential vehicles from their fleets. For example,  every year agencies provide an update on their progress in achieving the  inventory goals determined by their Vehicle Allocation Methodology  (VAM), such as the type and number of vehicles in their fleets. These  updates are reviewed by GSA\u2019s Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP),  which provides feedback on agencies\u2019 submissions.", "Federal provisions on vehicle justifications and determining what makes a  vehicle \u201cutilized\u201d are detailed in the Federal Property Management  Regulations (FPMR). Specifically, the FPMR provide how agencies can  define utilization criteria for the vehicles that they use. According to  GSA\u2019s OGP, the only requirement in the utilization portion of the  regulations is for agencies to justify every full-time vehicle in their  respective fleets, though the regulations do not specify how these  justifications should be conducted. The FPMR recommend\u2014but do not  require\u2014that the annual mileage minimum for passenger vehicles be  12,000 miles, and 10,000 miles for light trucks. However, according to  GSA officials, mileage is not the only appropriate indicator of utilization for  some vehicles\u2019 missions. For example, GSA officials stated that it would  be inappropriate to set a mileage expectation for an emergency  responder vehicle or a vehicle that supports national security  requirements because those vehicles are only needed in specific  circumstances and may not accrue many miles. Thus, the FPMR state  that the aforementioned mileage guidelines \u201cmay be employed by an  agency\u2026 other utilization factors, such as days used, agency  mission, and the relative costs of alternatives to a full time vehicle  assignment, may be considered as justification where miles traveled  guidelines are not met.\u201d Therefore, according to GSA officials, agencies  are allowed to define their own utilization criteria, which may include  adopting the miles-traveled guidelines from the FPMR, using mileage  minimums above or below the FPMR, or employing other metrics.", "According to GSA officials, agencies may choose to define their selected  utilization criteria in their internal policies, and vehicles meeting those  criteria would be considered justified under the regulations. However, if a  vehicle does not meet the utilization criteria specifically described in  agency policy, the FPMR permit agencies to individually justify a vehicle  using criteria the agency finds appropriate for that specific vehicle. The  regulations do not specify the frequency with which the justifications  (either as determined by agency policy or individually determined) must  be conducted, updated, or reviewed. Agencies decide what vehicles are  needed to help the agency meet their mission at any given point in time.  While GSA provides guidance, the ultimate decision-making power lies  with the agency leasing the vehicle.", "Federal agencies can use GSA Fleet to acquire leased vehicles.  According to GSA, under this arrangement an agency informs GSA Fleet  what kind of vehicle is necessary for its mission. GSA Fleet fulfills the  agency\u2019s request by either purchasing a new vehicle (owned by GSA but  leased to the agency), or providing a vehicle from GSA\u2019s existing  inventory (owned by GSA and previously leased to another agency). GSA  Fleet\u2019s primary mission is to provide the \u201cbest value\u201d to its customers and  the American people. GSA Fleet\u2019s leasing rates are designed to recover  all costs of its leasing program, but the exact cost of a lease depends on  the type of vehicle and the number of miles traveled during the lease  period, among other factors. For example, a conventionally fueled  subcompact sedan has a 2015 fixed rate of $153 per month and mileage  rate of $0.13 per mile traveled. GSA Fleet\u2019s fixed rate is designed to  cover fixed costs such as GSA Fleet staff and vehicle depreciation,  whereas the mileage rate is designed to cover variable costs such as fuel  and maintenance. Agencies are responsible for any costs associated with  damage or excessive wear and tear over the course of the lease\u2014 typically 3-7 years for a passenger vehicle. We previously reported that,  according to GSA officials and fleet managers from military and civilian  fleets, GSA Fleet\u2019s vehicle lease rates are typically lower than the  commercial sector and provide a more economical choice for federal  agencies.", "GSA Fleet collects data on leased vehicles to assist with billing as well as  help agencies manage their leased-vehicle fleets. GSA Fleet\u2019s Fleet  Management System (FMS) contains most of this data. The portal used  by agencies to access the data in GSA\u2019s FMS is called Drive-thru. Drive- thru offers a suite of applications, including tools to analyze crash data  and report mileage. As Drive-thru is the primary portal through which  customers can access GSA\u2019s leasing data, some customers refer to the  underlying database as Drive-thru as well. While Drive-thru is the name of  the exterior-facing access portal rather than the database itself, we will  refer to the database as Drive-thru for the purposes of this report to reflect  the language commonly used by GSA\u2019s leasing customers.", "Drive-thru stores hundreds of data elements on each vehicle, including  manufacturer-provided information such as make, model, and fuel  efficiency; agency-reported data such as monthly mileage; and data  obtained through fleet cards (charge cards) such as quantity and type of  fuel purchased. Agencies can import information from Drive-thru into their  own internal fleet management systems and, according to multiple  agency officials, generally rely on GSA Fleet to ensure Drive-thru\u2019s  accuracy, as identifying and correcting erroneous data can be time  consuming and difficult. However, agencies can change the data they  receive from Drive-thru after data enter an agency\u2019s internal fleet  management system but before they are externally reported.", "GSA\u2019s OGP co-manages and co-funds a web-based reporting tool\u2014the  Federal Automotive Statistical Tool (FAST)\u2014with the Department of  Energy (DOE). FAST gathers data from federal agencies about their  owned and leased vehicles to satisfy a variety of federal-reporting  requirements, including the annual Federal Fleet Report. According to  the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), it is the leasing agencies,  not GSA or DOE, which are responsible for the accuracy of the data  agencies report to FAST. As a result, while GSA\u2019s OGP helps compile the  information from FAST that populates the Federal Fleet Report, the  accuracy of the Federal Fleet Report is dependent on the accuracy of the  data that agencies report to FAST.", "The Federal Fleet Report provides an overview of federal motor vehicle  data, such as number of vehicles and related costs. A comparison of the  reports from fiscal years 2012 through 2014 shows that the overall  quantity of leased vehicles varies slightly from year to year, but the costs  have consistently decreased. For example, in fiscal year 2013, federal  agencies leased 183,989 vehicles at a cost of approximately $1.06 billion.  In fiscal year 2014, federal agencies leased slightly more vehicles\u2014 186,214\u2014but the costs dropped to $1.03 billion, as shown in table 2.  GSA officials explained that the cost reduction is attributable in part to  agencies\u2019 decisions to lease smaller, less expensive vehicles.", "Although GSA collects and reports information on leased vehicles, GSA  does not have responsibility for tracking how agencies use vehicles or  identifying underutilized vehicles. Nevertheless, some of the services  that GSA Fleet provides are related to utilization. For example, to help  streamline customers\u2019 vehicle leasing experiences, in 2014 GSA  employed approximately 330 liaisons called Fleet Service  Representatives (FSR). FSRs are expected to answer local customers\u2019  questions about vehicle acquisition, provide assistance when vehicles  need services, and help customers understand the various leasing terms  and products offered by GSA Fleet. According to GSA Fleet, FSRs should  discuss utilization with leasing customers at least annually as part of other  business discussions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GSA Data on Selected Leased Vehicles Are Generally Reliable", "paragraphs": ["We found the data we reviewed in Drive-thru to be generally reliable as  GSA has taken steps to ensure that the data are reasonable, although a  few data elements have indications that those data could be more  accurate.

It  is important that data in Drive-thru are reliable because reports that are  generated via Drive-thru represent a service that GSA is directly providing  to customers to help them manage their fleets. Agencies also use Drive- thru when fulfilling federal fleet reporting requirements. For example,  agencies can download a report about their leased vehicles from Drive- thru. The report then can be directly uploaded into FAST to meet annual  reporting requirements on the leased fleet\u2019s size and costs. Incorrect data  in Drive-thru can therefore hinder agencies\u2019 abilities to manage their  leased fleets or could compromise the integrity of federal reports."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reasonableness of Selected Drive-thru Data", "paragraphs": ["A basic test of reliability is whether the data are reasonable. Using the  guidance provided in three key sources, we developed an analytical  framework for measuring the \u201creasonableness\u201d of data, as there is  currently no universally accepted standard for such a measurement.  Each of these key sources discusses three topics, which we use as our  standard for reasonableness of data: (1) electronic safeguards, such as  error messages for out-of-range or inconsistent entries; (2) a review of  data samples to ensure that key fields are non-duplicative and sensible;  and (3) clear guidance to ensure consistent user interpretation of data  entry rules.", "Based on the data we reviewed, we found that GSA has taken  appropriate steps to ensure the selected Drive-thru data are reasonable.  Specifically, GSA uses electronic safeguards when data are entered into  Drive-thru. For example, error messages appear if a user enters an  odometer reading such as 12345, 99999, 00000, 654321 or a reading  that differs 9,999 or more miles from the previous month\u2019s entry. Similarly,  GSA uses a validation program to catch vehicle identification number  (VIN) entry errors. VIN barcodes are scanned into GSA\u2019s system unless  they must be manually entered due to barcode damage. For both scans  and manual entries, software validates that the entered VIN meets the  check digit calculation.", "In addition, GSA verifies some data during reconciliations and other post- entry checks. For example, customer mileage entries are routinely  monitored by GSA\u2019s Loss Prevention Team (LPT) for abnormal inputs. If  entries for a specific vehicle are consistently nonsensical, the LPT  reviews the activity for signs of fraud and, if likely fraudulent, forwards to  the appropriate Inspector General\u2019s office for investigation. For entries  that are consistently nonsensical but are not likely fraudulent, the LPT  notifies the designated FSR for follow-up with the customer. The FSR is  then tasked with emphasizing to the customer the importance of entering  valid odometer readings in the future.", "Lastly, GSA reported that it provides guidance on how to enter vehicle- related information into Drive-thru to the people who are responsible for  entering different types of data. Generally, information about the vehicle  itself is the responsibility of GSA or its agents (such as contractors\u2014 known as \u201cmarshallers\u201d\u2014who enter manufacturer-provided data at the  time GSA receives the vehicle). GSA provides a handbook to marshallers  that explains how the marshallers should use the software that collects  information and transmits it to GSA\u2019s system. Similarly, GSA provides a  Drive-thru guide to customers that explains how customers should enter  certain types of information into Drive-thru;  however, GSA does not  provide instructions regarding how customers should inform GSA if their  contact information will change. The lack of such guidance may have  been a contributing factor in the inaccuracies we found in the customer  contact data, as discussed in the next section on indications of accuracy  in Drive-thru data; however, according to GSA officials, planned changes  to GSA\u2019s customer ID protocols will remove the need for such guidance in  the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Indications of Accuracy in Selected Drive-thru Data", "paragraphs": ["A second test of data reliability is accuracy; however, we tested for  indications of accuracy in the data, as verifying the data accuracy itself  would have required extensive examination of individual vehicles, which  was beyond the scope of this review. We performed tests on a selection  of nearly two dozen Drive-thru data elements from May 2015 for selected  vehicles and determined that there are numerous indications of accuracy  associated with the data we reviewed. For example:", "Almost 100 percent of 9 vehicle inventory fields, including make,  manufacturer name, fuel type, VIN, and model year, have no missing  data. One vehicle was missing the manufacturer name.", "Three entries indicated the presence of a luxury manufacturer entry  (all for Audi), an error rate of less than one hundredth of one  percent.  .07 percent of records for sedan fuel tank sizes exceeded 20  gallons. Although sedan fuel tank sizes vary and can change from  year to year, few midsize sedans have 20 gallon tanks. Therefore, fuel  tanks larger than 20 gallons might indicate a data error.", "Despite the overall indications that the selected Drive-thru data are  accurate, there are three areas where we found indications that the data  may be less accurate than the other information we studied: fuel type  coding, odometer entries, and customer contact data. According to  federal internal controls standards, data collection applications\u2014including  electronic safeguards such as logic and edit checks\u2014should ensure that  all inputs are correct in order to facilitate accountability and effective  stewardship of government resources.", "First, we found that while most fuel-type-coding data appear to be  accurate, gas stations coded pumps incorrectly in at least some cases  from January through April 2015, and possibly in as high as 46 percent  of cases. For example, drivers of vehicles with E-85 fuel types were  reported to have purchased compressed natural gas or biodiesel. We  were not able to determine the precise number of instances where fuel  had been miscoded; however, because some vehicles use more than one  type of fuel\u2014for example, \u201cflex fuel\u201d vehicles can operate on either  regular gasoline or an alternative fuel known as E-85, which is a blend of  gasoline and ethanol. Given the data available, we were not able to  determine which fuel the user actually selected and were thus unable to  determine which purchases were coded incorrectly by the gas station.  The high end of the error range (46 percent) would mean that each  uncertainty was resolved as a fuel-pump-coding error by the gas station,  an error that GSA officials said was extremely improbable. These officials  noted that they believed the actual error rate was substantially lower.  However, GSA officials agreed that pump miscodings compromise data  accuracy and noted that GSA has worked with fueling station owners and  relevant associations to reduce fuel pump miscodings. However, GSA  officials stated their ability to affect change is highly limited, as the  miscodings occur at the point of sale and there is no incentive for the  fueling stations to correct the miscodings.", "In addition to fuel type miscodings, we found that 3 percent of monthly  odometer entries in May 2015 were lower than the previous month\u2019s  odometer reading. An odometer reading that decreases from one month  to the next indicates that there was an error at some point in time\u2014either  the previous month\u2019s entry was too high, or the current month\u2019s entry is  too low. Monthly odometer readings are supplied by agencies as part of  the billing process, and odometer errors result in temporary billing errors  as agencies pay additional fees based on mileage. GSA officials stated  that they cannot be certain of a vehicle\u2019s odometer reading until the  vehicle is returned to them at the end of the leasing period and that they  typically depend on the leasing agency to correctly report the odometer  readings. According to GSA officials, as part of the monthly odometer- data collection process GSA\u2019s system warns users that they may have  entered incorrect data if the reported odometer reading is 9,999 miles  greater than or less than the previous month\u2019s odometer reading. Users  would then be able to correct the data before submitting it to GSA.", "GSA officials stated that they chose the 9,999 mile warning point because  they did not want the system to generate cautionary messages to  customers when there was a valid reason for the mileage difference. The  officials explained that there are legitimate reasons why the previous  month\u2019s odometer reading might be higher than the current month\u2019s  reading. For example, if the agency relied on GSA to estimate mileage in  the previous month and the estimate was too high, the agency\u2019s  correction in the current month could result in a lower odometer reading.  GSA officials said that they did not want the system to incorrectly flag  these instances, and that they have no plans to evaluate the current  safeguard. However, using such a large mileage difference to trigger a  warning means that GSA may be unlikely to catch the majority of errors.  We found 52 cases where the mileage difference was 9,999 miles or  greater, but more than 4,800 cases where the previous month\u2019s odometer  reading exceeded the current month\u2019s reading. We also found that the  average monthly odometer difference for our selected vehicle data is 564  miles per month, with 95 percent of vehicles driving less than 2,482 miles  per month, as shown in table 3.", "Although the resulting billing errors can be resolved the following month  and the overall error rate is low, resolutions take time and resources for  both GSA and the customer. Evaluating the current warning and adjusting  it accordingly could help improve the accuracy of the data and therefore  help reduce these costs, and GSA officials stated that changing the  existing safeguard would not be costly. Further, GSA\u2019s edit check for  odometer readings is not consistent with federal internal control standards  that call for agencies to pursue data accuracy when possible and cost- effective.", "Lastly, we found that customer contact data, such as the name and e-mail  of the individual whom GSA should contact for vehicle-related services, is  not always correct. As mentioned previously, GSA\u2019s customer-leasing  guide does not provide guidance regarding how customers should  proceed if the vehicle\u2019s point of contact will change. In addition, according  to GSA officials, the customer ID number\u2014which is how customers sign  in to Drive-thru\u2014is associated with the customer\u2019s fleet, not the customer  points of contact themselves. As a result, customer contact data are  updated manually by FSRs after FSRs detect a problem, such as a  returned e-mail after the previous point of contact leaves the agency.  Several FSRs stated that the manual updates are time-consuming.  Moreover, one FSR we interviewed stated that the current process relies  on the initiative of FSRs to ensure accuracy. Without accurate customer  contact data, it is more difficult for FSRs to communicate with agencies  about vehicles, including whether certain vehicles are still needed. Two  FSRs stated that turnover in customer agency fleet management is high.  Such turnover exacerbates the difficulty associated with maintaining the  accuracy of these data. According to GSA officials, planned changes to  Drive-thru in 2016 will resolve this issue, as customer IDs will no longer  be assigned to a fleet. Rather, each customer will have that individual\u2019s  own individual user account, profile, and password. In addition, the  customer ID will be the individual customer\u2019s e-mail address instead of a  number, a step that GSA officials anticipate will resolve the difficulties  associated with updating the user contact information."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GSA Takes Steps to Ensure the Reasonableness of FAST Vehicle Data", "paragraphs": ["GSA is not responsible for the accuracy of data reported to FAST, a data  collection system that GSA co-manages with DOE.

However,  GSA\u2019s OGP has a role in ensuring the reasonableness of FAST data as a  partner in the FAST management team. In this role, GSA focuses on data  relevant to fleet management, such as overall inventory, cost, and  utilization metrics. We found that GSA\u2019s OGP has taken appropriate steps  to ensure the fleet management data reported to FAST are reasonable.

Rather, according to GSA officials, GSA focuses on providing  guidance and advice to federal agencies on utilization by (1) developing  written guidance and reviewing agencies\u2019 Vehicle Allocation Methodology  (VAM) update submissions and (2) holding conversations with federal  agencies\u2019 fleet managers about vehicle utilization at least annually.", "GSA\u2019s OGP provides written guidance in the form of bulletins to federal  agencies to implement legislation, executive orders, and other directives,  but agencies are not legally required to follow this guidance. For example,  in May 2011, a Presidential Memo (implementing a 2009 Executive  Order) required GSA to develop and distribute VAM guidance to federal  agencies for determining their optimum fleet inventory. In response,  GSA provided such guidance to agencies in August 2011. Specifically,  the guidance directed agencies to survey the utilization of vehicles each  year, but agencies were not required to follow the guidance and some  agencies chose to continue using their existing processes even though  those processes differed from the GSA guidance. For example, some  agencies\u2019 fleet managers (including those from NASA, according to NASA  officials, and those from the U.S. Navy, according to GSA officials)  believed that the processes they already had in place fulfilled the intention  of the guidance. In addition to providing written guidance, GSA has  voluntarily reviewed utilization information covered in agencies\u2019 VAM  update submissions and has sometimes made broad recommendations  to agencies based on those reviews. For example, in the 2014 VAM  review, GSA recommended that all executive federal agencies establish  and document specific vehicle utilization criteria for motor vehicle  justification, that the criteria be reviewed at least annually, and that action  be taken when underutilized vehicles are identified.", "GSA officials told us that another aspect of the agency\u2019s role in identifying  and reducing underutilized leased vehicles is to provide advice to federal  agencies\u2019 fleet managers at least annually through conversations about  utilization. According to GSA officials, this advisory role is intended to  help the federal government save money by providing agencies with  support needed to make wise business decisions. In addition, GSA  officials explained that during conversations with fleet managers, FSRs  might discuss the agency\u2019s overall fleet size, vehicle replacement options,  or may suggest that a larger vehicle is no longer needed when a smaller  one will suffice.  For example, one NASA fleet manager told us that his  FSR coordinated the exchange of two larger vehicles in his fleet for two  smaller vehicles for the purposes of downsizing and reducing fuel  consumption.", "To improve our understanding of these utilization conversations and to  examine their usefulness, we sent a non-generalizable survey to 68 fleet  managers for our five selected federal fleets. While the responses are  not representative of either the experiences among our five selected  agencies or the federal fleet as a whole, they do provide insight into  activities that are otherwise undocumented. Fifty one fleet managers  responded, with the majority of them (41) reporting either having decision- making authority or collaborating with their supervisor to make decisions  about vehicle acquisition and disposal. Of the 41 respondents with a role  in the vehicle\u2019s acquisition and disposal decision-making process, 27  responded that their FSR has communicated with them about leased- vehicle utilization based on mileage. The majority of those decision- makers\u201425 of the 27\u2014said that these communications were moderately  to extremely useful in helping them to manage their leased-vehicle  utilization based on mileage. However, 18 of the 51 overall respondents  (including 14 of the 41 respondents with an acquisition and disposal  decision-making role) said that they had never discussed utilization based  on mileage with their FSR.", "GSA\u2019s management told us that it believes these conversations are  occurring, but may not include the word \u201cutilization,\u201d a situation that could  explain, in part, why some of our survey respondents reported never  having discussed utilization with their FSR. According to GSA officials,  the expectation is inherent to the role of the FSR and is made clear to  them through training. However, we found indications that not all FSRs  are discussing utilization with agency fleet managers. GSA\u2019s  management does not have a mechanism to help ensure that these  conversations are occurring as expected. As a result, GSA may not be  able to identify opportunities for FSRs to better assist agencies in  identifying and managing their underutilized leased vehicles. Establishing  such a mechanism would be consistent with federal internal control  standards, which state that agencies should have reasonable assurance  that employees are carrying out their duties and that feedback is provided  in the event that expectations are not met.", "While GSA generally focuses on providing guidance and advice, it has  regulatory authority to repossess federal agencies\u2019 leased vehicles in  some instances, including cases where agencies cannot produce  justification for the vehicle. Specifically, the FPMR state that if GSA  requests justification for a vehicle, agencies must provide it. If the agency  does not provide justification for that leased vehicle, GSA may withdraw  the vehicle from further agency use.

However, agency processes do not always  require that every vehicle undergo a justification review or that vehicles  are removed if they do not pass a justification review. Agency processes  that do not facilitate the removal of underutilized vehicles hinder agencies\u2019  abilities to maintain efficient vehicle fleets. Without processes to ensure  that underutilized vehicles are consistently removed, agencies may be  foregoing opportunities to reduce the costs associated with their fleets.  The cost savings achieved by eliminating unjustified vehicles may be less  than the cost paid to GSA because agencies may need to spend  resources on alternative means to accomplish the work performed by  these vehicles. For example, while an agency would save the monthly  cost of leasing an eliminated vehicle, another vehicle in the agency\u2019s fleet  may need to travel more miles if it performs functions previously  performed by the eliminated vehicle.

For example, GSA\u2019s current 9,999 odometer reading warning allows  for large odometer discrepancies before warning users of a potential  error, leading to potentially inaccurate odometer readings that can result  in potentially inaccurate billing and additional staff time for subsequent  correction. Evaluating the current warning and adjusting it accordingly  could help improve data accuracy and therefore help reduce these costs.", "Additionally, while customers report that utilization-related conversations  with FSRs are helpful, GSA does not have a mechanism to know the  extent to which these conversations are taking place as expected.

This  report assesses: (1) the extent to which GSA data on leased vehicles are  reliable, (2) GSA\u2019s role in identifying and reducing underutilized leased  vehicles, and (3) the extent to which the assessment processes used by  selected federal agencies facilitate the identification and removal of  underutilized leased vehicles, and any cost savings that could be  achieved by reducing any underutilized vehicles.", "To determine the extent to which GSA\u2019s data for leased vehicles are  reliable, we examined the reasonableness of data contained in GSA\u2019s  internal fleet management database (Drive-thru) and the Federal  Automotive Statistical Tool (FAST), a web-based reporting tool co- sponsored by GSA and the Department of Energy. For the purposes of  this review, reliability is defined by two key components: reasonableness  and indications of accuracy. We also tested a selection of Drive-thru data  (reflecting approximately 162,000 vehicles) for indications of accuracy.", "GSA is responsible for the reasonableness of data in Drive-thru and  FAST. We used three key sources to develop a standard for  reasonableness, as there is currently no single federal criterion for a  measurement of reasonableness. The three key sources included (1)  prior GAO work that provided guidance on how to assess the reliability of  data; (2) OMB\u2019s Circular A-123, which defines management\u2019s  responsibility for internal controls in the federal government; and (3)  GAO\u2019s Green Book, which provides standards for internal control in the  federal government. The key practices surrounding the standard of  measurement that we developed for reasonableness are: electronic safeguards, such as error messages for out of range entries  or inconsistent entries;  the extent to which GSA reviews data samples to ensure that key data  fields are non-duplicative and sensible; and  the clarity of the guidance that GSA provided to ensure consistent  user interpretation of data entry rules.", "As agencies are responsible for the accuracy of data in FAST, not GSA,  we only examined Drive-thru for indications of accuracy. We focused on  approximately two dozen data elements contained in the Fuel Use Report  and the Inventory Report as these related most to costs associated with  utilization and federal fleet reporting. To this end, we requested data from  GSA for all GSA-leased vehicles that were continuously leased by the  same agency from January 1, 2015, through May 21, 2015. We  requested continually leased vehicles because we anticipated making  month-to-month data comparisons. However, this historical comparison  was not feasible as GSA does not store some historical data in its Fleet  Management Information System database, which provides information to  Drive-thru. Therefore, the inventory data pulled from GSA\u2019s database  were a \u201csnapshot\u201d of the federal fleet as of May 21, 2015, although the  fuel data reflected the months of January-April 2015. Once the data were  obtained, we conducted a variety of logic checks to locate any anomalies  that might provide insight into the extent which GSA ensures the accuracy  of Drive-thru data. For example, one of the logic checks we performed on  these data included counting vehicles and determining whether at least  one purchased fuel type over a 4-month time period failed to match the  vehicle\u2019s fuel type (accounting for vehicles that could potentially use more  than one fuel type). This logic check was performed to determine how  often, if at all, fuel was erroneously coded at the fuel pump.", "For objectives 2 and 3, we judgmentally selected five federal vehicle  fleets from five federal agencies, including the U.S. Air Force (Air Force);  U.S. Department of the Interior\u2019s National Park Service and Bureau of  Indian Affairs; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and U.S.  Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Veterans Health Administration. We  made our selection based on the following criteria: (1) varying fleet sizes,  but none smaller than 1,000 vehicles; (2) a combination of military and  civilian fleets; (3) a combination of fleets with mileage-based utilization  levels above and below federal mileage-based utilization guidelines; (4)  fleets that had not been audited by an organization other than GAO within  the last 3 years; and (5) other considerations such as use of telematics  and adoption of utilization criteria other than the mileage guidelines in  GSA regulations. We selected these fleets, which according to GSA in  2014 ranged in size from 1,574 to 13,954 vehicles to broadly discuss the  experiences and practices across a section of the federal fleet. These  results are not generalizable to their overarching agencies or other  federal agencies.", "To determine what GSA\u2019s role is in identifying and reducing underutilized  leased vehicles, we reviewed and analyzed relevant federal laws,  regulations, executive orders, and GSA guidance to federal agencies for  preparing VAM submissions. We described GSA\u2019s role based on the  responsibilities delineated in those documents. We also interviewed GSA  officials, including Fleet Service Representatives (FSR) to better  understand the role they play when working with federal agency fleet  managers to identify underutilized leased vehicles. To corroborate  information that GSA officials told us about FSRs speaking with their  agency fleet managers at least once a year to assist in identifying  underutilized leased vehicles and to determine any value that fleet  managers assign to these conversations, we administered a non- generalizable, mixed-method questionnaire to 68 federal agency fleet  managers. To ensure that our questions were meaningful and that we  received accurate survey data, we pre-tested our survey with four  representatives from four of our selected agencies. Using GSA\u2019s Drive- thru data, we selected fleet managers for our five selected federal  agencies who were responsible for at least 20 GSA leased vehicles.  Through interviews with agency officials and FSRs, we learned that the  contact information in Drive-thru was not sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. Specifically, two of four FSRs that we spoke with and officials  from two selected agencies reported that Drive-thru does not contain  reliable contact information for individuals who would have conversations  with FSRs. These officials reported that some of the contacts in Drive-thru  were actually end-users, such as contractors. In other cases, the contact  information was outdated. To address this, we requested that the  selected federal agencies provide us with lists of current fleet managers  within their agencies, and we matched those names to the list of fleet  managers from the Drive-thru data. Agencies that were unable to provide  independent lists of fleet managers verified which individuals from the  Drive-thru data were in the fleet manager\u2019s role at their agency and would  be the appropriate individuals with whom to discuss utilization. This  matching and verification process brought the survey selection pool to  114 fleet managers, yielding a reasonable number of contacts for BIA,  NASA, and NPS\u2014given their respective fleet sizes. However, our  matching and verification process resulted in four fleet managers for Air  Force and 80 for VHA. Since other fleet managers on Air Force\u2019s list of  current fleet managers met our survey pool parameters, we took a  random sample of 16 fleet managers to add to the four we identified  during the matching and verification process. Also, to avoid over- representing VHA, we randomly chose one fleet manager from 19  Veterans Affairs\u2019 regions. We sent the survey to a total of 69 fleet  managers as follows:", "12 at BIA;", "12 at NPS;", "6 at NASA;", "20 at Air Force ; and", "19 at VHA.", "However, during the survey period, Air Force informed us that one of the  selected fleet managers\u2019 roles no longer included responsibilities for  GSA-leased vehicles. Therefore, the total number of selected fleet  managers in the survey pool totaled 68. Fifty one of the 68 fleet managers  completed our survey, yielding a 75 percent response rate. As noted in  our report, findings from this survey effort are not generalizable.", "To determine the extent to which the assessment processes used by  selected federal agencies facilitate the identification and removal of  underutilized leased vehicles, we reviewed and analyzed: pertinent  federal laws and regulations; GSA guidance that described the VAM  process; and internal policies and procedures that the selected federal  agencies use to identify underutilized vehicles in five fleets, such as fleet  handbooks; and interviewed officials from GSA and the five federal  agencies about the agencies\u2019 responsibilities in identifying underutilized  leased vehicles. We then compared these processes to federal internal  control standards related to record keeping and management as well as  stewardship of government resources, as described in the 1999 Green  Book.", "To calculate the costs of the vehicles involved in these processes, we  conducted a multi-step analytical process. First, we asked GSA to provide  data on passenger vehicles and light trucks that were continuously leased  from GSA during fiscal year 2014 (i.e., from October 1, 2013-September  30 2014, inclusive) for the five selected federal fleets. Table 7 shows how  we defined passenger vehicles and light trucks for the purposes of this  review.", "We focused on vehicles that GSA leased on a continuous basis (i.e., to a  single agency) for at least fiscal year 2014 so that the agencies were fully  accountable for the selected vehicles\u2019 mileage over the entire fiscal year  2014 time period. We scoped our work to include light trucks and  passenger vehicles because they comprise the majority of GSA\u2019s  continuously leased fleet at 65 percent and 27 percent, respectively. We  also asked GSA to exclude tactical, law-enforcement and emergency- responder vehicles from the selected vehicle population, as well as  vehicles located outside of the continental U.S. We made these  exclusions because, according to GSA officials, some agencies did not  want law enforcement data, for example, released outside of GSA  because it could be considered sensitive. In addition, we needed to  develop a manageable, selected population given the time resources  needed to investigate each vehicle.", "After receiving the data from GSA, we conducted various analytical tests  to develop a dataset that was free from detectable errors. For example,  we examined data on current and previous monthly odometer readings.  We then determined which vehicles in the dataset had a current monthly  odometer reading that was lower than the previous month\u2019s odometer  reading. This allowed us to determine which vehicles likely had errors  associated with their end-of-fiscal year mileage\u2014allowing us to remove  them from the population of analysis. We also analyzed over 15,500 fiscal  year 2014 vehicle records from the five agencies that we reviewed. In  total, selected vehicles from these agencies accounted for about 8  percent of the federally leased fleet, although the findings associated with  this selection are not generalizable.", "Next, we determined which selected passenger vehicles and light trucks  at each agency did not meet the miles-traveled guidelines in the Federal  Property Management Regulations in fiscal year 2014 (12,000 miles and  10,000 miles, respectively). We then sent a list of the selected vehicles  that had not met the miles-traveled guidelines to each agency and  requested that they group the vehicles into one of the categories  described below and depicted in figure 1:", "Group 2: No longer leased by the agency as of May 21, 2015;", "Group 4: Met a mileage-based utilization criteria defined by the", "Group 5: Met a non-mileage-based utilization criteria defined by the", "Group 6: Had a written justification in lieu of meeting the utilization  criteria that the agency defined;", "Group 8: Was repurposed, given additional tasks, or reassigned within  the agency during fiscal year 2015; and", "Group 9: Was retained beyond May 21, 2015, despite not meeting  agency-defined utilization criteria, possessing a written justification for  retention, or being given other tasks.", "We also asked agencies to identify vehicles that they could not categorize  and reasons why\u2014such as vehicles\u2019 lacking readily auditable  documentation, including information on whether the vehicle met the  agency-defined utilization criteria in fiscal year 2014 (Group 3) and written  justification for retaining vehicles that did not meet the agency-defined  utilization criteria (Group 7). As these two groups\u2014and vehicles in Group  9\u2014stem from insufficient agency processes to identify and remove leased  vehicles, we focused on determining the costs associated with the  vehicles in these groups.", "Agencies were responsible for categorizing each of the vehicles that GAO  provided to them. We provided the agencies with each vehicle\u2019s license  plate number, VIN number, make, model, and other identifying  information to assist in this process. We did not verify whether agencies  categorized vehicles correctly, as some of the information necessary for  these categorizations was contained within agency systems and records  (for example, if the vehicle met an agency-defined criteria or if the vehicle  was repurposed). However, to evaluate the overall reliability of agencies\u2019  vehicle justification, we selected a small sample of vehicles from each  agency and then requested written justifications from each of those  agencies that reported that they had written justifications for vehicles. We  removed vehicles from the selected population if agencies reported that  the vehicle should have been excluded from the review (for example,  vehicles that agencies reported were law enforcement vehicles but not  labeled as such in GSA\u2019s system). We also removed vehicles if the VIN  number that the agency provided did not match the VIN from the original  information that GSA provided and vehicles that agencies categorized in  more than one group, among other data-cleaning efforts.", "We determined the cost paid to GSA for each vehicle in each of the 9  groups using data from GSA. For each vehicle, we summed the following:  the vehicle\u2019s fiscal year 2014 mileage rate multiplied by the total  number of miles the vehicle traveled in fiscal year 2014; per-mile costs for additional equipment multiplied by the total number  of miles the vehicle traveled in fiscal year2014;  the fixed monthly mileage rate for additional equipment multiplied by  12 (for the 12 months of the fiscal year); and any flat monthly rate charges multiplied by 12 (for the 12 months of  the fiscal year).", "These costs represent the amount an agency paid to GSA for each  vehicle in fiscal year 2014. However, these costs do not include other  costs incurred by the leasing agency, such as the salaries of their fleet  managers or the costs to garage the vehicles. Also, we did not have  information on the opportunity costs of alternatives to replacing these  leased vehicles. For example, if a vehicle is removed from an agency\u2019s  fleet and another vehicle is used more frequently as a result, the agency  would still pay for miles traveled or trips made by the other mode of  transportation. Therefore, the costs associated with the groups are annual  costs paid to GSA, and an undetermined percentage of these costs would  reflect actual cost savings if vehicles were removed.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2015 to January  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: NASA Utilization Criteria by Vehicle Type and Center in Fiscal Year 2014", "paragraphs": ["According to NASA policy, each NASA center should conduct an annual  review of fleet utilization during the third quarter of each fiscal year. The  review first identifies vehicles that fail to meet the minimum utilization  goals, also called the \u201cutilization target point.\u201d The target point is  calculated by multiplying the average usage by 25 percent (0.25) for each  vehicle type, such as sedans/station wagons, ambulances, intercity  busses, and trucks with a gross vehicle weight of less than 12,500  pounds. In fiscal year 2014, sedans and trucks less than 12,500 pounds  were required to meet the mileage target points shown in table 9 at their  respective centers:  According to NASA policy, individual vehicles within each vehicle type  whose range falls below the utilization target point will be added to the  \u201cutilization target list\u201d. Programs, missions or departments with vehicles  on the target list are required to submit a new justification form for each  individual vehicle on the list for center review and retention approval.  These justifications are then evaluated during the annual review process,  with possible outcomes including reassignment within the center,  exchanging the vehicle for a different type of vehicle that better suits the  mission, or returning the vehicle to GSA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the General Services Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of the Interior", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, John W.
