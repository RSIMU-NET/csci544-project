These threats can be unintentional\u2014for example, from equipment failure, careless or poorly trained employees; or intentional\u2014targeted or untargeted attacks from criminals, hackers, adversarial nations, or terrorists, among others. Threat actors use a variety of attack techniques that can adversely affect federal information, computers, software, networks, or operations, potentially resulting in the disclosure, alteration, or loss of sensitive information; destruction or disruption of critical systems; or damage to economic and national security. These concerns are further highlighted by the sharp increase in cyber incidents reported by federal agencies over the last several years, as well as the reported impact of such incidents on government and contractor systems.", "Because of the risk posed by these threats, it is crucial that the federal government take appropriate steps to secure its information and information systems. However, GAO has identified a number of challenges facing the government's approach to cybersecurity, including the following:", "Implementing risk-based cybersecurity programs at federal agencies: For fiscal year 2014, 19 of 24 major federal agencies reported that deficiencies in information security controls constituted either a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal controls over their financial reporting.

As you know, federal agencies  and their contractors are dependent on computerized (cyber) information  systems and electronic data to carry out operations and to process,  maintain, and report essential information. The security of these systems  and data is vital to public confidence and the nation\u2019s safety, prosperity,  and well-being. Safeguarding federal computer systems and the systems  that support critical infrastructures\u2014referred to as cyber critical  infrastructure protection\u2014is a continuing concern. In February 2015, the  Director of National Intelligence testified that cyber threats to U.S.  national and economic security are increasing in frequency, scale,  sophistication, and severity of impact.", "Underscoring the importance of this issue, we have designated federal  information security as a high-risk area since 1997 and in 2003 expanded  this area to include computerized systems supporting the nation\u2019s critical  infrastructure. In the 2015 update to our high-risk list, we further  expanded this area to include protecting the privacy of personally  identifiable information (PII)\u2014that is, personal information that is  collected, maintained, and shared by both federal and nonfederal  entities.", "As discussed with your staff, my testimony today will describe (1) cyber  threats facing federal and contractor systems and (2) challenges in  securing them, as well as actions needed to address these challenges. In  preparing this statement in April 2015 we relied on our previous work in  these areas. The reports presenting this work contain detailed overviews of its scope and the methodology we used to carry it out. The work on  which this statement is based was conducted in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform audits to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provided a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on  our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["As computer technology has advanced, both government and private  entities have become increasingly dependent on computerized  information systems to carry out operations and to process, maintain, and  report essential information. Public and private organizations rely on  computer systems to transmit sensitive and proprietary information,  develop and maintain intellectual capital, conduct operations, process  business transactions, transfer funds, and deliver services. In addition,  the Internet has grown increasingly important to American business and  consumers, serving as a medium for hundreds of billions of dollars of  commerce each year, as well as developing into an extended information  and communications infrastructure supporting vital services such as  power distribution, health care, law enforcement, and national defense.", "Consequently, the security of these systems and networks is essential to  protecting national and economic security, public health and safety, and  the flow of commerce. Conversely, ineffective information security  controls can result in significant risks, including  loss or theft of computer resources, assets, and funds;  inappropriate access to and disclosure, modification, or destruction of  sensitive information, such as national security information, personally  identifiable information (PII), or proprietary business information; disruption of critical operations supporting critical infrastructure,  national defense, or emergency services; undermining of agency missions due to embarrassing incidents that  erode the public\u2019s confidence in government; use of computer resources for unauthorized purposes or to launch  attacks on other systems; damage to networks and equipment; and high costs for remediation.", "Recognizing the importance of these issues, Congress recently enacted  laws intended to improve federal cybersecurity. These include the Federal  Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA), which revised  the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 to, among  other things, clarify and strengthen information security roles and  responsibilities for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The act also reiterated the  requirement for federal agencies to develop, document, and implement  an agency-wide information security program. The program is to provide  security for the information and information systems that support the  operations and assets of the agency, including those provided or  managed by another agency, contractor, or other source.", "In addition, the Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act and the  Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act aim to help  DHS address its cybersecurity workforce challenges. Another law, the  National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014, codifies the role of DHS\u2019s  National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center as the  federal civilian interface for sharing information between federal and  nonfederal entities regarding cyber risk, incidents, analysis, and warnings.  The Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014, among other things,  authorizes the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to  facilitate and support the development of voluntary standards to reduce  cyber risks to critical infrastructure and to develop and encourage the  implementation of a strategy for the use and adoption of cloud computing  services by the federal government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Federal Government and Its Contractors Face an Evolving Array of Cyber-Based Threats", "paragraphs": ["Risks to cyber-based assets can originate from unintentional and  intentional threats. Unintentional threats can be caused by, among other  things, defective computer or network equipment, and careless or poorly  trained employees. Intentional threats include both targeted and  untargeted attacks from a variety of sources, including criminal groups,  hackers, disgruntled employees, foreign nations engaged in espionage  and information warfare, and terrorists.", "Threat sources vary in terms of the capabilities of the actors, their  willingness to act, and their motives, which can include monetary gain or  political advantage, among others. For example, adversaries possessing  sophisticated levels of expertise and significant resources to pursue their  objectives\u2014sometimes referred to as \u201cadvanced persistent threats\u201d\u2014 pose increasing risks. Table 1 describes common sources of cyber  threats.", "These threat sources make use of various techniques\u2014 or exploits\u2014that  may adversely affect federal information, computers, software, networks,  and operations. Table 2 describes common types of cyber exploits.", "An adversarial threat source may employ multiple tactics, techniques, and  exploits to conduct a cyber attack. NIST has identified several  representative events that may constitute a cyber attack:", "Perform reconnaissance and gather information: An adversary  may gather information on a target by, for example, scanning its  network perimeters or using publicly available information.", "Craft or create attack tools: An adversary prepares its means of  attack by, for example, crafting a phishing attack or creating a  counterfeit (\u201cspoof\u201d) website.", "Deliver, insert, or install malicious capabilities: An adversary can  use common delivery mechanisms, such as e-mail or downloadable  software, to insert or install malware into its target\u2019s systems.", "Exploit and compromise: An adversary may exploit poorly  configured, unauthorized, or otherwise vulnerable information systems  to gain access.", "Conduct an attack: Attacks can include efforts to intercept  information or disrupt operations (e.g., denial of service or physical  attacks).", "Achieve results: Desired results include obtaining sensitive  information via network \u201csniffing\u201d or exfiltration, causing degradation  or destruction of the target\u2019s capabilities; damaging the integrity of  information through creating, deleting, or modifying data; or causing  unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.", "Maintain a presence or set of capabilities: An adversary may try to  maintain an undetected presence on its target\u2019s systems by inhibiting  the effectiveness of intrusion-detection capabilities or adapting  behavior in response to the organization\u2019s surveillance and security  measures.", "More generally, the nature of cyber-based attacks can vastly enhance  their reach and impact. For example, cyber attacks do not require  physical proximity to their victims, can be carried out at high speeds and  directed at multiple victims simultaneously, and can more easily allow  attackers to remain anonymous. These inherent advantages, combined  with the increasing sophistication of cyber tools and techniques, allow  threat actors to target government agencies and their contractors,  potentially resulting in the disclosure, alteration, or loss of sensitive  information, including PII; theft of intellectual property; destruction or  disruption of critical systems; and damage to economic and national  security.", "The number of information security incidents affecting systems supporting  the federal government is increasing. Specifically, the number of  information security incidents reported by federal agencies to the U.S.  Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) increased from 5,503  in fiscal year 2006 to 67,168 in fiscal year 2014, an increase of 1,121  percent (see fig. 1).", "Similarly, the number of information security incidents involving PII  reported by federal agencies has more than doubled in recent years, from  10,481 in 2009 to 27,624 in 2014.", "Figure 2 shows the different types of incidents reported in fiscal year  2014.", "These incidents and others like them could adversely affect national  security; damage public health and safety; and lead to inappropriate  access to and disclosure, modification, or destruction of sensitive  information. Recent examples highlight the potential impact of such  incidents:  In April 2015, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of  Inspector General reported that two VA contractors had improperly  accessed the VA network from foreign countries using personally  owned equipment.  In September 2014, a cyber intrusion into the United States Postal  Service\u2019s information systems may have compromised PII for more  than 800,000 of its employees.", "According to the Director of National Intelligence, unauthorized  computer intrusions were detected in 2014 on the networks of the  Office of Personnel Management and two of its contractors. The two  contractors were involved in processing sensitive PII related to  national security clearances for federal employees.  In 2011, according to a media report, the Deputy Secretary of  Defense acknowledged a significant cyber attack in which a large  number of files was taken by foreign intruders from a defense  contractor. The deputy secretary was quoted as saying \u201cit is a  significant concern that over the past decade, terabytes of data have  been extracted by foreign intruders from corporate networks of  defense companies\u201d and that some of the data concerned \u201cour most  sensitive systems.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Federal Government Faces Ongoing Challenges in Its Approach to Cybersecurity", "paragraphs": ["Given the risk posed by cyber threats and the increasing number of  incidents, it is crucial that the federal government take appropriate steps  to secure its systems and information. However, both we and agency  inspectors general have identified challenges in the government\u2019s  approach to cybersecurity, including those related to protecting the  government\u2019s information and systems. In particular, challenges remain in  the following key areas:", "Designing and implementing risk-based cybersecurity programs  at federal agencies. Agencies continue to have shortcomings in  assessing risks, developing and implementing security controls, and  monitoring results. Specifically, for fiscal year 2014, 19 of the 24  federal agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers Act reported  that information security control deficiencies were either a material  weakness or a significant deficiency in internal controls over their  financial reporting. Moreover, inspectors general at 23 of the 24  agencies cited information security as a major management challenge  for their agency. For fiscal year 2014, most of the agencies had  weaknesses in five key security control categories. Figure 3 shows  the number of the 24 agencies reviewed with weaknesses in each of  the five control categories for fiscal year 2014.", "Over the last several years, GAO and agency inspectors general have  made hundreds of recommendations to agencies aimed at improving their  implementation of information security controls. For example:", "Addressing cybersecurity for building and access control  systems. In December 2014 we reported that DHS lacked a strategy  for addressing cyber risk to building and access control systems and  that its Interagency Security Committee had not included cyber threats to such systems in its threat report to federal agencies.Further, the General Services Administration (GSA) had not fully  assessed the risk of cyber attacks aimed at building control systems.  We recommended that DHS and GSA take steps to address these  weaknesses. DHS and GSA agreed with our recommendations.", "Enhancing oversight of contractors providing IT services. In  August 2014 we reported that five of six agencies reviewed were  inconsistent in overseeing assessments of contractors\u2019  implementation of security controls. This was partly because  agencies had not documented IT security procedures for effectively  overseeing contractor performance. In addition, according to OMB, 16  of 24 agency inspectors general found that their agency\u2019s program for  managing contractor systems lacked at least one required element.  We recommended that OMB, in conjunction with DHS, develop and  clarify guidance to agencies for annually reporting the number of  contractor-operated systems and that the reviewed agencies establish  and implement IT security oversight procedures for such systems.  OMB did not comment on our report, but the agencies generally  concurred with our recommendations.  Improving security incident response activities. In April 2014 we  reported that the 24 major agencies did not consistently demonstrate  that they had been effectively responding to cyber incidents.  Specifically, we estimated that agencies did not completely document  actions taken in response to detected incidents reported in fiscal year  2012 in about 65 percent of cases. In addition, six agencies we  reviewed had not fully developed comprehensive policies, plans, and  procedures to guide their incident-response activities. We  recommended that DHS and OMB address agency incident-response  practices government-wide and that the six agencies in our review  improve the effectiveness of their cyber incident response programs.  The agencies generally agreed with these recommendations.", "Responding to breaches of PII. In December 2013 we reported that  eight federal agencies had inconsistently implemented policies and  procedures for responding to data breaches involving PII. In  addition, OMB requirements for reporting PII-related data breaches  were not always feasible or necessary. Thus, we concluded that  agencies may not be consistently taking actions to limit the risk to  individuals from PII-related data breaches and may be expending  resources to meet OMB reporting requirements that provide little  value. We recommended that OMB revise its guidance on federal  agencies\u2019 responses to a PII-related data breach and that the  reviewed agencies take specific actions to improve their response to  PII-related data breaches. OMB neither agreed nor disagreed with our  recommendation; four of the reviewed agencies agreed, two partially  agreed, and two neither agreed nor disagreed.  Implementing security programs at small agencies. In June 2014  we reported that six small agencies (i.e., agencies with 6,000 or fewer  employees) had not fully implemented their information security  programs. For example, key elements of their plans, policies, and procedures were outdated, incomplete, or did not exist, and two of the  agencies had not developed an information security program with the  required elements. We recommended that OMB include a list of  agencies that did not report on the implementation of their information  security programs in its annual report to Congress on compliance with  the requirements of FISMA, as well as including information on small  agencies\u2019 programs. We also recommended that DHS develop  guidance and services targeted at small agencies. OMB and DHS  generally concurred with our recommendations.", "Until federal agencies take actions to address these challenges\u2014 including implementing the hundreds of recommendations made by us  and inspectors general\u2014federal systems and information, as well as  sensitive personal information about members of the public, will be at an  increased risk of compromise from cyber-based attacks and other threats.", "In summary, the cyber threats facing the nation are evolving and growing,  with a wide array of threat actors having access to increasingly  sophisticated techniques for exploiting system vulnerabilities. The danger  posed by these threats is heightened by weaknesses in the federal  government\u2019s approach to protecting federal systems and information,  including personally identifiable information entrusted to the government  by members of the public. Implementing GAO\u2019s many outstanding  recommendations will assist agencies in better protecting their systems  and information, which will in turn reduce the risk of the potentially  devastating impacts of cyber attacks.", "Chairman Chaffetz, Ranking Member Cummings, and Members of the  Committee, this concludes my statement.
