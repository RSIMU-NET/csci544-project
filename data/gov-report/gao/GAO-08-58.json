To address these concerns, the United States employs a range of tools, including diplomatic pressure, a military presence in the Gulf, and sanctions. A U.S. sanction is a unilateral restriction or condition on economic activity imposed by the United States for reasons of foreign policy or national security. We were asked to review (1) U.S. sanctions targeting Iran and their implementation, (2) reported sanction impacts, and (3) factors limiting sanctions. To conduct the review, we assessed trade and sanction data, information on Iran's economy and energy sector, and U.S. and international reports on Iran, and discussed sanctions with U.S. officials and Iran experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since 1987, U.S. agencies have implemented numerous sanctions against Iran. First, Treasury oversees a ban on U.S. trade and investment with Iran and filed over 94 civil penalty cases between 2003 and 2007 against companies violating the prohibition. This ban may be circumvented by shipping U.S. goods to Iran through other countries. Second, State administers laws that sanction foreign parties engaging in proliferation or terrorism-related activities with Iran. Under one law, State has imposed sanctions in 111 instances against Chinese, North Korean, Syrian, and Russian entities. Third, Treasury or State can use financial sanctions to freeze the assets of targeted parties and reduce their access to the U.S. financial system. U.S. officials report that U.S. sanctions have slowed foreign investment in Iran's petroleum sector, denied parties involved in Iran's proliferation and terrorism activities access to the U.S. financial system, and provided a clear statement of U.S. concerns to the rest of the world. However, other evidence raises questions about the extent of reported impacts. Since 2003, the Iranian government has signed contracts reported at about $20 billion with foreign firms to develop its energy resources. Further, sanctioned Iranian banks may fund their activities in currencies other than the dollar. Moreover, while Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003, according to the November 2007 National Intelligence Estimate, it continues to enrich uranium, acquire advanced weapons technology, and support terrorism. Finally, U.S. agencies do not systematically collect or analyze data demonstrating the overall impact and results of their sanctioning and enforcement actions. Iran's global trade ties and leading role in energy production make it difficult for the United States to isolate Iran and pressure it to reduce proliferation and support for terrorism. For example, Iran's overall trade with the world has grown since the U.S. imposed sanctions, although this trade has fluctuated. Imports rose sharply following the Iran-Iraq war in 1988 and then declined until 1995; most export growth followed the rise in oil prices beginning in 2002. This trade included imports of weapons and nuclear technology. However, multilateral UN sanctions began in December 2006."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The 2006 National Security Strategy stated that the challenges that Iran  presents to the United States include the country\u2019s proliferation efforts,  involvement in international terrorism, opposition to the Middle East  peace process, and poor human rights record.

The broad U.S. strategy is  intended to deter Iran from developing weapons of mass destruction,  acquiring advanced conventional weapons, and supporting terrorist  activities. Sanctions have played an important role in the U.S. approach to  confronting Iran.

Furthermore, Iran borders both the Persian Gulf and  the Strait of Hormuz, through which roughly one-fifth of the global oil  supply is exported. According to the Department of Energy, Iran has the  third largest proven oil reserves in the world. Iran\u2019s oil export revenues  constitute about 80 percent of its total export revenue, and accounted for  nearly one-fifth of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2004.

Following the U.S.-supported overthrow of Iran\u2019s prime minister  in 1953, the United States and others backed the regime of Shah  Mohammed Reza Pahlavi for a quarter century. Although it did much to  develop the country economically, the Shah\u2019s government repressed  political dissent. In 1978, domestic turmoil swept the country as a result of  religious and political opposition to the Shah\u2019s rule, culminating in the  collapse of the Shah\u2019s government in February 1979 and the establishment  of an Islamic republic led by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini.

Third, Treasury or State can impose financial sanctions,  including a freeze on assets and a prohibition on access to U.S. financial  institutions, against parties who engage in proliferation or terrorism- related activities with any party, including Iran.

The prohibitions of the trade and investment ban began  with a 1987 ban on Iranian imports and were followed by a 1995 ban on  U.S. exports to and investment in Iran. These prohibitions apply to U.S.  persons, including U.S. companies and their foreign branches, wherever  located. U.S. officials stated that the ban does not apply to independent  foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies. Non-U.S. persons are generally  exempt from the provisions of the ban. Trade sanctions against Iran were  eased in 2000 to allow for the purchase and import from Iran of carpets  and food products. Further, the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export  Enhancement Act of 2000 lifted, subject to certain exceptions, U.S.  sanctions on commercial sales of food, agricultural commodities, and  medical products to several sanctioned countries, including Iran. The ban  also prohibits U.S. financial institutions from having direct banking  relationships with banks in Iran and banks owned or controlled by the  government of Iran.", "According to a Treasury official, the trade and investment ban is aimed at  making it more difficult for Iran to procure U.S. goods, services, and  technology, including those that could be used for terrorism or  proliferation. The official further stated that, as with all U.S. economic  sanctions programs, the premise of the sanctions is to exact a price on the  sanctioned entity, which serves as an inducement to change the behavior  that threatens U.S. national security and foreign policy goals. Sanctions  also serve to make it more difficult for a sanctioned entity to pursue its  threatening conduct.", "Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) administers the trade  and investment ban and is responsible for reviewing and licensing requests  to export or re-export goods to Iran, with most items subject to a general  policy of denial. OFAC is also responsible for conducting civil  investigations of sanctions violations, which can result in warning letters,  cease and desist orders, and civil penalties of up to $250,000 (or an amount  that is twice the amount of the transaction that is the basis for the  violation) imposed administratively. We found that Iran sanctions were  involved in 94 out of 425 civil penalty cases that OFAC assessed or settled  as a result of sanction violations between 2003 and 2007. In cases where  OFAC finds evidence of willful violations of the trade and investment ban,  it may refer those cases to other federal law enforcement agencies for  criminal investigation. Investigations of potential criminal violations can  be conducted by the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and  Security (BIS), DHS\u2019s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and  the Department of Justice\u2019s Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),  sometimes acting jointly. Criminal prosecutions are pursued by the  Department of Justice. Under recently enacted legislation, criminal  penalties for violations of the trade and investment ban can range up to  $1,000,000 and (for natural persons) 20 years in jail.", "According to officials at key U.S. export enforcement agencies, the trade  ban may be circumvented by the transshipment of U.S. exports through  third countries. Officials identified several locations that serve as common  transshipment points for goods destined for Iran. These locations include  Germany, Malaysia, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and, according to  Commerce officials, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in particular.", "Two trends underscore the possibility that U.S. goods are being shipped to  Iran through the UAE. First is the considerable growth in U.S. trade flows  through the UAE. The United States has become the number one supplier  of imports to the UAE and Iran is the UAE\u2019s largest trade partner.  Moreover, although trade statistics do not specify the portion of UAE  exports to Iran that are of U.S.-origin, the UAE transships a higher  proportion of its U.S. imports than other countries do. According to  Commerce officials transshipments have been a considerable problem in  terms of the effectiveness of sanctions in place against Iran. The second  trend is the high rate of unfavorable end-use checks for U.S. items  exported to the UAE. The Department of Commerce relies on post- shipment verification (PSV) checks as its primary method of detecting and  preventing illegal transfers, including transshipments, of U.S.-origin  exports to Iran. However, according to Commerce officials, in August  2007, the UAE enacted a comprehensive export, reexport, and  transshipment control law to better enable the UAE to control  transshipment of sensitive goods through its ports. The law is too new to  assess its effectiveness.

Three U.S. sanction laws discourage foreign parties from engaging in  proliferation or terrorism-related activities with Iran (see table 1). State  leads efforts to implement these laws and has imposed sanctions under  these laws to varying degrees.", "As table 1 shows, State has imposed sanctions against foreign parties,  including bans on U.S. government procurement opportunities and sales of  defense-related items, in 111 Iran-specific cases since 2000 under a law  currently known as the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act  (INKSNA). This law targets foreign persons that have transferred goods,  services, or technology to Iran that are listed on various multilateral  export control lists. According to a State official, entities engaged in  conventional arms transfers were the most widely sanctioned, followed by  those involved in chemical-biological, missile, and nuclear activities. Since  2000, almost half of the cases (52) involved Chinese parties, with North  Korean and Russian parties accounting for 9 and 7 cases, respectively. In  2007, Syrian parties were sanctioned in 8 cases. According to State  officials, in most cases, the full range of sanctions authorized under  INKSNA is imposed, and sanctions have been typically imposed for a 2- year period. Over 30 percent of all sanction cases involve parties that were  sanctioned multiple times under the law\u2014some, primarily Chinese firms, 3  or more times. According to a State official, such instances were the result  of new proliferation activities by these firms. Because the law establishes  the sanctions that are available, the practical effect of continuing to  impose sanctions against the same parties is to extend the length of time  the sanctions are imposed and make the public aware of the firms  facilitating proliferation with Iran. State officials said that generally no  consideration of additional penalties or measures is given to parties who  have been sanctioned multiple times, although some of these entities have  been sanctioned under other sanction tools.  However, State officials  emphasized that they raise concerns about the activities of such entities  with foreign governments as appropriate.", "In deciding to sanction an entity under INKSNA, State officials reported  that every 6 months they assess as many as 60,000 intelligence reports to  identify transfer cases that should be submitted to agencies for review.  State decides, on a discretionary basis, which parties to sanction following  a meeting chaired by the NSC that solicits input from DOD, Energy, and  Treasury and other agencies regarding the disposition of each case.  According to a State official, the Deputy Assistant Secretary-level  interagency group reviews cases to recommend whether the foreign  persons were reportable under the act, and if so, (1) whether there was  information establishing that a case was exempt from sanctions under the  act, (2) whether to seek from the foreign person additional information  concerning the transfer or acquisition as provided for in the act, and (3)  whether sanctions under the act should be applied. The final decision  regarding the disposition of each case is made by the Deputy Secretary of  State. One State official noted that there have been several cases in which  State decided not to impose sanctions because of positive nonproliferation  actions taken by the foreign government responsible for the firm engaging  in the proliferation transfer. A foreign government punishing or  prosecuting the firm responsible for the transfer is one example of the  type of positive action that has resulted in a decision not to impose  penalties. Another reason why State may decide not to impose sanctions is  a concern that such an action, which is made public, may compromise the  intelligence \u201csources and methods\u201d used to collect information on a  particular proliferation case. Once final decisions are made, State then  submits a classified report to Congress identifying parties that have  engaged in sanctionable activities and parties that will be sanctioned, and  ultimately publishes the names of sanctioned entities in the Federal  Register. (See appendix III for a detailed listing of these sanction cases.)", "Under a second law, the Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992  (also shown in table 1), State has imposed sanctions 12 times. Under this  act, mandatory sanctions include prohibiting the export to Iran of all  goods specified on the Commerce Control List (CCL). State also can  impose sanctions against foreign parties, such as a ban on U.S.  government procurement opportunities or export licenses that knowingly  and materially contribute to Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire destabilizing numbers  and types of advanced conventional weapons. As with the Iran, North  Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act, decisions under this act include  interagency input from Commerce, Energy, and DOD, with State in the  lead and responsible for deciding which cases warrant imposition of  sanctions. In 2002, State imposed sanctions in 10 instances, 9 of which  were against Chinese parties. In 2003, sanctions were imposed against  two parties, one Jordanian and one Indian. No sanctions have been  imposed since 2003 primarily because, according to State officials, it is  difficult to establish that transfers were made by parties who knowingly  and materially contributed to Iran\u2019s proliferation.", "Table 1 shows that State has not imposed sanctions against any party  under a third law\u2014the Iran Sanctions Act\u2014though State officials noted  that the law has been useful in raising U.S. concerns over Iran. The goal of  the Iran Sanctions Act (previously known as the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act  of 1996, or ILSA) has been to deny Iran the financial resources to support  international terrorism or the development of weapons of mass  destruction (WMD) by limiting Iran\u2019s ability to find, extract, refine, or  transport its oil resources. State considered sanctions on one occasion in  1998; however, the U.S. government granted waivers to the parties  involved. In that instance, the U.S. government determined that the  investments of three foreign companies\u2014Total (France), Gazprom  (Russia), and Petronas (Malaysia)\u2013in the development of Iran\u2019s South Pars  gas field were sanctionable under ILSA. However, the Secretary of State  determined that it was important to the U.S. national interest to waive the  imposition of sanctions against these firms. In making this determination,  the Secretary considered factors such as the desire to build an effective  multilateral regime to deny Iran the ability to acquire WMD and support  acts of international terrorism. Further, the European Union (EU) had  concerns that the use of the act to impose sanctions would constitute  extraterritorial application of U.S. law. The possibility that the EU might  take this issue to the World Trade Organization for resolution played a role  in convincing the U.S. government to waive sanctions. In addition, a report  on the use of ILSA prepared by State and cleared by the NSC noted that  the sanctions that could be imposed were unlikely to induce the three  companies to abandon their investments because the companies were  insulated from any practical negative impact of the sanctions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Targeted Financial Sanctions Freeze Assets of Parties Involved in Proliferation and Terrorism-Related Activities", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. government has taken actions against Iran using targeted  financial sanctions that can be used against any party that engages in  certain proliferation or terrorism activities. In June 2005, the President  issued Executive Order 13382 to freeze the assets of persons engaged in  proliferation of WMD and members of their support networks. This  action followed the issuance in September 2001 of Executive Order 13224  to freeze the assets of persons who commit, threaten to commit, or  support terrorism. Executive Orders 13382 and 13224 were both issued  under the authority of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act  (IEEPA). Persons targeted under these financial sanctions are said to be  \u201cdesignated\u201d as either WMD proliferators or global terrorists, depending  on which set of sanctions is employed, and any transactions with them by  U.S. persons are prohibited.  According to Treasury, the goal of this  action is to deny sanctioned parties\u2019 access to the U.S. financial and  commercial systems. Treasury or State can make designations under these  financial sanctions, which are published in the Federal Register.", "As of October 25, 2007, 53 of the 70 parties designated under the  nonproliferation financial sanctions were tied to Iranian proliferation  activities. Of these 53 parties, 48 were either Iranian entities or overseas  subsidiaries of Iranian banks, 4 were Chinese, and 1 was American.  Several designations have been made in recent months. For example, in  June 2007, Treasury designated four Iranian companies for their role in  Iran\u2019s proliferation of WMD. On October 25, 2007, State and Treasury  designated 27 entities or individuals under Executive Order 13382,  including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and other  companies or individuals affiliated with the IRGC, the Ministry of Defense  and Armed Forces Logistics, and two Iranian banks, including Bank  Melli\u2014Iran's largest bank.", "With regard to the antiterrorism financial sanctions, Treasury was unable  to provide us with data on the number of Iran-related designations  because it does not compile information about the country or countries  with which the designated entities are involved. We were, however, able to  identify instances where antiterrorism financial sanctions were imposed.   For example, on October 25, 2007, under Executive Order 13224, Treasury  designated the IRGC\u2019s Qods Force a supporter of terrorism.  According to  Treasury, the Qods Force provides material support to the Taliban,  Lebanese Hizbollah, Hamas, and other terrorist groups.

Further,  U.S. financial sanctions also have reportedly disrupted Iran\u2019s support for  terrorism. U.S. officials report that the United States has disrupted  Hizbollah\u2019s financial support network by reducing the ability of Iranian  banks to interact with the U.S. financial system. For example, in  September 2006, Treasury altered the trade ban regulations to cut off Bank  Saderat, Iran\u2019s second largest state-owned bank, from dollar transactions  due to its support for terrorism. Treasury officials reported that Iran used  Bank Saderat to move millions of dollars to terrorist organizations such as  Hizbollah, Hamas, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.

However, Treasury could not provide data on designations made  under the antiterrorism sanctions or specify the amount of assets frozen  under either set of financial sanctions.", "To obtain U.S. government views on the impact of sanctions on Iran, we  collected publicly available testimonies, speeches, and other remarks  made by U.S. officials from the Departments of State, Commerce,  Treasury, and DHS from March 2006 through April 2007. We reviewed  these documents for statements regarding the U.S. government\u2019s position  on the impacts of sanctions on Iran, factors that might lessen their impact,  UN sanctions, and other issues identified as key to the U.S. foreign policy  strategy for Iran. We also interviewed U.S. officials as well as a  judgmentally selected group of experts from think tanks and universities  and reviewed numerous scholarly articles and testimonies to gain  additional perspectives on the impact of sanctions on Iran. After reviewing  the literature on Iran sanctions and conducting a Web-based search of  universities and other institutions with research projects or issue areas  focusing on U.S. policies toward Iran, we identified a large field of experts.  To balance our selection of experts to interview, we identified the  institutions with which they were affiliated. These 39 institutions  represented a wide variety of perspectives on U.S. foreign policy and,  within them, we identified 56 scholars who have written papers and given  presentations on Iran sanctions. We then selected six prominent scholars,  each from an institution having a different political perspective, and with  multiple publications on Iran sanctions. After reviewing their publications  and speeches, we interviewed them on a set of questions concerning the  impact of unilateral and UN sanctions against Iran, factors that might  hinder impact, and other issues identified as key to U.S. foreign policy  strategy for Iran.", "To obtain information on the impact of sanctions in deterring investment  in Iran\u2019s energy sector, FACTS Global Energy provided us with a list of  recent major agreements between Iran and foreign firms and governments.  FACTS Global Energy explained, in response to our questions concerning  its methodology and the value of the contracts, that these are publicly  reported figures, though the actual worth of the contract may be slightly  higher or lower. While FACTS reports that some contracts are legally  binding, Iran has been involved in several instances in which these  contracts have not been fulfilled. We also substantiated many of these  reported agreements based on our review of a variety of sources, including  expert reports (Congressional Research Service , Economist  Intelligence, Global Insight, Energy Information Administration); scholarly  articles; testimony of senior U.S. officials; and other experts. Based on our  interviews and checks, we determine the data were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of indicating the estimated value of publicly announced  binding contracts between foreign companies and Iran.", "To determine the major factors that affect U.S. sanctions ability to  influence Iran\u2019s behavior, we reviewed numerous scholarly articles,  professional economists\u2019 publications, official U.S. documents, and  testimonies of officials and experts. In addition, we read open-source  documents, including newspaper and journal articles, both national and  global. We also interviewed a selected group of experts on Iran, met with  agency officials, and attended conferences on the subject. In addition, we  collected and analyzed data from several widely used databases of  international trade statistics, including International Monetary Fund (IMF)  Direction of Trade Statistics and International Financial Statistics National  Income database, the UN trade database, U.S. Department of Commerce  Trade Statistics, Department of Energy statistics, and United Nations  Conference on Trade and Development Foreign Direct Investment  statistics. We also reviewed and analyzed proprietary private sector data  from an internationally recognized consultant on Iran\u2019s energy sector. We  have determined that these data are sufficiently reliable for the purposes  for which they were used in this report.", "To determine the effect of U.S. sanctions on U.S. trade with Iran, we used  1986 to 2006 U.S. trade statistics from the Department of Commerce,  Bureau of the Census Web-based database. We converted these data from  nominal dollars to 2006 dollars using Department of Commerce, Bureau of  Economic Analysis U.S. export and import commodity price deflators  from the online database. We also analyzed these data at the 2-digit  commodity level to determine what goods the United States exported to  and imported from Iran in various years and the relative importance of  U.S. trade to Iran for various years encompassing the imposition of the  trade bans.", "We used IMF Direction of Trade Statistics (May 2007 CD ROM) to analyze  trends in Iran\u2019s trade, exports and imports, as well as Iran\u2019s trade with the  world by major country groupings and individual partners, from 1986 to  2006. We determined that the U.S. commodity price deflators noted above  were not appropriate deflators for the purpose of analyzing Iran\u2019s global  trade. Thus, we converted the annual export and import data, which IMF  reports in U.S. dollars, into 2006 dollars using the following methodology.  We converted annual dollar trade flows to Iranian rials using an exchange  rate conversion factor from the World Bank\u2019s World Development  Indicators Online. This conversion factor, known as the DEC alternative  conversion factor, is, as a rule, the official exchange rate reported in the  IMF\u2019s International Financial Statistics. This alternative conversion  factor differs from the official rate when the official exchange rate is  judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate actually  applied in international transactions. In such cases, it employs a method  known as the Atlas method to average exchange rates for a given year and  the two preceding years, adjusted for differenced in rates of inflation  between the country and a specified groups of major trading countries.  For 1991 and 1992, for which the World Bank does not publish a DEC  alternative conversion factor for Iran, we constructed conversion rates by  applying rates of change exhibited in a purchasing power parity  conversion rate for Iran, from the World Development Indicators Online,  from 1990 to1993.", "As Iran does not publish separate price indices for exports and imports, in  their place we use the Iranian gross domestic product (GDP) deflator from  the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators Online to convert trade  flows into 2006 rials. We then use the official 2006 exchange rate (which  happens to be the same as the DEC conversion factor) to express these  trade flows in constant 2006 dollars. This methodology preserves the real  growth rates computed in real Iranian rials. Thus, it reflects how Iran may  view its global trade when adjusted for exchange rate anomalies and price  inflation.", "We obtained general information on other countries\u2019 trade in sensitive  goods (arms, aircraft, and nuclear equipment and technology) from  publicly available official sources, including State Department reports and  testimonies, Department of Justice data, the unclassified National  Intelligence Estimate, and CRS reports and testimonies. To identify  countries and the value of their exports to Iran of possibly sensitive items,  we used the global shipping company DHL\u2019s online interactive product  classification tool to identify Harmonized System (HS) trade codes in the  export control category 0: Nuclear materials, facilities, equipment and  miscellaneous items. We then used the UN trade database to identify  countries and their reported value of exports to Iran for these items.", "The Department of Energy\u2019s Energy Information Administration (EIA)  provided data on Iran\u2019s position in world oil and gas reserves and  production, gasoline consumption, and export earnings. We calculated  Iran\u2019s oil export revenue as a percent of Iran\u2019s GDP using reporting  countries\u2019 crude oil import statistics from Iran and GDP data from the  most currently available IMF International Financial Statistics CD ROM  (December 2006). To determine top Iranian crude oil export destinations  and respective country shares, we used UN trade statistics at the 2-digit  commodity level (HS2709), for the period 1989 to 2005, and ranked  countries by dollar value and country share of crude oil exports from Iran.  For the top recipients of Iran\u2019s crude oil, we also calculated each country\u2019s  crude oil imports from Iran as a percent of that country\u2019s total crude oil  imports to demonstrate the relative importance of Iranian crude oil to  these countries. We also used 2-digit commodity level (HS2710 and  HS2711) UN trade statistics to determine the major suppliers of refined  petroleum products to Iran.", "We based our assessment of Iran\u2019s near-term growth prospects on a  review of economists\u2019 reports on Iran, including IMF\u2019s 2007 Article IV  consultation with Iran and country reports on Iran from Economists  Intelligence Unit and Global Insight. We also utilized proprietary  information obtained from FACTS Global Energy regarding current  developments in Iran\u2019s energy sector. We supplemented our review with  reports on Iran from other official sources, including CRS and the  Department of Energy\u2019s EIA.", "To determine the development and current status of Iran\u2019s nuclear  program, we reviewed documents from the International Atomic Energy  Agency, an independent agency affiliated with the United Nations. We also  reviewed reports by the CRS specific to Iran\u2019s nuclear program and  proliferation concerns. Finally, we reviewed the November 2007  unclassified National Intelligence Estimate on Iran. We also reviewed State  and other documents to examine Iran\u2019s broad proliferation efforts. To  identify continued behavior by the government of Iran that establishes  continued support for terrorism, we reviewed the Department of State\u2019s  2006 Country Report on Terrorism, other unclassified documentation  (such as Department of State testimonies and CRS reports) as well as  classified information.", "To trace the development of UN sanctions against Iran for its efforts to  enrich uranium and possibly develop nuclear weapon capability, we  reviewed UN Security Council (UNSC) resolutions 1696 (2006), 1737  (2006), and 1747 (2007) and reports and documents from the UNSC 1737  Sanctions Committee. We also reviewed documentation from the  Department of State and CRS. The State Department\u2019s Bureau for  International Organization Affairs declined to meet with us, which  precluded direct contact with the United Nations.
