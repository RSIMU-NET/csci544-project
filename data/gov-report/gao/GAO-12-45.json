In 2007, GAO reported that in recent years states' annual demand for emergency relief funds often exceeded the program's $100 million annual authorization from the Highway Trust Fund and required supplemental appropriations from general revenues to address a backlog of funding requests from states. GAO recommended that FHWA tighten eligibility standards and coordinate with states to withdraw unneeded emergency relief funds, among other actions. For this report, GAO reviewed (1) Emergency Relief Program funding trends since 2007, (2) key program changes made in response to GAO's 2007 report, and (3) the extent to which selected emergency relief projects were approved in compliance with program eligibility requirements. GAO reviewed projects in New York, Texas, and Washington state, states selected based on the amount and frequency of funding allocations since 2007, among other factors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal years 2007 through 2010, the Emergency Relief Program received about $2.3 billion, of which $1.9 billion came from three supplemental appropriations compared with about $400 million authorized from the Highway Trust Fund. FHWA allocated this funding to 42 states and 3 territories to reduce the backlog of funding requests, with $485 million in unfunded requests remaining as of June 2011. This backlog list did not include funding requests for August 2011 damages from Hurricane Irene. Because the program lacks time frames to limit states from requesting funds years after events occur, the June 2011 backlog list includes about $90 million for events that occurred prior to fiscal year 1994. Without time limits for emergency relief funding requests, FHWA's ability to anticipate and manage future program costs is hindered. In response to GAO's 2007 report, FHWA withdrew about $367 million of unobligated emergency relief funds from states and redistributed most of this funding for other emergency relief needs. However, additional funding remains unused, including (1) at least $63 million allocated to states before fiscal year 2007 that has yet to be obligated to projects and (2) $341 million obligated between fiscal years 2001 and 2006 that remains unexpended. Due to a lack of time frames for states to close-out completed projects, FHWA lacks project status information to determine whether unexpended funding is no longer needed and could be deobligated. FHWA has not addressed GAO's 2007 recommendation to revise its regulations to limit the use of emergency relief to fully fund projects that have grown in scope and cost as a result of environmental or community concerns. The Emergency Relief Program faces the continued risk of escalating costs due to projects that have grown in scope beyond the program's goal of restoring damaged facilities to predisaster conditions. GAO's review of 83 emergency relief project files in three FHWA state offices found many instances of missing or incomplete documentation--as such, GAO was unable to determine the basis by which FHWA made many eligibility determinations. For example, about half of the project files did not include required repair cost estimates, and 39 of 58 (67 percent) emergency repair projects approved for 100 percent federal funding did not contain documentation of completion within 180 days--a requirement for states to receive 100 percent federal funding. FHWA lacks clear requirements for how states submit and FHWA approves key project documentation, which has resulted in FHWA state offices applying eligibility guidelines differently. Establishing standardized procedures for reviewing emergency relief documentation and making eligibility decisions would provide greater assurance that projects are in fact eligible and that FHWA makes eligibility determinations consistently and transparently."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes several recommendations including that FHWA establish (1) time frames to limit states' requests for emergency relief funds and to close completed projects and (2) standardized procedures for reviewing emergency relief documentation and making eligibility decisions.

However, in recent years the Highway Trust Fund has not been the only source of funds for the Emergency Relief Program.  The $100 million annual authorization of contract authority has remained  constant since 1972, and due to inflation, it has declined in real value.

As a result, the program has relied on supplemental  appropriations for 86 percent of its funding from fiscal years 1998 through  2006. In past years, supplemental appropriations were drawn from the  Highway Trust Fund. However, with the enactment of the Safe,  Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for  Users (SAFETEA-LU) in August 2005, Congress authorized additional  necessary funding for the Emergency Relief Program in excess of the  $100 million annual contract authority to be appropriated from general  revenues.", "In our 2007 report, we identified a significant fiscal imbalance between  available funds and eligible projects in the Emergency Relief Program.

We also raised  concerns about the use of emergency relief funds to fully finance projects  whose scope and costs had grown as a result of environmental and  community concerns. We made several recommendations to FHWA to  improve its management, including ensuring that unneeded emergency  relief allocations were withdrawn on a timely basis so the backlog of  unfunded requests could be addressed, and to revise program  regulations to tighten the eligibility criteria for emergency relief funding,  among other recommendations.", "As requested and in light of these concerns, this report reviews (1) FHWA  Emergency Relief Program funding trends since our 2007 report, (2) key  changes to the Emergency Relief Program implemented in response to  concerns raised in our 2007 report, and (3) the extent to which selected  emergency relief projects were approved in compliance with program  eligibility requirements.", "To identify Emergency Relief Program funding trends and key changes  made to the program since our 2007 report, we reviewed federal statutes,  including supplemental appropriation acts, and FHWA data on emergency  relief allocations to states from fiscal years 2007 through 2010.

Five of the 88  projects in our review had been withdrawn by states because, in part,  FHWA had determined them ineligible for emergency relief funds,  bringing the total number of projects reviewed to 83. We selected New  York, Texas, and Washington state because they were among the states  receiving the most funding allocations from fiscal years 2007 through  2010, among other factors. We chose the files according to several  criteria, including a criterion to examine a mix of active and closed  projects that were obligated more than $1 million in emergency relief  funds. Prior to our site visits, we requested that the division offices  provide all documentation they maintain for each of the projects selected  in our sample, which represented approximately 67 percent of all  emergency relief funds that FHWA obligated to those states during that  time period. We reviewed all the documentation provided during our site  visits, and requested follow-up information as necessary. To gather  additional information on the project files, we reviewed the procedures  used to manage and oversee emergency relief projects and interviewed  officials in the FHWA division offices and state departments of  transportation for all three states.

In 1996, we questioned FHWA\u2019s decision to use more than  $1 billion in emergency relief funds to replace the Cypress Viaduct in  Oakland, California, which collapsed as a result of the Loma Prieta   FHWA engineers initially estimated that  earthquake in October 1989.replacing the destroyed structure along its predisaster alignment would  cost $306 million. In response to public concern, Caltrans identified  several alternative alignments that it studied in a 2-year environmental  review. In 1991, Caltrans and FHWA decided to replace the destroyed  1.5-mile structure, which had bisected a residential area, with a new 5- mile structure running through active rail yards. This cost estimate later  increased to more than $1.1 billion at the time of our 1996 report\u2014an  increase of almost $800 million from FHWA\u2019s initial estimate of $306  million to restore the facility to its predisaster condition. As such, we  questioned whether the improvements and costs resulting from the  significant relocation and changes in scope should have been funded  through the Emergency Relief Program rather than the regular federal-aid  highway program. We recommended that FHWA modify its guidance to  clearly define what costs can be funded through the Emergency Relief  Program, particularly when an environmental review recommends  improvements or changes to the features of a facility from its predisaster  condition in a manner that adds costs and risks to the project.", "In response to our recommendation, FHWA amended its guidance to more clearly  indicate when limits should be placed on emergency relief funding, and when full funding  is appropriate, and we closed this recommendation. to restore damaged facilities to predisaster conditions. First, we noted  that relocating California S.R.1 at Devil\u2019s Slide could have been  addressed through the state\u2019s regular federal-aid highway program, rather  than through the Emergency Relief Program. If the regular federal-aid  highway program had been used, the project would not have been eligible  for 100 percent federal funding, and the federal government would have  saved an estimated $73 million. Second, we reported that the  reconstruction of the U.S. Highway 90 Biloxi Bay Bridge in Mississippi\u2014 which was destroyed in August 2005 during Hurricane Katrina\u2014grew in  scope and cost by $64 million as a result of community concerns.  Specifically, in response to a concern raised by a local shipbuilder about  the proposed height of the new bridge, Mississippi department of  transportation expanded the scope of the bridge reconstruction to  increase the bridge height to allow for future ships to pass under the  bridge. The original design was to provide an 85-foot clearance at a cost  of $275 million, but this scope was expanded to its current design to  provide a 95-foot clearance at a cost of $339 million.", "FHWA has clarified its definition of an eligible damage site as we  recommended in 2007, through its revisions to its Emergency Relief  Manual in 2009.  Specifically, FHWA\u2019s 2009 revisions clarified that  grouping damages to form an eligible site based solely on a political  subdivision (i.e., county or city boundaries) should not be accepted. This  change addressed our concern that FHWA division offices had different  interpretations of what constituted a site, such that damage sites that  were treated as eligible for emergency relief in one state may have not  been eligible in another state."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Incomplete Information in Emergency Relief Project Files in Three States Raises Concerns about FHWA\u2019s Eligibility Decisions and Program Oversight", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Documentation for Many Project Files We Reviewed Was Missing, Incomplete, or Inconsistent", "paragraphs": ["In our review of 83 selected emergency relief project files in three FHWA  division offices, we found that many of the project files reviewed did not  contain documentation called for in the Emergency Relief Manual to  support FHWA decisions that projects met program eligibility  requirements. Of the 83 projects in our review (totaling about $198.5  million in federal funds), 81 projects (about $192.8 million in federal  funds) had at least one instance of missing or incomplete documentation.  As a result of this missing information, we were unable to determine the  basis of FHWA\u2019s eligibility decisions for many of the projects in our file  review.", "The Emergency Relief Manual directs FHWA division offices to maintain  files containing information on the methods used to evaluate disasters  and FHWA\u2019s assessment of damages and estimates of cost. According to  the Emergency Relief Program regulations, program data should be  sufficient to identify the approved disaster and permit FHWA to determine  the eligibility of the proposed work.several areas of concern with FHWA\u2019s eligibility determinations based on   In our file review, we identified  missing, incomplete, or inconsistent documentation, as illustrated in table  3 and described below (see app. III for detailed results of our file review).", "Forty-seven of 83 project files (57 percent) lacked documentation for on- site damage inspections. In particular, they did not include a detailed  damage inspection report (DDIR) or the DDIR was not complete.  According to the Emergency Relief Manual, on-site detailed damage  inspections are conducted by the applicant or a state department of  transportation representative if the applicant is a local public agency, and  an FHWA representative, if available, to determine the extent of damage,  scope of repair work, preliminary estimate of the repair cost, and whether  a project is eligible for emergency relief funding. FHWA provides its  division offices with a DDIR form that states may use to document their  inspections and provide critical information necessary for determining  project eligibility, such as a listing of preliminary repair cost estimates for  equipment, labor, and materials for both emergency and permanent  repairs. Without such information on file for some projects, we could not  confirm that FHWA had that information to make emergency relief project  eligibility determinations.", "These documents may be missing due to lack of clear requirements from  FHWA. FHWA requires documented on-site damage inspections but does  not have a clear requirement for how states submit the inspections to  FHWA officials or for how they approve inspection reports; as a result, the  three division offices we visited applied the Emergency Relief Manual  guidelines differently. For example, none of the 28 project files we  reviewed in Texas included a DDIR because FHWA\u2019s Texas division  office relies instead on a \u201cprogram of projects,\u201d which is a spreadsheet of  all projects requesting emergency relief funds. In response to a draft  version of this report, FHWA\u2019s Office of Program Administration explained  that state departments of transportation may use any format to submit the  data necessary for FHWA to make an eligibility determination. FHWA\u2019s  Texas division officials stated that they find the program of projects useful  and believed it to be an FHWA requirement; however, we found that the  Emergency Relief Manual guidance was ambiguous and did not directly  state that this document can be used in place of DDIRs. One section the  Emergency Relief Manual indicates that the state department of  transportation is to submit the program of projects to the FHWA division  office, but it also states that the program of projects should relate the  damage to that described in the DDIRs. Furthermore, the manual  suggests in an appendix that the program of projects is actually a  package of all DDIRs resulting from the detailed damage inspections.", "In addition, our file review found that the project descriptions in the  program of projects did not always provide the detailed information  regarding damages and proposed repairs outlined in the Emergency  Relief Manual and found on a DDIR. For example, for one Texas project  totaling close to $1.7 million in both emergency and permanent repairs,  the project description was the same for both emergency and permanent  repairs and did not indicate what specific repair activities were conducted  for each repair type. Differentiation between emergency and permanent  repairs is important because emergency repairs are eligible for a higher  federal share and do not require prior FHWA authorization. Without  documentation showing a clear distinction between the emergency and  permanent repairs\u2014information that should be identified and documented  on a DDIR per program guidance\u2014we could not determine the basis for  FHWA\u2019s decision that this project met the eligibility requirements for both  repair types. Overall, we found the program of projects was less useful  than the DDIR for evaluating the full range of information necessary to  determine the basis for FHWA\u2019s eligibility determinations.", "We found that about half of the projects in our sample (42 of 83) did not  include repair cost estimates. The Emergency Relief Manual states that at  a minimum the division office\u2019s project file should contain copies of the  FHWA field engineer\u2019s assessments on damage and estimates of cost.", "Officials in each of the FHWA division offices that we visited reported that  the state\u2019s department of transportation is responsible for preparing repair  cost estimates, but that FHWA area engineers also conduct some on-site  inspections to verify the cost estimates provided. In total, 42 projects in  our sample did not include any repair cost estimates; thus, we could not  confirm that FHWA officials had this information to make eligibility  determinations for those projects. For example, a portion of two projects  in our sample for emergency and permanent repairs was to remove sand  from drainage ditches and was initially approved by the FHWA Texas  division office for reimbursement of up to $1.3 million, although the project  file included no repair cost estimate for any of the work associated with  the project. Additionally, no information was available in the project file to  explain the FHWA Texas division office\u2019s decision to later approve a  nearly 40 percent increase from $1.3 million to the final approved amount  of $1.85 million. In responding to a draft of this report, DOT stated that the  cost of the project increased because more sand was removed from the  drainage ditches than originally estimated. However, no documentation of  this change was included in FHWA\u2019s project files.", "FHWA officials reported that the division office in Texas reviews a sample  of preliminary cost estimates based on risk, among other factors, prior to  making any eligibility decisions. According to the officials, FHWA\u2019s Texas  division office reviewed preliminary cost estimates of at least 10 of the 30  projects included in our file review before determining eligibility. The  officials also reported that this sampling approach is consistent with  FHWA\u2019s stewardship agreement with TXDOT and the fact that states  have assumed oversight responsibility for design and construction of  many federal-aid highway projects, including emergency relief projects.  FHWA also reported that TXDOT\u2019s oversight responsibilities do not  extend to determining whether particular projects are eligible for federal  funds. Furthermore, the Emergency Relief Manual states that Emergency  Relief Program eligibility determinations reside with FHWA, and estimated  repair costs should be documented to determine eligibility. As such, the  practice of reviewing a sample of preliminary cost estimates does not  appear to be consistent with the requirements in the Emergency Relief  Manual, and as a result, we could not determine the basis of FHWA\u2019s  eligibility decisions for those project cost estimates it did not review.", "We found other cases in which cost increases were not documented  according to the internal policies established by each of the division  offices we visited. In New York and Texas, FHWA division officials stated  they require additional documentation to justify cost increases of 25  percent or more. In Washington state, FHWA division office officials  stated they require additional documentation if costs increase by 10  percent or more. Yet 14 percent of the project files we reviewed (12 of 83)  showed total cost increases that exceeded the limits established by the  three division offices and no additional documentation was on file to  support the increases.", "The majority of the emergency repair project files that we reviewed did  not include documentation demonstrating that emergency repairs were  completed within 180 days from the event to be eligible for 100 percent  federal reimbursement. included emergency repairs approved to receive 100 percent federal  funding reimbursement if repairs were completed within 180 days of the  event occurrence. However, 39 of the 58 (67 percent) did not have  documentation on file to show the completion date of those repairs (see  table 3). In total, only 14 of 58 (24 percent) emergency repair projects  provided a completion date that was within 180 days of the event\u2019s  occurrence. For the majority (39 of 58) of projects, we were unable to  confirm whether the emergency repairs were completed within 180 days  and whether these projects were eligible to receive 100 percent federal  reimbursement.", "Emergency repairs must be completed within 180 days from the event to be eligible for  100 percent federal funding. See 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 120(e); also see the FHWA regulation 23  C.F.R. \u00a7 668.107(a). completion. As such, FHWA lacks a standardized process for verifying  the completion of emergency repairs within 180 days on projects for  which it does not exercise full oversight. By law, states assume oversight  responsibility for the design and construction of many federal-aid highway  projects, including the vast majority of emergency relief projects in the  three divisions we visited. As such, the states\u2014rather than FHWA\u2014were  responsible for conducting final inspections of emergency relief projects.  States are required to conduct a final inspection for all federal-aid  highway projects under state oversight, and these inspections could be  useful to determine federal share eligibility of emergency repairs if they  provide project completion dates. While officials in each of the three state  departments of transportation told us that they conduct final inspections of  emergency repairs, we found only two final inspection reports prepared  by states in FHWA\u2019s records to confirm the completion of emergency  repairs within the required time frame. In addition, when we reviewed final  inspection reports from one of the state departments of transportation in  our review, we were frequently unable to verify completion dates.  Specifically, 11 of the 12 final inspections performed by officials at New  York State Department of Transportation for projects in our review did not  include project completion dates. Although the Emergency Relief Manual  states that FHWA division offices reserve the right to conduct a final  inspection of any emergency relief project, only the FHWA Texas division  reported conducting spot inspections for a sample of emergency relief  projects.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, DOT stated that the FHWA New  York state division office uses other means to verify completion of  emergency repairs within 180 days. According to DOT, the state often  submits its DDIRs to FHWA after emergency repairs are completed,  which allows FHWA to verify the eligibility and completion of an  emergency repair when it reviews the DDIR. DOT reported that the  FHWA division office does not sign the DDIR until it confirms the work is  completed, and that its signature indicates verification that the work was  performed within the required time frame. However, our file review found  that 14 of the 18 emergency repair projects in New York that were  approved for 100 percent federal funding did not have an FHWA  signature on the DDIR.", "In addition to a lack of documentation, we found eight instances in which  permanent repair projects may have incorrectly received 100 percent  federal share reimbursement. According to the Emergency Relief  Manual, absent specific legislative approval, permanent repair work is not  to be considered emergency repair work even if it is completed within 180  days. However, we found instances in which projects were determined to  be permanent repairs based on information in the project files, but were  later authorized to receive 100 percent federal share. For example, in one  project in our review, FHWA\u2019s Washington state division office approved  permanent repairs to a state highway for $2.6 million in estimated  damages caused by a landslide. Our review of FHWA financial records  for this project indicates that FHWA later authorized a federal  reimbursement of $5.3 million, roughly 99 percent of the total project cost  of nearly $5.4 million. FHWA Washington state division officials reported  that this project was considered to be a permanent repair performed as  an incidental part of emergency repair work. However, the project files  did not include any emergency repair work to accompany the approved  permanent repairs. According to these officials, the FHWA Washington  state division interpreted the 2003 version of the Emergency Relief  Manual as allowing incidental permanent work to be funded at 100  percent federal share either with or as emergency repair work. However,  the manual states that during the 180 day period following the disaster,  permanent repair work is reimbursed at the normal pro rata share unless  performed as an incidental part of emergency repair work. As such,  based on the program guidance, this project should have been  reimbursed at 86.5 percent federal share.", "A primary purpose of the Emergency Relief Program is to restore highway  facilities to predisaster conditions, not to provide improvements or added  protective features to highway facilities. However, according to FHWA  regulations and the Emergency Relief Manual, such improvements may  be considered eligible betterments if the state provides economic  justification, such as a benefit-cost analysis that weighs the cost of the  betterment against the risk of eligible recurring damage and the cost of  future repair through the Emergency Relief Program. In our file review  we identified two areas of concern regarding betterments, including  instances of missing documentation of benefit-cost analyses:", "Lack of documentation of required benefit-cost analyses. Six of the 15  projects (40 percent) identified as betterments in our review did not  contain the required benefit-cost analyses in their files to justify the   As a result we were unable to determine the basis on betterment. which FHWA approved these six betterments. We also found one  instance in which the benefit-cost analyses used to justify an  approved betterment did not meet Emergency Relief Program  requirements. Specifically, FHWA\u2019s New York division office approved  a betterment of almost $1.6 million to repair and improve a damaged  roadway and shoulder caused by an April 2007 storm. However, we  found that the report prepared to justify the betterment did not weigh  the cost of the proposed betterment against the risk of future  damages and repair costs to the Emergency Relief Program, as  required by program regulations. Consequently, we were unable to  determine the basis on which FHWA approved the $1.6 million  betterment.", "Lack of documentation indicating whether projects include  betterments. We found that it was often difficult to determine which  projects included betterments, as FHWA lacks a standard process for  where and how betterments should be identified in project  documentation. The Emergency Relief Manual states that betterments  must receive prior FHWA approval and that further development of  contemplated betterments should be accomplished with FHWA  involvement, necessitating that proposed betterments are specifically  identified. We found eight project files with indications that the projects  may have included betterments that were not identified explicitly in  project documentation or by FHWA officials. For example, following  the completion of emergency repairs to remove debris and protect a  bridge against erosion caused by a landslide, the FHWA Washington  state division office approved an additional $3.7 million in permanent  repairs in response to continued erosion and movement of the hillside.  The documentation in the project file indicated that this permanent  work was added to stabilize the slide area in anticipation of future  flooding. According to officials from the FHWA Washington state  division, this slide stabilization project was a betterment, but the  project file did not contain documentation to indicate that this project  was in fact a betterment.", "FHWA provides considerable discretion to its division offices to tailor the  Emergency Relief Program within states and lacks a standard mechanism  to specifically identify whether a project includes a betterment. FHWA\u2019s  Office of Asset Management has developed an Economic Analysis Primer  for FHWA division offices to use when evaluating benefit-cost analyses  for federal-aid program projects. However, neither the Emergency Relief  Manual nor the Economic Analysis Primer provide sample benefit-cost  analyses or specific guidance on what information should be included in  the benefit-cost analysis to demonstrate that the proposed betterment will  result in a savings in future recurring repair costs under the Emergency  Relief Program. Because we had found betterments without  documentation of the required benefit-cost analyses on file and identified  possible betterments that were not explicitly identified as such, we could  not confirm that federal funds were being reimbursed in accordance with  the requirements of the Emergency Relief Program. Further, absent  specific guidance for identifying and approving betterments to its division  offices, FHWA cannot be assured that the Emergency Relief Program is  being administered consistently."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The federal government plays a critical role in providing financial  assistance to states in response to natural disasters and other  catastrophic events. Given the costs of these events and the significant  fiscal challenges facing both states and the federal government, it is  increasingly necessary that federal financial support be delivered in an  effective, transparent, and accountable manner so that limited funds are  put to their best use. FHWA\u2019s stewardship of the Emergency Relief  Program could be better structured to meet that necessity.", "First, because some emergency relief projects can be delayed for many  years due to environmental or community concerns and projects can  grow significantly in scope and cost, the federal government faces the risk  of incurring long-term costs for such projects. FHWA has limited tools to  control its exposure to the costs of older events and ensure that as  projects grow in scope and cost that they do not go beyond the original  intent of the program, which is to assist states to restore damaged  facilities to their predisaster conditions. Once an event has been  approved for emergency relief by FHWA, the Emergency Relief Program  as currently structured does not limit the time during which states may  request additional funds and add projects, which increase the size of  FHWA\u2019s backlog list. Because Emergency Relief Program funding is not  subject to the annual limits of the regular federal-aid highway program,  states have an incentive to seek as much emergency relief funding as  possible. Consequently, without reasonable time limits for states to  submit funding requests for such older events, FHWA\u2019s ability to  anticipate and manage future costs to the Emergency Relief Program is  hindered, as is Congress\u2019 ability to oversee the program. Furthermore,  without specific action by FHWA to address the recommendation from our  2007 report that it revise its emergency relief regulations to tighten  eligibility criteria, the Emergency Relief Program will continue to face the  risk of funding projects with scopes that have expanded beyond the goal  of emergency relief and may be more appropriately funded through the  regular federal-aid highway program.", "Second, while FHWA has taken some important steps in response to our  2007 report to manage program funding by withdrawing unobligated  balances from states, it faces challenges in tracking allocations that have  been provided to states. In particular, because FHWA division offices  have allowed states to transfer unobligated allocations from an existing  event to new events, and because FHWA headquarters is not tracking  which divisions have done so, FHWA headquarters does not have the  information needed to identify and withdraw all unneeded funds. In  addition, without time frames to expedite the close-out of completed  emergency relief projects, FHWA lacks useful information to help  determine whether obligated but unexpended program funds are no  longer needed and could be deobligated.", "Finally, the fact that we could not determine the basis of FHWA\u2019s eligibility  decisions in three states on projects costing more than $190 million raises  questions about whether emergency relief funds are being put to their  intended use and whether these issues could be indicative of larger  problems nationwide. While federal law allows states to assume oversight  over design and construction of much of the federal-aid highway program,  including many emergency relief projects, FHWA is ultimately responsible  for ensuring that federal funds are efficiently and effectively managed and  that projects receiving scarce emergency relief funds are in fact eligible.  This is especially important in light of the fact that emergency relief funds  have been derived principally from general revenues in recent years and  that the funds that states receive are above and beyond the funding limits  for their regular federal-aid highway program funds.  Without clear and  standardized procedures for divisions to make and document eligibility  decisions\u2014including documenting damage inspections and cost  estimates, verifying and documenting the completion of emergency repair  projects within the required time frame, and evaluating information  provided to justify proposed betterments\u2014FHWA lacks assurance that  only eligible projects are approved, and that its eligibility decisions are  being made and documented in a clear, consistent, and transparent  manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the accountability of federal funds, ensure that FHWA\u2019s  eligibility decisions are applied consistently, and enhance oversight of the  Emergency Relief Program, we recommend that the Secretary of  Transportation direct the FHWA Administrator to take the following four  actions:", "Establish specific time frames to limit states\u2019 ability to request  emergency relief funds years after an event\u2019s occurrence, so that  FHWA can better manage the financial risk of reimbursing states for  projects that have grown in scope and cost.", "Instruct FHWA division offices to no longer permit states to transfer  unobligated allocations from a prior emergency relief event to a new  event so that allocations that are no longer needed may be identified  and withdrawn by FHWA.", "Establish clear time frames for states to close out completed projects  in order to improve FHWA\u2019s ability to assess whether unexpended  program funds are no longer needed and could be deobligated.", "Establish standardized procedures for FHWA division offices to follow  in reviewing emergency relief documentation and making eligibility  decisions.

We incorporated this information into the final report; however, since a  state\u2019s list of projects may be amended at any time to add new work, we  continue to believe that FHWA\u2019s ability to anticipate and manage future  costs to the Emergency Relief Program is hindered absent specific time  frames to limit states\u2019 requests for additional funds years after an event\u2019s  occurrence. Such time frames would provide FHWA with an important  tool to better manage program costs.", "DOT also commented that its ability to control the costs of some of the  projects cited in the report that have grown in scope and cost over the  years is limited in some cases by the fact that DOT received statutory  direction from Congress to fund these projects.

We incorporated  additional information to recognize this statutory direction; however, a  determination by Congress that a particular event should qualify for relief  under the Emergency Relief Program, or for other individual actions, does  not relieve FHWA of its stewardship and oversight responsibilities. Except  as Congress otherwise provides, this includes its responsibility to  determine whether enhancements to projects or betterments are  consistent with its regulations and the intent of the Emergency Relief  Program to restore damaged facilities to predisaster conditions.

We  interviewed FHWA officials in the Office of Program Administration to  determine why specific changes were made, and we interviewed officials  in three FHWA division offices to determine how program changes were  implemented. To corroborate information provided by FHWA regarding its  process of withdrawing unused Emergency Relief Program funds from  states, we reviewed FMIS data on the emergency relief funds that were  allocated among all states and territories, obligated to specific projects,  and the remaining unobligated balance for all active Emergency Relief  Program codes as of May 31, 2011. To determine other amounts of  program funding that remained unused, we reviewed data in FMIS on the  amount of emergency relief funding obligated to specific projects and  expended by all states and territories for events occurring from fiscal  years 2001 through 2010. We provided FHWA officials with our  methodology for gathering data from FMIS to ensure that our data queries  were accurate.

The states selected are  not representative of the conditions in all states, the state departments of  transportation, or FHWA division offices, but are intended to be examples  of the range of practices and projects being funded by the Emergency  Relief Program across the country. These states were selected based on  several criteria:  1.  The overall amount of emergency relief funding allocated to a state  from fiscal years 2007 through 2010, to identify those states that were  allocated the most funding (at least $15 million) over that period,  based on allocation data provided by FHWA headquarters. 2.  Frequency of funding requests to identify those states that requested  funds for three or more fiscal years from 2007 through 2010. 3.  The occurrence of an eligible emergency relief event since FHWA  updated its Emergency Relief Manual in November 2009.

We narrowed our selection down  by eliminating those states that experienced outlier events, such as North  Dakota\u2019s reoccurring basin flooding at Devils Lake and the catastrophic  failure of the Interstate 35 West bridge in Minnesota. We judgmentally  selected New York, Texas, and Washington state to reflect a geographic  dispersion of states.", "We reviewed a sample of emergency relief project files in the FHWA  division office in each of these states to determine whether the project  files included required or recommended documentation cited in federal  statute, regulations, and FHWA program guidance. Such documentation  included the President or state governors\u2019 proclamation of a disaster,  detailed damage inspection reports, cost estimates for repairs,  photographs of the damage, and other information. Across the three  division offices, we selected a nongeneralizable sample of 88 Emergency  Relief Program files out of a total universe of 618 project files for  emergency relief projects approved by FHWA in those states from fiscal  years 2007 through 2010. Among the 88 projects in our review, 5 projects  had been withdrawn by states as FHWA had determined them ineligible  for emergency relief funds, or they were reimbursed through a third party  insurance settlement, bringing the total number of projects reviewed to  83. The project files we reviewed represented approximately 67 percent  of all emergency relief funds obligated to those states during that time  period. Those projects were selected based on the following criteria:  1.  All projects with more than $1 million in obligated federal funds  between fiscal years 2007 and 2010, including a mix of active and  closed projects and various event or disaster types. 2.  Projects with more than $1 million in obligated federal funds for events  from fiscal years 2001 through 2006 on the list of formal emergency  relief funding requests as of March 7, 2011, that were either currently  active or were completed more than five years after the event  occurred. 3.  Projects that had other characteristics that we determined to warrant  further review, such as events with $0 amounts listed in FHWA\u2019s  FMIS database for total cost or which had expended relatively small  amounts of funding compared with the obligated amounts in FMIS.", "Prior to our site visits, we requested that the division offices provide all  documentation they maintain for each of the projects selected in our  sample. We reviewed all the documentation provided during our site  visits, and requested follow-up information as necessary. In conducting  our file review, a GAO analyst independently reviewed each file and  completed a data collection instrument to document the eligibility  documentation that was included for each file. A second reviewer  independently reviewed the file to verify whether the specific information  identified by the first reviewer was present in the file. The analysts met to  discuss and resolve any areas of disagreement until a consensus was  reached on whether the required information was included in the file. To  gather additional information on the project files we reviewed and the  procedures used to manage and oversee emergency relief projects, we  interviewed officials in the FHWA division offices and the departments of  transportation in our three selected states. We provided the results of our  file review to FHWA for their comment and incorporated their responses  as necessary within our analysis.", "Lastly, we contacted state and local audit organizations through the  National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers, and Treasurers for  the three states we reviewed, as well as North Dakota, to obtain reports  or analyses that were conducted on FHWA\u2019s Emergency Relief Program.  None of the states in our review had conducted substantive work on the  Emergency Relief Program.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2010 to November  2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Summary of Emergency Relief Funding for Projects at Devils Lake, North Dakota", "paragraphs": ["Devils Lake in North Dakota lies in a large natural basin and lacks a  natural outlet for rising water to flow out of the lake. Starting in the early  1990s, the lake level has risen dramatically\u2014nearly 30 feet since 1992\u2014 which has threatened the roadways near the lake which were built in the  1930s and 1940s when lake water levels were lower. In April 2000,  FHWA issued a memorandum that authorized raising the roads at Devils  Lake in response to a predicted rise in the water level of the lake that was  within 3 feet of causing inundation, as forecasted by the National Weather  Service or U.S. Geological Survey. This allowance to repair roadways  prior to damages incurred by an event is a unique provision for the FHWA  Emergency Relief Program, which otherwise funds only post-disaster  repair or restoration. The basin flooding events at Devils Lake also  precipitated a related problem at Devils Lake, as some communities  around the lake plugged culverts under roadways to impound rising water  and protect property from flooding, which increased the roadways\u2019 risk of  failure. These roads were subsequently referred to as \u201croads-acting-as- dams\u201d which required additional improvements to ensure their structural  integrity to serve as dams.", "Devils Lake projects involve multiple stakeholders, depending on the  location and type of roadway. FHWA\u2019s North Dakota division office is  responsible for overseeing the Emergency Relief Program projects  administered by North Dakota department of transportation. FHWA\u2019s  Office of Federal Lands Highway is responsible for the oversight of the  Emergency Relief on Federally Owned Roads program, which covers  projects on the Spirit Lake Tribe Indian Reservation. The Central Division  of Federal Lands Highway leads the overall coordination among the  federal, state, and local agencies. FHWA reported that the two FHWA  offices are working together to address the roads-acting-as dams projects  which affect state highways and roads on the Sprit Lake Tribe Indian  Reservation. The North Dakota department of transportation and the  Spirit Lake Tribe are responsible for administering the construction  projects on their respective roads.", "To ensure the integrity of the roads at Devils Lake, Congress included  funding provisions in Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation  Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) to raise the roadways and  make improvements to roads-acting-as-dams. Through SAFETEA-LU,  Congress authorized up to $10 million of Emergency Relief Program  funds to be expended annually, up to a total of $70 million, for work in the  Devils Lake region of North Dakota to address the roads-acting-as-dams  situation. These funds are known as section 1937 funds for the provision  in SAFETEA-LU which authorized them. In the absence of other authority,  this $10 million must come out of the $100 million annual authorization of  contract authority that funds the Emergency Relief Program, effectively  reducing the annual emergency relief funding available to other states to  $90 million. SAFETEA-LU also included language that exempted the work  in the Devils Lake area from the need for further emergency declarations  to qualify for emergency relief funding.", "According to a June 24, 2011, FHWA policy memo, the final allocation of  section 1937 funds was made on March 16, 2011, and the $70 million  limit has been reached. Although rising water levels at Devils Lake are  expected to continue into the future, no further federal-aid highway funds  are eligible to raise roads-acting-as-dams or to construct flood control and  prevention facilities to protect adjacent roads and lands."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Results of GAO\u2019s File Review of Emergency Relief Project Documentation Available in Three FHWA Division Offices", "paragraphs": ["Figure 6 represents the results of our review of 88 selected project files  from FHWA\u2019s division offices in New York, Texas, and Washington state.
