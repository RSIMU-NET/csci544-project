By exploiting software vulnerabilities, hackers can cause significant damage. While patches, or software fixes, for these vulnerabilities are often well publicized and available, they are frequently not quickly or correctly applied. The federal government recently awarded a contract for a government-wide patch notification service designed to provide agencies with information to support effective patching. Forty-one agencies now subscribe to this service. At the request of the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Technology, Information Policy, Intergovernmental Relations, and the Census, GAO reviewed (1) two recent software vulnerabilities and related responses; (2) effective patch management practices, related federal efforts, and other available tools; and (3) additional steps that can be taken to better protect sensitive information systems from software vulnerabilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The increase in reported information systems vulnerabilities has been staggering, especially in the past 3 years. Automated attacks are successfully exploiting such software vulnerabilities, as increasingly sophisticated hacking tools become more readily available and easier to use. The response to two recent critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft Corporation and Cisco Systems, Inc., products illustrates the collaborative efforts between federal entities and the information security community to combat potential attacks. Patch management is one means of dealing with these increasing vulnerabilities to cybersecurity. Critical elements to the patch management process include management support, standardized policies, dedicated resources, risk assessment, and testing. In addition to working with software vendors and security research groups to develop patches or temporary solutions, the federal government has taken a number of other steps to address software vulnerabilities. For example, offered without charge to federal agencies, the federal patch notification service provides subscribers with information on trusted, authenticated patches available for their technologies. At present, the government is considering broadening the scope of these services and capabilities, along with the number of users. Other specific tools also exist that can assist in performing patch management. In addition to implementing effective patch management practices, several additional steps can be taken when addressing software vulnerabilities. Such steps include stronger software engineering practices and continuing research and development into new approaches toward computer security."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to participate in the Subcommittee\u2019s hearing  on recent cyber incidents and the role of software patch management in  mitigating the risks that these types of events will recur.

The increasing complexity and size of software programs  contribute to the growth in software flaws. For example, Microsoft  Windows 2000 reportedly contains about 35 million lines of code,  compared with about 15 million lines for Windows 95. As reported by the  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), based on various  studies of code inspections, most estimates suggest that there are as many  as 20 flaws per thousand lines of software code. While most flaws do not  create security vulnerabilities, the potential for these errors reflects the  difficulty and complexity involved in delivering trustworthy code. By  exploiting software vulnerabilities, hackers and others who spread  malicious code can cause significant damage, ranging from Web site  defacement to taking control of entire systems, and thereby being able to  read, modify, or delete sensitive information, destroy systems, disrupt  operations, or launch attacks against other organizations\u2019 systems.", "Between 1995 and the first half of 2003, the CERT\uf8e8 Coordination Center  (CERT/CC) reported 11,155 security vulnerabilities that resulted from  software flaws. Figure 1 illustrates the dramatic growth in security  vulnerabilities over these years.", "The growing number of known vulnerabilities increases the number of  potential attacks created by the hacker community. As vulnerabilities are  discovered, attackers may attempt to exploit them. Attacks can be  launched against specific targets or widely distributed through viruses and  worms.", "Worms and viruses are commonly used to launch denial-of-service attacks,  which generally flood targeted networks and systems with so much  transmission of data that regular traffic is either slowed or completely  interrupted. Such attacks have been utilized ever since the groundbreaking  Morris worm, which brought 10 percent of the systems connected to  Internet systems to a halt in November 1988. In 2001, the Code Red worm  used a denial-of-service attack to affect millions of computer users by  shutting down Web sites, slowing Internet service, and disrupting business  and government operations. This type of attack continues to be used by  recent worms, including Blaster, which I will discuss further later in my  testimony.", "The sophistication and effectiveness of cyber attack have steadily  advanced. Because automated tools now exist, CERT/CC has noted,  attacks that once took weeks or months to propagate over the Internet  now take just hours, or even minutes. Code Red achieved an infection rate  of over 20,000 systems within 10 minutes, foreshadowing more damaging  and devastating attacks. Indeed, earlier this year, the Slammer worm,  which successfully attacked at least 75,000 systems, became the fastest  computer worm in history, infecting more than 90 percent of vulnerable  systems within 10 minutes.", "Frequently, skilled hackers develop exploitation tools and post them on  Internet hacking sites. These tools are then readily available for others to  download, allowing even inexperienced programmers to create a  computer virus or to literally point and click to launch an attack.  According to a NIST publication, 30 to 40 new attack tools are posted to  the Internet every month.", "The threat to systems connected to the Internet is illustrated by the  increasing number of computer security incidents reported to CERT/CC.  This number rose from just under 10,000 in 1999 to over 52,000 in 2001, to  about 82,000 in 2002, and to over 76,000 for the first and second quarters of  2003. And these are only the incidents that are reported. According to the  Director of CERT/CC, as much as 80 percent of actual incidents go  unreported, in most cases because the organization was either unable to  recognize that its systems had been penetrated (because there were no  indications of penetration or attack) or because it was reluctant to report  an incident. Figure 2 illustrates the number of incidents reported to  CERT/CC from 1995 through the second quarter of 2003.", "According to CERT/CC, about 95 percent of all network intrusions could  be avoided by keeping systems up to date with appropriate patches;  however, such patches are often not quickly or correctly applied.  Maintaining current patches is becoming more difficult, as the length of  time between the awareness of a vulnerability and the introduction of an  exploit is shrinking. For example, the Blaster worm was released almost  simultaneously with the announcement of the vulnerability it exploited.", "Successful attacks on unpatched software vulnerabilities have caused  billions of dollars in damage. Following are examples of significant  damage caused by worms that could have been prevented had available  patches been effectively installed:  In September 2001 the Nimda worm appeared, reportedly infecting  hundreds of thousands of computers around the world, using some of the  most significant attack methods of Code Red II and 1999\u2019s Melissa virus  that allowed it to spread widely in a short amount of time. A patch had  been made publicly available the previous month.", "On January 25, 2003, Slammer triggered a global Internet slowdown and  caused considerable harm through network outages and other unforeseen  consequences. As we discussed in our April testimony, the worm  reportedly shut down a 911 emergency call center, canceled airline flights,  and caused automated teller machine (ATM) failures. According to media  reports, First USA Inc., an Internet service provider, experienced network  performance problems after an attack by the Slammer worm, due to a  failure to patch three of its systems. Additionally, the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission reported that Slammer also infected a nuclear power plant\u2019s  network, resulting in the inability of the computers to communicate with  each other, disrupting two important systems at the facility. In July 2002,  Microsoft had released a patch for its software vulnerability that was  exploited by Slammer. Nevertheless, according to media reports, some of  Microsoft\u2019s own systems were infected by Slammer.", "In addition to understanding the threat posed by security vulnerabilities, it  is useful to understand the process of vulnerability identification and  response. In general, when security vulnerabilities are discovered, a  process is initiated to effectively address the situation through appropriate  reporting and response. Typically, this process begins when security  vulnerabilities are discovered by software vendors, security research  groups, users, or other interested parties, including the hacker community.  When a software vendor is made aware of a vulnerability in its product,  the vendor typically first validates that the vulnerability indeed exists. If  the vulnerability is deemed critical, the vendor may convene a group of  experts, including major clients and key incident-response groups such the  Federal Computer Incident Response Center (FedCIRC) and CERT/CC, to  discuss and plan remediation and response efforts.", "After a vulnerability is validated, the software vendor develops and tests a  patch and/or workaround. A workaround may entail blocking access to or  disabling vulnerable programs.", "The incident response groups and the vendor typically prepare a detailed  public advisory to be released at a set time. The advisory often contains a  description of the vulnerability, including its level of criticality; systems  that are affected; potential impact if exploited; recommendations for  workarounds, and Web site links where a patch (if publicly available) can  be downloaded. Incident-response groups as well as software vendors may  continue to issue updates as new information about the vulnerability is  discovered. When a worm or virus is reported that exploits a vulnerability,  virus detection software vendors also participate in the process. Such  vendors develop and make available to their subscribers downloadable  \u201csignature files\u201d that are used, in conjunction with their software, to  identify and stop the virus or worm from infecting systems protected by  their software. The Organization for Internet Safety (OIS), which consists  of leading security researchers and vendors, recently issued a voluntary  framework for vulnerability reporting and response."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Collaborative Response to Two Recent Software Vulnerabilities", "paragraphs": ["Recently, two critical vulnerabilities were discovered in widely used  commercial software products.

Policies  provide the foundation for ensuring that requirements are communicated  across an entity. In addition, selecting and implementing appropriate patch  management tools is an important consideration for facilitating effective  and efficient patch management.", "Dedicated resources and clearly assigned responsibilities. It is  important that the organization assign clear responsibility for ensuring  that the patch management process is effective. NIST recommends  creating a designated group whose duties would include supporting  administrators in finding and fixing vulnerabilities in the organization\u2019s  software. It is also important that the individuals involved in patch  management have the skills and knowledge needed to perform their  responsibilities, and that systems administrators be trained regarding how  to identify new patches and vulnerabilities.", "Current technology inventory. Creating and maintaining a current  inventory of all hardware equipment, software packages, services, and  other technologies installed and used by the organization is an essential  element of successful patch management. This systems inventory assists  in determining the number of systems that are vulnerable and require  remediation, as well as in locating the systems and identifying their  owners.", "Identification of relevant vulnerabilities and patches. It is important  to proactively monitor for vulnerabilities and patches for all software  identified in the systems inventory. Various tools and services are  available to assist in identifying vulnerabilities and their respective  patches. Using multiple sources can help to provide a more  comprehensive view of vulnerabilities.", "Risk assessment. When a vulnerability is discovered and a related patch  and/or alternative workaround is released, the entity should consider the  importance of the system to operations, the criticality of the vulnerability,  and the risk of applying the patch. Since some patches can cause  unexpected disruption to entities\u2019 systems, organizations may choose not  to apply every patch, at least not immediately, even though it may be  deemed critical by the software vendor that created it. The likelihood that  the patch will disrupt the system is a key factor to consider, as is the  criticality of the system or process that the patch affects.", "Testing. Another critical step is to test each individual patch against  various systems configurations in a test environment before installing it  enterprisewide to determine any impact on the network. Such testing will  help determine whether the patch functions as intended and its potential  for adversely affecting the entity\u2019s systems. In addition, while patches are  being tested, organizations should also be aware of workarounds, which  can provide temporary relief until a patch is applied. Testing has been  identified as a challenge by government and private-sector officials, since  the urgency in remediating a security vulnerability can limit or delay  comprehensive testing. Time pressures can also result in software  vendors\u2019 issuing poorly written patches that can degrade system  performance and require yet another patch to remediate the problem. For  instance, Microsoft has admittedly issued security patches that have been  recalled because they have caused systems to crash or are too large for a  computer\u2019s capacity. Further, a complex, heterogeneous systems  environment can lengthen this already time-consuming and time-sensitive  process because it takes longer to test the patch in various systems  configurations.", "Distributing patches. Organizations can deploy patches to systems  manually or by using an automated tool. One challenge to deploying  patches appropriately is that remote users may not be connected at the  time of deployment, leaving the entity\u2019s networks vulnerable from the  remote user\u2019s system because they have not yet been patched. One private- sector entity stated that its network first became affected by the Microsoft  RPC vulnerability when remote users plugged their laptops into the  network after being exposed to the vulnerability from other sources.", "Monitoring through network and host vulnerability scanning.", "Networks can be scanned on a regular basis to assess the network  environment, and whether patches have been effectively applied. Systems  administrators can take proactive steps to preempt computer security  incidents within their entities by regularly monitoring the status of patches  once they are deployed.

In addition, NIST offers a source of vulnerability data, which I will discuss  later in this testimony. Further, in accordance with OMB\u2019s reporting  instructions for the first year implementation of the Federal Information  Security Management Act (FISMA), maintaining up-to-date patches is a  part of FISMA\u2019s system configuration requirements. As such, OMB  requires that agencies report how they confirm that patches have been  tested and installed in a timely manner. In addition, certain  governmentwide services are offered to federal agencies to assist them in  ensuring that software vulnerabilities are patched. For example, FedCIRC  was established to provide a central focal point for incident reporting,  handling, prevention, and recognition for the federal government. Its  purpose is to ensure that the government has critical services available in  order to withstand or quickly recover from attacks against its information  resources.", "In addition, for the two recent vulnerabilities just discussed in my  testimony, OMB and FedCIRC held teleconferences with agency Chief  information officers to discuss vulnerabilities and request that agencies  report on the status of their actions to patch them. An OMB official  indicated that they planned to hold meetings with agencies to discuss  ways to improve communication of and followup on critical  vulnerabilities, including addressing some of the challenges identified in  the two recent exercises, such as delays in reaching key security personnel  in certain instances.", "FedCIRC also initiated PADC to provide users with a method of obtaining  information on security patches relevant to their enterprise and access to  patches that have been tested in a laboratory environment. The federal  government offers PADC to federal civilian agencies at no cost. According  to FedCIRC, as of last month, 41 agencies were using PADC. Table 2 lists  its features and benefits, as reported by FedCIRC. OMB reported that  while many agencies have established PADC accounts, actual usage of  those accounts is extremely low.", "To participate in PADC, subscribers (who could be one or more  individuals within an agency) receive an account license that allows them  to receive notifications and log into the secure Web site to download the  patch. To establish an account, each subscriber must set up a profile  defining the technologies that they use. The profiles act much like a  filtering service and allow PADC to notify agencies of only the patches that  pertain to their systems. The profiles do not include system\u2013specific  information because of the sensitivity of that information. Subscribers  using PADC receive notification of threats, vulnerabilities, and the  availability of patches on the basis of the submitted profiles. They are  notified by E-mail or pager message that a vulnerability or patch has been  posted to a secure Web site that affects one or all of their systems.", "When a patch is identified, FedCIRC, through contractor support, ensures  that it originates from a reliable source. The patch is then tested on a  system to which it applies. The installation of the patch and the operation  of the system are monitored to ensure that the patch causes no problem.  Next, if an exploit had been developed, exploit testing is performed to  ensure that the patch fixes the vulnerability. Any issues identified with a  patch are summarized and provided to the users. The validated patch is  then uploaded to PADC servers and made available to users. A patch is  considered validated when it has been downloaded from a trusted source,  authenticated, loaded onto an appropriate system, tested, exploit\u2013tested,  verified, and posted to the PADC server. This type of testing and validation  is performed for over 60 technologies that, according to FedCIRC officials,  account for approximately 80 percent of the technologies used by federal  agencies. Also available is notification of patches that are not validated for  over 25,000 additional technologies.", "According to FedCIRC officials, high-priority patches are to be tested and  posted on the PADC server within the same business day of availability.  Medium- and low-priority patches are to be completed by the following  business day, but are generally available sooner. However, because PADC  has several early warning mechanisms in place and arrangements with  software vendors, some patches may be available as soon as a  vulnerability is made public. FedCIRC officials emphasize that although  the contractor tests the security patches, these tests do not ensure that the  patch can be successfully deployed in another environment; therefore,  agencies still need to test the patch for compatibility with their own  business processes and technology.", "PADC offers a reporting capability that is hierarchical. Senior managers  can look at their complete system and see which subsystems have been  patched. These enterprisewide reports and statistics can be generated for  a \u201creporting user\u201d subscriber who has read-only capability within the  system.", "According to agency officials, there are limitations to the PADC service.  Although it is free to agencies, only about 2,000 licenses or accounts are  available because of monetary constraints. According to FedCIRC  officials, this requires them to work closely with participating agencies to  balance the number of licenses that a single agency requires with the need  to allow multiple agencies to participate. For example, the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration initially requested over 3,000  licenses\u2014one for each system administrator. Another agency, NIST,  thought that each of its users should have his or her own PADC account.  Another limitation is the level of services currently provided by PADC.

Agent- based products require up-front work to integrate agents into the  workstations and in the server deployment process, but are better suited  to large organizations due to their ability to generate less network traffic  and provide a real-time network view. The agents maintain information  that can be reported when needed. Finally, some patch management tools  are hybrids\u2014allowing the user to utilize agents or not.", "Instead of an automated stand-alone system, entities can also use other  methods and tools to perform patch management. For example, they can  maintain a database of the versions and latest patches for each server and  each client in their network and track the security alerts and patches  manually. While labor-intensive, this can be done. In addition, entities can  employ systems management tools with patch-updating capabilities to  deploy the patches. This method requires monitoring for the latest security  alerts and patches.

For  example, CERT/CC has a research program, one goal of which is to try to  find ways to improve technical approaches for identifying and preventing  security flaws, for limiting the damage from attacks, and for ensuring that  systems continue to provide essential services in spite of compromises  and failures. Also, Microsoft recently initiated its Trustworthy Computing  strategy to incorporate security-focused software engineering practices  throughout the design and deployment of its software, and is reportedly  considering the use of automated patching in future products.", "In summary, it is clear from the increasing number of reported attacks on  information systems that both federal and private-sector operations and  assets are at considerable\u2014and growing\u2014risk. Patch management can be  an important element in mitigating the risks associated with software  vulnerabilities, part of overall network configuration management and  information security programs. The challenge will be ensuring that a patch  management process has adequate resources and appropriate policies,  procedures, and tools to effectively identify vulnerabilities and patches  that place an entity\u2019s systems at risk.
