In 2001, the Air Force began an acquisition program to develop and produce improved Global Hawks. In 2002, the Department of Defense (DOD) restructured and accelerated the program to include a new, larger and more capable air vehicle.

Immature technologies: Several critical technologies needed to provide the advanced capabilities are immature and will not be tested on the new air vehicle until late in the program, after which most of the air vehicles will already have been bought. New requirements, new costs: DOD's desire to add additional Global Hawk capabilities tripled development costs. The program acquisition unit cost increased 44 percent since program start, yet fewer vehicles are to be produced than originally planned. Challenges, trade-offs, and delays: The addition of new capabilities has led to space, weight, and power constraints for the advanced Global Hawk model. These limitations may result in deferring some capabilities. Some key events and activities--many related to testing issues--have been delayed. Global Hawk's highly concurrent development and production strategy is risky and runs counter in important ways to a knowledge-based approach and to DOD's acquisition guidance. The restructuring caused gaps in product knowledge, increasing the likelihood of unsuccessful cost, schedule, quality, and performance outcomes.

The business case should provide sufficient evidence that  resources are available to meet warfighter needs. This case would include  technology and design demonstrations that added confidence that the  integrated product can be developed within time and money constraints.  The original plan was to first acquire basic RQ-4A systems very similar to  the demonstrators and then slowly and incrementally develop and acquire  systems with more advanced sensor capabilities while using the same air  vehicle. This strategy incorporated an evolutionary approach in that a basic  capability was to be produced in a first block of aircraft and a second, more  advanced block was to be acquired once the new technologies were  mature. Each block had separate decision points and testing plans and  significant risk was removed from the program because the demonstrators  had been built, tested, and extensively flown (and later used successfully in  actual combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq).

This policy  covers most of DOD\u2019s major acquisition programs. As noted in our  November 2003 report, this revised policy is a step in the right direction.  The acquisition policy states that program managers shall provide  knowledge about the key aspects of the system at key decision points in the  acquisition process and an evolutionary or incremental development  approach should be used to establish a more manageable environment for  attaining and applying knowledge. The customer may not get the ultimate  capability right away, but the initial product is available sooner and at a  lower cost. The policy adopts the essence of the following points from the  knowledge-based approach:  Knowledge point 1: Should occur when the acquisition program is  scheduled to start, when the customer\u2019s requirements are clearly  defined, and resources\u2014proven technology, engineering capability,  time, and money\u2014exist to satisfy them.

Also shown in figure 4 is how the Global Hawk  program overlaps technology and system development and begins  production before the necessary knowledge is achieved.", "Global Hawk\u2019s new strategy approved initial production of the improved  RQ-4B well in advance of completing technology maturation and approved  developing and integrating the vehicle\u2019s design with the various sensor  payloads desired by the warfighter. Furthermore, low-rate production was  approved without ensuring the quality and reliability of manufacturing  processes. This approach added significant risk in that sensor technologies  and final design may not meet the space, weight, and power limitations of  the RQ-4B, which is in low-rate production, and may not satisfy the  warfighter\u2019s requirements. By not closing knowledge gaps in the integrated  product design (air vehicle, sensor payloads, and data links) needed to  meet requirements, there is increased risk that sensor development  schedules may need to be extended to achieve form, fit, and function for an  integrated Global Hawk system. Otherwise, the program office may have to  go back to the warfighter and further negotiate requirements.

Lack of product knowledge increases risks of  poor cost, schedule, and performance outcomes. Appendix III includes a  more detailed discussion of knowledge gaps at each knowledge point.  Following are brief examples of knowledge gaps as they relate to each of  the three critical knowledge points.", "Technology maturity: Using best practices, at the start of system  development, a program\u2019s critical technologies should be in the form, fit,  and function needed for the intended product and should be demonstrated  in a realistic environment. The RQ-4B development program is struggling to  meet these criteria for several of its most critical technologies. Nearly  2 years after development began, the technologies required for the RQ-4B  to perform its operational mission including enhanced imaging sensors,  signals intelligence, multiplatform radar, and open system architecture are  immature, basically at a functional rather than form or fit configuration.  For example, the airborne signals intelligence payload and multiplatform  radar technology insertion program are still in development under separate  Air Force programs. These subsystems are key to providing the advanced  intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities for which the  RQ-4B is being developed. At the time of our review, neither of these  technologies had been demonstrated in an operational environment using a  system prototype. Air Force officials expect them to be mature by the time  they begin buying sensors to incorporate them into the Global Hawk  production line in fiscal years 2008 and 2009. However, by this time most of  the air vehicles will have already been bought. Also, operational testing to  evaluate performance in a realistic operating environment is not scheduled  until late fiscal year 2008 for the signals intelligence sensor and late 2010  for the radar. Nevertheless, the Air Force continues to build the RQ-4B  platform lacking solid assurance that these critical subsystems will work  as planned.", "Design maturity: The program had completed 75 percent of RQ-4B model  drawings by the design readiness review in comparison with the 90 percent  completion standard for best practices. While the Air Force anticipated the  design and experience on the RQ-4A would add assurances and speed  efforts to mature the new RQ-4B design, the two vehicles ultimately had  only about 10 percent commonality. While drawings completed were  approaching best practice standards, the Air Force did not build a  prototype of the RQ-4B design to demonstrate a stable design.  Demonstration of the design is a key factor in ensuring a stable design.  The Air Force had not established a reliability growth goal or plan and had  not identified critical manufacturing processes, both essential to the next  phase of production and needed to ensure quality and cost targets can  be met.", "Production maturity: Officials have started to identify the critical  manufacturing processes for the RQ-4B but do not intend to collect and use  statistical process control data to ensure the manufacturing could deliver  quality products. The new RQ-4B requires new manufacturing processes  because of major differences from the RQ-4A. In addition, Officials from  the program office, the prime contractor, and the Defense Contract  Management Agency continue to identify problems and concerns about the  performance and quality of work by several key subcontractors, including  those producing the wing, the advanced sensor suite, and the vertical tail  and aft fuselage parts. This latter subcontractor is new to large-scale  manufacturing using advanced composite materials and has experienced  significant start-up and quality problems. According to best practices, the  subcontractor\u2019s critical processes must be demonstrated to ensure good  quality and limit rework. The prime contractor and DOD sent special teams  of advisors to help develop the firm\u2019s manufacturing processes and to train  employees. Creating another gap in production maturity, a fully integrated  system representative prototype was not tested before starting production  and will not have been demonstrated before full-rate production, scheduled  in 2007.

The first increment of Global Hawk was based on mature technologies and  a design proven to meet the warfighter\u2019s need through actual combat use of  the technology demonstrator. The plan included a reasonable funding  profile and embraced a knowledge-based acquisition strategy that  completed development before entering production. The plan included  future improvements to the baseline capability as technologies and funding  became available. By December 2002, the Air Force had dramatically  changed the Global Hawk\u2019s acquisition plan and the knowledge-based  foundation for the earlier decision to proceed into development and  production. This change created large gaps between Global Hawk\u2019s  requirements and the resources available to meet them. The new plan  required a new, larger, and heavier air vehicle with only 10 percent  commonality with the previous proven design; increased development  time; and accelerated production time, creating significant concurrency  between development and production. To accommodate the changes, the  plan calls for twice the annual funding amounts in peak years over the old  plan. Overall, the new plan has increased risks significantly. Subsequent  reviews by DOD have acknowledged the changes in the program have  increased uncertainty. The new design has not been demonstrated to work  using a prototype model; technologies to support the advanced sensor  payloads that drove the need for a new Global Hawk design are still  immature; and the Air Force will be requesting about $750 million in  funding next year for the program. Yet, the Air Force has awarded a  contract to start the production of the new, larger Global Hawk B model  with the hope that simulations and analysis will be sufficient to allow  decision makers to manage risk. The history of DOD managed programs  suggests otherwise."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To decrease risks of poor outcomes and to increase the chances of  delivering required warfighter capabilities with the funds available, we are  making recommendations to the Secretary of Defense to take the following  two actions  direct the Air Force to revisit the decision to begin concurrent  development and production of the Global Hawk B design and direct the  Air Force to create and present a new business case that defines the  warfighter\u2019s needs that can be accommodated given current available  resources of technology, engineering capability, time, and money, and  delay further procurement of the Global Hawk B, other than units  needed for testing, until a new business case is completed that reduces  risk and justifies further investments based on a knowledge-based  acquisition strategy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided us with written comments on a draft of this report. The  comments appear in appendix II. DOD stated that it did not concur with  our two recommendations. Separately, DOD provided one technical  comment that we incorporated in this report to more accurately  characterize the issue of affordability and use of Global Hawks in threat  conditions.", "Regarding our first recommendation on completing a new business case to  justify and guide concurrent development and production of the RQ-4B  model, DOD stated its belief that the Global Hawk\u2019s acquisition strategy  balances acquisition risks with the department\u2019s demands to rapidly field  new capabilities to the warfighter, thereby obviating the need for a new  business case. Furthermore, by following what officials call an  evolutionary development process, DOD said it is providing  transformational warfighting capabilities to ongoing military operations  without disrupting Global Hawk\u2019s current development and production  activities. DOD said it is effectively managing risk with the help of regular  oversight meetings and by requiring monthly and quarterly activity reports.", "We continue to believe that a new business case is needed to support  further investments and to improve oversight by Congress and DOD  decision makers. The program today is much different than the one  supported by the original business case. The Air Force started with an  advanced concept technology demonstration program that proved the  capability of a smaller and lighter Global Hawk air vehicle. Use of this  vehicle on numerous occasions in actual combat situations has saved lives,  according to Air Force and contractor officials. However, this is not the  vehicle that the Air Force now plans to produce. Instead, the Air Force  dramatically changed the acquisition strategy for the Global Hawk program  and is not gaining some key knowledge before production. The Air Force  plans to concurrently design and produce a new Global Hawk air vehicle  that is significantly larger and heavier than the earlier version used in  combat. The larger air vehicle is intended to accommodate new, heavier,  and larger sensors that will not be available until the 2008 to 2009 time  frame. In implementing the restructured strategy, the Air Force is not fully  following a knowledge-based approach for developing the RQ-4B Global  Hawk as called for by best practices and DOD\u2019s new defense acquisition  guidance. The new guidance clearly states that knowledge reduces risks,  and we agree.", "While the Air Force believes it can manage the risk of a concurrent  development and production program by holding regular meetings with  acquisition executives and by issuing management reports, DOD\u2019s own  experience has shown this to be risky and a factor that led DOD to change  its acquisition policy to a knowledge-based approach. History has shown  concurrency usually delays the delivery of a needed capability and results  in higher costs. From March 2003 to March 2004, estimated program costs  have increased by $466 million, and the sensors and the new air vehicle are  still being developed. Stepping back from this rush to produce the new air  vehicle and establishing a new business case designed to capture key  product knowledge before costly investments in production would better  inform DOD decision makers and Congress about what is feasible with  available technology and dollar resources to meet warfighter needs and to  better assess the extent and/or severity of program acquisition risks.", "Regarding our second recommendation to delay further procurement of the  RQ-4B (other than units needed for testing) until a new knowledge-based  and risk-reducing business case is prepared, DOD stated that its current  acquisition strategy effectively manages risk and fosters the rapid delivery  of needed capabilities to the warfighter. DOD said we overstated risks from  RQ-4B development, design changes, and insertion of advanced sensor  capabilities. DOD further stated that our recommendation would result in a  production break with serious cost and schedule complications and that  GAO\u2019s sequential knowledge-based approach does not consider real-world  events, such as the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack in the United States  or issues related to North Korea and Iraq.", "We believe the risks in the Global Hawk program are real and continue to  support delaying the near-term procurement of air vehicles not needed for  testing. We think this is a prudent way for the program to gain knowledge  before significantly increased resource investments and to reduce risks  until a new air vehicle integrated with the advanced signals intelligence  payload and the multiplatform radar can be demonstrated through testing  to meet warfighter requirements. Our report notes that operational testing  of the air vehicle\u2019s performance and suitability will not take place until  almost half the fleet is already purchased and that integration and testing of  the advanced sensors will not occur until late in the program after the full- rate production decision is made and most systems are bought. DOD\u2019s  comments appear to decouple the air vehicle from the advanced sensors by  stating that, if a sensor diverges from its current plan, alternate future  payloads could fill the RQ-4B\u2019s greater payload capacity. However, the need  for designing a new larger air vehicle was predicated on its ability to carry  these specific sensors to meet the warfighter\u2019s requirements. Therefore, we  believe that knowledge based on a demonstration of the integrated  capability is key to supporting production and delivery of the product  within estimated cost and schedule. Additionally, the new Global Hawk  program strategy requires significantly greater amounts of funding earlier,  putting that investment at risk should changes occur as development and  testing is completed.", "Regarding a potential break in production, our analysis indicates that a  break is neither impending nor certain if our recommendation were  adopted. We are not recommending that DOD stop production or reduce  the total quantity but rather a near-term delay in procuring the portion of  annual buys for air vehicles not needed for testing. Funds currently on  contract and approved appropriations for fiscal year 2005 would continue  production on the Air Force\u2019s planned schedule through mid-fiscal  year 2007 at least. Only then would a production break or slowdown  happen, and only if the Air Force has not yet prepared a business case to  justify its investments beyond that point based on demonstrated product  knowledge of the new air vehicle. If the current acquisition strategy and  financial plan are feasible and appropriate, the Air Force would be able to  prepare and justify a comprehensive business plan for the RQ-4B well in  advance of a potential break.", "DOD indicated that our knowledge-based acquisition approach was  untimely and not adaptive to fast-changing world events. When we  developed the knowledge-based approach, our high priority was to focus  on better ways to deliver capability to the warfighter more quickly through  incremental, or evolutionary, development. Our approach is based on a  careful study of historical DOD acquisition programs and the best efforts in  the private sector. Our prior work shows that proceeding without requisite  knowledge ultimately costs programs more money and takes longer to  complete than those adopting a more rigorous and comprehensive strategy  basing investment decisions on key product knowledge\u2014technology,  design, and production maturity levels. DOD agreed with our findings and  changed its acquisition guidance to reflect a knowledge-based approach.  We note in this report that the original Global Hawks were produced  through a successful demonstration program that effectively and quickly  provided the warfighter with transformational intelligence, surveillance,  and reconnaissance capabilities. Defense Contract Management Agency  reports, contract cost reports, corporate briefings, design drawing changes,  new tooling and new production processes, and the evident need for Air  Force and prime contractor task teams to be extensively deployed to  subcontractor facilities, all indicate that the RQ-4B program entails higher  degrees of risk, greater management challenges, and significant changes  from production of the RQ-4A and earlier demonstrators.", "We believe that our recommendation to delay further procurement of the  RQ-4B until a new knowledge-based and risk-reducing business case is  prepared prudently balances real-world internal investment risks with  military demands from real-world external events. The Air Force could  have continued to deliver the capability of the Global Hawk that was the  direct outgrowth of the demonstration program while allowing the sensor  and radar technology time to mature before investing in a new larger and  more risky Global Hawk program. This would have allowed continued  delivery of the enhanced RQ-4A capability to the warfighter while  minimizing the impacts of design changes that come out of normal  development and testing and that grow more costly as a product enters the  production environment. The heavy cost of design changes after  production is underway could impact DOD\u2019s ability to respond to other  warfighter needs in the post-9/11 world.", "As arranged with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its  issue date.

This means that the  critical technologies needed to meet essential product requirements are in  the form, fit, and function needed for the intended product and have been  demonstrated to work in their intended environment. The RQ-4B  development program is struggling to meet these criteria for several of its  most critical technologies. More than 2 years after development began, the  technologies required for the RQ-4B to perform its operational mission  including enhanced imaging sensors, signals intelligence, multiplatform  radar, and open system architecture are immature, basically at a functional  rather than form or fit configuration. Nevertheless, the Air Force continues  to build the RQ-4B platform, lacking solid assurance that these critical  subsystems will work as planned.", "In particular, the airborne signals intelligence payload and multiplatform  radar technology insertion program are still in development under separate  Air Force programs and will be purchased by the Global Hawk program as  government furnished equipment. These subsystems are key to providing  the advanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities for  which the RQ-4B is being developed. At the time of our review, neither of  these technologies had been demonstrated in an operational environment  using a system prototype. Air Force officials characterized their current  stages of development as laboratory settings demonstrating basic  performance, technical feasibility, and functionality but not form or fit  (size, weight, materials, etc.). Technology maturity of the sensors is critical  because the basic design of the RQ-4B has been completed and allocates  limited space, weight, and power for the new capability. If the new sensors  cannot be developed within these constraints, some performance  trade-offs\u2014such as reduced frequency coverage\u2014are likely. The airborne  signals intelligence payload currently exceeds the weight allocated for its  integration into the RQ-4B, while the multiplatform radar uses most of the  vehicle\u2019s available power-generation capability.", "Officials expect them to be mature by the time they begin buying sensors to  incorporate them into the Global Hawk production line in fiscal years 2008  and 2009. However, by this time most of the air vehicles will have already  been bought; additional time and money might be needed to fix or retrofit  any remaining differences. Also, operational testing to evaluate  performance in a realistic operating environment is not scheduled until late  fiscal year 2008 for the signals intelligence sensor and late 2010 for the  radar.

However, officials found out that  the two models had much less in common than anticipated. About  90 percent of the airframe had to be redesigned\u2014only 10 percent was  common to both models.
