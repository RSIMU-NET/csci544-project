Some of these decisions require balancing short-term demands to fund day-to-day operations with needs to acquire assets that yield benefits over the long term. Spending for some assets may be necessary to produce program efficiencies and cost savings over the long-term. Some budget observers believe, however, that a bias is created against spending for long-term capital assets because of the requirement that the entire cost of these relatively expensive assets be budgeted for in an agency\u2019s or program\u2019s annual budget or \u201cup-front\u201d rather than spread over the life of the assets.These concerns have led some to suggest that the federal government adopt a capital budget to spread the cost of long-lived assets across their useful lives. However, capital budgeting proposals have raised concerns among budget experts about fiscal control and accountability.", "This report responds to a request by Representative William F. Clinger Jr., Chairman of the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, to examine issues federal agencies face in planning and budgeting for the acquisition of capital assets. It also assesses ways that some federal organizations have developed to address those concerns and that could be used by other agencies within the existing budget structure. For the purposes of this study, the terms \u201ccapital assets\u201d and \u201cfixed assets\u201d are used interchangeably and are defined as tangible assets that are owned by the federal government and that are primarily used in the delivery of federal services. These types of assets are normally available in the commercial market and include buildings, equipment, and information technology. Capital asset acquisition may take the form of rehabilitation of existing assets or development and construction of new ones. The primary focus of this report is on the capital planning and budgeting experiences of five case study organizations represented by four agencies: the Army Corps of Engineers, the Coast Guard, the General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) and the Public Buildings Service (PBS), and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Capital Decisions Are Made in an Environment of Resource Constraints", "paragraphs": ["Budgetary constraints have long had an influence on federal decision-making. Since 1970, the federal government\u2019s spending has consistently exceeded its income, resulting in pressure to restrain spending. Discretionary spending or the portion of the budget that lawmakers annually control through appropriations\u2014which is the primary source for capital spending\u2014has dropped from 12.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1970 to 7.8 percent in 1995. In dealing with a shrinking resource base, it is inevitable that some agency missions may be curtailed, and some assets may not be, nor need to be, replaced. Thus, a decision not to fund a particular capital asset may reflect the outcome of competition with other capital projects and other types of expenditures as much as it does any characteristics of the budget process. Distinguishing between obstacles which are rooted in overall resource constraints and those which are an outflow of budget practices and rules is a difficult but critical task.", "Agencies have often pointed to the poor condition of their existing capital assets as evidence of the need for increased capital spending. Articles in the popular press and past GAO reports have discussed the poor condition of various federal fixed assets, including the Pentagon, National Park Service facilities, Forest Service facilities, and many financial and information systems throughout government. Moreover, spending on capital is often necessary to generate operational savings in the future. Some observers have been concerned that even as overall resources are limited, resources for capital assets are constrained even more because of the high initial cost of capital assets and what these observers believe to be the short-term focus of the budget process.", "It is inevitable that resource constraints will prevent some worthwhile capital projects from being undertaken. However, decisions about whether any particular resource need\u2014capital or operating\u2014is funded reflect the priorities that are determined by the administration and the Congress. Ideally, those capital projects that are funded will be ones with the highest returns or that meet the highest priority mission needs. Therefore, the goal of the budget process should be to ensure neutrality vis-a-vis various types of spending so that decisions are guided by what is economically and programmatically justified rather than by what is recorded or \u201cscored\u201d most favorably in the budget."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Capital Spending Has Been Relatively Constant Over Time", "paragraphs": ["It is reasonable to expect that historical budget data would give some indication as to how spending on capital has changed over time. However, the federal government does not aggregate data on capital asset spending in the same way that we have defined it in this report\u2014spending on assets used in agency operations. One reason for this is that federal budget data is intended to serve multiple purposes. For capital spending, the data collected are used to highlight the level of investment activity (character class data) and to record the nature of the assets procured (object class data). Nevertheless, OMB\u2019s character class data, object class data, and program and financing data each provide some rough approximation for capital asset spending, and therefore, an approximate gauge of how such spending has fared over time.", "OMB asks agencies to code their net outlays each year according to various investment categories or character classes. Investment outlays are defined by OMB as spending that is intended primarily to yield benefits in the future\u2014whether to the nation as a whole or to the government. Investments may be in the form of direct federal spending or grants to state and local governments, and may be for tangible or intangible assets. The OMB categories that we have used to most closely match our definition are those for direct spending on physical assets. However, the character class data will include some types of spending, such as for flood prevention and the acquisition of park land, which are excluded from our definition but cannot be easily segmented from the character class codes.", "OMB also requires that agencies classify their obligations by object of expenditure or object class. Object class schedules appear for each account in the President\u2019s budget. The classifications for \u201cEquipment\u201d and \u201cLand and Structures\u201d are the closest approximation to our definition of capital assets, although they include some obligations which we exclude and omit others we would include. For example, some salaries and contractor costs that are devoted to capital projects are not included in these object class categories.", "Finally, agencies may also identify their obligations as \u201ccapital investments\u201d in the program and financing schedules that appear for each account in the President\u2019s budget. In these schedules, capital investments are acquisitions of physical or financial assets that yield benefits over several years. The program and financing classification capital investments is only shown when such investments are material for a program and represent nonreimbursable obligations. Agencies have discretion in defining programs, and consequently capital investments for this schedule. Therefore, some capital investments in the program and financing data may include items we would not consider capital and exclude others.", "Despite the limitations of the available data, a review of historical trends can provide some perspective on the magnitude and overall pattern of spending for capital assets. (See figures 1.1 through 1.3.) OMB character class data show that direct federal spending for \u201cnondefense physical assets\u201d in 1995 measured $19.5 billion and was about the same proportion of GDP and of total budgetary outlays as it was in 1970. Direct outlays for nondefense physical assets measured 0.26 percent of GDP in 1970, and in spite of ups and downs over the period, it represented about the same proportion in 1995. Likewise, as a percent of total budgetary outlays, direct spending for nondefense physical assets is basically unchanged from the 1970 level of 1.3 percent (although it did fluctuate over the period between 1.0 and 1.5 percent). Since these assets are primarily funded from the domestic discretionary category of spending, it may be insightful to compare trends against this portion of the budget. Here, too, we found that direct spending on nondefense physical assets is about identical to the proportion it was 25 years earlier (7.7 percent in fiscal year 1995 and 7.4 percent in fiscal year 1970).", "Historical budget data for our four case studies also show that spending on capital assets has not necessarily fared poorly relative to operations and programs. (Appendixes II through VI provide graphical analysis of agency trends.) Each case study experienced at least a modest increase in its overall budget in real terms between 1982 and 1995. For both GSA entities, capital obligations as a percent of total obligations have generally increased since 1982. For two other agencies, USGS and the Corps of Engineers, the proportion of obligations and outlays, respectively, made for capital assets over time has fluctuated up and down. In contrast, the Coast Guard has seen a steadily decreasing proportion of its outlays go toward capital assets.", "Caution is required in interpreting the significance of these trends. This is not solely due to the limitations noted above. Neither the overall federal data nor the case study trend data provide any indication as to whether the past levels of capital obligations or outlays were deficient, adequate, or excessive. Nor can the data indicate whether there is a bias in one direction or another. Trends could reflect changes in priorities between capital and other spending or changes in underlying needs for capital. Economies of scale in operations may suggest that in some cases operating expenses should decline relative to capital. In contrast, advances in technology may enable agencies to maintain consistent levels of operations while reducing their spending on capital assets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private Sector and Federal Practices for Budgeting for Capital Differ", "paragraphs": ["As agencies try to adopt more business-like practices, it is inevitable that comparisons are made with private-sector practices in budgeting for capital. Some observers have noted that when it comes to acquiring capital assets, businesses\u2014unlike government agencies\u2014are able to spread the expense of capital assets by depreciating their value in income statements over the estimated useful life. Budget practitioners rightly observe that because of the cash basis of the federal budget, there is a difference between the timing of the costs and benefits of capital assets. While the benefits of capital assets flow over time, federal budget rules require that their full cost be recognized in the budget when acquired. This has been equated to a business charging the full cost of capital assets to a single year\u2019s income statement. Doing so would distort the true profitability of the firm in that year and make the cost of capital asset acquisitions appear artificially high. However, although the budget is occasionally called upon to serve the purpose of an income statement as well, it is not designed to measure profitability and is poorly suited for this role. In both the public and private sectors, budgets generally are a means through which organizations allocate resources.", "For many years there has been discussion of the federal government adopting separate capital and operating budgets. Under many such proposals, capital assets would be financed over time by borrowing\u2014with depreciation charged each period to the operating budget (which under most proposals would be required to be balanced). Such proposals, however, fail to recognize key differences between budgeting and accounting. While depreciation is appropriate for helping companies measure profit or loss in financial statements, it is generally not used by companies in budgeting. They base capital spending decisions on present value comparisons of total cash inflows and outflows that are expected to result from alternative capital projects. Depreciation is not a cash flow and therefore affects a company\u2019s capital spending decisions only to the extent that, as a tax deduction, it affects the amount of cash outflow for income tax. A company\u2019s capital budget reflects the results of its spending decisions and records the cash requirements for its selected capital projects that are expected during each period. In this manner, a business\u2019 capital budget has some similarity to the federal unified budget, which also records the cash requirements for capital projects during each year. If depreciation were recorded in the federal budget in place of cash requirements for capital spending, this would undermine Congress\u2019 ability to control expenditures because only a small fraction of an asset\u2019s cost would be included in the year when the decision was made to acquire it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Spending Is Guided by Budgetary Controls", "paragraphs": ["The Antideficiency Act, as amended, implements Congress\u2019 constitutional oversight of the executive branch\u2019s expenditure of funds. The act reflects laws enacted by the Congress since 1870 to respond to abuses of budget authority and to gain more effective control over appropriations. The central provision of the act (31 U.S.C. 1341(a)(1)) prevents agencies from entering into obligations prior to an appropriation or from incurring obligations that exceed an appropriation, absent specific statutory authority. Thus, agencies may not enter into contracts that obligate the government to pay for goods or services unless there are sufficient funds available to cover their cost in full. Instead, agencies must budget for the full cost of contracts up-front. Also, the Adequacy of Appropriations Act (40 U.S.C.11), established in 1861, prohibits agencies from entering into a contract unless the contract is authorized by law or there is an appropriation to cover the cost of the contract.", "While these acts require that agencies have sufficient appropriated funds to cover their obligations, the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (BEA) created new mechanisms by which to limit federal spending overall. BEA formalized the distinction between direct and discretionary spending and provided separate controls for each. Discretionary spending is defined as budget authority provided in annual appropriations acts, while direct or mandatory spending is that which is provided by law other than annual appropriations acts. To control discretionary spending\u2014including spending for fixed assets\u2014BEA established strict dollar limits or \u201ccaps\u201d on budget authority and outlays for each fiscal year through 1998. These caps are implemented through allocations to House and Senate appropriations committees, who subsequently allocate these totals among their subcommittees. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and OMB \u201cscore\u201d or track budget authority, receipts, and outlays estimated to result from enacted legislation. Should a breach of the caps occur, BEA established a process called sequestration in which spending for most discretionary programs is reduced by a uniform percentage.", "As a result of BEA, scorekeeping guidelines, called scoring rules, were developed that significantly changed how certain types of contracts were scored in the budget. Previously, when an agency entered into a lease-purchase contract, budget authority and outlays were scored over the period of the lease in an amount equal to the annual payments. The new guidelines changed this by requiring that budget authority for lease-purchases be scored up-front and outlays be scored over the period during which the contractor constructs or purchases the asset. After BEA, a lease-purchase, which is tantamount to borrowing from the private sector, was no longer treated in the budget preferentially to borrowing by the Treasury to finance direct ownership. This effectively eliminated lease-purchases from consideration as a capital acquisition method that could be used to spread the cost of purchases over a period of years.", "The benefits to the government as a whole and the disadvantages to individual agencies resulting from the change in lease-purchase scoring are illustrative of the dichotomy that can exist between agencies\u2019 and Congress\u2019s perspective on the budget process. Changes in the scoring of lease-purchases, while problematic from the perspective of an individual agency because of up-front funding requirements and budget caps, are critical to enabling the Congress to control the total commitments made by agencies. Likewise, some ideas agencies propose to alleviate their perceived obstacles to capital spending may in turn create obstacles to maintaining fiscal control if implemented on a governmentwide basis. In this regard, there is a constant tension between agency and congressional perspectives on the nature of capital acquisition problems and their solutions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Nature of This Report", "paragraphs": ["This report illustrates how a select group of federal organizations plan and budget for capital assets and the experiences they have had with the budget process. Five case studies were selected to include a broad range of characteristics\u2014large and small organizations, operations-intensive and capital-intensive organizations, and organizations having a range of asset needs and account structures. While it is inappropriate to generalize about governmentwide practices in budgeting for capital from these case studies, it is possible to gain insight into some issues and discover potential strategies for addressing these issues. The information obtained from the case studies, supplemented by a limited number of interviews at other agencies that purchase capital assets, provides some indication of the range of issues that may be encountered governmentwide.", "Because agencies can differ substantially in their asset requirements, account structure, financial management history, and other characteristics, care must be taken in applying lessons from one agency to another. The chapters that follow include issues that generally affect all federal organizations, such as the requirement to fully fund capital acquisitions up-front, as well as issues that may be limited to selected organizations as a result of their particular characteristics. Likewise, any strategy that an agency has adopted to deal with its perceived obstacles to capital spending has been tailored for its specific circumstances. Some may be adaptable to other agencies; others may not be. The report is also not exhaustive with respect to the problems and strategies of case studies. Some financing strategies, such as budgeting for stand-alone stages of a larger capital project, may be used by case studies other than those explicitly mentioned in this report. Similarly, case studies may be using other financing approaches in addition to those cited.", "This report is not intended to represent a final or universal solution to the problems in budgeting for capital assets. Indeed, other issues would also need to be addressed if the capital acquisition process is to be improved. For example, the selection and evaluation of capital projects must be improved. GAO\u2019s past work has identified a variety of federal capital projects including information technology as well as large-scale construction projects where acquisitions have yielded poor results\u2014costing more than anticipated, falling behind schedule, and failing to meet mission needs. In addition, to effectively evaluate program performance as called for in the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), agencies will need data on the full annual cost of programs including the cost of capital usage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The objectives of this study were to examine (1) how case study organizations perceive the budget process and structure affects their ability to acquire capital assets, (2) whether there are financing mechanisms currently used or proposed by our case studies that could be helpful in improving budgeting for capital assets within the current unified budget structure, and (3) the results of OMB\u2019s Bulletin 94-08 on \u201cPlanning and Budgeting for the Acquisition of Fixed Assets.\u201d", "To identify aspects of the budget process that affected case studies\u2019 capital spending decisions and the financing mechanisms they used and proposed, we interviewed officials from our case studies as well as OMB and congressional staff responsible for reviewing the budgets of these organizations. To select our case studies, we used data from OMB\u2019s MAXsystem to identify federal organizations making capital expenditures between fiscal years 1982 and 1994 and the general type of assets they acquired. We developed an initial short list of organizations that provided coverage across various departmental levels of government and asset types.

After conducting initial interviews with officials at each of the short list organizations to confirm the issues they face and the assets acquired, we agreed with the requestor to select five case studies representing four agencies: the Army Corps of Engineers, Coast Guard, GSA (the Public Building Service (PBS) and the Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS)), and USGS. Our selection of case studies was based on a goal of choosing organizations that reflected diversity in the types of assets acquired, the volume of capital spending, the type of account used, and the appropriations subcommittees. Table 1.1 (see p. 33) shows the types of assets case studies acquire and the account(s) used to finance capital.

Managers expressed concern that their agency or program budgets are not able to accommodate the large, single-year increases in budget authority needed to fully fund capital projects up front. As a result, managers believe that capital needs are either not met or met through methods that are more costly in the long term.", "Despite the potential problems for individual agencies, up-front funding is critical to safeguarding Congress\u2019 ability to control overall federal expenditures and to assess the impact of the federal budget on the economy. Without up-front funding, projects may be undertaken without adequate attention being given to their overall costs and benefits. Moreover, failure to fully fund projects before they are undertaken can distort the allocation of budget resources and obscure the impact of federal budgetary action on the private sector. Only a few agencies, including the Army Corps of Engineers (one of our case studies), have been exempted from the up-front funding requirement.

These officials felt that when it is necessary to purchase expensive capital assets, up-front funding requirements result in a spike in their agency\u2019s or program\u2019s budget authority that often would not be provided in the current budget environment. Although an asset may be an important component to carrying out the mission of the organization and may bring benefits over many years, managers believed that having to budget for the full cost in 1 year is often a significant impediment to its acquisition. Although general resource constraints are not new, full up-front funding has become more difficult because most capital spending is discretionary and, thus, annually capped by BEA. OMB has responded to BEA by frequently imposing limits on agency spending and by prohibiting agency borrowing. Consequently, managers may find themselves faced with a situation in which funding an expensive capital project may require deep cuts in operations or in all other capital projects during that year. Faced with these trade-offs, agency managers may either delay capital projects until an additional appropriation can be obtained or, when possible, look for other ways of meeting their capital needs though the long-run cost may be higher.", "Officials from virtually every organization that we contacted could cite examples of how the up-front funding requirement affected their ability to acquire capital. Up-front funding appeared to be a particularly significant issue at organizations we contacted that acquire buildings because these assets often have a high initial cost, provide benefits over many years, and could be financed over an extended period of time. Up-front funding was also a concern for USGS in acquiring equipment because the cost of the equipment sometimes represented a significant portion of the organization\u2019s resources.", "PBS has often cited the up-front funding requirement as an impediment to meeting federal agency space needs in the most cost-effective manner. PBS is responsible for acquiring general and special purpose work space for federal agencies and has multiple methods available for meeting these space needs, including operating leases, capital leases, lease-purchases,and direct purchases. Each of these methods for obtaining space presents a combination of advantages and disadvantages in terms of flexibility and short- and long-term cost to PBS. Budget scoring rules are intended to facilitate comparisons of the long-term cost of each method and to ensure compliance with the full funding concept. For each space acquisition method except for operating leases, PBS (like other federal organizations) is required to have budget authority for the total cost up front even though the outlays may occur over several years. PBS has generally found that ownership is the least costly manner with which to meet long-term federal space needs. However, PBS officials indicated that the up-front funding requirement coupled with caps on total discretionary budget authority and outlays has resulted in PBS not receiving sufficient budget authority to allow it to own the amount of office space that its studies indicate to be optimal. PBS has maintained that by relying on operating leases instead, the government incurs a higher long-term cost and consumes resources that could be used for repairs and alterations of the existing inventory.", "Other organizations felt similar constraints on their ability to obtain or replace facilities. Coast Guard officials, for example, cited a need for new employee housing. The Coast Guard prefers to satisfy housing needs by providing allowances to employees to rent from the private sector. However, in remote or resort areas of the country where affordable rental housing is not available, the Coast Guard constructs housing. Coast Guard officials stated that even though the housing fulfills a long-term need, they must budget for the full cost in a single year, which generally limits the number of capital projects that can be undertaken. Officials at the Forest Service also felt that up-front funding requirements in conjunction with resource constraints prevented them from making investments in buildings and facilities. Many of the agency\u2019s facilities are in very poor condition and in need of repair or replacement. However, Forest Service managers say they are not able to obtain the large increases in appropriations needed to meet these one-time costs.", "FDA officials also felt that up-front funding was an obstacle to acquiring needed facilities. They felt that some of their facilities were in need of repair or replacement, but that many of these cannot be undertaken because their cost must be budgeted for up-front. In addition, FDA has been waiting for a number of years to obtain funding to consolidate headquarters staff that are currently spread out across many different locations in the Washington, DC metropolitan area into fewer sites. FDA officials believe that the segmentation of their facilities increases their operating cost and makes it harder to fully use some pieces of equipment that could be shared if staff were consolidated into fewer facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Up-Front Funding Is Paramount to Governmentwide Fiscal Control", "paragraphs": ["Although possibly problematic for individual agencies, up-front funding has long been recognized as an important tool for maintaining governmentwide fiscal control. The requirement that budget authority be provided up-front, before the government enters into any commitment, was established over 100 years ago in the Adequacy of Appropriations Act and the Antideficiency Act. These acts responded to past problems in which agencies committed the government to payments that exceeded the resources made available to them by Congress.", "The importance of the principle was reinforced by the 1967 Report of the President\u2019s Commission on Budget Concepts, which emphasized the primary purposes of the budget as being the efficient allocation of resources and the formulation of fiscal policy to benefit the national economy. The up-front funding requirement advances both. It is essential for efficient resource allocation decisions because it helps ensure that the Congress considers the full cost of all proposed commitments and makes trade-offs based on full costs. To be useful in the formulation of fiscal policy, the budget must be able to highlight the impact of the federal budget on the economy. For this purpose, the requirement for up-front funding also serves the Congress well. The point at which capital spending has the largest and most direct economic impact on the private sector occurs at the point the commitment is made\u2014that is, up-front\u2014not over the expected lifetime of a long-lived asset.", "Failure to recognize the full cost of a particular type of expenditure when budget decisions are being made could lead to distortions in the allocation of resources. In other words, if particular types of spending, such as for physical assets, were given preferential treatment in the budget by virtue of recognizing only a fraction of their total cost, then it is likely that relatively more spending for those types of assets would occur. While advocates for purchasing some federal assets may see this as a desirable end, such an outcome may not accurately reflect the nation\u2019s needs. In particular, other types of federal spending that also provide long-term benefits but that are not physical assets (including research and development and spending for human capital) would be arbitrarily disadvantaged in the budget process, even if national priorities remain unchanged.", "Furthermore, failure to fully fund capital projects at the time the commitment is entered into can force future Congresses and administrations to choose between having an unusable asset and continuing projects\u2019 funding for years even after priorities may have changed. For example, if the Congress provides funding for only part of a project and that part is not usable absent completion of the entire project, then the Congress and the administration may feel compelled to continue funding in the future to avoid wasting the initial, partial funding that was already spent. Thus, if capital projects are begun without full funding, future Congresses and administrations may, in effect, be forced to commit a greater share of their annual resources to fulfilling past commitments and thus have less flexibility to respond to new or changing needs as they arise.", "Although the organizations we contacted may perceive it to be difficult to obtain full funding in a single year for capital assets, OMB and the Congress have at various times accommodated agencies\u2019 needs for large increases in budget authority to fully fund their capital projects.

Thus, an agency\u2019s failure to receive funding for its capital request may reflect the fact that, on a governmentwide basis, other agencies\u2019 capital projects are of higher priority to OMB or the Congress.

These contracts cover the entire project but indicate the amount of work that is expected to be completed during each year and the cost of that increment.

If the Congress were to discontinue funding for the project at some point during the overall contract, the Corps would be responsible for paying the contractor various cancellation or decommissioning costs. However, while the Corps is not legally obligated to complete an incrementally funded project, terminating it before completion can leave the Corps without anything of economic value. Corps officials suggest however, that because of the costs that have already been incurred and the economic justification that is done before beginning any project, it is unlikely that the Congress would choose to cancel a project for fiscal reasons once it is begun.

Some within OMB have suggested that this may not be as much of a concern with the Corps, in part because both OMB and the Congress have had confidence in the Corps\u2019 total cost estimates because of the historical reliability of its cost-benefit justifications. Thus, the Congress is aware of the costs and the benefits of a project before it is authorized. OMB officials also indicated that other factors contribute to ensuring that projects are managed cost effectively. For example, state or local authorities that act as financial partners in Corps projects have a strong incentive to ensure that projects are well-managed. In addition, project authorization levels limit the amount of additional appropriations the Corps can obtain for cost overruns.", "OMB has acknowledged that agencies have not always requested or received full up-front funding for capital acquisitions. Besides the Corps of Engineers, some capital projects at the Bureau of Reclamation, DOE, and NASA have also been funded incrementally.

Although full funding was not requested for capital projects at the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation, the President\u2019s budget indicated that the cost of fully funding ongoing and new projects for these two agencies would be about $23 billion in fiscal year 1997 (which represents 11 percent of total domestic discretionary budget authority in fiscal year 1995). The implications of fully funding capital projects\u2014including those that have been incrementally funded\u2014will be clarified for the government as a whole when agencies submit their fiscal year 1998 budget requests to OMB.

Under certain conditions and for certain types of capital acquisitions, revolving funds and investment-type accounts can serve to manage the spikes in resource needs that are created for an agency by up-front funding. Case studies have also pursued strategies intended to reduce their need to own capital assets and to lower their overall cost of operations so that capital spending may be more easily accommodated.

In acquiring a class of ships, the Coast Guard may write a contract for a lead ship and spare parts with options to buy additional ships in future years. By structuring its acquisitions in this way, the Coast Guard can request full funding for each useful piece of the project as the project progresses, rather than requesting funds for the entire project up-front. This strategy reduces the budget authority needed by the Coast Guard to initiate the project and is consistent with full funding because the Coast Guard receives a useful asset from each funded option, though the full value of the asset may not be realized until the entire project is completed.", "The Coast Guard\u2019s experience indicates that structuring a capital acquisition into fully-funded, stand-alone stages has several advantages to agencies and the Congress. First, it allows agencies to spread the amount of budget authority needed to complete a large capital acquisition over multiple years. For the agency and for the Congress, this can enable more projects to be underway concurrently. A second advantage is that the Congress can exercise more frequent oversight over the progress of the total capital project. As each usable portion of the total project is completed, the Congress has an opportunity to review progress, re-evaluate needs, and decide whether to provide funding for the next segment. Third, budgeting for stand-alone stages of a project gives the Congress greater funding flexibility to respond to changing needs or national priorities. If changing circumstances dictate that other needs are of a higher priority, the Congress can discontinue the project at an appropriate juncture, shift funds to the new need, and still benefit from the funds already spent on the stand-alone stages.", "Agency managers, of course, would prefer to receive funding for the entire project at the outset since that would reduce uncertainty, make project management easier, and possibly lower the cost contractors charge. However, it is appropriate from an overall federal budgeting perspective for projects spanning multiple years and requiring significant resources to be re-evaluated as they progress, with the Congress maintaining the option to end the project. Decisions to terminate or slow down projects reflect current budget priorities given available resources.

Revolving funds can ensure through their user charges that the full cost of programs\u2014including capital usage\u2014is borne on an annual basis by those responsible for the program rather than passed on to future users. At an agency level, revolving funds incorporate traditional capital budgeting concepts and can result in charging users for capital consumption without violating up-front funding principles for the federal government as a whole. As GPRA is implemented, full costing will take on even greater importance as managers will need to assess whether their programs are achieving goals in a cost-effective manner.

In some cases this may lead them to reconsider whether they need the same quantity or type of fixed assets as previously thought. For example, as rent charges for work space become a greater burden for agencies (because of stagnant or declining annual budgets), it is reasonable to expect that more agencies will become concerned about their use of space and the resources it diverts from other purposes.

However, the fund may not be able to accommodate future costs if advances from DOE continue to decline or cease altogether.", "Although a revolving fund should fully recover its costs through user charges if it is to be self-sustaining, this has not been the case with the FBF. The imbalance between the FBF\u2019s costs and its income lies in part in the inherent structure of the Fund. FBF rent charges to agencies are not necessarily sufficient to cover full costs because they are not based on the actual costs to PBS. In some cases, PBS\u2019 repair and maintenance costs are higher than the average for office buildings because it must maintain some of its office buildings as heritage assets. Since FBF charges agencies for their use of owned and leased space based on market appraisals made every 5 years, actual costs to maintain the space and FBF payments to the private-sector lessor may vary from the rental income FBF collects. Adding to these constraints on PBS\u2019 cost recovery have been caps on rent. During the 1980s, the Congress believed some PBS rental charges were too high and imposed caps on the rents of some agencies. Although only three agencies currently have rent caps, PBS estimated that the caps have caused substantial income losses over the years.", "Financing office space to satisfy customer needs may also be more difficult because the FBF is not authorized to retain the proceeds from the disposal of property.

Our review of case studies\u2019 revolving funds, as well as previous analysis of specific revolving funds, has led us to draw some conclusions about the characteristics needed for successful revolving funds. First, agencies using a revolving fund need to have demonstrated a sound record of financial management. Financing capital through a revolving fund can entail a lesser degree of congressional control than direct appropriations. Not all agencies may have demonstrated a sufficient stewardship of government resources to warrant a reduction in congressional oversight. Good financial management can be even more important if revolving funds rely on charges to other agencies for income and are not subject to competition because, under such circumstances, revolving fund managers may have less incentive to control costs. Sound internal controls and oversight by management are needed to ensure that revolving fund efficiencies are not neglected because costs can be passed on to its users. When external competition that can provide an incentive for cost-consciousness is absent and when fund acquisitions are expensive, revolving funds may need a greater degree of congressional oversight.", "Second, for a revolving fund to be effective, the agency must be able to identify clearly the appropriate customers to charge and the actual capital cost that each customer incurs. If this is not possible, a revolving fund is probably not practical. For example, officials at the Coast Guard indicated that because of their organizational structure and overlapping missions it would be impractical for them to use a revolving fund. They explained that many Coast Guard assets are used by units in carrying out multiple activities\u2014such as defense operations and law enforcement\u2014so that it is potentially more difficult to assign cost to a specific mission or activity. They also stated that it would be inappropriate to charge some users of capital. Since mission responsibilities are often tied to carrying out search and rescue, law enforcement, and maritime environmental protection activities, fees attached to those activities could create perverse incentives. Coast Guard officials want to encourage units to use the most appropriate assets for carrying out their missions and not to be inappropriately influenced by cost considerations in what is often an emergency situation.", "Third, to be successful in the long-term, revolving fund managers must know their full costs and have the authority to charge fees that recover the cost of operating and replacing assets. Without replacement cost pricing, the resources of the fund would eventually be depleted by inflation. In addition, the accounting system of the agency must be able to track costs accurately. All agencies do not have adequate systems to allow them to fully allocate all costs associated with running a particular program or activity.", "Fourth, to be self-sustaining, the revolving fund should be adequately funded initially and should receive additional resources when significant increases in its asset base are immediately required. If fees are established in order to meet a specific level of capital need, and that level increases, then some additional resources must be made available for the fund to remain self-sustaining. The additional resources could come from operational savings that are achieved, higher fees to users, or an external injection of funding (i.e., an appropriation). For example, IFMS must expand its service level to include more expensive, alternatively fueled vehicles but is hesitant to either delay vehicle replacements or raise rates and risk losing customers. IFMS officials believe that some of the cost can be funded through operating efficiencies but that additional funds will be necessary if the requirement cannot be modified. Likewise, if PBS must increase the size of its inventory to meet customer demand and past collections have not been designed to fund expansion, then appropriations may need to be considered. Existing reserves may be able to fund expansions of the asset base or service level in the short-term, but using these reserves would ultimately deprive the existing users from having their own assets repaired and replaced. Also, while providing a funding source for asset base expansion, increasing the fees charged to current users may make them pay more than the cost they are responsible for incurring, thus distorting the cost shown in the users\u2019 budgets. Conversely, if demand for the revolving fund\u2019s capital assets declines, resources could be taken out of the revolving fund to be used for other purposes across the government. This is especially the case for a revolving fund that purchases relatively large-scale and heterogeneous assets.", "Fifth, if they are to provide a constant level of service, revolving funds typically need to have the flexibility to retain or dispose of assets based on their economic value and be able to reinvest the proceeds in the fund. If a revolving fund is to operate in a business-like fashion, its managers must be able to determine when it is more efficient to invest in new assets than to retain and operate existing assets. If revolving funds tasked with providing constant levels of services are not able to dispose of under-performing or unnecessary assets and retain the proceeds, capital allocation decisions may be distorted. For example, PBS officials cited an experience where their financial analysis indicated that they should sell a building and use the proceeds to acquire alternative space. Although they could still use the building, in the long-term it would have been a more efficient use of resources to purchase new space. However, because PBS is prevented by law from keeping the sale proceeds, PBS retained the building.", "Finally, revolving funds, like other funding mechanisms, must operate within an environment of controls if the Congress and OMB are to ensure that resources are well spent and that capital acquisitions reflect the government\u2019s highest priorities. Because revolving fund purchases need not be reviewed by the Congress or OMB, traditional revolving funds may not be appropriate when competition for the fund\u2019s services is lacking and when purchases are relatively large-scale, sporadic, or heterogeneous. Under these conditions, a greater degree of oversight is warranted to ensure that the resources accumulated in the fund are used where most needed governmentwide. Such assets might include buildings and courthouses acquired through the FBF. In contrast, revolving funds that compete with private-sector service providers and that make relatively routine purchases of small-scale, homogeneous assets such as vehicles, may warrant relatively high degrees of autonomy because the external factor of competition forces revolving fund managers to control their costs and effectively allocate resources."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "An Investment Component Encourages Saving for Capital Needs", "paragraphs": ["Another mechanism being used to ameliorate agency problems with up-front funding requirements is USGS\u2019 creation of an investment component within its working capital fund (WCF).

In this sense, the WCF investment component operates much like a savings account for a manager at any level to fund capital acquisition. In contrast to a more traditional revolving fund, users of the investment component make voluntary contributions for prospective capital purchases, rather than being charged retrospectively for capital usage.

The investment plan specifies the asset to be acquired, the estimated acquisition or replacement cost, the number of years required to fund the acquisition, and the schedule of deposits into the fund (annually, quarterly, or monthly, for example). After the investment plan is approved, the division periodically obligates the planned contribution amount from its annual appropriations and pays it to the investment component of the WCF, where it remains available for obligation. Once in the investment component, the contributions can be saved until a sufficient sum\u2014as specified in the investment plan\u2014has been accumulated to purchase the planned asset.", "The USGS has imposed internal restrictions on the fund to prevent abuse of the authority.

Nevertheless, the investment component has several benefits and may be a useful tool for other agencies, especially those with annually expiring funds. First, it encourages agencies to use long-range planning to alleviate the effects of up-front funding capital. Managers must anticipate the capital needs they will have in the future and submit a plan that indicates specifically how they expect to fund the asset need. An investment plan requires the agency to justify spending in advance of receiving the appropriations that will fund contributions. It also gives agencies an incentive to make their own trade-offs between operations and capital and to strive for savings in operations. The investment component achieves this by permitting agencies to set aside annual resources for future capital purchases. While agencies may have some incentive to look for savings in operations even without an investment component, the mechanism provides an impetus to make cuts in operations that may not exist otherwise.", "A third advantage of the investment component is that it facilitates agencies funding their highest priority asset needs. When agencies do not have sufficient annual resources to make a particular capital purchase, they may be inclined to devote the resources to acquiring other\u2014possibly less critical but less expensive\u2014capital assets rather than see the funds expire at the close of the fiscal year. And finally, the investment component would contribute toward making program and operating budgets better reflect their cost of capital usage. The investment component will not be as efficient or accurate at allocating capital costs as a revolving fund since it lacks the direct linkage between capital use and charges. However, because contributions are made from the operating budget, the mechanism does help facilitate a more systematic incorporation of capital costs into program expenses.", "Despite the potential benefits from investment components, problems could arise if investment accounts were widely used throughout government without adequate controls. For example, if several agencies obtain investment components and each decides to make large purchases in the same year, total outlays could rise sharply and cause a spike in the deficit. Therefore, OMB will need to manage all investment components to ensure that the total investment component outlays do not cause such spikes, even though this may result in deviations from the schedule specified in the agency\u2019s original investment plan.", "Furthermore, if the Congress permits agencies to use such investment components, it is giving them relatively more control than they currently possess over the use of their appropriation. Investment component control issues are similar to those of revolving funds (discussed previously in this chapter); thus the Congress would need to have similar confidence in the financial management abilities of agency officials before it permits the establishment of an investment component. Once established, managers should prepare and be held accountable to investment plans to ensure investment component funds are used as intended.", "The investment component concept is premised on program managers being able to plan for fixed asset acquisitions by accumulating funds over a period of years and applying them toward a future capital need. USGS officials felt that potential congressional actions to re-allocate these funds, such as rescissions and reductions in future appropriations, would create significant disincentives for managers to contribute. Likewise, these officials felt that program managers would be less likely to contribute if top-level management used contributions for purposes other than those in the investment plan.", "Though a promising tool, the investment component can have limitations to its usefulness. Agencies already faced with tight operating budgets may have little to contribute to such an account without making difficult trade-offs with operations, potentially including personnel cuts. Although increasing numbers of agencies have been confronted with downsizing in recent years, some appropriations subcommittee staff still question the willingness of agencies to voluntarily trade-off personnel for capital assets. Furthermore, capital assets must still be budgeted for in advance of any savings they may generate. Capital acquisitions that could \u201cpay for themselves\u201d over time still could not be funded without the agency first carving out funds from elsewhere to pay for them.

It is likely that in other agencies as well, government managers have found that increasing specialization among contractors enables agencies to acquire some capital-intensive services more cheaply externally than they can be performed in-house. Contracting out can be useful and cost-effective when asset needs are short-term and non-recurring.

For example, the Coast Guard structures its acquisition strategies to assure contractors of minimum levels of production that will keep costs low. In their response to OMB Bulletin 94-08, Coast Guard officials wrote that funding that is insufficient to support acquisition strategies or rescissions can cause contractor shut-downs and make designs obsolete, adding to projected costs.

Up to 10 percent of the funds within the Corps\u2019 fixed asset categories can be diverted from one acquisition to another without prior approval by the Corps\u2019 appropriations subcommittees. When reprogramming requires the subcommittees\u2019 approval, informal relationships between Corps officials and congressional staff help the Corps receive a quick response to reprogramming requests. The Coast Guard has also taken advantage of reprogramming authority to respond to variances between estimated and actual costs for construction projects. Nevertheless, Coast Guard officials feel they are constrained in addressing some new and changing priorities because of limits on their reprogramming authority.

A new $100 million construction project makes fewer outlays in the first-year, and thus can produce fewer outlay savings in that year, than a $100 million operating account.

In addition to assets meeting FASAB\u2019s definition, space exploration facilities and equipment and all DOE facilities were deemed fixed assets for purposes of the Bulletin.

FASA requires that executive agency heads (1) set cost, performance, and schedule goals for major acquisition programs, (2) monitor the programs to ensure they are achieving, on average, 90 percent of the established goals, and (3) take corrective actions, including termination, on programs that do not remain within the permitted tolerances. FASA also requires OMB to report to the Congress on agencies\u2019 progress in meeting these cost, schedule, and performance goals. ITMRA requires agency heads to establish goals for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of agency operations through effective use of information technology and to acquire information technology systems in successive acquisitions of interoperable increments. Under ITMRA, when the President submits the budget to the Congress, the OMB Director is to submit a report to the Congress on the net program performance benefits achieved as a result of agencies\u2019 major information systems projects and on how the benefits of such projects relate to agencies\u2019 goals. Under GPRA, agencies must develop, no later than by the end of fiscal year 1997, strategic plans that cover a period of at least 5 years and include the agency\u2019s mission statement; identify the agency\u2019s long-term strategic goals; and describe how the agency intends to achieve those goals through its activities and through its human, capital, information, and other resources. GPRA also requires each agency to submit to OMB, beginning for fiscal year 1999, an annual performance plan. In essence, the annual performance plan is to contain the annual performance goals the agency will use to gauge its progress toward accomplishing its strategic goals and identify the performance measures the agency will use to assess its progress.

For example, if both capital and operating costs are not attributed to programs over time, programs may appear deceptively inexpensive. In addition, the cost of replacing assets is borne entirely by future agency managers and Congresses that may not have been responsible for asset consumption. Second, the budget process ought to enable lawmakers to compare the full, long-term costs of various spending alternatives. Thus, long-term commitments, such as purchases or lease-purchases, are scored up-front in the budget. Third, the Congress needs to be assured that agencies are spending funds as directed by law and be able to control total federal spending. Fourth, agencies need the flexibility and incentives to make economic decisions regarding capital acquisition and usage.", "Full up-front funding is one of the tools that has been important to facilitating fiscal control and comparisons of the long-term costs of spending alternatives. An essential part of prudent capital planning must be an adherence to full up-front funding. When full up-front funding is not practiced, the Congress risks committing the government to capital acquisitions without determining whether the project is affordable over the long-term. Incremental funding also compels future Congresses to fund a project in order to prevent wasting resources previously appropriated. As budgetary constraints continue, incremental funding may lock the Congress into future spending patterns and reduce flexibility to respond to new needs. In the budget process, fully funded projects may be disadvantaged in competition with incrementally funded projects\u2014even when the fully funded projects actually cost less in the long-run.", "However, full up-front funding can impede agencies\u2019 ability to economically acquire capital in an environment of resource constraints. Full up-front funding of relatively expensive capital acquisitions can consume a large share of an agency\u2019s annual budget, thereby forcing today\u2019s decision-makers to pay all at once for projects with long-lived benefits. While various capital budgeting proposals have been advanced to address this, the proposals themselves have raised significant concern because of their potential diminution of fiscal accountability and control.

Several use revolving funds to help accumulate resources for capital replacement and to help incorporate capital costs into program budgets. This will become of increasing importance as implementation of GPRA will require managers to know the full annual cost of their programs and to evaluate the performance of programs based on the full cost. Because revolving funds charge users for the cost of capital, managers have an incentive to regularly assess their need for and use of assets. By providing managers with a predictable stream of funding, revolving funds also encourage long-range capital planning. Our work indicates that revolving funds are most effective when (1) agencies have a sound record of financial management, (2) costs can be tracked to users, (3) replacement cost is recovered, (4) appropriations are available to fund significant or immediate expansions of the fund\u2019s asset base, (5) proceeds from the disposal of fund assets are retained by the fund if the fund is expected to provide a constant level of service, and (6) used to finance small-scale, ongoing capital needs. Our case studies also indicate that revolving funds can provide varying degrees of congressional control. IFMS has few restrictions on the type of vehicles it can purchase; in contrast, the Congress approves every large purchase by the Corps\u2019 and PBS\u2019 revolving funds. Oversight by the Congress is important to ensuring that agency acquisitions are well-planned and justified and that the agency\u2019s overall level of capital spending is appropriate given other competing capital and operating needs across the government.", "An investment component within a working capital fund generates many of the same benefits as revolving funds. In addition, an investment component may encourage agency managers to fund their voluntary contributions by making tradeoffs between capital and operational spending. Although the investment component is a recent development and used by only one of our case studies, it seems especially helpful for agencies that would otherwise fund capital with annually expiring funds. USGS\u2019 investment component operates with few restrictions apart from prohibitions against building construction and using funds within 2 years of their placement in the investment component. However, expanding the use of an investment component to other agencies may require other limitations. For example, if several agencies obtain investment components and each decides to make large purchases in the same year, total outlays could rise sharply and cause a spike in the deficit. Therefore, OMB would need to manage all investment components to ensure total investment component outlays do not cause such spikes. The Congress must also be aware that an investment component may encourage agencies to build unobligated balances and that agencies would need to be held accountable to their investment plans.", "In addition to using revolving funds or an investment component, some case studies budget for stand-alone stages of capital acquisitions and use reprogramming authority. Budgeting for stand-alone stages makes capital acquisition affordable by limiting the budget authority needed at one time. It may also increase opportunities for oversight and permit adjustment of capital funding levels when other needs emerge. This tool can be used when parts of an acquisition can be useful without the whole being completed. If used as intended, reprogramming authority also helps agencies respond when changes in funding or mission leave inadequate funding to complete a capital acquisition or create new capital needs. Congressional control is maintained by limiting the amount of such authority.", "Multiyear and no-year funding help agencies accommodate capital\u2019s longer acquisition cycle. All of our case studies had the opportunity to fund capital through multiyear appropriations or a revolving fund.

OMB\u2019s bulletins and guidance on fixed-asset planning and budgeting have been valuable contributions toward promoting agency capital planning. Also, given the governmentwide trend in downsizing, agencies may need to consider alternatives to ownership of capital assets. For example, agencies may purchase the use of assets through service contracts with private-sector organizations or other agencies. In other instances, agencies may need to explore creative ways of leveraging resources with the private sector, such as limited partnerships and loan guarantees, in order to meet their specific asset requirements.", "While agencies are concerned that the budget process facilitate capital acquisitions, it should be understood that agencies must ensure that capital projects are properly selected and well-managed. Flexible financing mechanisms and up-front funding can help to improve the chances that agencies can fully fund capital projects and will select financing methods that are most economical for the government. However, to ensure that funds are well used, it is imperative that agencies have a sound process for selecting which capital projects to fund and to manage those projects well. We have shown that many information technology projects undertaken by agencies have been poorly managed and wasted federal resources. Agencies could benefit from viewing capital projects\u2014especially information technology\u2014as investments that require explicit decision criteria and performance measures that assess risks, costs, and benefits.
