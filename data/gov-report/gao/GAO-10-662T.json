Sellers, such as retail stores, Web sites, and distributors, often claim these supplements help improve memory, circulation, and other bodily functions. GAO was asked to determine (1) whether sellers of herbal dietary supplements are using deceptive or questionable marketing practices and (2) whether selected herbal dietary supplements are contaminated with harmful substances. To conduct this investigation, GAO investigated a nonrepresentative selection of 22 storefront and mail-order retailers of herbal dietary supplements. Posing as elderly consumers, GAO investigators asked sales staff (by phone and in person) at each retailer a series of questions regarding herbal dietary supplements. GAO also reviewed written marketing language used on approximately 30 retail Web sites. Claims were evaluated against recognized scientific research published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). GAO also had an accredited lab test 40 unique popular single-ingredient herbal dietary supplements for the presence of lead, arsenic, mercury, cadmium, organichlorine pesticides, and organophosphorous pesticides."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Certain dietary supplements commonly used by the elderly were deceptively or questionably marketed. FDA statutes and regulations do not permit sellers to make claims that their products can treat, prevent, or cure specific diseases. However, in several cases, written sales materials for products sold through online retailers claimed that herbal dietary supplements could treat, prevent, or cure conditions such as diabetes, cancer, or cardiovascular disease. When GAO shared these claims with FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), both agreed that the claims were improper and likely in violation of statutes and regulations. In addition, while posing as elderly customers, GAO investigators were often told by sales staff that a given supplement would prevent or cure conditions such as high cholesterol or Alzheimer's disease. To hear clips of undercover calls, see http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-662T . Perhaps more dangerously, GAO investigators were given potentially harmful medical advice. For example, a seller stated it was not a problem to take ginkgo biloba with aspirin to improve memory; however, FDA warns that combining aspirin and ginkgo biloba can increase a person's risk of bleeding. In another case, a seller stated that an herbal dietary supplement could be taken instead of a medication prescribed by a doctor. GAO referred these sellers to FDA and FTC for appropriate action. GAO also found trace amounts of at least one potentially hazardous contaminant in 37 of the 40 herbal dietary supplement products tested, though none in amounts considered to pose an acute toxicity hazard. All 37 supplements tested positive for trace amounts of lead; of those, 32 also contained mercury, 28 cadmium, 21 arsenic, and 18 residues from at least one pesticide. The levels of heavy metals found do not exceed any FDA or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations governing dietary supplements or their raw ingredients, and FDA and EPA officials did not express concern regarding any immediate negative health consequences from consuming these 40 supplements. While the manufacturers GAO spoke with were concerned about finding any contaminants in their supplements, they noted that the levels identified were too low to raise any issues internal product testing."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss findings from our investigation  into the manufacture and marketing of selected herbal dietary  supplements commonly used by the elderly. The Dietary Supplement  Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) defines dietary supplements as  products that, among other things, are intended for ingestion to  supplement the diet, labeled as dietary supplements, and not represented  as conventional foods or as a sole items of a meal or diet. Recent studies  have shown that use of herbal dietary supplements, such as chamomile,  echinacea, garlic, ginkgo biloba, and ginseng, by the elderly in the United  States has increased substantially.", "In 2000, we reported that consumers did not consistently receive clear,  scientifically supported information concerning products\u2019 health benefits  so they could make informed dietary choices. Further, we have reported  that consumers faced health risks because federal laws and agencies\u2019  efforts did not effectively and consistently ensure that dietary supplements  were safe. Most recently, we expressed concern that weaknesses in the  regulatory system may increase the likelihood of unsafe products reaching  the market, and a lack of consumer knowledge increases the potential  health risks associated with uninformed consumption. At your request,  we determined (1) whether sellers of herbal dietary supplements are using  deceptive or questionable marketing practices to encourage the use of  these products and (2) whether selected herbal dietary supplements are  contaminated with harmful substances.", "To determine whether sellers of herbal dietary supplements are using  deceptive or questionable marketing practices to encourage the use of these  products, we investigated a nonrepresentative selection of 22 storefront and  mail-order retailers. We identified these retailers by searching online using  search terms likely to be used by actual consumers and by observing  newspaper advertisements. Posing as elderly potential consumers, we asked  sales staff at each retailer a series of questions regarding the potential health  benefits of herbal dietary supplements as well as potential interactions with  other common over-the-counter and prescription drugs. We also reviewed  written marketing language used on approximately 30 retail Web sites. We  evaluated the accuracy of product marketing claims against health benefit  evaluations published through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and  Food and Drug Administration (FDA). While our work focused on herbal  dietary supplements, we also evaluated claims made regarding nonherbal  supplement products recommended to us during undercover storefront  visits and telephone calls.", "To determine whether selected herbal dietary supplements are  contaminated with harmful substances, we purchased 40 unique single- ingredient herbal supplement products from 40 different manufacturers  and submitted them to an accredited laboratory for analysis. We selected  the types of herbs to purchase based on recent surveys about the  supplements usage of the elderly. These surveys identified the most  commonly used herbs among the elderly as chamomile, echinacea, garlic,  ginkgo biloba, ginseng, peppermint, saw palmetto, and St. John\u2019s wort. We  purchased these 40 unique products from a combination of retail chain  storefronts and online or mail-order retailers; these retailers were selected  independently from those selected for evaluation of marketing practices.  For each online retailer, we selected brands based primarily on relative  popularity according to the site\u2019s list of top sellers. One unopened,  manufacturer-sealed bottle of each of these 40 products was submitted to  an accredited laboratory where they were screened for the presence of  common hazardous contaminants: lead, arsenic, mercury, cadmium, and  residues from organichlorine and organophosphorous pesticides. These  contaminants were selected based on prevalence and the likelihood of  negative health consequences as a result of consumption. We did not  independently validate the results received with another lab, or through  any other mechanism. The likely negative health consequences from  consumption of these contaminants were determined based on a review of  relevant health standards and discussions with FDA and Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) experts. For a complete discussion of our scope  and methodology, see appendix I. See appendix II for the complete list of  contaminants we reviewed.", "Our investigative work, conducted from September 2009 through March  2010, was performed in accordance with standards prescribed by the  Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Herbal dietary supplements are traditionally used to alleviate certain  medical conditions, such as anxiety, digestive problems, and depression,  and to improve general quality of life. However, for many traditional uses,  there is not clear scientific evidence to show that they prevent or treat  underlying diseases or conditions. Further, some herbal dietary  supplements may interact in a potentially harmful manner with some  prescription drugs. For example, according to NIH, St. John\u2019s wort can  negatively affect the efficacy of antidepressants, HIV treatments, cancer  drugs, and anticoagulants, though this is not always noted on product  labels. The possibility of adverse drug interactions is one of the reasons  that FDA recommends that consumers check with their health  practitioners before beginning any supplement regimen. The elderly are  particularly at risk from these interactions since recent studies have found  that approximately 85 percent of the elderly take at least one prescription  drug over the course of a year and 58 percent take three or more. Many  herbal supplements have not been exhaustively tested for hazardous  interactions with prescription drugs, other supplements, or foods.", "Under DSHEA, dietary supplements are broadly presumed safe, and FDA  does not have the authority to require them to be approved for safety and  efficacy before they enter the market, as it does for drugs. However, a  dietary supplement manufacturer or distributor of a supplement with a  \u201cnew dietary ingredient\u201d\u2014an ingredient that was not marketed in the  United States before October 15, 1994\u2014may be required to notify FDA at  least 75 days before marketing the product, depending on the history of  use of the ingredient.

Except in the case of a new  dietary ingredient, where premarket review for safety data and other  information is required by law, a firm does not have to provide FDA with  the evidence it relies on to substantiate effectiveness before or after it  markets its products. For the most part, FDA relies on postmarket  surveillance efforts\u2014such as monitoring adverse event reports it receives  from companies, health care practitioners, and individuals; reviewing  consumer complaints; and conducting facility inspections\u2014to identify  potential safety concerns related to dietary supplements. Once a safety  concern is identified, FDA must demonstrate that the dietary supplement  presents a significant or unreasonable risk, or is otherwise adulterated,  before it can be removed from the market.", "A product sold as a dietary supplement cannot suggest on its label or in  labeling that it treats, prevents, or cures a specific disease or condition  without specific approval from FDA. Under FDA regulations, a  manufacturer may submit a health claim petition in order to use a claim on  its product labeling that characterizes a relationship between the product  and risk of a disease, and FDA may authorize it provided the claims meet  certain criteria and are authorized by FDA regulations (e.g., diets high in  calcium may reduce the risk of osteoporosis). However, manufacturers  may make \u201cqualified health claims\u201d when there is emerging evidence for a  relationship between a dietary supplement and reduced risk of a disease  or condition, subject to FDA\u2019s enforcement discretion.

The human body\u2019s  absorption of many contaminants is governed by intake method, so  advisory levels for other foods (e.g., drinking water) cannot be strictly  applied to dietary supplements. In addition, EPA sets limits on how much  pesticide residue can remain on food and feed products. These pesticide  residue limits are known as tolerances and are enforced by FDA. If no  residue tolerance has been set for a particular pesticide, any product  containing that pesticide residue is considered adulterated and its sale is  prohibited by law.

The most egregious practices included suspect marketing claims  that a dietary supplement prevented or cured extremely serious diseases,  such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. Other dietary supplements  were claimed to mitigate age-related medical conditions, such as  Alzheimer\u2019s disease and diverticular disorder. We also found some claims  that followed FDA\u2019s labeling regulations and guidelines, but could still be  considered deceptive or questionable and provide consumers with  inaccurate information. In addition, while conducting in-person and  telephone conversations with dietary supplements sellers, our  investigators, posing as elderly consumers, were given potentially harmful  medical advice by sales staff, including that they could take supplements  in lieu of prescription medication.

According to NIH, all these claims are unproven, and garlic is not  recommended for treating these conditions. In fact, for several of these  conditions, garlic may interact adversely with common FDA-approved  drug treatments. Nowhere in this product\u2019s marketing materials does the  seller suggest that consumers should consult their health care providers  prior to taking its supplement. While NIH recognizes that garlic may have  some anticancer properties, the agency notes that additional clinical trials  are needed to conclude whether these properties are strong enough to  prevent or treat cancer. Further, studies have shown that garlic may alter  the levels of some cancer drugs in the human body, lessening their  effectiveness. For diabetes, there are no studies that confirm that garlic  lowers blood sugar or increases the release of insulin in humans. In fact,  NIH recommends caution when combining garlic with medications that  lower blood sugar, and further suggests that patients taking insulin or oral  drugs for diabetes be monitored closely by qualified health care  professionals.", "Case 3: According to its labeling, this ginseng supplement\u2014which costs  $500 for a 90-day supply\u2014cures diseases, effectively prevents diabetes and  cardiovascular disease, and prevents cancer or halts its progression. These  claims are unproven\u2014no studies confirm that ginseng can prevent or cure  any disease. In fact, NIH recommends that breast and uterine cancer  patients avoid ginseng. In addition, ginseng may adversely interact with  cancer drugs. The product labeling claims do not differentiate between  type 1 and type 2 diabetes. According to NIH, ginseng\u2019s effect on patients  with type 1 diabetes is not well studied. While ginseng may lower blood  sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes, the long-term effects of such a  treatment program are unclear, and it is not known what doses are safe or  effective. NIH specifically recommends that consumers with type 2  diabetes use proven therapies instead of this supplement.", "Case 7: While our investigators posed as consumers purchasing dietary  supplements, sales staff provided them with an informational booklet  regarding an enzyme that claims to \u201c us against dementia and  Alzheimer\u2019s, exhibiting a truly miraculous capacity to optimize mental  performance and fight off cognitive decline.\u201d In fact, FDA reviewed the  scientific evidence for the active ingredient of this supplement and found  that it was not adequate to make such a claim. Because the agency  considered such a health claim potentially misleading, FDA provided for  the use of a qualified health claim that contains a disclaimer that must  accompany the health claim in all labeling in which these claims appear.  While the booklet we received does state the FDA disclaimer on the first  page, the manufacturer follows it with a rejoinder: \u201cThe very cautious  language of these claims, which FDA mandates can only be stated word  for word, is at best a grudging concession to the extensive clinical  research done with .

The  sales representative recommended a garlic supplement and stated that the  product could be taken in lieu of prescribed blood pressure medication.  According to NIH, while this herb may lower blood pressure by a small  amount, the scientific evidence is unclear. NIH does not recommend this  supplement as a treatment for high blood pressure and warns patients to  use caution while taking this product with other drugs or supplements that  can lower blood pressure. Further, it is not recommended that a consumer  start or stop a course of treatment without consulting with his or her  health care provider.

A  sales representative recommended one of the store\u2019s ginkgo biloba  supplements. The consumer told the representative that he takes aspirin  everyday and asked if it was safe to take aspirin and ginkgo biloba  together. The sales representative told him that it is completely safe to  take the two together.
