These risks, identified through GAO's review of 32 adjudicated cases, include price inflation through multiple companies owned by the same entity to falsely create the appearance of competition, contractors receiving contracts they were not eligible to receive, and a foreign manufacturer receiving sensitive information or producing faulty equipment through a U.S.-based company. For example, one case involved an ineligible foreign manufacturer that illegally exported sensitive military data and provided defective and nonconforming parts that led to the grounding of at least 47 fighter aircraft, as illustrated below.", "DOD has taken some steps that could address some risks related to contractor ownership in the procurement process but has not yet assessed these risks across the department. DOD, in coordination with other agencies, revised the Federal Acquisition Regulation in 2014 to require contractors to self-report some ownership information. DOD has taken steps to identify and use ownership information\u2014for example, as part of its supply-chain risk analysis when acquiring critical components. DOD has also begun a department-wide fraud risk management program, but it has neither assessed risks of contractor ownership across the department nor identified risks posed by contractor ownership as a specific area for assessment. Assessing risks arising from contractor ownership would allow DOD to take a strategic approach to identifying and managing these risks, make informed decisions on how to best use its resources, and evaluate its existing control activities to ensure they effectively respond to these risks."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD assess risks related to contractor ownership as part of DOD's ongoing efforts to assess fraud risk.

In fiscal year 2018, DOD obligated over $350  billion in contracts for goods and services and awarded over 570,000 new  contracts to approximately 38,000 contractors. DOD awards contracts to  companies in the private sector to provide a wide variety of services for  U.S. military forces. Of the thousands of contractors doing business with  DOD, some companies are what are known as shell companies\u2014that is,  companies that exist but conduct either no business or minimal business.  Shell companies can be used for legitimate purposes; for example, they  may be formed to obtain financing before starting operations. However,  companies sometimes use shell companies to form opaque ownership  structures designed to disguise the beneficial owner\u2014the natural person  or persons who directly or indirectly own and control, or receive  substantial economic benefit from, a company. These opaque ownership  structures can be used to facilitate fraud and other unlawful activity in  commerce, including contracts with DOD. For this report, we define  opaque ownership as structures of business governance that may  conceal or obfuscate entities or individuals who own, control, or benefit  financially from a business.", "In the committee report on the National Defense Authorization Act for  fiscal year 2018, the House Armed Services Committee expressed  concerns that DOD contractors may disguise their identities and cost  structures from procurement officers, in effect acting as hidden  monopolies with unreasonable prices or establishing opaque ownership  structures for benefits that are contrary to the government\u2019s interest. The  committee report included a provision that GAO examine DOD\u2019s  processes to identify contractors\u2019 ownership structures and the risks  posed to DOD by contractors with opaque ownership structures. This report (1) identifies types of fraud and other risks, if any, that contractors  with opaque ownership could pose to DOD in the procurement process  and (2) assesses whether DOD has taken steps to address risks posed  by contractor ownership in the procurement process.", "This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on  September 12, 2019. The sensitive report included the results of data  analysis we conducted to identify offerors who might disguise their  ownership to create the appearance of competition. DOD deemed some  of the details from this analysis to be sensitive, which must be protected  from public disclosure. This report also omits sensitive information about  ongoing investigations, certain internal controls and vulnerabilities, and  actions taken to address some of these vulnerabilities. Although the  information provided in this report is more limited, it addresses the same  overall objectives as the sensitive report and uses the same  methodology.", "To address our first objective, we researched information on closed cases  investigated by the Defense Criminal Investigative Organizations or  prosecuted by the Department of Justice (DOJ) from calendar years 2012  through 2018. We also researched legal databases and news articles  involving DOD contractors to identify federal court cases and agency  decisions. We reviewed GAO bid-protest decisions to identify cases in  which contractors may have failed to disclose foreign ownership or  concealed beneficial-owner information to obtain contracts that they were  not eligible to receive. For each of the 32 cases identified, we reviewed  associated federal court filings or DOJ press releases. To identify  additional types of risks that may not have been identified through our  case-study research, we interviewed officials from the General Services  Administration (GSA) and officials across DOD, including the Office of  Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Organizations,  Defense Pricing and Contracting, Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD), Office of the Chief Information Officer,  Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Defense Security Service (DSS),  Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), Defense Contract Management Agency  (DCMA), and Defense Contract Audit Agency, and relevant procurement  policy officials from the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.  We examined known risks identified through our case-study research and  interviews with DOD officials; however, these risks are not necessarily  representative of the extent or the types of presently undiscovered fraud  or other risks that may exist across DOD.", "We further examined the risk that contractors could be disguising their  ownership to create the appearance of competition by analyzing bid  response data on approximately 2,700 solicitations from GSA\u2019s Federal  Business Opportunities website and offeror registration data from GSA\u2019s  System for Award Management (SAM) for fiscal years 2015 through  2017. We selected this date range because fiscal year 2015 was the first  year in which offerors were required to report ownership and 2017 was  the most-recent complete year of data at the time of our analysis. To  identify whether offerors were potentially related, we analyzed information  to identify instances in which different offerors shared certain  information. Offerors sharing information does not definitively prove that  the offerors are related or share ownership; however, it is an indicator that  these offerors may not be independent of each other. The results of our  analysis are limited to the approximately 2,700 solicitations we reviewed  and are not generalizable to other DOD solicitations. To assess the  reliability of these data, we performed electronic testing, reviewed related  documents, and compared the data to published sources and source  documentation maintained in the DOD contracting files. We also  interviewed GSA officials responsible for these databases. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  analyzing potential ownership relationships.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed federal laws, the Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR), DOD regulations, directives, instructions,  policies, procedures, and training documents. We also reviewed  OUSD(C) fraud assessment templates and preliminary results from the  department\u2019s fraud risk management pilot program. We interviewed  procurement policy officials from GSA, Defense Pricing and Contracting,  DLA, and the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force as well as  officials from the Office of the Chief Information Officer, OUSD(C), DIA,  DSS, DCMA, the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Joint Staff Logistics  Directorate, the Defense Industrial Policy office, members of DOD\u2019s  Procurement Fraud Working Group, and the Naval Contracting Council to  discuss how DOD has addressed risks. To assess these efforts, we  compared these documents and the information from our interviews to  federal internal control standards and the leading practices outlined in  GAO\u2019s Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs (Fraud  Risk Framework). We contacted several government contractors\u2019  associations to gain members\u2019 perspectives on reporting beneficial  ownership information and received feedback from 16 members of three  government contractors\u2019 associations. The perspectives gained from our  queries are not generalizable to all contractors.

In July 2015, GAO issued its Fraud Risk  Framework, which provides a comprehensive set of key components and  leading practices that serve as a guide for agency managers to use when  developing efforts to combat fraud in a strategic, risk-based way. The  Fraud Risk Framework consists of four components to effectively manage  fraud risk: Assess, Design and Implement, Evaluate and Adapt, and  Commit. The Assess component calls for federal managers to plan  regular fraud risk assessments and to assess risks to determine a fraud  risk profile.

For example, in a 2014 federal court case we  examined, a contractor and another company with common ownership  pled guilty to major fraud against the United States. They agreed to pay  $434 million in criminal penalties and to settle a lawsuit in connection with  concealing their relationship with a subcontractor that the contractor  directed to fraudulently mark up costs on items that the contractor  purchased and resold to DOD. Specifically, the contractor purchased  goods from a company that its owners created, controlled, and used to  make the fraudulent markups appear legitimate. Further highlighting the  relationship between the company and the contractor, contractor  personnel were also responsible for hiring individuals to work for the  subcontractor. The contractor billed the government an artificially high  price for the goods from July 2005 through April 2009 and resulted in a  loss to DOD of $48 million. Figure 3 below illustrates this scheme to  conceal ownership and fraudulently inflate prices.", "Billing for work not performed. Contractors or subcontractors can bill  for work not performed by creating fictitious invoices that add costs to a  contract. For example, in four court cases we examined, multiple DOD  subcontractors were actually shell companies that did not have the  inventory they purported to ultimately provide to the government or  perform the work indicated in the contract requirements. According to  documents filed in U.S. district court, some of these subcontractors hired  other companies to perform work, but created additional invoices that  added costs for work the subcontractors did not perform. These additional  costs were then passed on to DOD.", "Disguising conflicts of interest. Contractors or subcontractors can  conceal conflicts of interest for financial benefits. We identified a case  involving a DOD subcontractor that concealed ownership for illicit  financial gain. According to court records, a DOD contractor employee  and his spouse formed a company and concealed their interests by not  listing their names but listing the names of family members on formation  documents. This company became a subcontractor to the company that  employed the DOD contractor. The contractor employee, in his official  position, wrote letters justifying awards of purchase orders to the  subcontractor he owned and approving recommendations that the awards  be made to the subcontractor. The co-owner of the subcontractor  concealed her involvement by signing contracts using a different name,  knowing that the use of her real name could reveal the DOD contractor  employee\u2019s ownership of the subcontractor and affect the awards.", "Creating the appearance of competition on a contract to inflate  prices. In our review of 32 cases, we also identified the potential risk of  companies creating the appearance of competition by submitting bids  from fictitious companies. Specifically, we identified one case that  involved a DOD contractor whose executives admitted as part of their  plea agreements to creating fictitious, inflated bids that were not from  actual businesses to ensure that the contractor\u2019s own bid would be  selected by DOD as the supposed lowest. In this instance, the contractor  was required to obtain at least two competitive bids for certain services  and items and provide the bids to DOD for selection. As part of their plea  agreements, the individuals involved with the scheme also admitted that  the scheme allowed the contractor to control and inflate the prices  charged to DOD without any true, competitive bidding, as required.

As a result, it is unlikely that they  would have affected the price paid by the government in these contracts.  However, these potentially related offerors represent a risk that offerors  may not always be competing independently and these types of  relationships may not always be readily apparent to contracting officers,  which is important when evaluating the sufficiency of competition on a  solicitation and the independence of its offerors.

For example, verifying contractor ownership  can be challenging because state governments determine the type of  information collected during company formation and, as discussed earlier,  most states collect minimal ownership information as part of this process.  As described earlier, there is no centralized information source or registry  on company ownership information in the United States. As a result,  contracting officers could face challenges in time-consuming efforts to  verify contractor ownership. Further, DOD procurement policy officials  stated that workload and resource constraints limit the extent to which  they can verify contractor ownership.", "The nature of ownership information submitted during the SAM  registration process also presents challenges to any verification efforts  conducted by contracting officers. The ownership information submitted in  SAM is self-reported by the prospective contractor, and therefore relies  on the contractor to honestly report such information. DOD officials told  us that, for most procurements, with the exception of those involving  classified work or other national security concerns, this information is not  verified. A related limitation involving SAM ownership information is that  contractors must provide information on the immediate and highest-level  entity owners and are not required to report beneficial-ownership  information, that is, on the natural person or persons who own or control,  or benefit financially from, the company. Lastly, while the SAM ownership  requirement provides some transparency at the prime-contractor level, it  does not provide transparency at the subcontracting levels below the  prime contractor. Subcontractors are not required to register in SAM and,  therefore, are not required to report their ownership. Consequently,  DOD generally does not have insight into the ownership of its  subcontractors. DOD procurement policy officials noted that this poses  particular challenges in identifying fraud and other risks to the supply  chain. For example, the contractor itself may not pose a risk; but that  does not guarantee that the contractor\u2019s suppliers do not pose fraud or  other risks. DOD procurement policy officials told us that it would be  helpful to require subcontractors to register in SAM and report their  ownership. This requirement would be an additional burden on  contractors, however, and would need to be balanced with the potential  benefit of being able to identify problem actors.", "Another challenge involves the use of publicly available ownership  information, including commercially available data services, by  contracting officers to help identify contractor ownership. Depending on  how a company is structured, there may be no publicly available  ownership information. Furthermore, DOD procurement policy officials  told us that public information, including ownership information, could be  inaccurate or outdated and potentially expose the department to bid  protests from the contractor. Therefore, any external or supplemental  information used that was not part of the contractor\u2019s submission would  need to be vetted by the contractor before using it. These officials said  that DOD would need to come up with an efficient process to inform the  prospective contractor of the additional information and provide due  process to allow it the opportunity to refute any information obtained.  Additionally, DOD procurement policy officials noted that another difficulty  with using a commercial tool to determine ownership is the volume of  contracts processed by contracting officials, which amounted to over  570,000 new contracts in fiscal year 2018.", "For sensitive procurements in which DOD has the authority to use both  public and nonpublic information (for example, those involving national  security systems or classified work), DSS officials stated that the process  of identifying and verifying ownership is lengthy, particularly with complex  ownership. In some instances, it has taken DSS 1 to 2 years to resolve  issues that have arisen when clearing contractors\u2019 facilities for access to  classified materials. In addition, DSS officials mentioned that the many  different types of business structures, including new structures that DSS  comes across, create challenges for identifying ownership. According to  DIA officials, it is significantly easier to identify the beneficial owner of  publicly traded companies than privately owned companies. DSS officials  also mentioned that it is difficult and resource-intensive to monitor  changes to contractor ownership, particularly given that they monitor  13,000 facilities.", "According to DOD procurement policy officials, DOD would need to  determine which contracts require additional research into contractor  ownership and which office would be responsible for conducting the  research. Officials noted that DOD does not currently have the resources  in place to focus on these kinds of activities because contracting officers  are already operating in a constrained environment with limited  resources, lacking the time, resources, or training they need to conduct  in-depth reviews or analysis of the ownership aspects of a particular  company. According to these officials, DOD should dedicate staff and  funds to resolve this problem, including bringing in people with data- analysis and data-mining skillsets to learn from private-sector companies  and organizations that already conduct vendor ownership-related risk  assessments and data analytics.", "DOD procurement policy officials identified that another strategy to  address opaque ownership structures would be to require contractors to  report additional ownership information, such as beneficial-ownership  information, when registering to do business with the federal government  in SAM. However, the officials also noted that, previously, both public- sector organizations and private companies have resisted requirements  to provide additional ownership information, due in part to the difficulty in  defining ownership. Additionally, regulatory trends within government  contracting have generally focused on easing the burden to do business  with the government. New requirements to provide additional information  may be viewed as an additional burden.", "A selected group of companies that contracted with DOD in the last 5  years provided us with mixed views on the potential burden of providing  additional ownership information. Most small-business contractors we  contacted told us that an additional beneficial-ownership reporting  requirement would pose little to no further burden on them. In contrast,  both of the large, publicly traded companies that similarly contracted with  DOD expressed concerns about the complexity and difficulty of reporting  their beneficial ownership.

FRDAA also requires  agencies to report their progress identifying risks and vulnerabilities to  fraud affecting payroll, beneficiary payments, grants, purchase and travel  cards, and large contracts. As part of this implementation process, and to  test the development of its fraud risk management program, DOD  conducted a fraud risk management pilot program in 2018 by selecting  four components to identify fraud risks, assess controls they have in place  to mitigate these risks, and develop mitigation plans, as appropriate.

The survey asked components to provide, among  other things, information on any antifraud programs, key fraud risks  identified, and processes for identifying, responding to, and monitoring  risks. The responses from the 41 responding components were scored to  determine their fraud program maturity. According to DOD\u2019s Fraud Risk  Management Pilot Program Instructions, the results of this survey were  also used to identify potential vulnerabilities from the FRDAA  requirements and guide the development of DOD\u2019s pilot program. DOD  officials told us that before the recent development of their fraud risk  management pilot program, the department did not have a process for  assessing fraud risks department-wide.", "Also, as part of the pilot program, OUSD(C) and the components  identified seven fraud schemes that affect large contracts, five of which  we discuss above as having the potential to involve risks posed by  contractor ownership.

As discussed previously in this report,  opaque ownership structures can play a role in carrying out these types of  fraud schemes. DOD completed the pilot program in 2018, and in March  2019 began expanding the fraud risk management program department- wide by requesting that DOD components identify fraud risk and controls  in place to mitigate these risks by July 2019.

Still, getting support at the senior OSD level to  consider the risks posed by contractor ownership and dedicate resources  to mitigating these risks is a challenge, according to these officials. The  challenge exists because senior DOD officials may not be aware of the  potential magnitude or frequency of risks posed by contractor ownership  issues, including the extent to which risks cross multiple areas throughout  the department. Additionally, DOD procurement policy officials told us that  contracting officers do not have anyone within the department to contact  for assistance in determining ownership during the procurement process  and there is no dedicated entity within the department that deals with  contractor ownership issues.", "Federal internal control standards call for agency management officials to  assess the internal and external risks their entities face as they seek to  achieve their objectives.

In a complementary fashion, the Assess  component of GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework calls for federal managers to  plan regular fraud risk assessments and to identify and assess risks to  determine a fraud risk profile, as described in figure 10 below.

This could include a variety of internal and external  stakeholders, such as general counsel, contractors, or other external  entities with knowledge about emerging fraud risks or responsibilities for  specific control activities. For example, the DOD Office of Inspector  General and its work on emerging risks involving contractor ownership  may inform the fraud risk assessment process and help managers to  identify fraud risks. Additionally, an assessment of ownership risks could  include relevant DOD officials responsible for assessing and responding  to national security risks, such as those responsible for assessing supply- chain risks in national security system procurements, vetting vendors to  ensure DOD avoids contracting with the enemy, and determining whether  contractor facilities can be cleared to access classified materials.

Further, conducting a  department-wide assessment of risks posed by contractor ownership  would assist the department in its evaluation of whether its existing  control activities are sufficient and designed to effectively respond to  these risks or whether additional control activities are needed. For  example, it would allow DOD to better determine how contractor  ownership information should be used and verified, and whether  additional ownership information should be collected.

Further, it  would help DOD determine whether additional policies and procedures  are needed to articulate how officials should use and verify the ownership  information it collects, or to require additional ownership information. We  recognize that collecting additional ownership information, including  beneficial-ownership information, could pose compliance burdens for  contractors; and regulatory trends have generally focused on easing the  burden to do business.

These cases were identified by researching press  releases from the websites of the DOJ Office of Public Affairs, Offices of  the U.S. Attorney, DOD Office of Inspector General, and Defense  Criminal Investigative Organizations. We also researched legal databases  and news articles involving DOD contractors to identify federal court  cases and federal agency decisions. We reviewed GAO bid-protest  decisions to identify cases in which a contractor may have failed to  disclose foreign ownership or concealed beneficial-owner information to  obtain contracts that they were not eligible to receive. We interviewed  investigators from the Defense Criminal Investigative Organizations and  DOD contracting offices to supplement our research. For each case  identified, we reviewed the associated federal court filings or DOJ press  releases to determine the outcome of the case and how contractor  ownership was used or concealed to carry out the offense.", "To identify additional types of risks that may not have been identified  through our case-study research, we interviewed officials from the  General Services Administration (GSA) and officials from across DOD,  including the Office of Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative  Organizations, Defense Pricing and Contracting, the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD), the Office of the Chief  Information Officer, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Defense Security  Service (DSS), Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), Defense Contract  Management Agency (DCMA), and Defense Contract Audit Agency, and  relevant procurement policy officials from the Departments of the Army,  Navy, and Air Force. We examined known risks identified through our  case-study research and interviews with DOD officials; however, these  risks are not necessarily representative of the extent or the types of these  risks. There may be additional fraud or other risks and cases related to  contractor ownership that are presently undiscovered fraud and are not  identified in our report.", "Additionally, we further examined the risk that contractors could be  disguising their ownership to create the appearance of competition on a  contract to inflate prices by analyzing bid response data from GSA\u2019s  Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website and registration data in  GSA\u2019s System for Award Management (SAM). Specifically, we analyzed  responses to approximately 2,700 solicitations submitted for fiscal years  2015 through 2017 to identify indications of potentially related offerors  bidding on the same solicitation. We selected this date range because  fiscal year 2015 was the first year in which the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR) required offerors to report their ownership and fiscal  year 2017 was the most-recent complete year of data at the time of our  analysis. To identify whether offerors were potentially related, we  analyzed information to identify instances in which different offerors  shared certain information. Offerors sharing information does not  definitively prove that the offerors are related or share ownership;  however, it is an indicator that these offerors may not be independent of  each other. For offerors we identified as potentially related, we  researched company websites and third-party data sources to determine  whether we could find other indicators of a relationship. Further, we  provided a list of the potentially related offerors we identified to the  relevant DOD contracting office to determine whether the offeror  disclosed any relationships to other offerors or whether the contracting  officer was otherwise aware of the relationship with another offeror. The  results of our analysis are limited to the approximately 2,700 solicitations  we reviewed and are not generalizable to other DOD solicitations.", "To assess the reliability of the data used in our analysis, we performed  electronic testing to determine the validity of specific data elements in the  FBO bid module and other datasets. We also reviewed documentation  related to these databases, compared the data to published sources and  source documentation maintained in the DOD contracting files, and  interviewed GSA officials responsible for these databases. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  analyzing potential ownership relationships.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed federal laws, the FAR,  DOD regulations, directives, instructions, policies, procedures, and  training documents. We also reviewed OUSD(C) fraud assessment  templates and preliminary results from DOD\u2019s fraud risk management  pilot program. We interviewed procurement policy officials from GSA,  Defense Pricing and Contracting, DLA, and the Departments of the Army,  Navy, and Air Force as well as officials from the Office of the Chief  Information Officer, OUSD(C), DIA, DSS, DCMA, the Defense Contract  Audit Agency, the Joint Staff Logistics Directorate, the Defense Industrial  Policy office, members of DOD\u2019s Procurement Fraud Working Group, and  the Naval Contracting Council to discuss how DOD has addressed risks.  We also interviewed officials from the Defense Acquisition University to  determine how, if at all, DOD trained contracting officials to consider risks  posed by contractor ownership. To assess these efforts, we compared  these documents and the information from our interviews to federal  internal control standards and the leading practices outlined in GAO\u2019s  Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs. To gain the  perspectives of contractors on whether a requirement to report beneficial- ownership information when doing business with DOD would impose a  burden on companies, we researched and contacted several government  contractors\u2019 associations to gain the perspectives of their members. The  contractors\u2019 associations we contacted included associations for large,  medium, and small businesses working in a variety of industries doing  business with the government. We received responses to our inquiries  from three associations. To gain their members\u2019 perspectives, officials  from the three associations forwarded our inquiries to their members and  we received responses from 16 members. These 16 members were from  a range of business sizes and industries. The perspectives gained from  our queries are limited to the contractors from whom we received a  response and are not generalizable to all contractors.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2017 to September  2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We subsequently worked  with DOD from September 2019 to November 2019 to prepare this  version of the original sensitive report for public release. This public  version was also prepared in accordance with these standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Summary of GAO Review of Cases Adjudicated or Settled from Calendar Years 2012 through 2018", "paragraphs": ["The table below summarizes the information we reviewed involving  Department of Defense (DOD) contractors or subcontractors that  provided false information about ownership or corporate structure to  allegedly commit fraud. We identified cases involving contractors that  posed financial and nonfinancial risks to DOD (see app. I for additional  details on the methodology used). Financial risks we identified involved  DOD contractors using opaque ownership structures to fraudulently  inflate prices on DOD contracts. We also identified subcontractors that  misrepresented ownership or shared common ownership with a  contractor for the purpose of obtaining awards or overcharging the  government. Nonfinancial risks we identified involved contractors bidding  on and obtaining contracts that they were not eligible to receive, including  contracts set aside for small businesses owned by service-disabled  veterans or socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. We also  identified cases involving ineligible foreign manufacturers creating  domestic shell companies to obtain government contracts.
