In conducting our review, we used our Year 2000 Assessment Guide to assess the Navy\u2019s Year 2000 efforts. This guide addresses common issues affecting most federal agencies and presents a structured approach and provides a checklist to aid in planning, managing, and evaluating Year 2000 programs. The guidance, which is consistent with Defense\u2019s Year 2000 Management Plan and the Navy\u2019s own Year 2000 management approach, describes five phases\u2014supported by program and project management activities\u2014with each phase representing a major Year 2000 program activity or segment. The phases and a description of each follows.", "Awareness - Define the Year 2000 problem and gain executive-level support and sponsorship.

Further, we reviewed available inventory information on the Navy\u2019s mission-critical systems contained in the Defense Integration Support Tools (DIST) database, which the Navy uses to help manage its Year 2000 efforts. In doing so, we determined (1) the number of systems reported to be owned and operated by Navy organizations and (2) the reported status of Navy systems in their Year 2000 efforts.

With this two-digit format, however, the Year 2000 is indistinguishable from 1900, or 2001 from 1901, etc. As a result of this ambiguity, computerized systems and/or application software that use dates to perform calculations, comparisons, or sorting may generate incorrect results when working with years after 1999. In addition, any electronic device that contains a microprocessor or is dependent on a timing sequence may be also vulnerable to Year 2000 problems. This includes computer hardware, telecommunications equipment, building and base security systems, street lights at military installations, elevators, and medical equipment.", "Should Navy computer systems fail, Navy operations at all levels could be impacted by the incorrect processing of data as well as corrupted databases or even massive system failures. In turn, this could result in such problems as delays in supply shipments, faulty inventory forecasts, unreliable budget estimates, and erroneous personnel-related information. Moreover, the problem could adversely impact critical maritime operations such as combat, communications, command and control, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, strategic sealift, and fleet mobilization and readiness.", "Like the other military services, the Navy has adopted DOD\u2019s Year 2000 management strategy, which charges components (that is, program managers and system owners) with responsibility for making sure that all of their systems correctly process dates and gives them the flexibility to implement solutions as they deem appropriate. In December 1995, the Navy designated the Navy Information Systems Management Center with responsibility for (1) coordinating Year 2000 efforts being carried out by its 9 operating forces, including the U.S. Marine Corps, and its 17 shore establishments which include 5 major systems commands, (2) facilitating the sharing of Year 2000 information and best practices departmentwide, and (3) monitoring the Navy\u2019s Year 2000 progress. In August 1997, the Navy transferred this responsibility to its newly established Office of the Department of the Navy Chief Information Officer.

Rather, program managers and system owners have been directed to use previously budgeted funds (that is, primarily operational and maintenance (O&M) funds) or reprogram other programmatic funds to fix Year 2000 problems.

These reviews are attended by representatives from the Secretary of the Navy, the CIO office, and the major Navy and Marine Corps commands and activities. Since May 1998, the Navy CIO office has been holding weekly briefings with the commands. In April 1997, it adopted and implemented DOD\u2019s compliance checklist to assist system managers in ensuring that their systems are compliant for the Year 2000. The checklist focuses on (1) identification of systems and interfaces, (2) assessment of date usage by the systems, and (3) compliance testing, among other subjects. In August 1997, it identified Year 2000 as its highest priority behind life-threatening or mission failure repairs and instructed components to put a higher priority on funding remediation efforts than on other information technology initiatives. In December 1997, it tasked the Navy Inspector General to assess Year 2000 readiness at its commands. The IG plans to report on its assessment of 12 commands in April.

In addition, it did not issue an approved Year 2000 program management plan until January 1998. Our guide recommends that this be done early in the assessment phase. Further, it is still assessing whether corrective actions are needed for other equipment such as computer hardware, communications equipment, and security systems.

Because the Navy has spent about 60 percent of the time available completing the first two phases, it will be difficult to complete the more complex and time-consuming tasks of renovating, testing, and implementing its systems in the time remaining.", "Navy officials acknowledge that the assessment phase is taking longer than expected. They attribute this delay to difficulties associated with developing a complete systems inventory and the lack of skilled field people to perform Year 2000 tasks.

For example, during our review, the Navy had assigned only five full-time personnel in the office of the CIO to oversee and monitor the Year 2000 progress of more than 2,000 systems and 300,000 personal computers and servers owned by five major systems commands, 17 shore establishments, and 9 operating forces, including the U.S. Marine Corps. By contrast, the Air Force assigned 27 staff to the Year 2000 problem\u20143 to oversee and implement program and policy changes across the service and 24 to execute the program. According to Navy CIO officials, the office had not managed Year 2000 remediation efforts effectively, and most of the staff\u2019s time had been spent reporting the status of component efforts to top managers in the Navy, DOD, and external entities, such as the CIO Council and OMB.

In constructing the inventory of information systems, it is important to assess the potential impact on business processes if systems are not fixed on time, to estimate the cost of remediation, and to monitor the progress components are making toward correcting their systems. This provides the necessary foundation for Year 2000 program planning. The Navy, however, does not yet have a complete and accurate inventory or reliable status and cost information. As a result, it does not have a clear picture of its Year 2000 remediation efforts and it cannot reliably prioritize systems for correction, determine what resources it needs, or identify problems that require greater management attention.", "Until recently, the Navy\u2019s primary source of Year 2000 system inventory information was the Defense-wide database of automated systems, known as the Defense Integration Support Tools (DIST) database. The Navy was using this database to help oversee its Year 2000 efforts and prepare its quarterly status reports to the Department of Defense, which, in turn, submits the information to the Office of Management and Budget.", "In February 1998, due to concerns that extensive and detailed information on all of the Department\u2019s mission-critical systems was available on the Internet, ASD/C3I removed DIST from the Internet and classified it as \u201csecret\u201d\u2014meaning that it can only be accessed by personnel with a valid security clearance, job-related \u201cneed-to-know,\u201d and access to secure computer and communications equipment.

According to the CIO office, the secret classification given DIST has \u201cgravely hindered\u201d its ability to manage the Year 2000 effort.", "The Navy plans to resolve this problem by creating a separate unclassified Year 2000 database and making it available by June 1998. As the Navy implements this new database, it will be important for it to correct the data problems we identified in our discussions with command and headquarters officials as well as in our review of selected information from DIST on the Navy\u2019s mission-critical systems provided to us by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) database administrator. These problems include the following.", "Of 819 mission-critical systems in the database, 6 systems failed to identify which stage of remediation they were in, 23 did not provide the name of the system or describe its function, and 118 failed to show an expected compliance date. In providing the data, DISA did not include cost information because the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence concluded that the data were unreliable. For example, ASD/C3I noted that in some cost estimates, the decimal point was misplaced, overstating some estimates by millions of dollars.", "Our discussions with headquarters and command officials further revealed that the cost estimate was incomplete. For example, NAVSEA officials told us that the Navy was missing cost information for about 95 percent of NAVSEA\u2019s 138 major acquisition programs. NAVAIR also indicated that many of its system managers were not reporting costs.", "The reliability of cost information is also questionable because some Navy components are still using a cost formula derived from the Gartner Group and the Mitre Corporation, which recommends multiplying the number of lines of code by $1.10 for automated information systems and by $8 for weapons systems. Defense recommended that components use this formula early in their Year 2000 efforts, but it also recommended that a more detailed cost analysis based on more than 30 cost factors be conducted as components progressed through the assessment phase and learned more about their systems and the resources that would be required to fix them. The difference between the Gartner/Mitre formula and a more reliable analysis of data collected during the assessment phase can be significant. For example, based on the Gartner/Mitre formula, the Navy estimated that it would cost $4.3 million to correct a mission-critical ordnance management system. Based on a detailed cost analysis of data collected during its assessment, the Navy estimated that remediation costs would actually be about $1.75 million\u2014a 59 percent decrease over the original estimate.", "In addition, as the new database is implemented, it will be important for the Navy to routinely validate the information submitted by its components.

First, even if the Navy\u2019s mission-critical systems are replaced or renovated in time, there is no guarantee that they will operate correctly. Second, the risk of Year 2000 failures is not limited to the Navy\u2019s internal systems. In fact, the Navy depends on information and data provided by other Defense and federal agencies, international organizations, and private contractors whose systems can introduce Year 2000 problems into Navy\u2019s systems.

While the Navy has taken a number of actions to address this issue, many critical tasks remain to be done in a relatively short period. At this point, the Navy does not know whether it has identified all systems and interfaces; it lacks reliable data on the status and cost of remediation efforts; and it does not know if it has the capacity to handle the demanding task of testing systems, networks, operating platforms, and databases.

The Navy also stated that it has increased staff in its Year 2000 Coordination Office to 10 full-time employees to help carry out these activities.", "In addition, the Navy noted that its new Year 2000 database, which is expected to be on-line in June 1998, will include additional data elements not contained in DIST, such as actual and programmed costs, planned and actual dates that memorandums of agreements are signed with interface partners, the dates that test plans are prepared, and the status of testing activities. As part of the validation process, the CIO Office plans to conduct weekly reviews of the data for completeness and accuracy. The Navy also stated that, in addition to requiring that contingency plans be prepared on the continuity of business operations and to ensure mission capability at the user level, it is now requiring contingency plans to be prepared for all\u2014rather than a select few\u2014mission-critical systems no later than December 1998.", "This report contains recommendations to you.
