The extent of financial risks to the federal government from the Deepwater Horizon is closely tied to BP and the other responsible parties. BP established a $20 billion Trust to pay for individual and business claims and other expenses. As of May 31, 2011, BP has paid over $700 million of federal and state government costs for oil spill cleanup. Federal agency cleanup and restoration activities are under way and agencies continue to incur costs and submit them for reimbursement. However, the full extent of these costs, particularly those related to environmental cleanup, may not be fully realized for some time. As cleanup costs continue to mount, it is possible that expenditures from the Fund will reach the $1 billion total expenditure per incident cap. Expenditures were over $626 million on May 31, 2011. If these amounts reach the total expenditure cap of $1 billion, the Fund can no longer be used to make payments to reimburse agencies' costs (or to pay valid individual or business claims if not paid by the responsible parties). At that point, government agencies would no longer be able to obtain reimbursement for their costs. In November 2010, GAO suggested that Congress may want to consider setting a Fund per incident cap based on net expenditures (expenditures less reimbursement), rather than total expenditures. Finally, GAO found the federal government's longer-term ability to provide financial support in response to future oil spills is also at risk because the Fund's primary source of revenue, a tax on petroleum products, is scheduled to expire in 2017. GAO's testing of the Coast Guard's internal controls over Deepwater Horizon claims processed and cost reimbursements processed and paid showed that adjudicated claims processed and costs reimbursed were appropriate and properly documented. In November 2010, GAO made four recommendations regarding establishing and maintaining effective cost reimbursement policies and procedures for the Fund. The Coast Guard changed its operating practices to reflect lessons learned from the initial response to the Deepwater Horizon incident, and it has updated its cost reimbursement procedures accordingly. However, the Coast Guard has not yet updated its procedures for processing significant claims, so lessons learned from its experiences processing Deepwater Horizon claims could be lost. The federal government has used a variety of approaches to oversee BP's and GCCF's cost reimbursement and claims processing. Soon after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the federal government established a Deepwater Integrated Services Team (IST), which was initially responsible for monitoring BP's claims process, among other things. Subsequently, the oversight of cost reimbursement and claims activities transitioned to the Department of Justice, which continues to lead this and other efforts. In addition, the Department of the Interior and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are serving as the federal government's representatives for the natural resource trustees in evaluating the environmental impact of the Deepwater Horizon spill and selecting and implementing restoration projects to be funded by BP. GAO is (1) reiterating that Congress may want to consider setting a Fund cap per incident based upon net expenditures, (2) presenting a new matter concerning extending the barrel tax used to finance federal oil spill responses to sustain program funding, and (3) making a recommendation to improve procedures for future significant spills. In responding, the Department of Homeland Security concurred with the recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The explosion on the BP America Production Company\u2019s (BP) leased  Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010 resulted  in one of the largest environmental disasters in U.S. history. Along with  the devastating environmental impact, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill  affected the livelihoods of thousands of Gulf Coast citizens and  businesses. The total costs to clean up this unprecedented spill, ease the  economic suffering of affected parties in the region, and assess and  mitigate its eventual environmental impact remain unknown but have  been estimated in the tens of billions of dollars.", "The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (OPA), which was enacted  after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, established a \u201cpolluter pays\u201d  system that places the primary burden of liability for costs of spills up to a  statutory maximum, on the responsible parties\u2014BP and several other  companies in this case. However, responsible parties are liable without  limit if the oil discharge is the result of gross negligence or willful  misconduct, or a violation of federal operation, safety, and construction  regulations. OPA provides the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (Fund) to pay  for oil spill costs when the responsible party cannot or does not pay. The  Fund is administered by the Coast Guard through its National Pollution  Funds Center (NPFC), is primarily financed through a tax on petroleum  products, and is subject to a $1 billion cap on the amount of expenditures  from the Fund per incident. NPFC administers the Fund by disbursing  funds to government agencies to reimburse them for their oil spill cleanup  costs (cost reimbursements), monitoring the sources and uses of funds,  adjudicating claims submitted by individuals and businesses to the Fund  for payment (claims), and pursuing reimbursement from the responsible  party for costs and damages paid from the Fund (billing the responsible  party).", "In the case of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, BP, as well as others, have  been identified as responsible parties. In this capacity, BP established  multiple claims centers along the Gulf Coast to receive and process  individuals\u2019 and businesses\u2019 damage claims; on May 3, 2010, BP began  paying emergency compensation to them. In June 2010, as part of an oral  agreement between the Obama Administration and BP, BP established a  new claims processing facility, the Gulf Coast Claims Facility (GCCF).  GCCF, administered by Kenneth Feinberg, began operations on August  23, 2010, and is responsible for handling claims from individuals and  businesses for damages resulting from the spill. BP also established an  irrevocable trust in August 2010\u2014primarily to pay claims approved by  GCCF among other purposes\u2014and pledged to incrementally provide a  total of $20 billion to the trust by 2014.", "Shortly after the April 20, 2010 explosion, members of Congress  requested that we (1) identify the financial risks to the federal government  resulting from oil spills, particularly Deepwater Horizon, (2) assess  NPFC\u2019s internal controls for ensuring that processes and payments for  cost reimbursements and processes for claims related to the Deepwater  Horizon spill were appropriate, and (3) describe the extent to which the  federal government oversees the BP and GCCF Deepwater Horizon oil  spill-related claims processes.", "This report is the third and final in a series of reports related to these  objectives. In November 2010, we provided our preliminary assessment  of the financial risks and the cost reimbursement and notification policies  and procedures associated with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. We  expressed the view that Congress should consider changing the  calculation of expenditures made against the Fund\u2019s $1 billion per  incident expenditure cap to take into account reimbursements from  responsible parties. We also made four recommendations to NPFC  directed at helping NPFC establish and maintain effective cost  reimbursement policies and procedures for the Fund and update NPFC\u2019s  current policies to reflect current organization, structure, and  management directives. (See appendix I for the specific  recommendations and their status.) In April 2011, we provided updated  information on the financial risks to the federal government associated  with the Fund\u2019s cap on total, rather than net, expenditures, as well as  claims submitted to and reviewed by NPFC and GCCF. This final report  provides an update on the issues and risks to the federal government, the  results of our testing of NPFC\u2019s internal controls over the processes and  payments for cost reimbursement and the claims process, and an  overview of the federal government\u2019s oversight of BP and GCCF\u2019s claims  processes.", "As part of our analysis of financial risks to the federal government and the  Fund, we identified and analyzed applicable laws and regulations to  determine statutory and regulatory limitations on the liability of  responsible parties that may pose financial risks to the Fund and federal  government. As one of OPA\u2019s goals is to make the environment and  public whole for injuries to natural resources resulting from an oil spill, we  reviewed applicable guidance, regulations, and NPFC annual reports to  gain an understanding of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment  process. These processes involve determining the type and amount of  restoration needed to compensate the public for harm to natural  resources as a result of an oil spill, and the length of time these  assessments may take to complete. In addition, we reviewed publicly  available quarterly financial information of responsible parties through  June 2011 to gain an understanding of the extent to which these  companies reported contingent liabilities. To determine the amounts  obligated and actual costs incurred in relation to the Fund\u2019s $1 billion per  incident cap, we obtained and analyzed daily financial summary data  NPFC uses to track costs for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. We obtained  invoices NPFC sent to the responsible parties to reimburse the Fund,  analyzed the requests for reimbursements submitted by federal and state  agencies, and compared the invoiced amounts to the amounts federal  and state agencies had submitted for payment from the Fund.", "To assess the extent to which NPFC\u2019s internal controls ensured that cost  reimbursements were appropriate, we tested a statistical sample of  payments made to federal and state agencies between April 2010 and  April 2011 for Deepwater Horizon removal and response activities for  compliance with NPFC\u2019s policies and procedures. In addition, while NPFC  had not made any payments in response to claims from individuals and  businesses submitted as of April 30, 2011, we tested a statistical sample  of Deepwater Horizon final claim determinations\u2014all denials or withdrawn  by the claimant\u2014that had been made by NPFC officials for compliance  with NPFC\u2019s policies and procedures to implement OPA requirements.  We also obtained information on NPFC\u2019s claims contingency planning for  handling a potentially large number of claims related to the Deepwater  Horizon oil spill. In order to update information about claims submitted  and reviewed by NPFC and GCCF, we used available NPFC and GCCF  claims data through May 31, 2011.", "To provide an overview of the extent to which the federal government  oversees the BP and the GCCF claims processes, we interviewed agency  officials about oversight of BP\u2019s claims process. Specifically, we  interviewed Department of Justice (Justice) officials who worked with BP  to establish the GCCF and its claims processes, among other things. We  also interviewed NPFC officials who monitor GCCF\u2019s actions to approve  and deny claims from individuals and businesses. We interviewed Justice  and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) officials about any plans to  pursue payment from the responsible parties for federal government  costs for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill that are not reimbursed through  an intragovernmental agency agreement. Appendix II provides additional  details on our scope and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2010 to October 2011, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Legal Framework Establishing Responsibilities to Pay Oil Spill Costs and Claims", "paragraphs": ["The legal framework for addressing and paying for maritime oil spills is  identified in OPA, which was enacted after the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill.  OPA places the primary burden of liability and the costs of oil spills on the  owner and operator of the vessel or on shore facility and the lessee or  permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. This \u201cpolluter  pays\u201d framework requires that the responsible party or parties assume the  burden of spill response, natural resource restoration, and compensation  to those damaged by the spill, up to a specified limit of liability. In general,  the level of potential exposure under OPA depends on the kind of vessel  or facility from which a spill originates and is limited in amount unless the  oil discharge is the result of gross negligence or willful misconduct, or a  violation of federal operation, safety, and construction regulations, in  which case liability under OPA is unlimited. For oil spills from an offshore  facility, such as the Deepwater Horizon, liability is limited to all removal\u2014 or cleanup\u2014costs plus $75 million.", "Under OPA, before any vessel larger than 300 gross tons can operate in  U.S. waters, the owner/operator must obtain a Certificate of Financial  Responsibility (COFR) from NPFC. This COFR demonstrates that the  owner/operator has provided evidence of financial responsibility to pay for  removal costs and damages up to the liability limits required by OPA.  These OPA requirements for demonstrating financial responsibility apply  only to the statutory maximum amount of potential liability under OPA,  although states may impose additional liabilities and requirements related  to oil spills in state waters.", "OPA requires that, subject to certain exceptions, such as removal cost  claims by states, all nonfederal claims for OPA-compensable removal or  damages be submitted first to the responsible party or the responsible  party\u2019s guarantor. If the responsible party denies a claim or does not  settle it within 90 days, a claimant may present the claim to the federal  government to be considered for payment. To pay specified claims  above a responsible party\u2019s liability limit, as well as to pay claims when a  responsible party does not pay or cannot be identified, OPA authorizes  use of the Fund subject to limitations on the amount and types of costs.  For example, under OPA, the authorized limit on Fund expenditures for a  single spill is currently set at $1 billion (without consideration of whether  the Fund was reimbursed for any expenditures). In addition to paying  claims, the Fund is used to reimburse government agencies for certain  eligible costs they incur. Further, within the $1 billion cap, the costs for  conducting a natural resource damage assessment and claims paid in  connection with any single incident shall not exceed $500 million. OPA  provides that the President designate the federal officials and that the  governors designate the state and local officials who act on behalf of the  public as trustees for natural resources. OPA regulations provide that  the trustees may recover costs for natural resource damage assessment  and restoration. The Fund may not be used for certain types of personal  injuries or damages that may arise related to an oil spill incident, such as  financial losses associated with oil company investments by members of  the public. Recovery for such damages and injuries may be governed by  other federal statutes, common law, or various state laws.", "Federal agencies are authorized to use the Fund to cover their oil  removal costs from the affected areas to the extent the Fund has funds  available within the $1 billion cap. The federal government is entitled to  reimbursement from responsible parties for such costs.", "The Coast Guard\u2019s NPFC administers uses of the Fund to reimburse  government agencies for their removal and cleanup costs; adjudicating  individual and business claims submitted to the Fund for payment; and  pursuing reimbursement from the responsible party for costs and claims  paid by the Fund. NPFC bills the responsible parties directly, including BP  in this case, for costs government agencies have incurred, and all  payments received from responsible parties are deposited into the Fund.", "OPA defines the costs for which responsible parties are liable and for  which the Fund is made available for compensation in the event that the  responsible party does not pay, cannot pay, or is not identified. As  described in greater detail in appendix V, \u201cOPA compensable\u201d costs  include two main types:  \uf0b7  Removal Costs: Removal costs are incurred by the federal  government or any other entity taking approved action to respond to,  contain, and clean up the spill. For example, removal costs include  cleaning up adjoining shoreline affected by the oil spill and the  equipment used in the response\u2014skimmers to pull oil from the water,  booms to contain the oil, planes for aerial observation\u2014as well as  salaries, travel, and lodging costs for responders.  \uf0b7  Damages: OPA-compensable damages cover a wide range of both  actual and potential adverse impacts from an oil spill. For example,  damages from an oil spill include the loss of profits to the owner of a  commercial charter boat if the boat was trapped in port because the  Coast Guard closed the waterway in order to remove the oil, or  personal property damage to the owner of a recreational boat or  waterfront property that was oiled by the spill, for which a claim may  be made first to the responsible party, if possible, or to the Fund.", "In addition to OPA-compensable costs, the federal government can also  incur other non OPA-compensable costs associated with oil spills. For  example, the federal government had various non-OPA-compensable  costs for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, such as Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) costs associated with providing additional staff  to NPFC for receiving and processing claims."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Four Operational Response Phases for Oil Removal", "paragraphs": ["The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan,  more commonly called the National Contingency Plan is the federal  government\u2019s blueprint for responding to oil spill and hazardous  substance releases. The National Contingency Plan provides the  organizational structure and procedures for preparing for and responding  to discharges of oil and releases of hazardous substances, pollutants,  and contaminants. The plan outlines approved procedures and removal  activities when responding to an oil spill and identifies the following four  phases of response operations for oil discharges:  1.  Discovery and Notification include activities conducted to discover oil  spills or to notify appropriate authorities of oil spills.  2.  Preliminary Assessment and Initiation of Action include activities  conducted to assess the magnitude and severity of the spill and to  assess the feasibility of removal and plan appropriate actions.

In fiscal year 2009, the barrel tax was 92 percent  of the Fund\u2019s revenue. As shown in figure 1, the Fund\u2019s balance has  varied over the years. The barrel tax expired in December 1994 and was  reinstituted at 5 cents per barrel in April 2006 as mandated by the Energy  Policy Act of 2005. The Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008  increased the tax to 8 cents per barrel and provides that the Fund\u2019s barrel  tax shall expire after December 31, 2017.", "In fiscal year 2011, the increase to the Fund is primarily attributable to  reimbursements received from responsible parties for the Coast Guard\u2019s  costs incurred in response to the Deepwater Horizon incident.  Specifically, as of May 31, 2011, the Coast Guard has billed and received  from responsible parties, $315.3 million for Coast Guard recoverable, or  indirect costs, such as personnel and equipment. According to the  agency, the Coast Guard has historically viewed its OPA recoverable  costs as activities normally funded through the agency\u2019s operating  expense appropriation, and thus it has not sought reimbursement for  these costs from the Fund.", "As shown in figure 2, the Fund has been administratively divided into two  major components\u2014the Emergency Fund and the Principal Fund\u2014 administered by the Coast Guard\u2019s NPFC. The Emergency Fund  authorizes the President to make available $50 million each year to cover  immediate expenses associated with mitigating the threat of an oil spill,  costs of oil spill containment, countermeasures, and cleanup and disposal  activities, as well as paying for other costs to initiate natural resource  damage assessments. Amounts made available remain available until  expended. For the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the Coast Guard\u2019s Federal  On-Scene Coordinator used the Emergency Fund to pay for oil spill  removal activities (i.e., the equipment used in removal activities and for  the proper disposal of recovered oil and oil debris), and the Federal  Natural Resource Damage Trustees also entered into reimbursable  agreements with NPFC with respect to funding for activities to initiate  natural resource damage assessments. To the extent that available  amounts are inadequate for an emergency (as was the case in the  Deepwater Horizon oil spill), the Maritime Transportation Security Act of  2002 granted authority for the Coast Guard to advance up to $100 million  to pay for oil spill removal activities, and that amount was advanced from  the Principal Fund to the Emergency Fund.", "In June 2010, Congress amended OPA to authorize emergency  advances for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in increments of up to $100  million for each cash advance, but the total amount of all advances may  not exceed the $1 billion per incident cap. In contrast to the Emergency  Fund, the Principal Fund is to be used to provide funds for natural  resource damage claims, loss of profits and earning capacity claims,  and loss of government revenues. The Principal Fund also provides for  certain agency appropriations including the Coast Guard, Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA), and the Department of the Interior (DOI)\u2014each  of which receives an annual appropriation from the Fund through the  Principal Fund to cover administrative, operational, personnel, and  enforcement costs.", "Consistent with its Fund management responsibilities, in response to the  Deepwater Horizon oil spill, NPFC is responsible for billing the  responsible parties, including BP, directly for costs that government  agencies have incurred.

The PRFA  commits the Fund to reimburse costs incurred for agreed-upon pollution  response activities undertaken by a federal agency assisting the Federal  On-Scene Coordinator. The terms of a PRFA include relevant                 (1) personnel salary costs, (2) travel and per diem expenses, (3) charges  for the use of agency-owned equipment or facilities, and (4) expenses for  contractor or vendor-supplied goods or services obtained by the agency  for removal assistance. Similarly, the Federal On-Scene Coordinator may  issue a MIPR for agreed-upon activities of the Department of Defense  (DOD) or its related components and for some other agencies\u2019 activities.  In contrast to PRFAs, MIPRs generally commit the Fund to disburse  funds for oil spill response activities prior to conducting the activity and  incurring the related costs.

Although all  uncertainties\u2014and the associated expenses\u2014may not be known for  many years, some uncertainties that are known relate to the following  issues.  \uf0b7  The federal government has begun an extensive natural resource  damage assessment process, but the associated costs have yet to be  determined. In order to start the process, in May 2010, BP agreed to  provide $10 million to DOI and $10 million to the National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the Department of  Commerce. Also, in April 2011, BP committed up to $1 billion from the  Trust to projects to help restore damaged natural resources in the  Gulf of Mexico, such as the rebuilding of costal marshes,  replenishment of damaged beaches, conservation of sensitive areas  for ocean habitat for injured wildlife, and restoration of barrier islands  and wetlands that provide natural protection from storms. The natural  resource damage assessment and restoration process will take years  to complete, so the full costs for which BP and the other responsible  parties are liable have yet to be determined. The National  Commission on BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling  report estimates that fully restoring the Gulf will take $15 billion to    $20 billion and over 30 years. If the responsible parties are unable  or unwilling to pay, then the agencies\u2019 costs for the natural resource  damages, including the costs to assess and restore, rehabilitate,  replace, or acquire equivalent natural resources, would need to be  reimbursed from the Fund (provided that funds were still available,  given the $1 billion per incident cap).  \uf0b7  The responsible parties also are likely to face fines and penalties  which have yet to be determined and which will be levied by federal  and state governments. In particular, under the Clean Water Act,  liable parties face substantial administrative and civil penalties that  may be imposed by EPA or DHS. According to the BP Oil Spill  Commission Report, the maximum Clean Water Act civil penalties  could range from $4.5 billion to $21 billion.  \uf0b7  BP and the other responsible parties face over 500 lawsuits from the  federal government, states, investors, employees, businesses, and  individuals. The extent to which these lawsuits will impact the  responsible parties financially is uncertain at this time since they will  take years to litigate. BP has stated that it may use the Trust to pay  lawsuit settlements as well as for paying claims and for natural  resource damages.  Justice is continuing to evaluate federal government costs incurred  related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill that are not OPA- compensable. On May 13, 2011, Justice sent the responsible parties  an invoice requesting reimbursement to the federal government for  $81.6 million (for agencies\u2019 costs incurred through December 2010).", "Although BP has stated that it will pay expenses over the $20 billion, if  necessary, it is uncertain how this would be accomplished over time, thus  posing an element of risk to the federal government. In addition, although  MOEX and its affiliates have settled with BP by paying $1.065 billion and  Anadarko settled with BP which included a payment of $4 billion, other  responsible parties have not reached a settlement.

A provision of The Energy Improvement  and Extension Act of 2008 mandates that the Fund\u2019s primary source  of revenue, a per barrel tax, is set to expire on December 31, 2017.  Therefore, even with substantial amounts reimbursed by BP, the Fund  balance would likely decrease as a result of the expiration of its  primary source of funding and the expectation of future Deepwater  Horizon costs. This could raise the risk that the Fund would not be  adequately equipped to deal with future spills, particularly one of this  magnitude, and it will be important for Congress to determine a  funding mechanism for the Fund going forward. The two other  sources of revenue are cost recoveries from responsible parties and  interest on the Fund principal from U.S. Treasury investments. As  we reported in September 2007, the balance of the Fund generally  declined from 1995 to 2006 mostly because the per barrel tax expired  in December 1994 and revenue was not collected from January 1995  to March 2006.  \uf0b7  The potential need to fund the response to future spills poses risks.", "The possibility of needing to respond to another spill of national  significance increases the risk to the Fund and the federal  government.

We obtained and  reviewed letters sent by Justice to the GCCF highlighting concerns about  its pace for processing claims, need for transparency, and compliance  with OPA standards. In addition, we interviewed Deepwater Integrated  Services Team (IST) officials about their coordination activities regarding  the BP and GCCF claims process and social services coordination  efforts. The IST which was established in June 2010 and stood down in  September 2010, took steps to raise awareness of concerns related to  claim payment policy clarity, data access and reporting of overall claims  information, and the coordination of federal/state benefits and services to  avoid duplicate payments. We reviewed documentation from the  Deepwater IST including its coordination plan, team updates, and  transition plan. We did not evaluate the effectiveness of the monitoring  and oversight efforts by Justice and the Deepwater IST. Furthermore, we  reviewed publicly available claim reports from BP and GCCF for claim  amounts paid, but we did not test the claims data or amounts reported by  BP or GCCF.

For a Level I incident, agencies submit  documentation to the Federal On-Scene Coordinator at the completion of  removal activities. Level II (Moderately Complex) represents about 10 to  15 percent of all oil spill incidents, in which total removal costs to the  government are not expected to exceed $200,000. Level II removal  activities take place in multiple locations, require the involvement of  several external resources (i.e., state agencies and other government  units), and removal activities take longer than 2 weeks to complete. Level  III (Significantly Complex) represents less than 5 percent of all oil spill  incidents with total removal costs greater than $200,000. Level III removal  activities take place in multiple locations, require the involvement of  numerous contractors, and similar to Level II, the assistance of several  external resources is needed. For both Level II and III incidents,  documentation is submitted to the Federal On-Scene Coordinator as  often as practical (daily if possible) until final removal activities are  completed.
