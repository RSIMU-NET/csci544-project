The Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), the federal agency that administers the national regulatory program to ensure safe pipeline transportation, has been undertaking a broad range of activities to make pipeline transportation safer. However, the number of serious accidents--those involving deaths, injuries, and property damage of $50,000 or more--has not fallen. When safety problems are found, OPS can take enforcement action against pipeline operators, including requiring the correction of safety violations and assessing monetary sanctions (civil penalties). This testimony is based on ongoing work for the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and for other committees, as required by the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002.

Without these key elements, the agency cannot determine whether recent and planned changes in its strategy will have the desired effects on pipeline safety. Over the past several years, OPS has focused primarily on other efforts--such as developing a new risk-based regulatory approach--that it believes will change the safety culture of the industry. OPS has also became more aggressive in enforcing its regulations and now plans to further strengthen the management of its enforcement program. In particular, OPS is developing an enforcement policy that will help define its enforcement strategy and has taken initial steps toward identifying new performance measures. However, OPS does not plan to finalize the policy until 2005 and has not adopted key practices for achieving successful performance measurement systems, such as linking measures to goals. OPS increased both the number and the size of the civil penalties it assessed against pipeline operators over the last 4 years (2000-2003) following a decision to be \"tough but fair\" in assessing penalties. OPS assessed an average of 22 penalties per year during this period, compared with an average of 14 per year for the previous 5 years (1995-1999), a period of more lenient \"partnering\" with industry. In addition, the average penalty increased from $18,000 to $29,000 over the two periods. About 94 percent of the 216 penalties levied from 1994 through 2003 have been paid. The civil penalty is one of several actions OPS can take when it finds a violation, and these penalties represent about 14 percent of all enforcement actions over the past 10 years. While OPS has increased the number and the size of its civil penalties, stakeholders--including industry, state, and insurance company officials and public advocacy groups--expressed differing views on whether these penalties deter noncompliance with safety regulations. Some, such as pipeline operators, thought that any penalty was a deterrent if it kept the pipeline operator in the public eye, while others, such as safety advocates, told us that the penalties were too small to be effective sanctions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We appreciate the opportunity to participate in this hearing on progress  made by the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) in implementing the  provisions of the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. The act  strengthens federal pipeline safety programs, state oversight of pipeline  operators, and public education on pipeline safety. My remarks center on  work, required by the act, that we have almost completed on the  effectiveness of OPS\u2019s enforcement strategy and its use of monetary  sanctions (civil penalties) when safety problems are found. The act also  requires that we report in 2006 on OPS\u2019s implementation of its risk-based  safety program, called integrity management, and on a requirement that  operators assess their facilities every 7 years for safety risks. We expect to  begin work on these two topics next year.", "OPS has been taking many steps to make pipeline transportation safer. A  cornerstone to OPS\u2019s efforts over the past several years has been the  agency\u2019s development and implementation of a risk-based approach that it  believes will fundamentally improve the safety of pipeline transportation.  This approach, called integrity management, requires interstate pipeline  operators to identify and fix safety-related threats to their pipelines in  areas where an accident could have the greatest consequences. OPS  believes that this approach has more potential to improve safety than its  traditional approach, which focused on enforcing compliance with safety  standards regardless of the threat to pipeline safety. Officials have  emphasized that integrity management, coupled with other initiatives,  such as oversight of operators\u2019 programs to qualify employees to operate  their pipelines, represents a systematic approach to overseeing and  improving pipeline safety that will change the safety culture of the  industry and drive down the number of accidents.", "Now that its integrity management approach and other initiatives are  substantially under way, OPS recognizes that it needs to turn its attention  to the management of its enforcement program. Accordingly, my  testimony today focuses on opportunities for improving aspects of OPS\u2019s  enforcement program that should be useful to OPS as it decides how to  proceed and to this subcommittee as it continues to exercise oversight.", "My statement is based on the preliminary results of our ongoing work for  the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and for others. As  directed by the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, we have been (1)  evaluating the effectiveness of OPS\u2019s enforcement strategy and (2)  examining OPS\u2019s assessment of monetary sanctions (called civil penalties)  against interstate pipeline operators that violate federal pipeline safety  rules. We expect to report on the results of our work on these and other  issues in the next few days.", "Our work is based on our review of laws, regulations, program guidance,  and discussions with OPS officials and a broad range of stakeholders. To  evaluate the effectiveness of OPS\u2019s enforcement strategy, we determined  the extent to which the agency\u2019s strategy incorporates three key elements  of effective program management: clear program goals, a well-defined  strategy for achieving goals, and measures of performance that are linked  to program goals. We also examined how OPS proposed and assessed civil  penalties from 1994 through 2003 and the extent to which pipeline  operators have paid them. Finally, we interviewed stakeholders on  whether OPS\u2019s civil penalties help deter safety violations. As part of our  work, we assessed internal controls and the reliability of the data elements  needed for this engagement, and we determined that the data elements,  with one exception, were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We  performed our work in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.", "The effectiveness of OPS\u2019s enforcement strategy cannot be evaluated  because the agency has not incorporated three key elements of effective  program management\u2014clear program goals, a well-defined strategy for  achieving those goals, and measures of performance that are linked to the  program goals. Without these three key elements, OPS cannot determine  whether recent and planned changes in its enforcement strategy are  having or will have the desired effects on pipeline safety. Under a more  aggressive enforcement strategy (termed \u201ctough but fair\u201d) that OPS  initiated in 2000, the agency is using the full range of its enforcement tools,  rather than relying primarily as it did before on more lenient  administrative actions, such as warning letters. However, OPS has not  established goals that specify the intended results of this new strategy,  developed a policy that describes the strategy and the strategy\u2019s  contribution to pipeline safety, or put measures in place that would allow  OPS to determine and demonstrate the effects of this strategy on pipeline  safety. OPS is developing an enforcement policy that will help define its  enforcement strategy and has taken some initial steps toward identifying  new measures of enforcement performance. However, it does not  anticipate finalizing this policy until sometime in 2005 and has not adopted  key practices for achieving successful performance measurement systems,  such as linking measures to program goals.", "OPS increased both the number and the size of the civil penalties it  assessed in response to criticism that its enforcement activities were weak  and ineffective. For example, from 2000 through 2003, following its  decision to be tough but fair in assessing civil penalties, OPS assessed an  average 22 penalties per year, compared with an average of 14 penalties  per year from 1995 through 1999, when OPS\u2019s policy was to \u201cpartner\u201d with  industry, rather than primarily to enforce compliance. In addition, from  2000 through 2003, OPS assessed an average civil penalty of about $29,000,  compared with an average of $18,000 from 1995 through 1999.  Departmental data show that operators have paid 94 percent (202 of 216)  of the civil penalties issued over the past 10 years. OPS assessed the  penalty that it proposed 69 percent of the time (150 of 216 civil penalties).  For the remaining 66 penalties, OPS reduced the assessments by about 37  percent\u2014from a total of about $2.8 million to about $1.7 million. OPS\u2019s  database does not provide summary information on why penalties are  reduced. As a result, we are not able to provide information on the most  common reasons why penalties were reduced. Civil penalties are one of  several enforcement actions that OPS can take to increase compliance and  represent about 14 percent of all enforcement actions taken over the past  10 years. Although OPS has increased both the number and the size of its  civil penalties, it is not clear whether this action will help deter  noncompliance with the agency\u2019s safety regulations. The pipeline safety  stakeholders we spoke with expressed differing views on whether OPS\u2019s  civil penalties deter noncompliance with the pipeline safety regulations.  Some\u2014such as pipeline industry officials\u2014said that civil penalties of any  size act as a deterrent, in part because they keep companies in the public  eye.

(See fig. 2.) The number of serious accidents on interstate natural gas  pipelines also increased, from 64 in 1994 to 84 in 2003, though they have  fluctuated considerably over this time. Information on accident rates for  natural gas pipelines is not available because of the lack of data on the  amount of natural gas shipped through pipelines. For both hazardous  liquid and natural gas pipelines, the lack of improvement in the number of  serious accidents may be due in part to the relatively small number of  these accidents.", "OPS, within the Department of Transportation\u2019s Research and Special  Programs Administration (RSPA), administers the national regulatory  program to ensure the safe transportation of natural gas and hazardous  liquids by pipeline. The office attempts to ensure the safe operation of  pipelines through regulation, national consensus standards, research,  education (e.g., to prevent excavation-related damage), oversight of the  industry through inspections, and enforcement when safety problems are  found. The office uses a variety of enforcement tools, such as compliance  orders and corrective action orders that require pipeline operators to  correct safety violations, notices of amendment to remedy deficiencies in  operators\u2019 procedures, administrative actions to address minor safety  problems, and civil penalties. OPS is a small federal agency. In fiscal year  2003, OPS employed about 150 people, about half of whom were pipeline  inspectors.", "Before imposing a civil penalty on a pipeline operator, OPS issues a notice  of probable violation that documents the alleged violation and a notice of  proposed penalty that identifies the proposed civil penalty amount. Failure  by an operator to inspect the pipeline for leaks or unsafe conditions is an  example of a violation that may lead to a civil penalty. OPS then allows the  operator to present evidence either in writing or at an informal hearing.  Attorneys from RSPA\u2019s Office of Chief Counsel preside over these  hearings. Following the operator\u2019s presentation, the civil penalty may be  affirmed, reduced, or withdrawn. If the hearing officer determines that a  violation did occur, the OPS\u2019s associate administrator issues a final order  that requires the operator to correct the safety violation (if a correction is  needed) and pay the penalty (called the \u201cassessed penalty\u201d). The operator  has 20 days after the final order is issued to pay the penalty. The Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) collects civil penalties for OPS.", "From 1992 through 2002, federal law allowed OPS to assess up to $25,000  for each day a violation continued, not to exceed $500,000 for any related  series of violations.

In 2001, to further strengthen its  enforcement, OPS began issuing more corrective action orders requiring  operators to address safety problems that led or could lead to pipeline  accidents. In 2002, OPS created a new Enforcement Office to focus more  on enforcement and help ensure consistency in enforcement decisions.

Now that operators have this experience,  OPS has begun to make greater use of civil penalties in enforcing these  standards.", "OPS has also recently begun to reengineer its enforcement program.  Efforts are under way to develop a new enforcement policy and  guidelines, develop a streamlined process for handling enforcement cases,  modernize and integrate the agency\u2019s inspection and enforcement  databases, and hire additional enforcement staff.

While OPS\u2019s new measures may produce better  information on the performance of its enforcement program than is  currently available, OPS has not adopted key practices for achieving these  characteristics of successful performance measurement systems:    Measures should demonstrate results (outcomes) that are directly linked  to program goals. Measures of program results can be used to hold  agencies accountable for the performance of their programs and can  facilitate congressional oversight. If OPS does not set clear goals that  identify the desired results (intermediate outcomes) of enforcement, it  may not choose the most appropriate performance measures. OPS officials  acknowledge the importance of developing such goals and related  measures but emphasize that the diversity of pipeline operations and the  complexity of OPS\u2019s regulations make this a challenging task.", "Measures should address important aspects of program performance  and take priorities into account.

It was not  practical for us to gather information on a large number of penalties that  were reduced, but we did review several to determine the reasons for the  reductions. OPS reduced one of the civil penalties we reviewed because  the operator provided evidence that OPS inspectors had miscounted the  number of pipeline valves that OPS said the operator had not inspected.

Pipeline industry  officials also said that they want to operate safely and avoid pipeline  accidents because accidents generate negative publicity and may result in  costly private litigation against the operator.", "Most of the interstate agents, representatives of their associations, and  insurance company officials expressed views similar to those of the  pipeline industry officials, saying that they believe civil penalties deter  operators\u2019 noncompliance with regulations to a certain extent. However,  a few disagreed with this point of view. For example, the state agency  representatives and a local government official said that OPS\u2019s civil  penalties are too small to be deterrents. Pipeline safety advocacy groups  that we talked to also said that the civil penalty amounts OPS imposes are  too small to have any deterrent effect on pipeline operators. As discussed  earlier, for 2000 through 2003, the average assessed penalty was about  $29,000.", "According to economic literature on deterrence, pipeline operators may be  deterred if they expect a sanction, such as a civil penalty, to exceed any  benefits of noncompliance. Such benefits could, in some cases, be lower  operating costs. The literature also recognizes that the negative  consequences of noncompliance\u2014such as those stemming from lawsuits,  bad publicity, and the value of the product lost from accidents\u2014can deter  noncompliance along with regulatory agency oversight. Thus, for example,  the expected costs of a legal settlement could overshadow the lower  operating costs expected from noncompliance, and noncompliance might  be deterred.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
