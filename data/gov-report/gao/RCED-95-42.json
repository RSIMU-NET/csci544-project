The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), first enacted in 1985, was designed in part to address these problems. Under the CRP, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) entered into 10- to 15-year voluntary contracts with farmers to remove highly erodible cropland from production and establish a cover crop on it in return for annual federal rental payments. From 1986 to 1992, 36.4 million acres\u2014almost 10 percent of the nation\u2019s cropland\u2014were removed from production under 375,000 CRP contracts at an estimated total outlay of $19.5 billion through 2002.", "In October 1995, contracts for the first 2 million acres enrolled in the CRP will expire. Contracts on approximately 22 million additional acres will expire in 1996 and 1997; the remaining contracts will expire by the end of 2002.

The Congress initially authorized the CRP in the Food Security Act of 1985 and mandated USDA to retire 40 million to 45 million acres of highly erodible cropland from production by 1990 to improve the environment (focusing on reducing soil erosion), reduce excess supplies of commodities, and support farm income. On the basis of these 1985 goals, USDA enrolled nearly 34 million acres by 1990, principally in the Great Plains and Mountain states. These acres are subject primarily to erosion caused by wind rather than by water. Although both forms of erosion can result in reduced agricultural productivity, water-caused erosion generally results in greater off-site water quality, recreation, and wildlife damages.", "To improve the environmental benefits achieved by the CRP, the Congress emphasized the program\u2019s water quality goals when it reauthorized the CRP in the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 1990.

Generally, two-thirds of the field had to be highly erodible in order for the whole field to be enrolled. The normal practice was to enroll the entire field instead of just the portion of the field that was highly erodible. Beginning with the sixth signup period in 1988, ASCS expanded enrollment criteria to allow partial-field enrollment of grass or tree strips 66- to 99-feet wide bordering waterways, without regard to erodibility. ASCS also allowed other types of partial-field enrollments, such as public water wellhead areas, beginning with the tenth signup period in 1991. Although USDA allowed some partial-field enrollments, the vast majority of CRP enrollments continued to be whole field enrollments.", "In return for keeping land out of production, farmers receive federal rental payments on the CRP acreage and reimbursement for 50 percent of the cost they incur to establish a permanent cover crop, such as grass, on those acres. The rental payment amount is determined by the landowner\u2019s \u201cbid\u201d\u2014the amount of money the farmer is willing to accept to retire the land\u2014provided that the bid is within established ASCS payment limits and other enrollment criteria are met."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CRP Bid Process", "paragraphs": ["ASCS has used two different methods to evaluate bids for CRP enrollment. From 1986 to 1990, for nine signups, ASCS evaluated bids using the \u201cmaximum acceptable rental rate\u201d method. Under this method, if the farmer\u2019s bid was at or below the rate that ASCS established for that area and the land met the enrollment criteria described above, the acreage was enrolled. This approach met with criticism because (1) it did not target a broad range of environmentally sensitive land and (2) after the first few signups, farmers were able to determine the maximum acceptable rental rate and often submitted bids that were more than the land\u2019s actual market rental rate but less than USDA\u2019s maximum rate for that region.", "In 1990, the Congress reauthorized the CRP and directed USDA to give priority to future CRP enrollments in areas where crop production is most likely to impact water quality. This instruction caused ASCS to turn to another method for evaluating bids. ASCS compared all bids in signup periods 10 through 12 (1991 and 1992) to the market rental rate for comparable land in the same region. Bids that were less than or equal to this rate were then evaluated using a measure of environmental benefits developed by USDA known as the Environmental Benefits Index (EBI). This index calculates seven potential environmental and other factors associated with the land on which farmers were offering CRP bids\u2014surface water quality, groundwater quality, soil productivity, conservation compliance assistance, tree planting, Water Quality Initiative areas, and conservation priority areas\u2014in relation to the federal costs of enrolling that land.

The government\u2019s cost for the CRP is partially offset by a reduction in commodity payments that USDA would have otherwise paid on wheat, corn, barley, and other commodity acres enrolled in the CRP. A 1990 GAO report found that estimates of this offset vary depending on the assumptions made, such as the productivity of CRP land and how other acreage set-aside programs might have operated in the absence of the CRP. USDA has estimated the offsetting commodity program savings to be about 50 percent of total CRP outlays.", "Farmers can choose a variety of cover crops for their CRP acreage. Approximately 82 percent of CRP acres\u201430 million\u2014have been planted in grass. These acres could be converted to crop production once the contracts expire.

We were also asked to describe ways the federal government can encourage the use of these practices.", "In response to the first objective, we (1) reviewed literature on agriculture\u2019s effect on environmental quality and interviewed officials at USDA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Fish and Wildlife Service in the Department of the Interior, representatives of farmers\u2019 organizations, soil scientists, wildlife biologists, and agricultural economists to identify what factors determine environmental sensitivity, and (2) analyzed USDA\u2019s NRI and CRP contract data bases, in cooperation with the SCS, to estimate the amount and identify the location of cropland that met USDA definitions of environmentally sensitive land for each factor. The NRI\u2014a natural resource inventory sample compiled at 5-year intervals\u2014is the federal government\u2019s principal source of information on the status, condition, and trends of soil, water, and related resources for nonfederal lands and links this information to CRP land.

However, depending on the environmental objectives established, only a small portion of CRP acres and other cropland may need to be removed from production. This is because the use of \u201cbuffer zones,\u201d as well as other conservation practices such as reduced tillage, can mitigate the environmental degradation caused by crop production. Buffer zones are small portions of land that provide a buffer between fields in crop production and the surrounding environment. For example, if buffer zones were used on CRP land and other cropland to protect surface water\u2014one of the five environmental sensitivity factors\u2014only about 6 million acres would need to be removed from crop production. These acres are primarily located in the Corn Belt, Lake, Delta, and Appalachian states.

Therefore, if wildlife habitat enhancement is established as a major objective of a future CRP, much more land may be necessary than the amount needed for buffer zones.", "While the Congress is considering reauthorizing the CRP, it could consider three modifications to the CRP that would provide longer-term environmental benefits at less cost. These modifications are (1) focusing the program more on creating buffer zones rather than on retiring whole fields of cropland; (2) allowing CRP participants to generate revenues by using CRP land in ways that do not impair the environment, such as restricted haying or grazing; and (3) purchasing easements which would restrict activities on the land for a substantial period, such as 30 years, or longer, for approximately the same cost to the federal government as the current 10-year contracts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Buffer Zones Can Mitigate the Effects of Crop Production on Environmentally Sensitive Land", "paragraphs": ["Land on which crop production can result in significant off-site and on-site environmental damages is considered environmentally sensitive.

No comprehensive data are available to examine the effect of crop production on all factors simultaneously. Therefore, we used USDA data to estimate the amount of environmentally sensitive land nationwide for each factor. These estimates cannot be totaled because they are not mutually exclusive. The same land may be sensitive to several of the factors, such as surface water, groundwater, and wildlife habitat.", "Recent research by USDA, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the National Research Council shows that dedicating small portions of fields to create buffer zones\u2014relatively small plots of land that provide a buffer between fields in crop production and the surrounding environment\u2014can provide substantial environmental benefits without removing whole fields from production. Buffer zones include (1) filter strips\u2014typically 100-foot-wide strips of grass and trees around rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands that border cropland; these strips prevent the majority of agricultural pollutants from reaching the water; (2) plots of grass surrounding public water wellheads to prevent chemicals from leaching into groundwater; (3) strips of trees and bushes that decrease wind velocity to reduce wind erosion; and (4) strips of vegetative cover\u2014\u201cwildlife corridors\u201d\u2014that connect already existing wildlife habitat areas.", "To be most effective, buffer zones should be used in tandem with other conservation practices, such as reduced tillage, on cropland in production. For example, the National Research Council Board on Agriculture recently recommended the use of buffer zones as one component in soil and water quality improvement.

For example, a USDA study found that filter strips reduce the amount of phosphorous and nitrogen that reaches surface water by 80 percent. In addition, improvements to surface water and wetlands often extend to maintaining groundwater quality because groundwater is frequently replenished by surface water and wetlands. Filter strips also provide habitat for wildlife that live near water and improve water quality for fish and other aquatic species.", "Figure 2.1 shows that these 6 million acres are concentrated in the Corn Belt, Lake, Delta, and Appalachian states.", "While the 6 million acres in filter strips to protect surface water and wetlands are relatively easy to identify, buffer zones could also be used to protect groundwater, air quality, and two types of wildlife habitat.However, while nationwide data are not available to estimate the amount of buffer zone acres necessary to protect the environment from these perspectives, USDA officials and environmental experts agree that the amount of acres needed is likely to be less than the 6 million acres needed to protect surface water because buffer zones are more appropriate for protecting surface water than for the other factors. The following describes how buffer zones could be used for the remaining environmental factors:", "Groundwater. Grass buffer zones can protect areas where groundwater approaches the surface, such as where wells have been drilled for a public water supply or where groundwater is replenished with water from the surface through highly porous soils, by filtering water as it leaches from the surface into groundwater aquifers.", "Air. Tree and bush buffer zones\u2014windbreaks\u2014can protect air quality by decreasing wind velocity, thereby reducing wind erosion.", "Wildlife Habitat. Buffer zones can be used to protect the habitat of two types of wildlife. Wildlife that live near or in water would benefit from the buffer zones that improve surface water and wetlands quality. Buffer zones would also provide habitat for wildlife such as pheasants that need small, separate plots of habitat adjacent to cropland. However, buffer zones would not offer sufficient habitat for species that require large, unbroken blocks of their native landscape, such as grassland species like the prairie chicken. These species would require whole-field enrollments to provide sufficient habitat. Therefore, a mix of buffer zones and whole field enrollments may be appropriate for a future CRP to provide benefits for a wider range of wildlife species.", "In this connection, three reports issued in February 1995 suggest that, if wildlife habitat enhancement is established as a major goal of a future CRP, the acreage required for whole-field enrollments could be substantial. For example, the Wildlife Management Institute recently estimated that 27 million acres of grassland are needed in the Great Plains and eastern Mountain states to achieve regional goals of stabilizing and restoring wildlife populations. These acres would provide habitat for game birds and nongame birds. The National Audubon Society report recommends that future CRP enrollments, principally in these regions, should be targeted to areas that have the highest value to wildlife, such as acres adjacent to existing wildlife resource areas. In estimating the number of CRP acres that have the highest value to wildlife, a report by the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development states that very large wildlife benefits would likely result from converting some grassland from cropping uses but that, beyond some point, enrolling additional grassland is likely to yield significantly lower benefits.", "Wildlife biologists have also suggested that the CRP\u2014using buffer zones or whole field land retirement\u2014could be targeted to provide habitat for threatened or endangered species. According to USDA, the habitat for 319 wildlife species is threatened or endangered because of agricultural development.

For example, if the approximately 6 million acres identified as appropriate for filter strips to protect surface water and wetlands were enrolled in the CRP at the current average rental rate of $66 per acre for the regions where this acreage is located, total rental rates would be $396 million per year rather than $1.8 billion for the current 36.4 million CRP acres.

Currently, CRP participants are only allowed to cut hay or graze cattle on CRP land during emergency periods as declared by the Secretary of Agriculture. A House bill (H.R. 3894) introduced in February 1994 proposed allowing limited uses\u2014haying, grazing, producing seeds, and harvesting grass or trees for biomass fuel\u2014in exchange for a 20-percent or greater reduction in current rental rates. Limitations would be placed on these activities to ensure that environmental problems are minimized. While some of these activities could be conducted on buffer zones, others\u2014such as grazing\u2014would generally require larger plots of land. In addition, USDA officials noted in comments to a draft of this report that allowing alternative economic uses may meet opposition from producer groups because it would negatively impact the livestock and forage markets if a large number of CRP participants choose this option.", "This proposal encourages CRP participants to convert their CRP land to uses other than cropping.

Easements offer a better guarantee of long-term protection because they are an interest in the land itself and typically are for a substantial duration (such as from 10 years to in perpetuity). Because easements are recorded on the title to the land and are binding on subsequent owners, they can ensure that the restrictions on the land will be honored even if the land is sold. In addition, easements can cost less to the government than three 10-year contract renewals. For example, if the approximately 6 million acres identified as appropriate for filter strips were enrolled in easements at $620 per acre, total program costs would be $3.1 billion in 1994 dollars, compared to current program costs of $18.1 billion for rental payments.Alternatively, if that land were enrolled in 10-year contracts at the current average rental rate of $66 per acre for the regions where these acres are primarily located, total program costs for 30 years would be $5.9 billion in 1994 dollars.", "Beginning with the tenth signup period in 1991, CRP participants had the option of either contracts or easements and overwhelmingly opted for contracts because they were reluctant to restrict the use of their land for a long term.

In contrast, USDA offered easements, but not contracts, to farmers through the Wetlands Reserve Program, and farmers more willingly accepted easements. For example, in the Wetlands Reserve Program pilot in 1992, farmers submitted bids for nearly 250,000 acres even though USDA could accept only 50,000 acres.

Environmental degradation on this small amount of cropland can be managed by establishing buffer zones instead of removing entire fields from production. Under the buffer-zone approach, only 6 million acres of cropland would need to be removed from production and placed in buffer zones to protect surface water and wetlands. The buffer-zone approach can also be used to protect groundwater, air, and some wildlife habitat and is more efficient and less costly to the government because it allows more cropland to be in production. However, this approach would probably not provide for the habitat needs of all wildlife species. Therefore, if wildlife habitat enhancement is established as a major objective, a future CRP could require more acreage than that needed for buffer zones. Also, a buffer-zone oriented CRP would tend to put more land back in production and, depending on farm prices, could reduce farm income for CRP participants. Accordingly, this approach would not help achieve the current CRP\u2019s supply control and farm income objectives.", "In addition, modifying the CRP could reduce federal costs and increase the amount of time the land is protected by allowing CRP participants to engage in limited uses of the CRP land for a reduced federal payment and encouraging the use of long-term easements instead of 10-year contracts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["As the Congress debates the reauthorization of the farm bill in 1995 and contemplates the future environmental objectives of the CRP, it could consider modifying the CRP to (1) focus more on creating buffer zones where appropriate instead of removing whole fields from crop production, (2) allow alternative economic uses on CRP land, and (3) use long-term easements instead of 10-year contracts for any new CRP enrollments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Response", "paragraphs": ["In responding to a draft of this report, USDA said that the report focused on the CRP\u2019s environmental objective and did not address the CRP\u2019s supply control and farm income objectives. We agree that this report focuses on the potential adverse environmental impact of CRP land returning to production because this was the issue the requesters asked us to address. However, we were not silent on other issues. Because we recognized that the CRP was also intended to reduce surplus crop production and support farm income, we summarized the results of six economic studies that estimate the impact of returning CRP land to production on these two objectives. (See ch. 3 and app. III.) These studies generally concluded that federal outlays for commodity program payments will increase but will not exceed current CRP payments. In addition, some studies concluded that farm program adjustments, as well as market adjustments, would mitigate the impact of lower farm prices.", "In addition, USDA said that the Secretary of Agriculture\u2019s December 1994 announcement of planned CRP modifications will address many of the issues discussed in the report. USDA\u2019s actions include modifying and extending existing contracts to target environmentally sensitive land, adjusting rental rates to more accurately reflect local prevailing rental rates, and encouraging the establishment of long-term easements on CRP land. USDA also stated that a future CRP should include a mix of buffer zones and whole-field enrollments to ensure flexibility. We agree that these modifications are steps in the right direction and will improve the environmental benefits and the cost-effectiveness achieved from new CRP enrollments. These steps will not, however, make the program as cost-effective as possible because USDA will still allow current CRP land that could return to crop production without harming the environment to remain in the program. As discussed in chapter 3, most CRP land can return to production with minimal impact on water, air, and soil quality if farmers use appropriate conservation practices.", "USDA also made three additional comments related to our matters for congressional consideration. USDA asserted that (1) long-term easements are more costly to the federal government than 10-year contracts, (2) easements will be less attractive to farmers than 10-year contracts, and (3) allowing alternative economic uses on CRP land may meet strong opposition from certain producer groups.", "Regarding the first issue, USDA focused on an example of easements in our report and asserted that the easement price was too low. In our draft report, we recognized that easement prices are likely to vary between geographic regions and soil types. In preparing our cost analysis, we compared expected CRP costs to an estimate of what easement prices might be. Our easement price estimate was based on the Wetlands Reserve Program\u2014the only large-scale USDA land retirement program that purchases both partial and whole-field easements, rather than 10-year contracts. This price\u2014$620 per acre\u2014is actually higher than the average expected easement price of $583 quoted in USDA\u2019s comments. Even using the higher price estimate, our example shows that if 6 million CRP acres were enrolled in 30-year easements rather than 3 10-year contracts, total program costs would be $3.1 billion\u201453 percent of the cost of contracts.", "Regarding the second issue, we found that easements are generally less attractive to farmers when 10-year contracts are offered simultaneously. Not surprisingly, when farmers are given a choice between higher government payments through 10-year contracts rather than lower payments through easements, they choose to receive the higher payments.

Approximately 149 million acres of farmland nationwide\u2014concentrated in the Corn Belt, Lake, and Eastern states\u2014are most likely to contaminate groundwater because of the leaching of agricultural pesticides.

Crop production improves the habitat for some wildlife species while adversely affecting others. Therefore, it is difficult to estimate the amount and location of environmentally sensitive cropland for this factor.
