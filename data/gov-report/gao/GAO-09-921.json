From fiscal years 2003 through 2008 federal obligations under cost-reimbursement contracts were reported to have increased $16 billion, to $136 billion, which represented a decrease in the total percentage of federal obligations over the 6-year period, from 34 percent to 26 percent. However, the overall downward trend is misleading. A significant increase has been reported for obligations using the \"combination\" contract type, a category that based on GAO's analysis of 2008 data, includes many contracts with cost-reimbursement obligations that are not recorded as such. According to OFPP, a decision was recently made to eliminate the use of \"combination\" as a Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation contract type, effective for all new contract awards starting in fiscal year 2010. In addition, GAO found billions of dollars for which the contract type had been coded as \"missing\" in fiscal year 2008. Agencies' rationales for using cost-reimbursement contracts were difficult to determine because contracting officers frequently did not document--even in acquisition plans--why they chose to use this contract type. The current requirement for such documentation is minimal, but recent legislation (not yet implemented in the Federal Acquisition Regulation) requires that acquisition plans address the rationale. Of the 92 contracts and orders GAO reviewed, about 30 percent did not include any documentation. The supporting documentation GAO did find generally did not explain why a cost-reimbursement contract for the specific requirement was selected. GAO also found little evidence that agency officials are analyzing contracts' pricing history and requirements to determine if they can transition to a contract type with firmer pricing, even though experience may provide a basis for doing so. Of the 92 contracts and orders GAO reviewed, about half had any evidence that, at least within 4 years before contract award, contractors' accounting systems had been deemed adequate to determine costs applicable to the contract. Twenty contract files had no evidence that the contractors' accounting systems were determined adequate and 20 other contract files contained determinations that had been made either many years before award or after the contract was awarded. Inadequate accounting systems, or accounting systems that had not been deemed adequate for many years, may result in the government making improper payments to contractors. GAO found a range of procedures for monitoring contractor cost controls at the agencies in its review. Procedures at the civilian agencies generally call for program officials to review contractor invoices. At the Department of Defense, cost surveillance depends on contractor-reported earned value management data, supplemented with audits for the purpose of testing whether invoiced costs are allowable. GAO's prior work has raised concerns about the effectiveness of these audits."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies obligate more than $100 billion annually using cost- reimbursement contracts.

Appropriate government surveillance is also required to provide  reasonable assurance that the contractor is using efficient methods and  effective cost controls.

Fiscal  year 2007 FPDS-NG data were the latest available at the time we selected  the agencies for review, but we subsequently obtained data on cost- reimbursement obligations for fiscal year 2008 and included those data in  our trend analysis. Based on the fiscal year 2007 data, we grouped  agencies into one of three categories:    agencies whose obligations under cost-reimbursement contracts were less    agencies whose obligations were from 20 to 50 percent, and    agencies whose obligations were 51 percent or higher.", "We reviewed contract files for 10 randomly selected contracts or orders  (orders are used to procure goods or services from an established  contract) from each of 10 agencies that fell in the second and third  categories, with two exceptions.

Some of these types, and their limitations, follow.", "Cost-sharing contracts: The contractor receives no fee and is reimbursed  only for an agreed-upon portion of its allowable costs. A cost-sharing  contract may be used when the contractor agrees to absorb a portion of  the costs, in the expectation of substantial compensating benefits.    Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts: An objective relationship can be  established between the fee earned and performance results, such as  actual costs or delivery dates. This contract type provides for an initially  negotiated fee to be adjusted later by a formula based on the relationship  of total allowable costs to total target costs.", "Cost-plus-award-fee contracts: Objective incentive targets are not feasible  and judgmental standards, such as quality and technical ingenuity, can be  applied. A potential fee is intended to provide an incentive for excellence  in such areas as quality, timeliness, technical ingenuity, and cost effective  management; award of the fee is a unilateral decision made solely by the  government. We have reported on agencies\u2019 use of cost-plus-award-fee  contracts, finding in some cases that award fees had been paid to  contractors regardless of acquisition outcomes.", "Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts: These contracts provide for payment to the  contractor of a negotiated fee that is fixed at contract inception. The fixed  fee does not vary with actual cost, but may be adjusted as a result of  changes in the work to be performed under the contract. This contract  type permits contracting for efforts that might otherwise present too great  a risk to contractors, but it provides the contractor only a minimum  incentive to control costs. Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts are suitable, for  example, when contracting for research or preliminary exploration or  study, and the level of effort required is unknown.", "Cost-reimbursement contracts are suitable only when uncertainties  involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with  sufficient accuracy to use a fixed-price contract. The two major reasons  for the inability to accurately estimate costs are (1) the lack of knowledge  of the work needed to meet the requirements of the contract, for example,  under research contracts, which necessarily involve substantial  uncertainties, and (2) the lack of cost experience in performing work, such  as the development of a weapon system because manufacturing  techniques and specifications are not stable enough to warrant contracting  on a fixed-price basis. We have reported that during weapon system  development, the Department of Defense (DOD) often asks prime  contractors to develop cutting-edge systems and awards cost- reimbursement contracts for the work. Because the government often  does not perform the up-front analysis needed to determine whether its  needs can be met by the contract requirements, significant cost increases  can occur under the contracts as the scope of requirements changes or  becomes better understood. As of fiscal year 2007, for example, DOD  anticipated reimbursing the prime contractors on the Joint Strike Fighter  and Future Combat Systems programs nearly $13 billion more than  initially expected.", "Cost-reimbursement contracts involve significantly more government  oversight than do fixed-price contracts, which means the government  incurs additional administrative costs on top of what it is paying the  contractor.

Before approving the use of a cost-type contract for development, the  Milestone Decision Authority must execute a written determination that  among other things, the program is so complex and technically challenging  that it would not be practicable to reduce program risk to a level that  would permit the use of a fixed-price type contract. Further, the  conference report accompanying the act stated that DOD should reduce  program risk to the point that the use of a fixed-price contract for a major  acquisition program may be appropriate.", "In addition, the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2009 called for revisions to the FAR, to include guidance on   (1) when and under what circumstances cost-reimbursement contracts are  appropriate, (2) the acquisition plan findings necessary to support  decisions to use cost-reimbursement contracts, and (3) the acquisition  workforce resources necessary to award and manage cost-reimbursement  contracts. The FAR revisions were required by July 11, 2009, but as of  September 28, 2009, had not been implemented.

Along these lines, a regulatory change is in  process to implement a recent congressional direction that acquisition  plans set forth the findings necessary to support a decision to use cost- reimbursement contracts.

Shifting too  much risk to the contractor, the Navy states, would increase the risk that  safety, reliability, quality, and readiness could be compromised because,  when problems are encountered, contractors are motivated not to lose  money and to look for ways to cut costs. Cutting costs can translate to  performance degradations that may not surface until years later. Navy  officials also told us that cost-reimbursement contracts for nuclear  weapons are cost-effective because the high technical risk of what is being  procured would expose contractors to great financial risk with a fixed- price contract, causing contractors to mitigate such risk with proposals  that would be prohibitively expensive.", "One contract file in our review did include a more specific rationale for  using a cost-reimbursement contract type.

Some contracting  officers told us that cost-reimbursement contracts could be modified more  easily than fixed-price contracts as more funding became available (if, for  example, funding was made available on a periodic basis instead of at the  beginning of the fiscal year), whereas fixed-price contracts were required  to be fully funded up front. For example, a contracting officer at the  National Science Foundation (NSF) noted that as a result of the  ambiguities of the services provided and the funding available each year, a  fixed-price contract was not possible for the procurement. However, the  contracting officer said that even if there were no ambiguities regarding  the services to be awarded, if funding availability was incremental and  uncertain then the contract would be awarded on a cost-reimbursement  basis. At the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), one of the contract files we  reviewed contained documentation stating the following:  \u201cThe customer did not have sufficient funding available to structure the  task order and obligate the funding under a firm fixed price (FFP)  structure. As a result, a Cost Plus Fixed Fee \u2026 was awarded. The  customer estimated their requirement at $8.1 million; however, they were  only able to provide $2.1M at the time of award. After initial award, four  (4) additional increments of funds were provided to incrementally fund  this requirement in the first year. Given our continuous cycle of  Continuing Resolutions each Fiscal Year, our use of Cost Reimbursement  contract vehicles are the most practical awards.\u201d", "In our view, the perceived ease of adding funding under cost- reimbursement contracts as funding is made available is not a correct  assumption. Under a cost-reimbursement contract, an agency is required  to obligate the estimated costs (or ceiling) established in the base year  contract for the required services or products at the time of award. When  modifications are approved increasing the original funding ceiling in the  contract award, the increased costs are charged to the appropriation  current at the time of the modification. It is true that modifications of  fixed-priced contracts can be charged against the funding available at the  time of the original contract award, depending upon the type of contract  modification. However, agencies must obligate the ceiling amount under a  cost-reimbursement contract based upon a reasonable estimate of costs  for providing the service or product. Agencies cannot simply limit the  amount of a recorded obligation by stating that the contract is limited to  an amount of funding available for the contract or stating that the contract  will be incrementally funded if those amounts are different than the  estimated ceiling costs.", "At the Air Force Aeronautical Systems Center, we found that the  availability of research and development funds\u2014as opposed to  procurement\u2014was a reason for awarding a cost-reimbursement contract.

Using fiscal year 2008 as a baseline, the  memorandum states that agencies should aim to reduce by at least 10  percent the combined share of dollars obligated through new contracts in  fiscal year 2010 that (1) are awarded noncompetitively, receive only one  bid in response to a solicitation or a request for quote, or both; (2) are  cost-reimbursement contracts; or (3) are time-and-materials and labor- hour contracts. To meet this goal, the memorandum states that agencies  might plan for the migration of work from cost-type to fixed-price  contracts as requirements become better defined.", "We did not assess whether an agency\u2019s decision to use a cost- reimbursement contract was the most appropriate choice of contract type  during our review, but we generally found no evidence that agency  officials assessed, for example, the contract\u2019s pricing history or  requirements under the contracts we reviewed to determine whether there  was a basis for firmer pricing, even when the contracts had been in place  for several years. For example, NSF awarded a $2.8 million cost- reimbursement contract in 2007 to collect and analyze data for a survey of  science and engineering research facilities. NSF has been conducting the  survey since 1986 and noted in its acquisition plan that methodological  studies have been performed during each cycle to improve the design and  processes for subsequent cycles. However, the documentation showing  why the agency selected a cost-reimbursement contract, rather than one  with firmer pricing, was vague, stating that the survey tasks include  \u201canalysis work involving several uncertainties, and sufficient room during  the collection process for variegated opportunities to revise and improve  on survey methods, creating additional areas of uncertainty.\u201d Although  contracting officers are to consider the cost-reimbursement contracts\u2019  pricing history, there was no evidence in the contract file that this  occurred\u2014or that the program office had revisited requirements\u2014to  determine whether there was a basis to convert to a contract type with  firmer pricing. In another example, the Agency for Healthcare Research  and Quality (AHRQ) awarded a contract to collect data for its annual  Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. The contract, awarded in 2002 with  options extending through 2008, was worth over $128 million with the  options included. The same contractor had performed this survey since  1996, but the contract file contained no evidence regarding why a cost- reimbursement contract continued to be used, despite having at least 6  years of data regarding costs and requirements.", "We found cases where leadership had encouraged movement away from  cost-reimbursement contracts, largely by focusing on the program offices\u2019  role in establishing firmer requirements. An IRS contracting office, for  example, recently established a contract review board to review the use of  cost-reimbursement contracts supporting a multibillion-dollar IT  modernization program that has been in place for over 20 years. Cost- reimbursement contracts had initially been determined to be in the  government\u2019s best interest because IRS was unable to define its  requirements sufficiently to allow for fixed-price contracts. According to  IRS officials, over time cost-reimbursement contracts and orders  continued to be awarded and issued for this program because it was  easier. In effect, maintaining the status quo became the way contracting  was done. Officials told us that the partnership between the contracting  and program office was weak; one contracting officer told us that a source  selection was conducted, the acquisition plan written, and proposal  evaluation made without any input from the contracting officer. In January  2008, new leadership at this IRS contracting office established a contract  review board to review and approve procurements proposed as cost- reimbursement contracts. The IRS Director, Office of Information  Technology Acquisition, told us that the review board represented a  significant paradigm shift from how business was conducted. In one case,  the board stopped a planned sole-source, cost-reimbursement order from  being awarded in favor of a competitive, firm-fixed-price task order. The  order was awarded for approximately $9.5 million\u2014about half of the  government estimate and $15 million less than what the contractor  requested as a sole-source provider.", "We also found two additional cases where agencies had contracted for IT  services on a firm, fixed-price basis. While we recognize that IT services  vary significantly in terms of complexity, in these cases contracting  officials had made a concerted effort to work with the program offices to  define requirements such that vendors could submit offers on a fixed-price  basis. Procurement officials at the District of Columbia\u2019s Pretrial Services  Agency and the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Farm Services Agency\u2014two  agencies with high proportions of fixed-price contracts\u2014noted that IT  services contracts were among their largest obligations under fixed-price  contracts. Both of the agencies were successful at implementing these  contracts as fixed-price contracts because their technical personnel (i.e.,  officials in their program offices) were required to separate and define  their IT contract requirements into specific, measurable deliverables. The  head of contracting activity at the Farm Services Agency told us that it was  \u201ca long road\u201d to get the program office on board with this approach, as the  office had preferred cost-reimbursement contracts for IT services in the  past, but that the effort paid off in terms of savings as well as a greater  likelihood that the government would get the deliverables it expected. This  official emphasized that a key to the agency\u2019s success was including its  technical personnel in the contracting process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies Do Not Always Ensure That Contractors\u2019 Accounting Systems Are Adequate for Determining Costs Applicable to Contracts", "paragraphs": ["Cost-reimbursement contracts are to be used only when the contractor\u2019s  accounting system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the  contract. This determination is critical because it helps assure the  government that the contractor has systems in place to accurately and  consistently record accumulated costs and bill for allowable costs. If  accounting systems are not deemed adequate, problems can arise when  costs are accumulated during contract performance. Contracting officers  have a number of methods available to them to make this determination.  One method is to rely upon assessments of accounting systems prepared  by DCAA for prior contracts. The FAR does not specify a time frame  within which an accounting system needs to be determined adequate to be  used as a basis to award a new cost-reimbursement contract. As such, for  the purposes of this review, we used a period of 4 years, which is the  outermost time frame in DCAA policy, as being \u201ccurrent\u201d for auditing an  accounting system that has a significant impact on government contract  costs.", "Another method by which contracting officers can determine if an  accounting system is adequate is to perform a pre-award survey of a  prospective contractor\u2019s accounting system. According to the FAR,  determining that an accounting system is adequate as part of a pre-award  survey includes a determination of whether it is in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles and whether it provides for    a proper segregation of direct costs from indirect costs,    an identification and accumulation of direct costs by contract,    a logical and consistent method for the allocation of indirect cost to  intermediate and final cost objectives,    an accumulation of costs under general ledger control,    a timekeeping system that identifies employees\u2019 labor by intermediate or    a labor distribution system that charges direct and indirect labor to the  appropriate cost objectives, and    an interim (at least monthly) determination of costs charged to a contract  through routine posting of books of account.", "The contracting officer is responsible for verifying that the contractor has  an adequate accounting system. For most of the contracts we reviewed,  this verification was based on a DCAA opinion stemming from its review  of the contractor\u2019s accounting system and related internal control policies  and procedures, but the opinion can also be rendered by an independent  accounting firm or other designated entity. According to the DCAA  Contract Audit Manual, each relevant accounting or management system  that has a significant impact on government contract costs should be  audited on a cyclical basis, that is, every 2 to 4 years, depending on a  documented risk assessment of experience and current audit risk.", "Regular accounting system reviews are necessary to help ensure that  changes to the contractor\u2019s accounting practices are considered by the  government and evaluated for compliance with government contract cost  principles. Over the period of a contract, the contractor\u2019s cost structure or  accounting procedures can change because of multiple factors, such as  changing the criteria for capitalizing or depreciating assets, applying  different indirect cost allocation bases, or merging of a contractor\u2019s  various operating segments. By continuing to pay a contractor without  taking into account these changes, the government risks paying for  unallowable costs. The contracting officer takes into account DCAA\u2019s  opinion, or that of the designated entity, but retains the ultimate authority  for determining whether the contractor\u2019s accounting system is adequate.", "As an example of what can occur when the determination of adequacy is  not made or the contractor\u2019s accounting systems are not deemed  adequate, in August 2007, a contractor disclosed to the Air Force that it  had periodically overbilled on the Joint Strike Fighter Systems  Development and Demonstration cost-reimbursement contract since its  inception. The amount overbilled was about $267 million. In this case,  DCAA had rendered the opinion that the contractor\u2019s accounting system  was \u201cinadequate in part.\u201d The contractor reimbursed the Air Force for the  amount overbilled and paid an additional $28 million in interest."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Timely Accounting System Approval in 52 Cases Reviewed; 13 Others Approved After Award", "paragraphs": ["Of the 92 contract files we reviewed, only 52 (about 57 percent) had any  evidence that contractors\u2019 accounting systems had been deemed adequate  in a current time frame (within 4 years or less) before contract award.

For example, one  of the Air Force Aeronautical Systems Center contracts we reviewed  showed that DCAA found the contractor\u2019s accounting system to be  inadequate in part. According to the administrative contracting officer, the  inadequate in part opinion was significant enough to preclude the  contractor from direct billing the Defense Finance and Accounting System  for payment and required the contractor to submit invoices to DCAA for  review and approval before payment could be made to the contractor.

Cost surveillance procedures under cost-reimbursement  contracts are intended to help ensure that the contractor is performing  efficiently and effectively and that the government pays only for allowable,  allocable, and reasonable costs applicable to the contract. Lack of  adequate cost surveillance can lead to overpaying the contractor. The  civilian agency procedures call for program officials to review contractors\u2019  invoices. DOD procedures do not include invoice review by program  offices, but rely on monthly reviews of contractors\u2019 costs and a project  management tool called Earned Value Management (EVM), supplemented  by periodic DCAA audits.

Invoice reviews help  to ensure that the goods and services for which the government is being  billed were actually received, the amounts billed are allowable, and the  government is not incurring claimed costs that are inadequately  supported. Agency officials outlined the steps in the cost surveillance  process as follows.", "The program office directs work to be done, consistent with the contract\u2019s  statement of work.", "How the work is done, together with the time and cost required to do the  work, is proposed by the contractor and, upon approval by the program  office, becomes a work request. Work requests describe the work to be  done, the labor categories needed, and the hours required by each labor  category to complete the work.", "As invoices are submitted, the CORs are supposed to reconcile the  invoices to the work requests to ensure that the government only pays for  the completed work authorized by the work requests.", "Some CORs told us that they also pay attention to the labor categories  charged to ensure that the contractor is billing for the level of expertise  actually used to do the work and the hours worked. Once an invoice is  reconciled, payment is made. Should a contractor experience technical  problems, which may cause cost overruns, the COR must determine if the  technical problems are legitimate before the government will approve  continued work and invoices for payment.", "The efficacy of invoice review depends on an agency\u2019s policies and  procedures and the diligence and expertise of the COR in implementing  them. Another factor is the time CORs have available to devote to  oversight duties. We have reported that CORs are often assigned these  oversight functions as an additional duty. In addition, we reported in 2007  that DOE was not adequately reviewing invoices for a multibillion-dollar  cost-reimbursement contract to design and construct the Hanford waste  treatment plant, risking hundreds of millions of dollars in improper  payments. Instead, DOE relied primarily on DCAA\u2019s review and approval  of the contractor\u2019s financial systems and on the contractor\u2019s review and  approval of subcontractor charges. DOE\u2019s heavy reliance on others, with  little oversight of its own, exposed the hundreds of millions of dollars it  spent annually on the project to an unnecessarily high risk of improper  payments. In September 2008, DOE amended its acquisition guide to hold  contracting officers responsible for ensuring that contract invoices are  properly reviewed and analyzed before any payment is made to  contractors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Reliance on Contractor-Provided Program Management Data May Be Inadequate if Required Audits Are Not Conducted to Supplement Cost Surveillance", "paragraphs": ["At DOD, procedures for monitoring contractor costs depend in large part  on the EVM system\u2014a tool that presents contractor-provided data to  measure the value of work accomplished in a given period compared to  the planned value of work scheduled and the actual cost of work  accomplished\u2014supplemented with audits for the purpose of testing  whether invoiced costs are allowable. DOD policy dictates that CORs  shall not be delegated authority to approve invoices (as this is the role of  DCAA and administrative contracting officers), but they may review  contractor billings to determine whether the hours billed and labor mix  are commensurate with the work performed. CORs and program officials  responsible for surveillance for the DOD contracts in our sample told us  that they rely on contractor-provided monthly reports and EVM data to  perform cost surveillance. EVM data do not provide surveillance of  specific contract costs, as would be presented in an invoice, but are  intended to alert program managers to potential problems with cost or  schedule overruns sooner than a review of contract expenditures (such as  an invoice review) alone would. At the same time, however, the EVM  data\u2019s level of detail at the contract and order level can be much less than  that of an invoice\u2014where the specifics in terms of labor categories, travel,  and equipment would be reflected.", "Therefore, analysis of EVM data alone does not satisfy FAR requirements  for cost surveillance under cost-reimbursement contracts. In addition to  the key control discussed above\u2014determining that the contractor\u2019s  accounting system is adequate\u2014the EVM data must be supplemented with  audits for the purpose of testing whether invoiced costs are allowable.  DOD has two main sets of procedures in place to do this, one for when the  contractors are approved for direct billing and one for when they are not.  Direct billing allows approved contractors to send their invoices directly  to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for payment, without  invoice review by either DCAA or the COR. DCAA is required to perform  annual review of paid invoices. In addition, for contractors approved for  direct billing, DCAA performs incurred cost audits and conducts \u201cfloor  checks\u201d at contractor facilities to test the reliability of such things as  employee time records and job classifications. To be eligible to participate  in the direct billing program, contractors must meet certain criteria, such  as having an adequate accounting/billing system and related internal  controls, as determined by DCAA. If a contractor is not eligible to  participate in the direct billing program, the contractor must submit all  cost-reimbursement interim invoices to DCAA for approval for provisional  payment. DCAA then submits them to the Defense Finance and  Accounting Service for payment. Figure 2 depicts these various  procedures.", "The effectiveness of DOD\u2019s cost surveillance process depends, to a large  extent, on the adequacy of these DCAA procedures. Our recent work has  raised concerns in this regard. For example, rather than documenting the  population of invoices, preparing sampling plans, and testing a random  (statistical) sample, as should be done, auditors generally used a  nonrepresentative selection of invoices in deciding the number of invoices  they would review and the extent of testing they would perform to support  conclusions in their work. For example, we found that for one contractor  that generated $1.1 billion in annual billings to the government, the DCAA  auditor only reviewed 3 invoices totaling $88,000 out of 222 invoices  submitted for payment from March 2003 through February 2004, tested the  first invoice selected, and performed limited testing on the remaining 2  invoices. Despite this limited testing, DCAA prepared a memorandum for  the record, stating that \u201ccontinued reliance can be placed on the  contractor\u2019s procedures for the preparation of interim vouchers  (invoices)\u201d and \u201cthe contractor has met the criteria for continued  participation in the direct billing program.\u201d Also, we recently testified that  allegations that certain audits at three locations did not meet professional  standards were substantiated. Specifically, contractor officials and the  DOD contracting community improperly influenced the audit scope,  conclusions, and opinions in three cases, a serious independence issue. At  two DCAA locations, we found evidence that (1) working papers did not  support reported opinions, (2) DCAA supervisors dropped findings and  changed audit opinions without adequate evidence for their changes, and  (3) sufficient audit work was not performed to support audit opinions and  conclusions.", "In our review, we found an additional example of what can happen when  adequate cost surveillance is not in place. NSF awarded a $1.1 billion, 10- year 5-month cost-reimbursement contract (with options) for logistic and  operational support for the U.S. Antarctic Program. As discussed in a  series of NSF Office of Inspector General audit reports, DCAA found that  the contractor was billing indirect costs as direct costs, billing over the  negotiated ceiling limitations, and not providing supporting  documentation for other costs. To compound these issues, NSF had not  determined that the contractor\u2019s accounting system was adequate for  determining costs applicable to its contract. In November 2007, an  independent auditor reported that NSF had significant weaknesses in its  contract monitoring policies and procedures, meaning that the agency did  not know whether the costs it was paying the contractor were allowable  and reasonable. NSF officials acknowledged the weaknesses and have  begun to take corrective action.", "As a final example of inadequate cost surveillance, in January 2009, the  DOE Inspector General reported weaknesses in a contractor\u2019s internal  audit, which DOE relies on to help ensure that contractors\u2019 costs charged  to DOE are allowable under the terms of the contract. For fiscal year  2007, the contractor had expended and claimed over $1.4 billion. The  Inspector General found that the contractor\u2019s internal audit during fiscal  year 2007 was not satisfactory in several material respects. Specifically:    Procurements were not properly approved, but the contractor\u2019s internal  audit management permitted the contractor to provide approvals 3 years  after the fact. Questioned costs associated with the procurements were  omitted from the contractor\u2019s audit report.", "The contractor\u2019s internal audit manager encouraged the omission of  information that confirmed improper labor cost allocations.", "After the completion of audit testing, the contractor\u2019s internal audit  management directed the modification of the testing attribute related to  independent receipt of procured goods and services, an action that caused  some of the questioned costs to be excluded from reporting.", "As a consequence, DOE managers at the Savannah River Site were not  provided with the information necessary to fully comprehend the  materiality of, or to address and resolve, internal control weaknesses.

We also  analyzed the statements of work for the contracts and orders in our  sample.", "To determine agencies\u2019 rationales for using cost-reimbursement contracts,  whether contracting officers had deemed contractor accounting systems  adequate for determining costs applicable to the contracts, and  procedures for surveillance of contractor cost controls, we took the  following steps. Based on FPDS-NG data for fiscal year 2007, we grouped  the agencies and their components into three categories based on their  reported obligations under cost-reimbursement contracts. Category 1  comprises agencies that reported obligating less than 20 percent of their  total obligations in fiscal year 2007 under cost-reimbursement contracts.  Category 2 comprises agencies with reported cost-reimbursement  obligations of 20 to 50 percent. Category 3 comprises agencies with cost- reimbursement obligations of 51 percent and higher. We reviewed the files  of 10 randomly selected contracts or orders, with obligations of at least $1  million, from 5 of the category 2 and 6 of the category 3 agencies, with two  exceptions. We reviewed only one contract at the Corporation for National  and Community Service and at the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Alcohol  and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, as those contracts accounted for the  totality of those agencies\u2019 reported cost-reimbursement contracts in fiscal  year 2007.", "In all, we reviewed 92 contracts or orders at the agencies listed below.  Agencies were selected based on location and their reported use of cost- reimbursement procurements.", "Corporation for National and Community Service, Washington, D.C. \u2013    Department of the Air Force, Aeronautical System Center, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio \u2013 33 percent    Department of the Navy, Navy Strategic Systems Program, Arlington,    Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, National  Procurement Office, Oxon Hill, Maryland \u2013 36 percent    Environmental Protection Agency, Cincinnati Procurement Operations  Division, Cincinnati, Ohio \u2013 45 percent    Department of Defense, Defense Microelectronics Activity, McClellan,    Department of Health and Human Services, Agency for Healthcare  Research and Quality, Rockville, Maryland \u2013 87 percent    Department of Energy, multiple sites in several states \u2013 90 percent    Department of the Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade  Bureau, Washington, D.C. \u2013 100 percent    National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Glenn Research  Center, Cleveland, Ohio \u2013 81 percent    National Science Foundation, Arlington, Virginia \u2013 81 percent  Our review of the contract files focused on whether the files contained  documentation providing the rationales for awarding cost-reimbursement  contracts and evidence that the contractors\u2019 accounting systems were  adequate for determining costs applicable to their contracts. We also  reviewed the sections of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and  implementing agency policies and regulations that stipulate the  requirements that need to be met before a cost-reimbursement contract is  to be used. We interviewed a recognized expert from academia with  experience with this contract type. To supplement file reviews, we  interviewed agency contracting officers, contract specialists, or both to  determine how they documented their rationales for awarding cost- reimbursement contracts.", "As a data reliability check, for the 11 agencies in our review we also  identified cost-reimbursement contracts coded in FPDS-NG as buying  commercial items. We did this because the FAR prohibits the use of cost- reimbursement contracts to acquire commercial items, as commercial  items can be procured with a contract type other than a cost contract on  the open market. FPDS-NG reported that 3 of the agencies had at least one  cost-reimbursement contract coded as buying a commercial item. For  these contracts, we obtained explanations for the coding from agency  officials. In all cases, agency officials explained, to our satisfaction, that  the coding was in error. For example, FPDS-NG showed that 12 cost- reimbursement contracts at the Air Force\u2019s Aeronautical System Center  were used to procure commercial items. Center officials explained that the  coding was incorrect because of a glitch in the implementation of a new  computerized contract writing system, which has subsequently been  corrected. A review of the contracts showed that they should have been  coded as fixed-price or time-and-materials contracts, not cost- reimbursement contracts, as reported to FPDS-NG.", "Further, we conducted interviews with agency procurement policy  representatives and heads of contracting activities for 10 agencies with  very high reported use (95 percent or more) of fixed-price contracts to  determine the reasons for their low use of cost-reimbursement contracts.  One of the agencies that we identified as having reported a high use of  fixed-price contracts in fiscal year 2007, the Department of Justice\u2019s U.S.  Marshals Service, was dropped from this part of our review because we  found that many of its contracts had been miscoded. Although the U.S.  Marshals Service had reported 95 percent of its obligations as fixed price,  discussions with contracting officials revealed that many of their  obligations should have been coded as labor-hour contracts and not as  fixed-price contracts. U.S. Marshals Service officials told us that they have  taken steps to correct these coding errors in FPDS-NG.", "The remaining nine agencies, together with the percentage of their fiscal  year 2007 obligations using fixed-price contracts, are presented below.", "Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency, Pretrial Services  Agency, Washington, D.C. \u2013 99.8 percent    Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Marketing Service, Washington,    Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency, Washington, D.C. \u2013 98    Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Washington,    Department of Defense, Defense Commissary Agency, Fort Lee, Virginia \u2013  100 percent    Department of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency, Fort Belvoir, Virginia \u2013    Department of the Interior, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and  Enforcement, Washington, D.C. \u2013 97 percent    Department of Justice, Federal Prison System, Washington, D.C. \u2013 97    General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service, Washington,  Finally, to identify agencies\u2019 procedures for surveillance of contractor  costs, we reviewed contract files and documents maintained by  surveillance officials for each contract and order in our review. We also  reviewed agency cost surveillance procedures, relevant parts of the  Defense Contract Audit Agency\u2019s contract audit manual and our Cost  Estimating and Assessment Guide, which provides information on  practices for ensuring credible cost estimating, including earned value  management. In addition, we interviewed contracting officers and the  personnel responsible for the surveillance.", "Where appropriate, we supplemented our analysis with reviews of prior  GAO reports, agency inspector general reports, and recent statutory and  regulatory actions pertaining to cost-reimbursement contracts.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2008 to September 2009 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Health & Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Michele Mackin, Assistant  Director; Julie Hadley; Daniel Hauser; Julia Kennon; LeAnna Parkey;  Kenneth Patton; Matthew Shaffer; and Sylvia Schatz made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
