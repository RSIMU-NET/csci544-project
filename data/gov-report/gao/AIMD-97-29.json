A complete inventory is a critical step in DOD\u2019s efforts to correct its long-standing financial systems deficiencies and develop a reliable, integrated financial management system. These deficiencies have been a major factor contributing to DOD\u2019s inability to fulfill its stewardship responsibilities for its resources, including maintaining control over specific assets, such as shipboard supplies and weapons systems, and over its expenditures, such as payroll and contract payments.

Since 1990, GAO has designated DOD inventory management a high-risk area, with billions of dollars being wasted on excess supplies.

These systems were also excluded from the DOD inventory. We performed a limited search on the entire DIST database for the key words acquisition, personnel, property, and time and attendance and identified 282 systems that contained one or more of these words in their system name and therefore appeared to meet the OMB and JFMIP definitions of financial management systems; however, only 43 of those systems were classified in the DIST as financial and only 6 were reported in the DOD financial management systems inventory.", "Several systems that were not included in DOD\u2019s inventory provide critical information for use in formulating the financial statements of the military services.

DOD further stated that it will also include other relevant statutory and regulatory requirements in the revised definition. We want to reiterate our position that the OMB requirements be fully implemented. Since 1984, OMB\u2019s Circular A-127 and all subsequent guidance have included a definition of financial management systems that includes personnel, property, procurement, and inventory. These are the types of systems that DOD has specifically excluded from its reporting. The most recent guidance, issued by OMB in 1993, classifies these types of systems as mixed systems. Also, the recently enacted Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 uses the same definitions for financial management systems and mixed systems as OMB Circular A-127.
