Education awarded 1-year planning grants to organizations with the potential to effectively align services for students in their respective neighborhoods. Planning grants were generally intended to enhance the grantees' capacity to plan a continuum of services. Through a separate competition, Education awarded 5-year implementation grants to organizations that demonstrated they were most ready to implement their plans. However, Education did not communicate clearly to grantees about its expectations for the planning grants and the likelihood of receiving implementation grants. As a result, some grantees experienced challenges sustaining momentum in the absence or delay of implementation grant funding.", "The Promise program coordinates with related federal efforts primarily through a White House initiative that brings together neighborhood grant programs at five federal agencies. The Promise program's efforts are focused on ensuring that grants are mutually reinforcing by aligning goals, developing common performance measures, and sharing technical assistance resources. While Promise grantees incorporate a wide range of federal programs in their local strategies, Education coordinates with a more limited number of federal programs. Officials told us that they do this to avoid spreading program resources too thin. Further, Education did not develop an inventory of the federal programs that share Promise goals, a practice that could assist grantees; help officials make decisions about interagency coordination; and identify potential fragmentation, overlap, and duplication.", "Education requires Promise grantees to develop information systems and collect extensive data, but it has not developed plans to evaluate the program. Specifically, implementation grantees must collect data on individuals they serve, services they provide, and related outcomes and report annually on multiple indicators. However, Education stated it must conduct a systematic examination of the reliability and validity of the data to determine whether it will be able to use the data for an evaluation. Absent an evaluation, Education cannot determine the viability and effectiveness of the Promise program's approach.", "The Promise grant enabled grantees and their partners to collaborate in ways that align with leading practices GAO previously identified for enhancing collaboration among interagency groups including establishing common outcomes, leveraging resources, and tracking performance. For example, Education required grantees to work with partners to develop common goals and a plan to use existing and new resources to meet identified needs in target areas. Grantees were also required to leverage resources by committing funding from multiple sources. Implementation grantees were required to collect and use data to track performance. Some planning grantees used a leading collaborative strategy not required by Education that produced early benefits. For example, several grantees and partners told us they completed easily achievable projects during the planning year to help build momentum and trust. Grantees told us that collaboration yielded benefits, including deeper relationships with partners, such as schools, as well as the ability to attract additional funding. However, grantees also said they faced some challenges collaborating with partners, particularly in overcoming privacy concerns related to data collection."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Education communicate grant expectations more clearly, identify federal resources that can contribute to the program's goals, and develop a strategy for evaluation.

Specifically, two rural grantees said that the grant application and  materials had a few areas that seemed to be more geared to urban or  suburban grantees. For example, the term \u201cneighborhood\u201d was somewhat  difficult for them to interpret in a rural context. In fact, two rural grantees  included multiple towns or counties in their neighborhood footprints.  Additionally, two grantees we spoke with had concerns about the  implementation grant application\u2019s 50-page recommended maximum for  the project narrative. Both organizations limited their narratives to 50  pages, but said they later learned that most of the successful grant  recipients had exceeded this limit, often by a large amount.", "The timing of the grant cycles created either an overlap or a long gap  between the two grants. Grantees who applied for the implementation  grant in the first cycle after receiving a planning grant had an overlap  between executing the first grant and applying for the second grant.  According to Education officials these grantees were unable to fully apply  the knowledge gained in the planning year to develop their  implementation applications. For example, one grantee said having to  apply for the implementation grant during the planning year made it  difficult to create opportunities for community input into the planning  process. On the other hand, one of the four grantees that received an  implementation grant 2 years after receiving a planning grant faced  challenges sustaining the momentum of its efforts without additional  funding. Another grantee in the same situation was able to sustain  momentum with a separate grant from a private foundation. Education  officials said they became aware of the problems with the timing of the  implementation applications a few months into the first planning grant  year. However, they said they did not have much flexibility in timing the  grant cycles. For example, they said that they needed to allow time for  public comment on the grant notification in the Federal Register.

Specifically, two  officials from the six implementation grantees we visited told us that a  high-quality planning year was not nearly as important for obtaining an  implementation grant as having someone who could write a high-quality  federal grant application. For example, one grantee noted that writing a  good implementation grant application was not heavily dependent on  information gleaned from the planning process. Another grantee said that  the implementation grant application was written by a completely different  person who was not involved in planning grant activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges with the Two- Phase Strategy", "paragraphs": ["Some grantees who received only planning grants reported in our survey  and in interviews that they experienced challenges continuing their work  without implementation funds.

We found indications that grantees did not fully appreciate that receiving  a planning grant would not necessarily result in receiving an  implementation grant. Three of the five planning grantees we interviewed  stated that they did not have contingency plans for continuing their  Promise Neighborhood efforts in the event that they did not receive  implementation funding. The lack of contingency planning raises  questions about the grantees\u2019 understanding of the probability of  receiving an implementation grant. Internal control standards state that  management should ensure that effective external communications occur  with groups that can have a serious impact on programs, projects,  operations, and other activities, including budgeting and financing. To  date, Education has awarded 46 planning grants (21, 15, and 10 in 2010,  2011, and 2012, respectively) and 12 implementation grants. Even  though all but two implementation grants were awarded to planning  grantees, fewer than one-quarter of planning grantees received  implementation funding. (See table 3.)", "Education officials provided several reasons for separating the planning  and implementation grants and for not awarding implementation grants to  all planning grantees who applied. Officials said that when they awarded  the first planning grants, they were not sure which neighborhoods had  potential grantees with the capacity to implement a Promise plan. In their  view, the planning grants allowed them to invest in the capacity of  communities to take on this work, while the implementation grants were  only awarded to those that demonstrated they were ready for  implementation. Education officials said it was important that grantees  demonstrate they have an implementation plan in place before receiving  such a large sum of money. In addition, after the first round of  implementation grants were awarded, they noted that some applicants did  not receive implementation grants because they were not yet  competitive\u2014in part because they had applied for the implementation  grants before their planning efforts were complete. Finally, in commenting  on a draft of this report, Education officials said that in several years,  Congress appropriated less funds than were requested, which, they said,  affected the number of implementation grants Education awarded.", "In 2010, both Education\u2019s Federal Register Notice Inviting Applications for  planning grants and a related frequently asked questions document  informed organizations receiving planning grants that they should not  necessarily plan on automatically receiving implementation grants. The  frequently asked questions guidance noted that the two types of grants  could stand alone. For example, an applicant could receive just a  planning grant, consecutive planning and implementation grants, or\u2014if  the applicant was further along in the planning process\u2014just an  implementation grant. Education officials told us that they viewed the  planning grant activities as useful in themselves. For example, they told  us that the planning process offers rich data and begins the process of  bringing together partners and breaking down silos. They expected that  planning grantees that applied for but did not receive implementation  funding could continue their efforts without implementation grant funding,  using their partners\u2019 pledged matching funds to implement their plans on  a smaller scale. They noted that the requirement to develop memoranda  of understanding with partners should have signaled that the obligations  of the partner organizations were not to be contingent upon receipt of an  implementation grant. However, Education did not require grantees to  have matching funds in-hand before submitting their applications.  Especially in light of the difficult fiscal climate that federal agencies will  likely continue to face in the future, we believe that it is important for  Education to clearly communicate to grantees regarding expectations for  planning and implementation grants. Clear communication and  expectations can also help promote more realistic expectations among  grantees about future funding opportunities given the fiscal realities of the  Promise program over the past 5 years.", "Grantees who had not received implementation grants were trying to  continue their efforts and most reported significant challenges in  sustaining momentum. According to our survey, since the end of the  planning grant, most planning grantees who did not receive an  implementation grant (17 out of 29 that answered the related question)  found it very or extremely challenging to maintain funding, 12 out of 29  planning grantees felt that maintaining key leadership positions was very  or extremely challenging, and 13 out of 29 planning grantees found that  hiring staff was very or extremely challenging.", "Four of the five planning grantees we interviewed who had not received  implementation grants told us that they need to determine how to  implement scaled-down versions of programs and services identified in  their implementation grant applications. They described challenges  continuing their work without implementation funding. For example, three  grantees noted that partners had pledged funding as a match for federal  dollars in their implementation grant proposal. Without the leverage of  implementation grant funds, it was difficult to maintain the proposed  funding streams. All of the five grantees we interviewed that had  received only planning grants said the planning process was very helpful  in building connections and trust and deepening communication among  partners, and between partners and the community.

The official offered three options  for evaluation. IES\u2019 preferred option is to conduct a rigorous impact  evaluation with a control group obtained through randomized  assignment to the program. However, Promise Neighborhoods are not  designed to create such a control group. Another option would be for  IES to use students or families who were not chosen to participate in  an oversubscribed program as a control group, but an informal poll  that IES took at a Promise Neighborhoods conference suggested that  there were not a sufficient number of oversubscribed programs. A  third option was to develop a comparison group of neighborhoods that  did not receive a Promise Neighborhood grant. However, IES officials  question whether such an approach would enable them to match  neighborhoods that were comparable to Promise neighborhoods at  the beginning of the grant period. Finally, IES noted that collecting  additional data for a control group could be expensive.", "Education\u2019s OPEPD is responsible for conducting other types of  program evaluations. According to Education officials, it could conduct  a more limited evaluation focused on outcomes without demonstrating  that they are a direct result of the Promise program, but they have no  specific plans to do so. An OPEPD official stated OPEPD is reluctant  to commit to a plan because they have not yet seen the data and do  not know how reliable or complete it will be. In addition, the official  said that OPEPD is unsure about funding and that any comprehensive  evaluations are expensive to carry out. By creating a restricted-use  data set, OPEPD hopes that other researchers may have the funding  to use the data to reach some conclusions about the program. The  OPEPD official further explained that no one has ever evaluated a  community-based approach like this one and that they hope  researchers may have some ideas about how to do so.", "Researchers at the Urban Institute and within the Promise grantee  community have proposed other options for evaluating the program.

Planning grantees, especially those  concerned about building trust with their communities and partners, may  have been better served if Education had provided a more transparent,  realistic picture of the fiscal reality of the Promise program and its  potential impact on implementation grant funding. Lack of clear  communication about the expectations Education had for planning  grantees who did not receive implementation funding made it difficult for  these grantees to develop specific plans to continue their efforts without  future Promise funds. However, the reported small, yet tangible benefits  that some communities pursued during the planning year\u2014such as a safe  place for children to play\u2014increased momentum and built trust with  community members. Encouraging such \u201cearly wins\u201d could help all  grantees and their partners build upon and improve their efforts,  especially since implementation funding has proven scarce.", "Additionally, much of the information grantees use about what existing  federal, state, and local programs and resources to incorporate into their  strategies is gleaned through their needs assessment at the local level.

Education is best positioned to develop and share  such an inventory of federal programs that relate to the goals of the  Promise program.

Grantees are investing significant time and  resources to collect data to assess the program, but Education lacks a  clear plan for using it. Without evaluating program, it will be difficult for  Education to determine whether it is successfully addressing the complex  problem of poor student outcomes in impoverished neighborhoods.

We agree, and have clarified our  finding in the report accordingly.", "Education stated that an early assessment of planning grantees\u2019  likelihood of receiving implementation funding would have been  premature. Education noted that although Congress has funded the  Promise program for the past 5 years, in 4 of those 5 years it  appropriated far less than the President requested, and for the last 3  years the program has essentially been level funded. Education further  stated that this underscores the limited control that the program had over  the number of implementation grants made. We recognize that federal  agencies have faced a difficult fiscal climate over the past few years,  particularly for discretionary programs. For that reason\u2014and especially  given the level at which the Promise program has been funded for the  past 3 years\u2014we believe it is even more important that Education be  clear and transparent with planning grantees about historical fiscal  realities of the Promise program and the implications this may have on  future implementation grants. We also believe this situation highlights the  need for planning grantees to have contingency plans, especially given  Education\u2019s expectations that grantees continue their efforts even in the  absence of implementation funding. We further believe that this also  underscores the importance of \u201cearly wins\u201d to demonstrate what can be  achieved when grantees and their partners work collaboratively, as such  demonstrations can encourage them to continue their efforts even without  implementation funding.", "In discussing its perspective on communicating expectations to grantees  regarding future funding, Education stated that its Notifications Inviting  Applications indicated that future funding was contingent on the  availability of funds and that the program\u2019s frequently asked questions  document noted that implementation funding was not guaranteed and that  planning grantees would have to compete for implementation grants. We  believe that our report adequately reflects these communication efforts.  However, as we reported, Education did not communicate to planning  grantees that it expected them to continue their efforts even in the  absence of implementation funding. Nor did Education communicate to  implementation grant applicants that it expected them to be able to use  their partners\u2019 pledged matching funds even if they did not receive  implementation grants. This lack of communication was evidenced by  planning grantees\u2019 lack of contingency plans and challenges they faced  accessing the pledged matching funds, according to the grantees we  interviewed.", "In response to our first recommendation, Education stated that it would  continue to communicate to planning grant applicants that implementation  funding is contingent on the availability of funds, and that it would provide  more targeted technical assistance to planning grant recipients regarding  strategies for continuing grantees\u2019 efforts absent implementation funding.  Education also stated that it would clarify to grantees that planning grant  funds could be used to achieve early, tangible benefits.", "Regarding our second recommendation, Education stated that it would  work with its technical assistance providers to create a mechanism to  distribute a comprehensive list of external funding opportunities,  programs and resources on a regular basis to better support the grantees\u2019  implementation efforts.", "With regard to our final recommendation, Education stated that it will  consider options for how and whether it can use the data collected from  grantees to conduct a national evaluation.

However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce  nonsampling errors, such as variations in how respondents interpret  questions and their willingness to offer accurate responses. We took  steps to minimize nonsampling errors, including pretesting draft  instruments and using a web-based administration system. Specifically,  during survey development, we pretested draft instruments with five  grantees that received planning and/or implementation grants. In the  pretests, we were generally interested in the clarity, precision, and  objectivity of the questions, as well as the flow and layout of the survey.  For example, we wanted to ensure definitions used in the surveys were  clear and known to the respondents, categories provided in closed-ended  questions were complete and exclusive, and the ordering of survey  sections and the questions within each section was appropriate. We  revised the final survey based on pretest results. We took another step to  minimize nonsampling errors by using a web-based survey. This allowed  respondents to enter their responses directly into an electronic instrument  and created a record for each respondent in a data file\u2014eliminating the  need for manual data entry and its associated errors. To further minimize  errors, programs used to analyze the survey data were independently  verified to ensure the accuracy of this work.

We reviewed agency information on applicants for  implementation grants in the fiscal year 2011 and 2012 cycles, as fiscal  years 2011 and 2012 were the only years in which Education awarded  implementation grants. For both cycles, we analyzed application materials  and technical evaluation documentation for a subset of implementation  grant applicants\u2014those that received planning grants in prior years. We  compared the scores in each component of the application for both  successful and unsuccessful applicants to identify criteria or factors that  accounted for significant variation in total scores.
