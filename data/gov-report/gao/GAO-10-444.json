In 2008, SSA provided about $142 billion in financial benefits for these two programs. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the federal government also paid $250 to each SSA recipient, such as DI beneficiaries, SSI recipients, and old-age retirement beneficiaries. GAO was asked to (1) determine whether federal employees and commercial drivers and company owners may be improperly receiving disability benefits and (2) develop case study examples of individuals who fraudulently and/or improperly receive these benefits. To do this, GAO compared DI and SSI benefit data to civilian payroll records of certain federal agencies and carrier/driver records from the Department of Transportation (DOT) and 12 selected states. GAO also interviewed SSA disability beneficiaries and recipients."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO analysis of SSA and federal salary data found that there are indications that about 1,500 federal civilian employees may have improperly received benefits. In addition, GAO obtained data from 12 selected states and found that 62,000 individuals received or had renewed commercial driver's licenses after SSA determined that the individuals met the federal requirements for full disability benefits. Under DOT regulations, these individuals' eligibility must be medically certified every 2 years. Lastly, GAO found about 7,900 individuals with registered transportation businesses who were receiving SSA disability benefits. SSA regulations allow certain recipients to work and still receive their disability benefits. Thus, each case would require an investigation to determine whether there were fraudulent payments, improper payments, or both. The GAO analyses provide an indicator of potentially improper and fraudulent activity related to SSA benefits for federal employees, commercial drivers, and registrants of commercial vehicle companies. SSA currently does not perform a federal payroll or DOT records match to identify individuals improperly receiving benefits. GAO nonrepresentatively selected and investigated 20 examples of individuals who improperly and in some cases fraudulently received disability payments. For these 20 cases, SSA did not have the processes to effectively prevent improper and/or fraudulent payments. To see video clips of three individuals working at their federal jobs, see http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-444 . GAO identified several issues arising from the investigations. For example, SSA continued to improperly pay individuals who informed SSA of their employment. Using a process called Automated Earnings Reappraisal Operations (AERO), SSA examined the earnings for several individuals and automatically increased these individuals' disability payments because of raises in salary from their federal employment. SSA officials stated that they currently do not use AERO to identify individuals who have returned to work. In addition, 18 individuals received $250 stimulus payments while they were improperly receiving SSA disability payments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes two recommendations for SSA to detect and prevent fraudulent and improper payments.

In 2008, the DI  program provided about $104 billion in financial benefits to approximately  9 million beneficiaries, and the SSI program provided about $38 billion in  financial benefits to approximately 7.5 million recipients.", "An individual is considered eligible for disability benefits under Social  Security\u2019s regulations if he or she is unable to engage in any substantial  gainful activity (SGA) by reason of any medically determinable physical or  mental impairment that (1) can be expected to result in death or (2) has  lasted (or can be expected to last) for a continuous period of not less than  12 months. For DI, individuals are engaged in SGA if they have earnings  above $940 per month in calendar year 2008. DI also allows a 9-month  trial work period to test a beneficiary\u2019s ability to resume employment.  After the 9-month trial work period, SSA beneficiaries are covered under  an extended period of eligibility. This is a 36-month period in which SSA  does not pay any benefit amounts (i.e., payments are suspended) if the  beneficiary has earnings above the maximum SSA SGA threshold. If  earnings are under SGA, the full benefit is paid. For SSI, every $2 of  earnings generally reduces the monthly benefit by $1 after an $85 monthly  deductible.", "As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009  (Recovery Act), the federal government also recently paid DI beneficiaries  and SSI recipients $250 each to stimulate the economy. Given the  magnitude of these cash benefit payments, it is important for SSA to have  effective fraud prevention controls in place to minimize fraudulent  payments, improper payments, or both.", "In this context, you asked us to determine whether federal workers,  commercial drivers, and commercial vehicle company owners are  fraudulently receiving disability benefits, improperly receiving such  benefits, or both. Specifically, you asked us to (1) determine whether  federal employees and commercial vehicle drivers and company owners  may be improperly receiving disability benefits and (2) develop case study  examples of individuals who fraudulently and/or improperly receive these  benefits. We plan to conduct subsequent investigations to determine  whether other employment-related databases indicate whether individuals  are fraudulently or improperly receiving disability benefits. In addition,  because we did not systematically evaluate internal controls as part of this  investigation, we plan to review such controls at that time.", "To determine the number of individuals who are employed with the  federal government and potentially receiving SSA disability benefits  improperly, we matched the civilian payroll records from the Department  of the Treasury, the U.S. Postal Service, and the Defense Finance and  Accounting Service (DFAS) from October 2006 to December 2008 to the  SSA disability files of DI beneficiaries and SSI recipients as of December  2008. The scope of our investigation did not include Department of  Defense (DOD) military personnel who were improperly receiving SSA  disability benefits. To determine the number of commercial vehicle  owners and commercial drivers who were likely receiving DI and SSI  benefits improperly, we compared the Department of Transportation\u2019s  (DOT) Motor Carrier Management Information System file and  Commercial Driver License Information System (CDLIS) file to the SSA  disability files of DI beneficiaries and SSI recipients. Since DOT\u2019s CDLIS  file contains both active and inactive licenses, we also obtained data from  a nonrepresentative selection of 12 states to identify individuals who  maintain active commercial driver\u2019s licenses (CDL).", "To illustrate actual cases of fraudulent payments and/or improper  payments from our overall analysis, we nonrepresentatively selected 20  cases that illustrate the types of fraudulent and improper activity we found  in SSA disability programs. The 20 cases were primarily selected based on  our analysis of SSA electronic and paper files for the higher overpayment  amounts, the types of employment, and the locations of employment.  Because this is a nonrepresentative selection, the results of these 20 case  investigations cannot be projected to other federal employees, commercial  drivers, or commercial vehicle owners who received SSA disability  payments. To develop these cases, we interviewed, as appropriate, each  beneficiary and the beneficiary\u2019s employer. We also reviewed relevant SSA  case file documents and employer payroll records. We also videotaped  employees who had improperly received benefits working at their places  of employment. See http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-444.

SSA pays disability benefits to eligible individuals under Title II  of the Social Security Act. An individual is considered eligible for disability  benefits under the Social Security Act if he or she is unable to engage in  any SGA because of a medically determinable impairment that (1) can be  expected to result in death or (2) has lasted (or can be expected to last)  for a continuous period of at least 12 months. To be eligible for benefits,  individuals with disabilities must have a specified number of recent work  credits under Social Security (specifically, working 5 out of the last 10  years or 20 quarters out of 40 quarters) at the onset of medical impairment.  An individual may also be able to qualify based on the work record of a  deceased spouse or of parent who is deceased, retired, or considered  eligible for disability benefits, meaning one disability beneficiary can  generate multiple monthly disability payments. Benefits are financed by  payroll taxes paid into the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund by  covered workers and their employers, based on each worker\u2019s earnings  history. Individuals are engaged in SGA if they have earnings above $940  per month in calendar year 2008 or $980 per month in calendar year 2009.", "SSA conducts work-related continuing disability reviews (CDR) to  determine if beneficiaries are working at or above the SGA level. Each  beneficiary is allowed a 9-month trial work period, during which the  beneficiary is permitted to earn more than the SGA level without affecting  his or her eligibility for benefits. The trial work period is one of several  provisions in the DI program intended to encourage beneficiaries to  resume employment. Once the trial work period is completed,  beneficiaries are generally ineligible for future DI benefits unless their  earnings fall below the SGA level during the 36-month extended period of  eligibility (EPE). Work issue CDRs are triggered by several types of events,  although most are generated by SSA\u2019s Continuing Disability Review  Enforcement Operation. This process involves periodic computer matches  between SSA\u2019s administrative data and Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  wage data. Work CDRs can also be triggered by other events. For example,  SSA requires beneficiaries to undergo periodic medical examinations to  assess whether they continue to be considered eligible for benefits. During  such reviews, SSA\u2019s staff sometimes discovers evidence that a beneficiary  may be working and usually forwards the case to an SSA field office or  program service center for earnings/work development. Additional events  that may trigger a work CDR include reports from state vocational  rehabilitation agencies, reports from other federal agencies, and  anonymous tips. Finally, DI beneficiaries may voluntarily report their  earnings to SSA by visiting an SSA field office or calling the agency\u2019s toll- free number. SSA had increased work-related CDRs from about 106,500 in  fiscal year 2003 to about 175,600 in fiscal year 2006.

Individuals are not eligible for SSI  payments for any period during which they have income or resources that  exceed the allowable amounts established under the Social Security Act.  In addition, relevant information will be verified from independent or  collateral sources to ensure that such payments are correct and are only  provided to eligible individuals. SSI recipients are required to report  events and changes of circumstances that may affect their eligibility and  payment amounts, including changes in income, resources, and living  arrangements.

A redetermination is a review of a  recipient\u2019s nonmedical eligibility factors, such as income, resources, and  living arrangements. There are two types of redeterminations: scheduled  and unscheduled. Scheduled redeterminations are conducted periodically  depending on the likelihood of payment error.

SSA officials stated that their workers are  required to document all contacts in their files and that these purported  contacts regarding employment notifications were likely never made.", "Finally, our investigations found four cases with no evidence of fraud but,  rather, of administrative error. In these situations, the beneficiaries told  our investigators that they reported their employment to SSA and SSA had  evidence in its files that such contact did occur.

However, SSA currently does not use  AERO to identify individuals who return to work and alert SSA staff to  review these individuals\u2019 records for possible suspension of disability  payments.

This evaluation would include contacting the  beneficiary and the beneficiary\u2019s employer, obtaining corroborating  evidence such as payroll data and other financial records, and  evaluating the beneficiary\u2019s daily activities. Based on this evaluation, a  determination can be made on whether the individual is entitled to  continue to receive SSA disability payments or whether such payments  should be suspended. As such, our analysis provides an indicator of  potentially improper or fraudulent activity related to federal  employees, commercial drivers, and owners of commercial vehicle  companies receiving SSA disability payments. 3.  Our report described two cases of transportation drivers and owners  who fraudulently and/or improperly received SSA disability payments.  We do not believe that a change to the title is necessary. 4.  We believe that SSA should perform the match with more current  federal payroll records to determine the efficacy of matching federal  salary payment records with SSA disability files of DI beneficiaries and  SSI recipients. 5.  We revised the report to address SSA\u2019s specific comment.  6.  IRS provides summary earnings data for a calendar year. We have  previously reported that the IRS earnings data used by SSA in its  enforcement operations are typically 12 to 18 months old when SSA  first receives them, thus making some overpayments inevitable. The  federal payroll data provide detailed earnings information for each pay  period (e.g., all 26 pay periods for a fiscal year). We believe that these  data are more useful in the determination of whether continuing  disability reviews and redeterminations should be conducted and  could be more current. 7.  We believe the footnote is appropriate for this report.  8.  As we stated in the report, SSA has the authority to charge interest and  penalties, but SSA did not do so on any of its agreements with  beneficiaries in our case studies. 9.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 states that  these stimulus benefit payments should be provided to individuals who  are entitled to DI benefit payments or are eligible for SSI cash benefits.  SSA did not seek a formal legal determination as to whether  individuals who had their payments suspended because of  employment\u2014and were thus not receiving DI or SSI payments during  November and December of 2008 or January of 2009\u2014should receive  these stimulus payments. We continue to believe that a question exists  as to whether these payments were proper and believe that SSA should  have at least sought a legal opinion before making the payments. 10. IRS may well collect some of these stimulus benefits payments  through a reduction of the \u201cMaking Work Pay\u201d tax credit. We simply  stated the magnitude of the stimulus payments made to those  individuals covered under the extended period of eligibility. However,  we believe that relying on the IRS offset is not an effective internal  control activity. 11. Our estimated overpayment amount was based on our review of  detailed payroll records and discussion with the SSA beneficiary. We  believe that our estimated overpayment is accurate. 12. Our estimated overpayment amount was based on our review of  detailed payroll records and discussion with the SSA beneficiary.  Detailed payroll records showed that the beneficiary\u2019s earnings were  never below the substantial gainful activity threshold. As such, our  estimated overpayment is about $25,000."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
