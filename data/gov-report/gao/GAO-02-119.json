The Compact provided for the continuation of a  defense arrangement that has connected the United States and these  Pacific islands since the end of World War II. The Compact obligates the  United States to defend these island nations against attack, while providing  the United States with continued access to the Kwajalein Atoll in the RMI,  which is used for missile testing and space tracking activities. Additional  rights were retained by the United States under the Compact\u2014the ability to  deny access to the islands by third-party militaries and block actions by the  island governments that are incompatible with U.S. defense authority and  responsibilities. These rights reflected Cold War concerns, such as Soviet  influence in the Pacific, that existed at the time the Compact negotiations  took place. Certain defense and economic assistance provisions of the Compact are due to expire in 2001. Ongoing negotiations to renew these  expiring provisions provide the United States with the opportunity to  reexamine its defense and security interests in the region in light of the end  of the Cold War and the current use of Kwajalein Atoll in the RMI as a test  site for missile defense.", "In June 2001, we briefed your staffs on defense and security issues related  to the Compact and the ongoing negotiations taking place between the  United States and the FSM and the RMI. Specifically, we reported on (1) whether and how the United States has exercised its defense rights and  fulfilled its defense responsibilities under the Compact, (2) current U.S.  defense and security interests in the FSM and the RMI, and (3) the defense  and security issues that are being addressed in ongoing Compact  negotiations. This report summarizes the content of our briefing.", "To address these issues, we reviewed the Compact\u2019s defense provisions as  well as the related defense agreements. We also discussed the use of  Compact-related defense provisions, as well as U.S. defense and security  interests in the Pacific, with officials from the Departments of State and  Defense and U.S. intelligence agencies. Our most recent communication  with both departments occurred in October 2001 and our discussion of the  current U.S. defense interests in the FSM and the RMI takes into account  the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) most recent strategy and planning  document, the September 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review. In addition,  we reviewed other strategy documents from DOD and public statements  made by DOD and State officials related to the Compact and Asia Pacific  security issues. We also reviewed public negotiating documents and  discussed ongoing negotiations with Department of State officials and  officials from the FSM and the RMI. Finally, we conducted additional audit  work in response to questions raised during our June 2001 briefing and  incorporated this information into the background and other relevant  sections of this report (see app. I for a detailed discussion of our scope and  methodology, including a summary of this additional work)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Located just north of the equator in the Pacific Ocean are the two island  nations of the FSM and the RMI. The FSM is a grouping of 607 small islands  in the western Pacific that lie about 2,500 miles southwest of Hawaii (see  fig. 1). The FSM has a total land area of about 270 square miles and is  comprised of four states\u2014Chuuk, Pohnpei, Yap, and Kosrae\u2014with an  estimated total 2000 population of 107,000, according to FSM officials. The  RMI is made up of more than 1,200 islands, islets, and atolls, with a total  land area of about 70 square miles. The Marshall Islands are located in the  central Pacific about equidistant from Hawaii, Australia, and Japan. The  Marshall Islands had a 1999 total population of 50,840, according to the RMI  census.", "During the Second World War, the United States engaged in a Pacific  campaign that liberated the islands of Micronesia from Japanese control.  To administer these islands, the United Nations created the Trust Territory  of the Pacific Islands in 1947. The United States entered into the  trusteeship with the U.N. Security Council and became the administering  authority of the four current states of the FSM, as well as the Marshall  Islands, Palau, and the Northern Mariana Islands. The U.N. trusteeship  agreement made the United States financially and administratively  responsible for the region. In addition, the agreement, which designated  this Trust Territory as a strategic trusteeship, granted the United States the  ability to establish military bases, station armed forces, and close off any  area of the Trust Territory for security reasons. During Senate  consideration of this agreement, Secretary of State George C. Marshall,  General Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Admiral Chester A. Nimitz, among  others, remarked that the agreement gave the United States the complete  and exclusive military control over the islands that was necessary to deny  other militaries access to the islands and prevent their use as a springboard  for aggression against the United States.", "In 1986, the United States entered into the Compact of Free Association  with the FSM and the RMI. Through this Compact, the two Pacific Island  nations became Freely Associated States and were no longer subject to  U.S. administration under the U.N. Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.  The Compact, which consists of separate international agreements with  each country, was intended to achieve three principal goals: (1) secure self- government for each country;  (2) assist the FSM and the RMI in their  efforts to advance economic development and self-sufficiency;  and  (3) ensure certain national security rights for the FSM, the RMI, and the  United States.", "The defense and security relationships between the United States and the  FSM and the RMI are governed by Title Three of the Compact of Free  Association and three Compact-related agreements\u2014the Status of Forces  Agreement, the Military Use and Operating Rights Agreement, and the  Mutual Security Agreement. The provisions of Title Three expire in 2001,  but they can remain in effect during a 2-year negotiating window that ends  in 2003. If Title Three is not renewed by 2003, the Mutual Security  Agreement enters into force and preserves key aspects of the defense and  security relationship between these countries.", "There are four primary U.S. defense rights and responsibilities contained in  Title Three of the Compact and the Military Use and Operating Rights  Agreement between the United States and the RMI (see app. II for a listing  of other defense provisions contained in Title Three of the Compact that  are due to expire in 2001):  Title Three obligates the United States to defend the FSM and the RMI  against an attack or the threat of attack in the same way it would defend  itself and its own citizens. According to officials at DOD, this defense  guarantee is stronger than the U.S. commitment to defend its North  Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies from outside aggression. If  no agreement is reached with the FSM and the RMI on extending Title  Three\u2019s defense provisions, the United States retains a lesser, albeit significant, obligation to defend the islands through its mutual security  agreements with each country.", "Title Three provides the United States with the right of \u201cstrategic  denial,\u201d the ability to prevent access to the islands and their territorial  waters by the military personnel of other countries or the use of the  islands for military purposes. This right does not expire with Title Three,  because the mutual security agreements between the United States and  the FSM and the RMI contain this right.", "Title Three also grants the United States a \u201cdefense veto\u201d over actions by  the governments of the FSM or the RMI that the United States  determines are incompatible with its authority and responsibility for  security and defense matters in these countries. Unlike the U.S.  obligation to defend the islands and the right of strategic denial, the U.S.  defense veto will expire in 2001 unless Title Three of the Compact is  extended (or 2003 if negotiations are ongoing for an additional 2 years).", "Finally, through the Military Use and Operating Rights Agreement with  the RMI, the United States secured continued access to military facilities  on Kwajalein Atoll.", "At the time the Compact was negotiated (1969-1986), the United States was  concerned about the use of the FSM and the RMI as springboards for  aggression against the United States, as they were in World War II, and the  Cold War incarnation of this threat\u2014the Soviet Union. Australia, New  Zealand, and the United States practiced a coordinated Pacific-wide policy  of strategic denial. This policy was successful in preventing the Soviet  Union from establishing a diplomatic mission in the Pacific islands until  1990, when it did so in Papua New Guinea, and limited Soviet efforts to  establish economic ties and enter into commercial fishing agreements.  The United States and its allies blocked these diplomatic and economic  efforts by the Soviet Union out of concern that closer relations with Pacific  island governments could eventually lead to Soviet political involvement in  and military access to the region.", "However, since the Cold War ended, the security environment in the Asia  Pacific region has changed. The coordinated Pacific-wide policy of  strategic denial ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union; and the  United States does not exhibit the same degree of concern about the  influence of other foreign governments in the Pacific islands today. For  example, China has seven embassies in Pacific Island countries,  conducted $168 million worth of bilateral trade with the South Pacific in  1999, reportedly provided millions of dollars in economic assistance, and  built a civilian space launch tracking facility in Kiribati\u2014an island nation  southeast of the FSM and the RMI. Taiwan also has a presence in some  Pacific Island nations through diplomatic and economic ties and annual  port visits by navy cadets. However, while China and Taiwan may have  made greater diplomatic and economic inroads into the Pacific than the  Soviet Union did, they lack the military power projection capabilities that  defined the Soviet threat. The former Soviet Union was considered an  expansionist superpower with a large \u201cblue water,\u201d or ocean-going, navy  that was oriented toward the Pacific and capable of threatening the United  States and its allies. In contrast, China, for instance, is currently considered  to be a regional military power without a developed blue water naval  capability or power projection capabilities that extend out far beyond its  coastal waters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The United States Has Maintained a Presence at Kwajalein Atoll but Has Not Exercised the Compact\u2019s Other Principal Defense Rights", "paragraphs": ["While the United States has maintained facilities on Kwajalein Atoll for  military use, it has not exercised its other primary defense rights nor has it  been required to fulfill its responsibilities contained in the Compact: (1) it  has not had to defend the FSM and the RMI from an attack or the threat of  an attack; (2) it has not invoked its right to deny access to the islands by  foreign militaries or for military purposes; and (3) it has never had to veto  an action by either the FSM or the RMI because the action was  incompatible with the U.S. responsibility and authority for defense and  security matters.

In January 2001, the government of the RMI sought approval  from the U.S. government for a 3-day port visit by the Taiwanese ships. The  United States denied this request in a diplomatic note but did so without  mentioning the strategic denial or defense veto provisions of the  Compact. Even though the United States did not cite these provisions in  its written denial, the RMI, in its reply, argued that the strategic denial and  defense veto provisions were not appropriate in this case and that the  government\u2019s ability to conduct its own foreign relations must be  respected.

The atoll has been the test site  for ballistic missile systems for decades. The facility, which is one of two  sites listed in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty between the  United States and the Soviet Union, is used for long-range missile defense  testing among other missions. According to the U.S. Army Space and  Missile Defense Command (SMDC), the testing range\u2019s remote ocean  location in a sparsely populated area provides an acceptable environment  for ballistic missile testing with minimal environmental impact; and the  atoll\u2019s location near the equator is beneficial for space object and foreign  launch observation.

Congressional hearings on U.S. defense and security  issues in the Asia Pacific region since 1997 have been devoid of references  to these countries. In addition, the United States has never officially  responded to an offer the FSM, Guam\u2019s neighbor, made in 1998 to  preposition military forces in its territorial waters. Portions of a 1999 DOD  Assessment of U.S. Defense and Security Interests in the region provided to  us by the FSM and the RMI also concluded the United States has no current  requirement to preposition equipment in either of these countries.

DOD\u2019s  2001 Quadrennial Defense Review, released on September 30, sets out a  new strategic vision for defense planning purposes. The review noted the  U.S. overseas presence posture, concentrated in Western Europe and  Northeast Asia, was inadequate for the new strategic environment in which  U.S. interests are global and potential threats are emerging in other areas of  the world. The report called for, among other things, increasing U.S.  presence in the Western Pacific. As a result, the Navy will increase its air  craft carrier presence in the Western Pacific and explore basing options for  an additional three to four naval combat vessels and guided cruise missile  submarines in that area, while the Air Force will ensure that sufficient  refueling and logistics support capabilities are in place. DOD has stated  that the FSM and the RMI may not ultimately be involved in any of the  above decisions.

Furthermore, our  analyses concluded that the effect of strategic denial, the importance of sea  lines of communication in the region, and the degree of support received  from the FSM and the RMI for U.S. positions in the United Nations have  been overstated."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Strategic Denial: No Consensus on Value, Effect Overstated", "paragraphs": ["First, there is a lack of consensus about the value of strategic denial in the  post-Cold War era. Different elements of DOD and the Department of State  have offered a range of opinions on the subject, calling the policy  everything from \u201cessential\u201d to \u201cirrelevant.\u201d In the past 3 years, strategic  denial has been described as  \u201cessential\u201d to counter future uncertainty in the region, by the Office of  the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs;  \u201ca very real interest,\u201d if not as urgent as during the Cold War, by the  Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific;  \u201ca prudent insurance policy\u201d for U.S. security in the Pacific, by the  Department of State\u2019s Office of Compact Negotiations; and  \u201ca policy of the past\u201d that is \u201cirrelevant now with the end of the Cold  War,\u201d by the Commander in Chief, Pacific Command.", "Furthermore, statements that have overstated the scope of strategic denial  raise questions about the value assigned to this U.S. right and its  contribution to U.S. defense and security interests. Strategic denial only  covers the land and the 12-mile territorial waters around each island of the  FSM and the RMI (see fig. 5). The geographic limits of strategic denial were  defined by section 461(c) of the Compact, which states that the FSM and  the RMI include the land and water areas to the outer limits of the  territorial sea and air space above such areas as recognized by the United  States. The United States, as a result of its acceptance of most of the  provisions in the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea as customary  law, recognized the 12-nautical mile limit for the FSM and the RMI\u2019s  territorial seas and therefore for strategic denial. However, various  statements by U.S. and foreign officials have described strategic denial as  exclusive U.S. military control over a large, contiguous area of the Pacific  Ocean. Specifically,  An official in the Office of Compact Negotiations at the Department of  State described strategic denial as \u201cthe most significant U.S. interest at  the time the Compact was negotiated\u201d because of the value placed on  denying military access to \u201cover half a million miles of the Pacific Ocean  between Hawaii and Guam\u201d in a paper presented at the 2001 Island State  Security Conference.", "The Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific testified at  a 1998 congressional oversight hearing on the Compact that strategic  denial \u201cmeans taking a vast stretch of the Pacific and maintaining U.S.  military control and ensuring we could deny access to the ships of other  countries.\u201d", "A staff briefing paper submitted for the record during the same 1998  hearing stated that the U.S. right of strategic denial and defense veto  gave the United States \u201cexclusive military rights and legal defense veto  over third party use of any land, ocean, or airspace of the islands.\u201d This  paper stated that strategic denial included the islands\u2019 200-mile  exclusive economic zone, \u201can area larger than the continental United  States\u201d (see fig. 5).", "The RMI Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade testified in the 1998  hearing that the RMI \u201cprovides the United States strategic denial rights  over 1 million square miles of the Central Pacific.\u201d", "Finally, in a paper presented at the 2001 Island State Security  Conference, the Executive Director of the Joint Committee on Compact  Economic Negotiations for the FSM stated that \u201cstrategic denial and the  defense and security concessions in the Compact established an  internationally recognized U.S. zone of influence covering the 1,000,000  square miles of the FSM\u2019s exclusive economic zone in the western  Pacific.\u201d", "These statements, if taken literally, not only overstate the scope but also  the effect of strategic denial. While the right of strategic denial prohibits  third countries from establishing land-based operations in the FSM and the  RMI, the United States cannot use this right to prevent ships from  conducting military activities outside of the 12-mile territorial waters of  these countries. For example, in the mid-1980s and early 1990s, there were  numerous reports of Russian trawlers collecting information in the waters  around Kwajalein. Further, the United States recognizes that under  international law and custom, military vessels have a right to \u201cinnocent  passage\u201d through the coastal waters of the islands. According to DOD and  the Department of State, these rights are identical to those that the United  States exercises in its own territorial waters. However, Department of  Defense officials have noted that in denying third-country access to land  facilities, the right of strategic denial limits the ability of other nations to  undertake long-term naval operations in the area, and makes activities in  the region, such as surveillance, more costly.", "The importance of sea lines of communication, or sea routes, that run near  or through the FSM and the RMI is another area in which the value of U.S.  interests has been overstated. While U.S. policymakers have stated that the  critical commercial and military transit routes run near or through the FSM  and the RMI, there is evidence to the contrary. Officials from the  Department of the State and the U.S. Army in the RMI told us that one of  Kwajalein\u2019s positive qualities was its isolated location, away from  commercial shipping lines. In addition, a 1992 analysis of U.S. defense  interests in the Pacific Islands stated that the FSM and the RMI lie well to  the south of many north Pacific sea and air lines in peacetime; it is only  when these north Pacific lines are threatened that air and sea movements  would shift southward to minimize adversary interdiction. Our analysis of  U.S. trade flows in the Pacific supports these two assessments. Of the less  than 23 percent of total U.S. trade that crosses the Pacific, more than 61 percent (or about 14 percent of total U.S. trade) involves Japan, China,  Taiwan, and Korea, all of which lie north of the FSM and the RMI. Other  discussions of Pacific sea lines by U.S. officials and policy analysts have  concentrated on chokepoints in Southeast Asia (see fig. 6). An analysis of  these chokepoints in a 1996 National Defense University publication, stated  that in the event all the strategic straits in Southeast Asia are closed or  blocked, trade flows originating from the Middle East and South Asia could  be rerouted south of Australia. Depending on the final destination of these  goods, the rerouted ships could possibly pass near or through the FSM.  Although the chokepoints analysis does not specifically illustrate how U.S.  trade flows from this area would be affected, it appears they would transit  south of the FSM and the RMI in this scenario.", "Finally, the level of support from the FSM and the RMI for U.S. positions in  the U.N. General Assembly has been overestimated. Although U.N. voting  does not directly relate to U.S. defense and security interests, U.S.  government officials consistently referred to the support of these countries  in the United Nations as one aspect of the strategic importance of these  countries to the United States. In fact, an official in the Department of  State\u2019s Bureau of International Organizations called the FSM \u201cthe number  one friend of the United States at the United Nations,\u201d while the RMI was  referred to as \u201cone of the better members\u201d of the General Assembly. These  assessments were based on measures of voting coincidence that appeared  in the 2000 edition of the department\u2019s report to Congress, Voting Practices  in the United Nations. In 2000, the FSM was said to have voted with the  United States 100 percent of the time, while the RMI was credited with  casting an identical vote about 74 percent of the time. However, the  Department of State\u2019s methodology does not take into consideration those  occasions when the countries were absent or abstained from voting.  Including these absences and abstentions drops the countries\u2019 voting  coincidence numbers to about 54 percent and 52 percent, respectively (see  table 1). While these countries have agreed with the United States about as  often as the average NATO country, support on a few issues identified as  important by the Department of State, such as votes involving the Middle  East and other issues where the United States is often isolated, and the  numbers reported in the Department of State report have led to a  perception of much stronger support than our analysis indicates (see app. V for more discussion of the Department of State report Voting  Practices in the United Nations)."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Current Negotiators Have Expressed Their Intent to Preserve the Status Quo on Defense and Security Relations", "paragraphs": ["The ongoing Compact negotiations have resulted in agreements in  principle between the United States and the FSM and the RMI, respectively,  to continue their existing defense and security relationships.

Similarly, in a June 2000  congressional hearing on the Compact, an official from the Office of the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, stated  that providing continued Compact assistance was in the best interest of the  United States because it helps preserve access to key defense interests for  our forces while denying potentially hostile forces access to U.S. economic  and defense interests in the region.

DOD emphasized in its  comments that the U.S. right to exclude third-country militaries from the  territory of the FSM and the RMI remains an important one due to future  uncertainty about events in the region. It also noted that it would be unwise  to assume that the end of the Cold War has lessened the strategic  importance of Micronesia to U.S. interests. In our response to DOD\u2019s letter,  we cite a passage from a DOD assessment that states that the strategic  importance of the FSM and the RMI has in fact lessened over the past  50 years.", "The FSM government also disagreed with our conclusion that the FSM  currently lacks broad strategic importance for the United States and that  the importance of certain security interests involving the FSM has been  overstated. In its comments, the RMI government stressed its strategic  significance and historic contribution to the United States as a site of  nuclear test and argued that the rights granted to the United States under  the Compact have been significant. The RMI government also expressed  the view that we have not properly characterized the relationship between  the United States and the U.N. Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands at the  time of Compact negotiations and thus had overemphasized the U.S. desire  to address Cold War concerns in the Compact, while de-emphasizing the  role other issues played in the negotiations.

By excluding instances where  these countries were absent or abstained in their interpretation of this  report, officials have overlooked the report\u2019s cautionary message in its  methodology section. The report indicates that abstentions and absences  are often difficult to interpret, but they make a mathematical difference,  sometimes major, in the voting coincidence results. The case of Palau, a  country near the FSM and the RMI, illustrates this point. An official in the  Bureau of International Organizations at the Department of State  characterized Palau as the number-two friend of the United States in the  General Assembly because of its 100-percent voting coincidence with the  United States in 2000. However, this percentage is based on just 11 identical  votes cast out of a possible 65 votes (about 17 percent) because Palau\u2019s 2 abstentions and 52 absences are not included in the voting coincidence  percentage. Table 1 in our letter shows these differences for the FSM and  the RMI.", "The FSM and the RMI have also gained visibility by supporting the United  States on important issues in the General Assembly. Each year the  Department of State report highlights about 13 votes (or 18 percent of total  General Assembly votes) on issues the United States considers important,  such as arms control, Middle East issues, and human rights. On some of  these issues, the United States is one of only a few dissenters, making FSM  or RMI support highly visible. However, officials from the Department of  State and the FSM concede that this support has more symbolic  significance than actual significance given the overwhelming margins on  these votes. For instance, during the 2000 General Assembly, the FSM  joined the United States and Israel as the only dissenters on a resolution  concerning the risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East (the RMI  was one of only 8 countries who abstained), and the RMI joined the United  States and Israel as the only dissenters on a resolution critical of the U.S.  embargo of Cuba (the FSM was absent). The vote totals for these  resolutions were 157-3-8 (for-against-abstain) and 167-3-4 respectively.

General Assembly has been overstated, these countries have, in recent  years, achieved a level of support that resembles the average North Atlantic  Treaty Organization (NATO) country (see figs. 14 through 16). A closer  look at the voting profiles of the FSM, the RMI, and NATO also reveals the  importance of acknowledging abstentions and absences in measures of  voting coincidence. For example, in 2000, the FSM cast 35 votes (out of 65)  identical to those cast by the United States, while the RMI and the average  NATO country each cast 34 identical votes. However, due to the exclusion  of abstentions and absences from its calculations, the Department of State  reported voting coincidence percentages for the FSM, the RMI, and the  average NATO country that ranged from about 100 percent for the FSM to  74 percent for the RMI to 63 percent for NATO."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the letter from DOD dated  December 7, 2001. 1.

Further, the views from the  U.S. Pacific Command officials, which are included in our report, were  collected from individuals specifically designated by the Command to  respond to our questions. 8. The U.S. Pacific Command has told us that the United States has access  to airfields throughout the FAS. According to the Air Mobility  Operations Center within the Pacific Command Air Force Operations  Center, the U.S. Air Force (USAF) does not use Yap and Chuuk for  refueling as a matter of routine operations. As a rule, when USAF  fighters transit the Pacific Command\u2019s Area of Responsibility they have  tanker escort, which means they do not need to refuel on the ground.  The Air Mobility Operations Center does not keep track of fighter  refueling and cannot verify whether any USAF fighters have refueled at  Yap or Chuuk. However, a Pacific Command representative stated that  it is quite possible that the Marines or Navy could have dropped in for  fuel, but there is no way to provide an accounting of how many times  and for what reasons. He stated that there have been literally hundreds  of flights transiting the Pacific Command\u2019s Area of Responsibility in  support of Operation Enduring Freedom. U.S. pilots are given a great  deal of latitude; and, given countless possible scenarios, some could  have dropped into the FSM to refuel. Finally, he stated that Palau and  Guam have also been used recently for refueling purposes, with Guam  used more often than small airfields when it is convenient. However,  carrier-based aircraft transiting the Pacific Command\u2019s Area of  Responsibility might find a more direct route by flying through the FSM  or the RMI rather than Guam. 9. This report does not conclude that the value of strategic denial is  overrated. However, we did find that (1) strategic denial has never been  invoked (see p. 13); (2) there is a lack of consensus among U.S.  policymakers concerning its value in the post-Cold War era (see p. 17);  and (3) the scope and effect of this right have been overstated in public  statements by officials from the United States, the FSM, and the RMI  (see p. 18). Finally, with regard to the effective area of strategic denial,  we acknowledge both the right to deny land access and the potential  effect of this denial on the ability of other countries to conduct long- term naval operations (p. 19). 10. See p. 21, footnote 24 for a discussion of U.S. trade flows. Our analysis  illustrates that most U.S. Pacific trade passes well north of the FSM and  the RMI. 11. Of note, the examples offered here ignore the fact that strategic denial  would prevent the use of the FSM by a third-party military to threaten  Guam or sea lines. Also, in response to our questions on how U.S.  interests would be affected if a third-party military had a presence in  the FSM or the RMI, DOD focused exclusively on potential surveillance  activities, not threats to Guam or shipping. 12. We have carefully examined these route charts and determined that  they support our finding that the major sea lines of communication  between the United States and Guam as well as key trading partners in  Asia run north of the FSM and the RMI. In addition, we have amended  footnote 23 on p. 21, to note that there are sea lines running between  Australia and Japan that transit the FSM. Finally, these route charts  appear to show that major sea lines between the United States and  Australia lie close to 2000 kilometers away from the nearest point in the  FSM. 13. We provided a classified briefing to our requesters in June 2001. This  briefing included a discussion of contingency war plans and  operational scenarios, as well as other information gathered from U.S.  defense and intelligence agencies. 14. These specific instances of FSM support for U.S. positions were  included in the draft provided to the FSM for comment (see app. V, p. 45, footnote 40, and p. 46, footnote 45). 15. Information on FSM citizens serving in the U.S. armed forces was  included in the draft provided to the FSM for comment (see app. II,  p. 31). 16. This report recognizes that absences and abstentions are an issue for  all the coincidence numbers reported in the Department of State report  in p. 23, footnote 25. Our methodology, which accounts for these  absences and abstentions, was described as fair and valid by a former  Department of State official who prepared the U.N. voting report for  the past 12 years. We also compare the FSM favorably with U.N.  support received from NATO on p. 23 (see also app. III, pp. 47-48). Our  analysis of NATO voting on pp. 47, 48, and 50 applies the same  methodology that we used to calculate the voting coincidences of the  FSM and the RMI. Finally, we discuss FSM support on issues identified  as important by the Department of State on pp 46-47. However, we note  that lopsided vote margins in the U.N. General Assembly means this  support is largely symbolic."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the letter from the government of  the RMI dated November 19, 2001. 1. This report mentions two incidents where the defense veto, though not  formally invoked, may have had some relevance. On p. 13 in footnote  14, we note that the RMI government once considered a plan to store  third country nuclear waste in the RMI. The threat of the United States  possibly invoking the defense veto, along with a change in RMI  government leadership, may have been responsible for the RMI  government\u2019s final decision against providing storage. Furthermore, on  p. 13 we noted initial U.S. government objections to a 2001 RMI port  call by Taiwanese ships. While the U.S. government never mentioned  the Compact\u2019s defense veto provision during this incident, the RMI did  cite the provision as not being appropriate in this particular instance.  Finally, our objective was to determine which of the key provisions had  been formally invoked, and both DOD and the Department of State  have told us the defense veto remains unused. This report also does not  attempt to assign value to the defense veto provision based on its lack  of usage. 2. This report chose not to speculate on the role strategic denial may have  played in deterring third country militaries from seeking to use the RMI,  because data are not available to determine whether there are any third  countries that would have had an interest in engaging in activities in the  RMI in the absence of this right. We maintain that the evidence shows  that the scope and effect of strategic denial have been overstated in  public statements by officials from the United States, the FSM, and the  RMI (see p. 18). 3. This report does not conclude that hostile actors or foreign powers will  never again attempt to transit RMI waters or develop a presence in the  RMI. Rather we note on p. 13 in footnote 13 that portions of a 1999 DOD  assessment, provided to the RMI, stated that no outside threat to the  FSM and the RMI is likely to emerge over the next 10 to 20 years, and  there are no compelling security interests on the part of any Asian  countries that would manifest themselves in any threat to the FSM and  the RMI. This assessment also stated that no Asian country will have  the military reach to pose a credible threat or domineering presence in  the foreseeable future. 4. This report does acknowledge the importance of nuclear and missile  defense testing in the U.S.-RMI relationship. Appendix III discusses U.S.  activities in the Marshall Islands over the past 50 years. This report also  notes that Kwajalein Atoll is cited by DOD as an \u201cimportant and unique  national asset that would be difficult and expensive to replace,\u201d thus  giving prominence to the RMI location where missile and missile  defense testing occurs (see pp. 3 and 14).", "Reviewing U.S. nuclear testing activities in the Marshall Islands was  outside the scope of our review, though the issue is mentioned in  appendix III. For a discussion of the amount the United States has  spent to address nuclear testing-related issues in the Marshall Islands,  see our report Foreign Relations: Better Accountability Needed Over  U.S. Assistance to Micronesia and the Marshall Islands  (GAO/RCED-00-67, May 31, 2000). 5. This report states that the negotiation of expiring defense and  economic Compact provisions provides the United States with the  opportunity to reexamine its defense and security interests in the RMI  and the FSM. We believe that this is a reasonable and prudent course of  action and one that in no way suggests that the United States should  unilaterally choose to end or alter commitments that require mutual  termination by all parties involved. Of note, in a 1996 testimony, a  Department of State official stated that while U.S. defense  arrangements with the Freely Associated States (FAS) \u2013 the FSM, the  RMI, and Palau \u2014 have contributed measurably to the security of the  United States and the FAS, it is necessary to review the entire range of  Compact security provisions in light of new global conditions and  stringent fiscal realities as we near the end of the Compact period. 6. The U.S. obligation to defend the RMI and the FSM is mentioned in this  report on p. 7 in order to demonstrate the unique relationship between  the United States and the two Pacific Island nations, and is never  referred to as a burden. This report also states on p. 8 that strategic  denial, the defense veto, and access to RMI land are key provisions of  the Compact that provide rights to the U.S. government. 7. We agree that the factors discussed by the RMI government over the  next three pages\u2014the relationship that developed between the United  States and the RMI as a result of U.S. administration of the Marshall  Islands under the U.N. trust, and U.S. nuclear testing during the 1940s  and 1950s\u2014played a key role in establishing an important framework  for Compact negotiations. However, we maintain, after carefully  reviewing the Compact\u2019s legislative history, that the Compact\u2019s specific  security and defense provisions reflected Cold War concerns that  existed at the time of the negotiations. We also note that the RMI  government did not disagree when we cited three goals of the Compact  in a September 2000 report that are also listed in this report: (1) securing self-government for the RMI and the FSM, (2) assuring  certain national security rights for the RMI, the FSM, and the United  States; and (3) assisting the RMI and the FSM in their efforts to advance  economic self-sufficiency. Our earlier report also noted U.S. concerns  about an expanded Soviet Union military presence in the Pacific at the  time of Compact negotiations. In addition, a 1999 DOD assessment  points out that the Compact was negotiated during the Cold War era in  a vastly different politico-military and security environment, and a State  Department official testified at a 2000 congressional hearing that the  Compact was negotiated and enacted during the Cold War, when the  Soviet Union had a growing presence in the Pacific. 8. Pages 1 and 6 of this report state that the Compact consists of two  separate international agreements, one between the United States and  the RMI, the other between the United States and the FSM. 9. We have revised footnote 5 on p. 6 of the report to show direct Compact  funding provided to the RMI and the FSM separately for fiscal years  1986 through 1998. Further, on p. 2, footnote 1 and p. 6, footnote 5, we  have separated total estimated Compact assistance (direct funding as  well as U.S. programs and federal services) for the RMI from the total  estimated assistance provided to the FSM."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Ron Schwenn, Mary Moutsos, Mark  Speight, and Rona H.
