In 2007, the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) began developing a human capital system--called the Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel System (DCIPS)--to manage Department of Defense (DOD) civilian intelligence personnel. In response to a congressional request, GAO examined the extent to which DOD has (1) incorporated internal safeguards into DCIPS and monitored the implementation of these safeguards and (2) developed mechanisms to identify employee perceptions about DCIPS. GAO analyzed guidance, interviewed appropriate officials, and conducted discussion groups with employees at select DOD components. At the end of GAO's review, legislation was enacted that impacts, among other things, how DCIPS employees will be paid."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While early in its implementation of DCIPS, DOD has taken some positive steps to incorporate 10 internal safeguards to help ensure the fair, effective, and credible implementation of the system; however, opportunities exist to immediately improve the implementation of two of these safeguards, and continued monitoring of all is needed. For example, one safeguard requires employees to be trained on the system's operations, and GAO noted that DOD had provided extensive training to employees on DCIPS to include several Web-based and classroom courses. For another safeguard--which requires ongoing performance feedback--GAO noted that DOD's guidance requires feedback between employees and supervisors at the midpoint and at the close of the performance rating cycle. However, GAO determined that in the case of two safeguards--involving employees and fully implementing the merit principles--DOD could immediately improve its implementation. First, while DOD has leveraged mechanisms like town hall meetings and \"brown bags\" to involve employees in DCIPS, its guidance does not identify a formalized process for the continuous involvement of employees in the system implementation--which could ultimately undermine its credibility. Second, while DOD has stated that it will conduct an analysis of final ratings utilizing demographic data, DOD does not have a written policy outlining how this will be accomplished, and therefore may be unable to fully determine whether potential barriers to fair and equitable ratings exist. Without steps to improve implementation of this safeguard, employees may lack confidence in the system. Finally, GAO previously reported--for systems like DCIPS--that continued monitoring of such systems' safeguards is needed to help ensure agency actions are effective. In October 2009, DOD provided GAO with a draft DCIPS evaluation plan that would be executed after the first payout in January 2010. Without finalizing and executing the plan, DOD will not know if it has achieved desired outcomes from the system. DOD has used several mechanisms to provide employees with information; however, these mechanisms do not comprehensively identify and address employee perceptions of DCIPS. For example, USD(I), among other things, maintains a Web-site that contains frequently asked questions submitted by employees and responses by USD(I). Absent, however, are mechanisms to systematically identify employee perceptions. The nongeneralizable results of the discussion groups GAO conducted with employees and supervisors yielded mixed views. For example, participants generally expressed positive views about the concept of pay for performance. But participants at most of the Intelligence Components noted that DCIPS was being implemented too quickly or many questions went unanswered. Although DOD officials have drafted surveys that will allow them to more comprehensively collect employee perceptions about DCIPS, these surveys lack questions that would provide insight about employee perceptions of certain safeguards and overall acceptance of DCIPS. Without including such questions and expeditiously implementing its surveys, DOD will not have clear insight into employee perceptions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 2001, we have designated strategic human capital management as a  high-risk area because of the federal government\u2019s long-standing lack of a  consistent approach to such management.  We have previously reported  that strategic human capital management can be a powerful lever for  affecting transformational change.  Additionally, in our 2009 High-Risk  Series update, we identified the importance of having committed and  sustained top leadership in agencies across the federal government to  address this challenge and of developing a clear linkage between  individual employee performance and organizational success to create and  maintain a more results-oriented, customer-focused, collaborative, diverse,  and inclusive workforce.  In a 2008 report to Congress, the Office of the  Director for National Intelligence (ODNI) noted that, in the aftermath of  the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and prior to Operation Iraqi  Freedom, congressional and presidential reviews identified significant  institutional, cultural, and organizational factors that impeded the  Intelligence Community from operating in an effective and collaborative  manner.  As an  example, the report noted that one such review  concluded that the U.S. Intelligence Community (1) had failed to  encourage joint personnel assignments that could break down cultural  barriers and foster collaboration amongst the various intelligence  agencies; (2) contained personnel systems that were ill-suited to hire and  retain the most talented young people, who could often earn far more  money outside the government; and (3) had compensation systems\u2014like  the General Schedule System\u2014that were too often tied to \u201ctime-in-grade,\u201d  rather than demonstrated achievement.  The commission recommended,  among other things, that ODNI establish a central human resources  authority for the Intelligence Community; create a uniform system for  performance evaluations and compensation; and develop a more  comprehensive and creative set of performance incentives. To this end,  both ODNI and the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I))\u2014 the primary organization responsible for development and oversight of  DOD\u2019s intelligence community personnel system\u2014have consistently  emphasized their commitment to reforming and modernizing the disparate  personnel systems used throughout the Intelligence Community.", "Specifically, as part of a comprehensive approach to consistently  modernize compensation across the U.S. Intelligence Community, ODNI  has taken steps to develop a pay modernization framework to help prevent  inequality in pay, ensure a level playing field, help the Intelligence  Community compete with the private sector for employees with critical  skills, and retain a competitive workforce. ODNI officials stated that this  pay modernization framework will also help bring the U.S. Intelligence  Community closer together and act as a true community and not simply an  association of agencies with similar and related missions.  According to  ODNI officials, to address the personnel challenges in the Intelligence  Community that mirror those found throughout the rest of the executive  branch, the Director of National Intelligence launched the National  Intelligence Civilian Compensation Program.  Further, according to these  same officials, the National Intelligence Civilian Compensation Program is  a modern performance management and pay-for-performance initiative for  the U.S. Intelligence Community, which is intended to replace the existing  obsolete compensation systems used in much of the U.S. Intelligence  Community.  Specifically, the National Intelligence Civilian Compensation  Program is an overarching framework established by various Intelligence  Community directives, which sets forth common performance  management and pay rules for this community. See appendix I for a  detailed discussion of the National Intelligence Civilian Compensation  Program.  Using this framework, among other things, USD(I), in 2007,  began developing a human capital system\u2014called the Defense Civilian  Intelligence Personnel System (DCIPS)\u2014to manage civilian intelligence  personnel in the Department of Defense (DOD) intelligence components.   The statutory authority for this system originated in the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, which provided DOD the  authority to create a pay-for-performance system for the defense  Intelligence Community\u2014the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency was  the first DOD organization to implement this authority in 1998.  In 2006,  the ODNI, in partnership with all of the elements of the U.S. Intelligence  Community, adopted the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency\u2019s piloted  model in its design.", "In 2008, the Senate Armed Services Committee asked us to review the  implementation of DCIPS.  In response to this request, we examined the  extent to which DOD has (1) incorporated internal safeguards into DCIPS  and monitored the implementation of the safeguards and (2) developed  mechanisms to identify employee perceptions about it.", "At the end of GAO\u2019s review, legislation was enacted that contains  provisions that affect DCIPS. Specifically, provisions of the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 suspended the fixing of  \u201crates of basic pay\u201d under DCIPS \u201cfor employees and positions within any  element of the Intelligence Community,\u201d except for the National  Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.  The act also required \u201crates of basic pay\u201d  to be fixed in accordance with provisions of law that (disregarding DCIPS)  would otherwise apply, during the period beginning on the date of the  enactment of the defense authorization act and ending on December 31,  2010.  The act further required the Secretary of Defense, the Director of  the Office of Personnel and Management, and the Director of National  Intelligence to jointly designate an independent organization to review the  operation of DCIPS.  The Secretary of Defense, the Director of the Office  of Personnel and Management, and the Director of National Intelligence  are required, under the act, to submit to the congressional oversight  committees a written report describing any actions that the Secretary has  taken or proposes to take in response to the report of the independent  organization. Additionally, the provisions require the Secretary of Defense  to submit to the congressional oversight committees a written description  of any actions taken or proposed to be taken by the Secretary in response  to GAO\u2019s review and recommendations regarding DCIPS. On November 3,  2009, the USD(I) stated in a memorandum to the defense intelligence  workforce, that the legislation did not repeal or terminate DCIPS, but  suspended certain provisions of the DCIPS pay-setting regulations until  December 31, 2010. The memorandum further noted that the National  Geospatial-Intelligence Agency would be the only defense intelligence  component to continue under all DCIPS regulations\u2014including all of the  performance-based pay adjustment processes included in the regulations.   According to the memorandum, eligible employees in the remaining  intelligence components will not receive a payout under DCIPS but will  receive scheduled increases equivalent to step increases under the General  Schedule structure, as well as the full General Pay Increase and locality  pay, in January.", "To address our first objective, we analyzed guidance issued by the  Director of National Intelligence and the USD(I) and interviewed key DOD  officials to determine the extent to which DOD has incorporated internal  safeguards identified in our prior work on human capital management  issues. Specifically, we assessed the extent to which DOD has  incorporated the following 10 performance management safeguards:      Assure that the agency\u2019s performance management system links  employee objectives to the agency\u2019s strategic plan, related goals, and  desired outcomes.  Implement a pay-for-performance evaluation system to better link  individual pay to performance and provide an equitable method for  appraising and compensating employees.", "Provide adequate training and retraining for supervisors, managers, and  employees in the implementation and operation of the performance  management system.  Institute a process for ensuring ongoing performance feedback and  dialogue between supervisors, managers, and employees throughout  the appraisal period and setting timetables for review.", "Assure that the agency\u2019s performance management system results in  meaningful distinctions in individual employee performance.", "Provide a means for ensuring that adequate agency resources are  allocated for the design, implementation, and administration of the  performance management system.", "Assure that there is an independent and credible employee appeals  mechanism.", "Assure that there are reasonable transparency and appropriate  accountability mechanisms in connection with the results of the  performance management process, including periodic reports on  internal assessments and employee survey results relating to  performance management and individual pay decisions while  protecting individual confidentiality.", "Involve employees in the design of the system, to include employees  directly involved in validating any related implementation of the  system.", "Adhere to merit principles set forth in section 2301 of title 5 of the U.S.", "Code. (For example, section 2301 (b)(2) deals with fair and equal  treatment, regardless of factors such as political affiliation, race, color,  sex, age, or handicapping condition and section 2301 (b)(8)(A) says  that employees should be protected against arbitrary action, personal  favoritism, and coercion for partisan political purposes.) (The merit  principles are listed in their entirety in appendix II.)", "To address our second objective, we examined the extent to which DOD  had mechanisms in place to identify employee perceptions about DCIPS  and reviewed DOD surveys and information about DCIPS on defense  intelligence component Web sites. We also reviewed town hall meetings  about DCIPS and interviewed headquarters level DCIPS staff responsible  for implementing DCIPS at each of the nine defense intelligence  components and the Defense Security Service. To obtain insight into  employee perceptions and opinions of DCIPS, we visited seven DOD  intelligence components and conducted 26 nongeneralizable discussion  groups.  For each of the seven DOD intelligence components, we  conducted separate discussion groups for employees and supervisors both  in the Washington, D.C., area at each organization\u2019s headquarters, as well  as at three field locations in the United States to determine if employee  perceptions varied by location.  While the information from our  discussion groups is not generalizable to the entire population of DOD  civilian intelligence personnel, this information provides insight into  civilian intelligence personnel perceptions about the implementation of  DCIPS.  However, other employees and supervisors under DCIPS who did  not participate in our discussion groups may have different perceptions.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2008 through  November 2009 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. A more thorough  description of our scope and methodology is provided in appendix III."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The authority for DOD to establish a pay-for-performance management  system for civilian defense intelligence employees originated in the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997.  Initially, in  1998, only the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency implemented Full  Pay Modernization for its employees.  Specifically, the Office of the  Secretary of Defense granted the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency  the authority to pilot test a pay-for-performance system. The National  Geospatial-Intelligence Agency eventually converted all of its employees  out of the General Schedule pay scale and into a system it called Total Pay  Compensation in 1999 and thus has been under that system for about 10  years.", "As stated previously, ODNI, with agreement from agencies and  departments in the Intelligence Community, established the overarching  evaluation and performance based pay framework for this community\u2014  the National Intelligence Civilian Compensation Program.  This framework  was established by Intelligence Community Directives, which among other  things, set common rating categories and performance standards that were  adopted by the Intelligence Community.  According to Intelligence  Community Directive 650, the Director of National Intelligence has the  responsibility to establish, in collaboration and coordination with the  heads of executive departments and independent agencies with  Intelligence Community employees, a set of unifying Intelligence  Community-wide principles, policies, and procedures governing the  compensation of civilian employees in the Intelligence Community.   DOD, in 2007, designated USD(I) as the organization responsible for  overseeing the implementation of DCIPS. USD(I) based DCIPS primarily  on the pay-for-performance system implemented at the National  Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Appendix IV shows the notable  differences between the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency\u2019s system  and DOD\u2019s DCIPS. Additionally, figure 1 outlines the U.S. Intelligence  Community\u2019s pay modernization efforts under the National Intelligence  Civilian Compensation Program framework. DCIPS is one of the first  systems to use this framework.", "DCIPS will be the performance management system applicable to DOD  civilian intelligence personnel in the DOD intelligence components, which  include the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Geospatial- Intelligence Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, the National  Security Agency, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Intelligence, and the intelligence elements of the military departments.", "Although not a defense intelligence component, the Defense Security  Service also converted to DCIPS.", "Implementation of DCIPS pay-for-performance began in September 2008  and consists of three specific phases: (1) Performance Management,  which focuses on the processes of setting expectations and objectives for  monitoring, rating, and rewarding employee performance; (2) Pay Bands,  which moves employee pay from the General Schedule/Government Grade  pay scale to the five pay ranges associated with a particular DCIPS work  category and work level; and (3) the First Performance Payout, which is  when employees will receive a combination of their performance-based  salary increase and their performance-based bonus increase for the first  time.

During this period,  employees, along with their supervisors\u2014who are also referred to as  rating officials\u2014collaborate to identify performance expectations and  outcome-focused objectives; engage in regular dialogue to monitor  performance throughout the year, including a required mid-point review;  develop performance strengths and skills; document achievements  through employee self-assessments and rating official assessments; and,  finally, conduct an end-of-year performance review.  At the end of the  performance evaluation period, the rating official completes an evaluation  of record for each of the employees they supervise. These evaluations of  record are then passed through two levels of review: first by reviewing  officials and then by the Performance Management Performance Review  Authority. Reviewing officials are responsible for coordinating with rating  officials in evaluating and rating the performance of employees.  Concurrent with the actions of the reviewing officials, the Performance  Management Performance Review Authority conducts a high-level review  of all evaluations of record and ratings across the component with the  intent of ensuring rigor and consistency across all supervisors and  reviewing officials and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  Within 45 days of the end of the performance evaluation period, all ratings  must be finalized and approved by the reviewing officials and the  Performance Management Performance Review Authority.", "The pay pool process begins at the same time as the performance  management process with the establishment of pay pool structures and  annual training to strengthen participants\u2019 understanding about the pay  pool process from October 1 to September 30. However, pay pools begin  their annual deliberations about employee salary increases and bonuses  after ratings are finalized. A pay pool is a group of individuals who share in  the distribution of a common pay-for-performance fund. Each employee is  assigned to a pay pool according to considerations regarding  organizational structure, geographic location, and/or occupation. Figure 3  illustrates a sample DCIPS pay pool structure, specifically the relationship  between the members of each pay pool\u2014the employee, supervisor or  rating official, reviewing official, pay pool panel, pay pool manager, and  performance review authority.", "Each of these pay pool members has defined responsibilities during the  annual deliberations and pay out process. The Pay Pool Performance  Review Authority, who can be either an individual or a panel of  individuals, oversees one or more pay pools to ensure procedural  consistency among the pay pools under its authority. The Pay Pool  Manager provides financial, scheduling, and business rules guidance for  the process; settles differences among panel members; and approves the  final pay pool panel recommendations. The Pay Pool Panel members,  which include reviewing officials and, in some cases, rating officials, are  responsible for determining performance-based salary increases and  bonuses using established pay pool guidance. Payouts are normally  effective on the first day of the first pay period following January 1 of the  new calendar year. The department issued overall guidance in September  2009 regarding its pay pool business rules.", "DCIPS is a pay-banded performance management system.  As such,  employees have converted or will convert from the General  Schedule/General Government system to five distinct pay bands. Under  the General Schedule/General Government system, salary is determined by  the 15-grade/10-step system. Pay banding consolidates these 15 grades  into five broad pay bands, and the DCIPS pay system establishes a salary  range for each pay band, with a minimum and a maximum pay rate.

In our 2009 High-Risk Series update, we identified the  importance of developing a clear linkage between individual employee  performance and organizational success and pointed out that the success  of implementing a performance management system is contingent on how,  when, and the basis on which it is done. However, at the end of this  review, legislation was signed by the President that contained provisions  that affect DCIPS. As mentioned previously, the USD(I) November 3, 2009,  memorandum to the defense intelligence workforce noted that the  legislation did not repeal or terminate DCIPS, but suspended certain  provisions of the DCIPS pay-setting regulations until December 31, 2010,  to allow for an independent review of DCIPS.  This memorandum also  stated that the department would continue to press forward with unifying  the defense Intelligence Community under a common personnel system  and specifically noted that the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency  would continue under all DCIPS regulations\u2014as allowed by the  legislation\u2014and would be the focus of the department\u2019s review of DCIPS.   We have acknowledged in prior work on performance management  systems that moving too quickly or prematurely could have detrimental  consequences for such systems.  The additional review of DCIPS efforts to  date may provide the department time needed to address any potential  issues and help ensure successful implementation.", "We have further reported that a basic framework is needed to implement  major reforms, including performance management systems.  Our prior  reports make it clear that incorporation of internal safeguards is  fundamental for the effective implementation of performance management  systems.  Further, we have reported that committed top leadership and  involving employees in a new performance management system is a  continuous process.  While we recognize that DOD faces many challenges  in changing the culture to implement a pay-for-performance system  capable of serving the entire DOD Intelligence Community, we believe that  it is imperative that DOD continue to explore ways to build employee  confidence in the system to help ensure the system\u2019s success.  By partially  incorporating the two safeguards we specifically mention, DOD could put  the fairness and credibility of DCIPS at risk.  However, given the newness  of DCIPS, constant monitoring of all safeguards is a prudent course of  action.  Further, without developing an evaluation plan that assesses  DCIPS, including the safeguards, the department will be unable to  determine if it is meeting its intended human capital reform goals.", "Finally, until DOD implements its mechanism to comprehensively and  accurately identify and measure employee perceptions, including  questions related to the safeguards such as the internal grievance process,  it is not well positioned to develop a strategy to effectively address  concerns raised by employees regarding DCIPS.

Farrell Director, Defense Capabilities (U) This responds to the November 12,2009 request for review of a draft report entitled \"DOD Civilian Personnel: Intelligence Personnel System Incorporates Safeguards, but Opportunities Exist for Improvement,\" GAO-I 0-134. (U) We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the draft report given the central role the ODNI played in recent development of Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel System (DCIPS) and the National Intelligence Civilian Compensation Program (NICCP), and the importance of those companion efforts to the Intelligence Community's overall transformation. Please find attached our suggested edits to the body of the report and our official comments for inclusion in the appendices. (U) Overall, we believe the tenor of the report is fair and balanced, Highlights are overly negative and should be modified to more accurately reflect the tone In addition, we believe the report should also emphasize that and body of the report. DCIPS and the NICCP are intended to meet the goals of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. Thus, the ODNI and DoD are pursuing these efforts as a means of integrating and unifying the Community under a single, common human capital policy framework, where the IC's agencies and elements have historically operated under as many as six separate statutory personnel systems. GAO has noted that common human capital policies can act as a powerful tool in support of organizational transformation, and no where is this more critical than in the Ie. We also believe the report should emphasize that DCIPS was authorized by statute in 1997 and is separate and distinct from the National Security Personnel System; the latter was authorized several years later and has taken a much different path with respect to its design and implementation. (U) In 2001 GAO identified human capital as a \"High Risk Area\" across the executive branch, and it has been a champion of civil service reform ever since. We applaud your efforts in that regard and believe that NICCP/DCIPS is consistent with the spirit and intent of GAO's views. We also appreciate your comprehensive review and thoughtful recommendations; we take them seriously and will work with DoD to implementthem insofar as possible.

While the overall tenor of the report is fair and balanced, we do feel obligated to make a couple of important points. The design of DCIPS complies with all IC Directives, which were developed after an extensive period of collaboration among IC agencies and elements. The policy design represents a serious consideration of lessons learned from best practices found in existing successful alternative pay systems (with particular attention paid to NGA). Furthermore, the IC did gather input (in 2006) from hundreds of IC employees during the policy development and program design phases. It has always been our intention to continue soliciting additional employee suggestions for process improvement at the conclusion of each annual performance and pay cycle.", "IC Directive 650 clearly lays out ten guiding principles which very closely align to the ten criteria chosen by GAO for their review. We agree that employees must be informed and educated on the details of the IC-wide program, as well as their department or agency's compensation and performance management systems. They are to be given the opportunity to provide feedback on the content of those systems and their implementation, and their feedback must be considered when those systems are developed, implemented, and administered. During the design and implementation phases of our change initiative, we made several changes based on employee feedback. For example, we decided to pass through to all employees the full general pay increase (unadjusted by performance results). We also modified our implementation schedules whenever the agencies or elements didn't feel their workforce was properly prepared to convert to DCIPS.", "Change is often difficult for employees to accept, and there will always be some who are uncomfortable with the rate of change. But we believe this is more a reflection of where DCIPS is in its implementation schedule then any material defect in the design. The feedback that will be the most valuable will only come after we have been allowed to run all the way through a pay-for-performance cycle so we can evaluate the results.", "Regarding safeguards, our ICDs clearly affirm the need for employee protections. We must provide rigorous oversight of the administration of IC compensation and performance management systems, including review mechanisms to guard against unlawful discrimination and partisan pressures, and other non-merit factors such as cronyism and favoritism. We must also ensure transparency of merit-based pay and performance decisions for employees. We acknowledge that DCIPS can and must be improved, and agree to work with USD(I) in an expeditious manner to address the areas you have identified. However, we strongly believe that DCIPS has been established on a strong foundation of policy directives and incorporates many best practices in its processes.
