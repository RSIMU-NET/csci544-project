However, in today's environment of fast-evolving information technology, federal agencies are creating vast and growing volumes of electronic records while continuing to create physical records in large numbers. Accordingly, GAO was asked to assess NARA's effectiveness in overseeing the governmentwide management of records, including commenting on its capacity to identify risk of unlawful destruction of federal records; describe its ability to preserve permanent records; and assess its policies, procedures, and plans supporting key management and oversight capabilities (collaboration, governance, and human capital). To do so, GAO analyzed NARA documentation in these areas, interviewed agency officials, and reviewed prior work."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The effectiveness of NARA's oversight has been improved by recent increases in its oversight activities: NARA has conducted its first governmentwide records management self-assessment survey, resumed agency inspections after a long gap, and expanded its reporting (including giving more complete information about specific agencies). These efforts have provided a fuller picture of governmentwide records management: in particular, NARA found that almost 80 percent of agencies were at moderate to high risk of unlawful destruction of records. Reporting of such results may also help influence agencies to give more priority to records management, which has historically been given low priority. However, these initiatives have limitations. For example, NARA's efforts to validate self-reported survey data are limited, as are its plans for inspections of agency records management; addressing these limitations could enhance the usefulness of these efforts as they continue to be developed. NARA also oversees agency records management through its review and approval of the schedules under which agencies may dispose of records. Following an extended effort to get agencies to schedule electronic records and systems, NARA increased the number of schedules approved per year. However, it has also increased the backlog of schedules awaiting its approval, increasing the risk that NARA's success in promoting scheduling could bring in more schedules than it can handle in a timely manner. NARA faces challenges in preserving permanent records largely because of their volume, the finite resources available, and the technological challenges posed by electronic records. NARA has a large and persistent backlog of records on paper and other media needing preservation actions. Although it treated nearly 116,000 cubic feet of at-risk archival records in fiscal year 2009, the percentage of backlog remained constant at about 65 percent, and holdings requiring preservation grew from about 2.4 million cubic feet in 2008 to about 2.6 million cubic feet in 2009. For electronic records, NARA has an electronic records archive system that is still under development and does not yet include planned preservation functions. Until the system and its preservation capabilities are fully implemented, there is reduced assurance that NARA can ensure the preservation of all electronic records. NARA's policies and procedures for collaboration, selected aspects of governance, and human capital are generally aligned with its strategic planning. For example, it is participating in numerous collaborative activities that support the goals and strategies in its strategic plan. However, more action is needed. For example, with regard to governance, although its organizational responsibilities are generally aligned with its strategic plan, NARA has not established an enterprise risk management capability, reducing its ability to anticipate future challenges and avoid potential crises. Finally, NARA has developed and begun to implement a strategic human capital plan, but this implementation has been delayed, which hinders the agency's ability to ensure that it has the workforce and skills it needs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making recommendations to help NARA build on its recent oversight activities and to fill gaps in its risk management and human capital management.

For  example, one general records schedule permits civilian agencies to  destroy case files for merit promotions (2 years after the personnel action  is completed or after an audit by the Office of Personnel Management,  whichever is sooner). No record may be destroyed or permanently  transferred to NARA unless it has been scheduled, so the schedule is of  critical importance.

In 1999, in reporting on  the substantial challenge of managing and preserving electronic records in  an era of rapidly changing technology, we noted that NARA did not have  governmentwide data on the electronic records management capabilities  and programs of all federal agencies. Accordingly, we recommended that  NARA conduct a governmentwide survey of these programs and use the  information as input to its efforts to re-engineer its business processes.  However, instead of doing a governmentwide baseline assessment survey  as we recommended, NARA planned to obtain information from a limited  sample of agencies, stating that it would evaluate the need for such a  survey later.", "In 2002, we reported that because NARA did not perform systematic  inspections of agency records management, it did not have comprehensive  information on implementation issues and areas where guidance needed  strengthening.

We recommended that it develop a strategy for conducting  systematic inspections of agency records management programs to  (1) periodically assess agency progress in improving records management  programs and (2) evaluate the efficacy of NARA\u2019s governmentwide  guidance.", "In response to our recommendations, NARA devised a strategy for a  comprehensive approach to improving agency records management that  included inspections and identification of risks and priorities.  Subsequently, it also developed an implementation plan that included  undertaking agency inspections based on a risk-based model, government  studies, or media reports.", "In 2008, we reported that under its oversight strategy, NARA had  performed or sponsored six records management studies in the previous 5  years, but it had not conducted any inspections since 2000 because it used  inspections only to address cases of the highest risk, and no recent cases  met its criteria. In addition, NARA\u2019s reporting to the Congress and OMB  did not consistently provide evaluations of responses by federal agencies  to its recommendations, as required, or details on records management  problems or recommended practices that were discovered as a result of  inspections, studies, or targeted assistance projects. Accordingly, we  recommended that NARA develop and implement an oversight approach  that provides adequate assurance that agencies are following NARA  guidance, including both regular assessments of agency records and  records management programs and reporting on these assessments.

Our past reports  identified persistent weaknesses in federal records management, including  a lack of policies and training. We also noted some of the challenges of  managing electronic records: For example, electronic information is being  created in volumes that pose a significant technical challenge to our ability  to organize and make it accessible. Electronic records range in complexity  from simple text files to highly complex formats with embedded  computational formulas and dynamic content, and new formats continue  to be created. Further, in a decentralized environment, it is difficult to  ensure that records are properly identified and managed by end users on  individual desktops (the \u201cuser challenge\u201d).

In  September 2009, NARA sent the first of a promised series of annual  mandatory records management self-assessment surveys to 242 federal  records officers from cabinet-level agencies, agency components, and  independent agencies; the survey\u2019s goal was to determine how effectively  agencies were meeting statutory and regulatory requirements for records  management. Agencies were asked 34 questions designed to obtain basic  information about agencies\u2019 records management programs in five areas:  program management, records disposition, vital records, electronic  records, and e-mail records. NARA used the data collected to categorize  agencies according to the level of risk to records associated with the state  of agencies\u2019 records management programs. According to NARA,  ineffective records management programs are the most significant  indicators of risk of unauthorized disposition of records.", "NARA\u2019s report on the self-assessment survey, released in April 2010,  described strengths and weaknesses in agencies\u2019 records management  programs. It concluded that almost 80 percent of agencies were at  moderate or high risk of improper destruction of records; that is, the risk  that permanent records will be lost or destroyed before they can be  transferred to NARA for archiving or that other records will be lost while  they are still needed for government operations or legal obligations. In  particular, of the 220 (91 percent) federal agencies and components that  responded, 36 percent were at high risk in their records management  programs and 43 percent were at moderate risk. Overall, only 21 percent of  federal agencies and components responding were at low risk. For  electronic records, 39 percent were at high risk, and for e-mail, 48 percent  were at high risk.

The self-assessment survey adds to NARA\u2019s  ability to assess the risk of unauthorized destruction of records by  increasing its broad knowledge of the status of agency records  management programs; previously, although NARA\u2019s regular work with  agencies on scheduling and disposition of records provided it insight into  agencies\u2019 activities at the end of the records life cycle, NARA officials  agreed that its insight into records management at earlier stages\u2014that is,  creation, maintenance, and use\u2014had been more limited.", "In addition, NARA\u2019s work conducting the self-assessment survey raised  issues for further study, such as the role of the departmental records  officer and appropriate level of records management staffing. It also  provided NARA with important operational experience to apply to  improving further surveys. According to the survey report, the results of  the first few self-assessments will provide a baseline for records  management in the federal government and, along with findings from  agency inspections and records management studies, will allow it to  assess more thoroughly records management within individual agencies  and throughout the federal government. NARA has committed to  conducting the self-assessment survey annually, and it conducted a second  survey in May and June 2010 (at the time of our review, NARA had not yet  published the results of this second survey).", "In addition, NARA has increased its reporting on the results of its  oversight activities. In the past, NARA had been reluctant to report  negative news about individual agencies\u2019 records management, which we  attributed to an organizational preference for using persuasion and  cooperation when working with agencies. We noted that this reduced its  ability to hold agencies accountable. In contrast, this year NARA reported  fully on the results (both negative and positive) of its self-assessment  survey and its electronic records systems scheduling project. The current  reports not only provide summary results and analysis, they also list each  agency or component\u2019s results individually. Also, besides sending the self- assessment report to the Congress and posting it on its Web site, NARA  made efforts to publicize the results, including announcements through a  press release, on Twitter, and on two blogs: those of the Archivist and of  NARA\u2019s National Records Management Program. Further, the evaluation  sections in NARA\u2019s performance and accountability reports for fiscal years  2008 and 2009 were more extensive than in 2007, and included sections on  challenges and risks. These sections discuss specific agencies where  NARA identified significant records management program risks and cases  of alleged unauthorized disposition of federal records. By widely reporting  results by agency, NARA has taken an important step toward improving  the visibility of records management to senior agency managers, the  Congress, and the public, potentially raising the priority that agencies  assign to records management.", "Although instituting and reporting fully on annual self-assessment surveys  is a positive step, the initial survey had limitations. In its report, NARA  identified issues that it considered to affect the reliability and usefulness  of the data in its first self-assessment survey. Specifically:    Not all regulated agencies were covered. According to NARA, its list of  agency records contacts, to whom it sent the surveys, was not always  accurate: the distribution list was incomplete, and some people included  on the list were not responsible for their agencies\u2019 records management  programs. In addition, NARA reported that some agencies did not return  surveys because they did not have an assigned records management  officer responsible for completing the task, they believed they were not  required to respond, or for other reasons, including inadvertent oversight.", "Another issue involves the roles of departmental and component-level  records officers. According NARA officials, scoring was affected by issues  related to NARA\u2019s level of knowledge of the responsibilities of each  department-level records officer. According to NARA, agencies of  comparable size and complexity might have one records officer answering  on behalf of the organization, or several component-level records officers  answering for each component. Some departments do not have a  departmental records officer. Some department-level records officers  responded for the entire organization, but, in at least one case, the  department-level contact did not respond and deferred to the components.", "Some questions were unclear or inapplicable. Although NARA ran a focus  group and pilot test to obtain feedback on the survey questions, it reported  that responses and comments indicated that the wording of some  questions was unclear. For instance, some respondents answered \u201cno\u201d  when their comments indicated they should have answered \u201cyes,\u201d and vice  versa. In addition, NARA found that some questions on the survey were  not applicable to very small organizations (less than 100 FTEs), but a \u201cno\u201d  answer reduced their score, so that these organizations were penalized  inappropriately in the scoring.", "NARA has taken steps to reduce the effect of these issues on the second  survey. According to NARA officials, they gathered additional information  on records contacts, including the areas covered by departmental records  officers, to ensure that the survey went to the appropriate contacts and  that NARA understood those contacts\u2019 areas of responsibility. In addition,  the second survey included numerous definitions and revisions that,  according to officials, were intended to clarify the survey.", "Another important limitation of the surveys as assessment tools is their  reliance on unvalidated self-reported data. In the first survey NARA did  little validation of agencies\u2019 self-reporting. According to NARA, its  appraisal archivists reviewed the information provided by the agencies,  and their comments were incorporated into the analysis. However,  according to the survey report, NARA otherwise \u201ctook agencies at their  word and did not attempt to verify submissions.\u201d For the second self- assessment survey (conducted in May\u2013June 2010), NARA asked  respondents each to supply one item of documentation\u2014the records  management directive or directives issued by the department\u2014as  validation. According to officials, they expected to use these directives not  only to validate certain responses, but also for analysis of features such as  the age of the directives and extent they covered the requirements of the  C.F.R. Officials also told us they are considering asking for additional  documentation in future years, such as training curricula and internal  evaluation reports. An official said that besides examining the directives,  they validated answers for 5 of the 55 questions by comparing them with  records schedule information that they track in-house.", "As NARA continues to perform self-assessment surveys, it will be  important for it to be assured that improvement (or deterioration) in  governmentwide and agency scores reasonably reflect actual performance.  Accordingly, validation of the results will be important both for the broad  assessment of federal records management and for the assessment of  individual agencies and programs. However, NARA has not yet developed  plans to use other means of validating responses, such as doing followup  interviews with respondents, requesting additional supporting documents,  or including questions in the survey on how response data were collected.  Without additional validation, confidence in the validity of the survey  results may be reduced, and they may be less effective for their intended  purposes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NARA Has Shifted Efforts from Records Management Studies to Targeted Inspections, but Inspection Plans Are Limited and Still Under Development", "paragraphs": ["According to NARA\u2019s strategic records management plan, the agency is  to conduct records management studies to focus on cross-government  issues, to identify and analyze best practices, and to develop  governmentwide recommendations and guidance.

In particular, flexible  scheduling (the first study in table 3) is a relatively recent approach that  allows so-called \u201cbig bucket\u201d or large aggregation schedules (that is, a  single schedule would cover all records relating to a work process, group  of work processes, or a broad program area to which the same retention  time would be applied). According to officials, NARA used the results of  its study to update its original 2005 bulletin on this topic; the update was  released in May 2010. In contrast, the second study in table 3 (on  recordkeeping technologies) was not used to feed into guidance, but to  provide helpful information to agencies: in particular, on other agencies\u2019  experience with implementing records management software and, in one  case, with e-mail archiving software being implemented at the Office of the  Secretary of Defense. The third study (on Web 2.0 use) was released in  September 2010; according to NARA, the study enabled the agency to  identify recommendations for future actions (such as clarifying the  definition of a federal record and integrating records management into  agency social media policy).", "NARA recently shifted its efforts from performing studies to conducting  inspections. From 2005 to 2008, NARA set objectives for and performed  one or two records management studies in each fiscal year. For 2010 and  2011, NARA\u2019s objectives did not include performing studies, but instead it  set an objective to perform one inspection in each year. According to  NARA officials, at the time the 2011 plan was developed, they had not  determined whether to conduct a study in that fiscal year or do additional  inspections; since then, they have decided to do additional inspections.", "NARA\u2019s plan to perform records management inspections in fiscal years  2010 and 2011 reflects a resumption of NARA\u2019s agency inspection program  in response to our 2008 recommendation.

(In contrast, its previous approach involved more comprehensive reviews  of agency records programs.)", "To set up the inspection program, NARA took a number of steps: it revised  its requirements, developed criteria for doing inspections, chose its first  inspection targets, and has begun performing inspections. NARA added a  new section of its regulations that defines the conditions under which it  may undertake an inspection and how the inspection will be initiated and  carried out with the agency. Under the final rule, published on October 2,  2009, \u201cinspection\u201d is defined as a formal review and report by NARA of an  agency\u2019s recordkeeping processes that focus on significant records  management problems affecting records at risk that meet one or more of  the following criteria: (1) they have a direct and high impact on legal rights  or government accountability; (2) they are the subject of high-profile  litigation, congressional attention, or widespread media coverage; (3) they  have high research potential; or (4) they are permanent records with a  large volume, regardless of format.", "For fiscal year 2010, NARA chose to perform two inspections, both at the  Department of Defense: an inspection at the Office of the Secretary of  Defense (OSD) looking at three aspects of records management and one at  the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). According to a NARA  official, the inspection at the NGA, planned to begin in 2010, will not be  completed until 2011. Table 4 describes these inspections.", "At the time of our engagement, NARA had not issued planned reports on  the results of the OSD inspections, and, according to an agency official,  planning for the inspection at NGA was still in an early stage.", "Resuming inspections is an important step, because inspections provide  information in more detail on actual performance and particular records  issues; however, the inspection program currently planned is limited.  NARA\u2019s plan commits to conducting one inspection per year for fiscal  years 2010 and 2011, and officials told us they were considering one or two  inspections per year. According to one NARA official, NARA is unwilling  to commit to more inspections because it has other priorities for the  appraisal archivist staff, which also performs appraisals and scheduling,  conducts studies, and works on the self-assessment survey and other  special projects. (According to a NARA records management official, of  the 100 staff of the National Records Management Program, approximately  50 are appraisal archivists, who work with about 245 agencies or  components.)", "NARA\u2019s planning for its inspection program is at a high level and is still  under development. According to its 2009 methodology for self- assessments and inspections, NARA will develop a list of agency  inspection targets based partially on the self-assessment results, develop  inspection plans, and conduct inspections. The plan identifies 20  conditions that the records management staff is to consider to help  determine whether an agency may be an inspection candidate. (Examples  include nonresponses to NARA\u2019s surveys, out-of-date agency records  management manuals, requests from an agency head, and unresolved  unauthorized destructions.) These are conditions that management is to  assess in making inspection decisions\u2014a checklist of risk factors to  consider.

For example, the  agency has not yet described how it might distribute inspections among  agencies or what topics it would like to cover over a period of years.  Similarly, although NARA plans to perform multi-agency inspections, it has  not yet developed plans to do so by, for example, defining key practices  and determining how to inspect these at multiple sites. NARA\u2019s plan states  that self-assessment and inspection activities will help NARA monitor how  federal agencies manage their records, but it does not address how one or  two inspections a year would provide effective monitoring or how it would  best organize a limited number of inspections to accomplish this goal.", "NARA activities alone cannot solve the persistent problems facing federal  records management, since agency heads are responsible for their  agencies\u2019 records and records management, as well as for allocating  resources to these, and as we have pointed out in the past, records  management has historically received low priority. Nonetheless, shedding  light on the status of governmentwide records management can help focus  both agencies and NARA on areas needing improvement and the need to  devote resources to these areas. NARA\u2019s renewed inspection program has  the potential not only to help motivate agencies to improve records  management, but also to contribute to the systematic collection of  comprehensive information for assessing progress. However, NARA\u2019s  plans do not explain how it will systematically target and leverage a  limited number of inspections to help achieve its goals.

NARA  has identified unscheduled records as an important indicator of the risk of  unauthorized destruction of records.", "NARA has been making efforts to get agencies to schedule unscheduled  records in computer systems. This project, which it refers to as the  Electronic Records Project, was initiated in response to the requirements  of the E-Government Act. In December 2005 NARA issued a bulletin  requiring agencies by September 30, 2009, to submit records schedules to  NARA for all electronic systems of records existing as of December 17,  2005, and it has periodically requested agencies to provide summary  reports documenting their progress. After the 2009 deadline expired,  NARA issued, in February 2010, an additional bulletin reminding agencies  of their continuing responsibility to schedule all their electronic records  series and systems and requiring them to report semiannually on the status  of their electronic records scheduling activities.", "In fiscal year 2009, the number of schedules received jumped from 549 the  previous year to 974, which NARA attributes to its efforts to hold agencies  to the September 2009 deadline. Although this result is encouraging, it also  led to an increase in NARA\u2019s backlog of schedules to be processed and  approved. The number of schedules submitted increased by more than  400, while the number closed out increased by only about 100, from 402 to  501; as a result, the approval backlog increased from 575 to 1048. NARA\u2019s  processing capacity reached a high of 501 schedules closed out in 2009, so  the current backlog represents about 2 years\u2019 work for appraisal staff,  assuming that that they go on approving schedules at the current rate, and  that no other schedules are submitted in the meantime.", "NARA\u2019s schedule approval process occurs in four steps (see table 5)  involving professional analysis and judgment, as well as input from the  public.", "NARA estimates that it generally takes approximately 6 months or less to  process simple schedules for records that are clearly temporary and do  not have legal rights implications, with almost 4 months of this time period  taken by the public comment process. It may take up to a year for NARA  to process large and complex schedules requiring closer review or eliciting  critical public comments. According to NARA, the median time for it to  approve a schedule has historically been about 300 calendar days.", "NARA is trying to shorten its approval process and increase its capacity to  process schedules despite limited resources. It has about 100 people  working on records management, about half of whom work on appraisal  and scheduling. The director of the Lifecycle Management Division (within  Modern Records Programs) said the records management program aimed  to increase approvals of records schedules covering electronic records by  about 10 percent a year, and that staff are working on streamlining the  scheduling process. For example, the program has reduced the time  allowed for public comment by 15 days, and staff are using e-mail rather  than letters to communicate and send responses to requests from Federal  Register requesters. The official also described future projects, including a  project to improve the scheduling and appraisal workflow and a large  project to revise the General Records Schedules, which should have the  effect of reducing the number of schedules that agencies will have to  submit, thereby improving NARA\u2019s ability to keep up with other submitted  schedules.", "Although these efforts may help to streamline the process, the number of  records and systems that remain to be scheduled is likely very large.  Currently, the Director of Lifecycle Management said that they are unable  to estimate \u201cthe universe of electronic records,\u201d although they are  confident that it is a \u201cbig number.\u201d For example, in 2006, NARA requested  information from agencies on outstanding systems to be scheduled and  received answers from 54 agencies, for a total of about 8,500 systems.", "Other indications also support the conclusion that many records remain  unscheduled. For example, NARA\u2019s electronic records summary report  indicated that many electronic records were still unscheduled. As of  September 30, 2009, based on 240 federal agencies and components:    For 14 percent of agencies, schedules were submitted for 59 percent or  fewer of their e-records (these were characterized as high risk).", "For 11 percent of agencies, schedules were submitted for 60 to 89 percent  of their e-records (these were characterized as moderate risk).", "For 42 percent of agencies, schedules were submitted for 90 percent of  more of their e-records (these were characterized as low risk).    33 percent of agencies did not submit reports.", "Further, NARA\u2019s agency self-assessment indicated that 27 percent of  agencies responding had scheduled fewer than half of their electronic  systems. The survey did not ask for the numbers of systems remaining  unscheduled; however, NARA\u2019s February 2010 bulletin requires agencies  to list unscheduled systems. As agencies comply with this requirement,  such lists should provide a basis for a better estimate.", "NARA thus faces the risk that if its efforts to get agencies to submit  schedules for outstanding agency systems continue to be successful, it will  be unprepared to deal with the workload. The jump in its backlog  associated with the 2009 deadline for scheduling electronic systems  suggests that this is a real concern. NARA has acknowledged that in light  of the volume and complexity of electronic records increasing each year,  keeping pace with the requirements to schedule all existing electronic  records is a continuing challenge for both NARA and agencies. However,  it has not assessed the risk that it may be unable to keep up with  schedules submitted, nor has it developed plans to mitigate that risk.

In 2009, NARA  reported that 65 percent of its archival holdings were in need of some  preservation action. NARA defined \u201cin need of preservation action\u201d as  that there was an imminent threat to the record, and the information it  contained could not be accessed due to condition. According to NARA, it  was conservative in this assessment, focusing on whether records could  be safely served to researchers in their existing state and housing. For  example, even though poor quality, chemically unstable boxes are not  ideal for archival preservation, they would not be considered to require  preservation action (that is, replacement); however, a box that did not  adequately support the records would, since records that are not well  supported are likely to be damaged.", "NARA has set a strategic goal of reducing the backlog to 50 percent by  2016.

Risk management is the  continuous process of assessing such risks, reducing the potential that an  adverse event will occur, and putting steps in place to deal with any event  that does occur. Without an effective program of risk assessment and  internal control, management may have less assurance that it is using  organizational resources effectively and efficiently, or that agency assets  and operations are protected. As our previous work has shown, and as  called for by the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, agencies should continuously and systematically monitor  their internal and external environments to anticipate future challenges  and avoid potential crises.", "GAO has developed a framework for risk management (see figure 3) that  identifies five major phases: (1) setting strategic goals and objectives, and  determining constraints; (2) assessing the risks; (3) evaluating alternatives  for addressing these risks; (4) selecting the appropriate alternatives; and  (5) implementing the alternatives and monitoring the progress made and  results achieved.", "Our work has shown that decisions for enterprisewide risk management  should be made in the context of an organization\u2019s strategic plan, and  organizations should have risk planning documents that address risk- related issues that are central to the organization\u2019s mission.", "According to NARA program officials, NARA currently performs risk  management for the ERA project, its major system investment. The agency  manages ERA\u2019s risks using an agency-level risk review board, a program- level risk review board, and a technical risk review team. In addition,  officials stated that the ERA program office produces monthly reports that  include top identified risks and specify associated mitigation strategies.  Risk status is communicated to senior NARA management and OMB on a  monthly basis and Congress on a quarterly basis. The project uses an  automated tool to track and manage risk.", "However, although NARA has identified important risks facing the agency,  it currently has no dedicated active function to manage these risks at the  enterprise level. Some risks of which NARA is aware include  technological change causing record formats to become obsolete and  unreadable,  failure of the ERA project, and   effects of climate change or natural disasters (such as on continuity of  operation, preservation requirements, locations of facilities, and energy  use).", "According to NARA officials, the organization had a risk review board,  which existed for about 2 years, but it became inactive. This occurred  because the board\u2019s discussion of risk tended to focus either on project  and program risks or highly generic risks.", "NARA officials told us that the agency has also relied on a work group of  senior executives, the Lifecycle Guidance Team, to address enterprisewide  risks. However, as currently established, the Lifecycle Guidance Team  does not explicitly focus on enterprise risk management. The members of  this team, chaired by the Deputy Archivist, are members of NARA\u2019s senior  staff. However, although the team is at an appropriate level of seniority  to address enterprise risk management, this function is not part of its  charter. According to the charter, the group focuses on ensuring that  NARA\u2019s records lifecycle initiatives are effectively coordinated, integrated,  and implemented agencywide, and it provides leadership and oversight to  initiatives to advance the agency\u2019s mission and strategic goals and improve  records, information, and knowledge management governmentwide.  Among the initiatives it is reviewing or has reviewed are systems in  operation or in development, for which project risks have been discussed.  However, these risks are not enterprise risks.", "According to NARA officials, the development of a new process and  system for internal control has recently been proposed.

Sound human capital strategic planning  provides the essential context for making sensible, fact-based choices  about designing, implementing, and evaluating human capital  approaches. It is critical to ensuring that agencies have the talent and  skill mix they need to address their current and emerging human capital  challenges.", "Our research shows that to be effective, a strategic approach should use  data-driven methods to (1) assess the knowledge and skills needed;  (2) inventory existing staff knowledge and skills; (3) forecast the  knowledge and skills needed over time; (4) analyze the gaps in capabilities  between the existing staff and future workforce needs, including  consideration of evolving program and succession needs caused by  turnover and retirement; and (5) formulate strategies for filling expected  gaps, including training and additional hiring.

Linked to the agency\u2019s overall  strategic plan, this strategic plan discusses strategies for achieving each of  its five human capital goals: strategic alignment, leadership and knowledge  management, results-oriented performance culture, talent management,  and accountability.", "The strategic plan includes a set of improvements that would give NARA  the capability to strategically manage its human capital, as called for in our  human capital framework. Specifically, section 3, \u201cWorkforce Planning,\u201d  includes all five of the elements of our strategic human capital framework.  The plan also includes related goals, such as being able to hire people  faster by automating manual and paper-based processes; NARA\u2019s Director  of Human Resources cited this as one of the agency\u2019s highest priorities.", "The agency has taken some initial steps to implement its plan. For  example, it has completed a pilot of a competency development approach  in which it modeled the competencies required for all positions in the  Modern Records Program and in the Information Security Oversight  Office; it is currently assessing the accuracy and effectiveness of the  competency models developed under the pilot. Modeling competencies\u2014 determining the skills needed for specific positions\u2014is a key tool for  determining what skills NARA will need to meet organizational goals.  Once competency modeling is completed, NARA will be in a position to  forecast future workforce skills needs. It is also currently finalizing  guidance for workforce planning, another part of the process of  forecasting future workforce needs. Finally, it has completed a pilot for an  online training needs assessment tool. The results are currently being  analyzed, and a report is tentatively scheduled for September.", "However, NARA is falling behind in the implementation of its human  capital management milestones. For fiscal year 2010, NARA set 72  milestones for implementing the strategic plan. However, as of the end of  the third quarter, 23 milestones had been met, 14 were missed, 3 future  milestones were pushed further back, and 8 had other weaknesses, such  as lacking a specific date or status update. Of the remaining 24, some are  not due yet, and some were periodic actions with no single due date (see  figure 5). An example of a missed milestone specifically related to our  strategic human capital framework is the development of an agencywide  workforce plan that includes a hiring projections worksheet. In addition,  NARA has not completed an inventory of existing workforce skills.  Without a complete skills needs forecast and a current skills inventory, it  cannot perform a gap analysis and consequently cannot plan future human  capital initiatives, three of the steps of our strategic human capital  framework.", "The agency\u2019s human capital officials stated that milestones had been  missed or pushed back because they had to address other priorities,  including realigning staff to address the requirement to comply with the  Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) 2009 Hiring Reform and the May  2010 Presidential Hiring Reform Initiatives.", "To its credit, in responding to these initiatives, NARA is making progress  on addressing its hiring process. Hiring is an important part of strategic  human capital management, since hiring is a critical tool for addressing  skills gaps. According to NARA, as of September 2009, it had an overall  average time to fill a position of 163 to 213 days. In contrast, the model set  up by OPM called for an 80-day hiring process. Responding to OPM\u2019s 2009  Hiring Reform, NARA\u2019s Hiring Process Action Plan (submitted to OPM in  December 2009) identified primary barriers to a timely and effective hiring  process. According to the plan, an important barrier was the agency\u2019s  paper-based application process, including manual routing of forms.  During NARA\u2019s hiring process, its staff manually printed, reviewed, and  annotated hundreds of applications at several stages in order to verify and  screen applications. The agency also experienced a 45 to 90 day backlog of  hiring actions, which NARA officials attributed largely to reliance on  paper-based hiring systems. NARA determined that without an automated  staffing system to screen applications, addressing the other barriers  identified in its action plan would have only a marginal impact on its  overall time to fill a position.", "To address this barrier, NARA piloted and implemented automated hiring  software, called USA Staffing, provided by OPM. This Web-based system  automates the recruitment, assessment, referral, and notification  processes, reducing the degree of human intervention required in the  hiring process. According to NARA, the agency implemented the USA  Staffing tool in May 2010, and as of July 2010, it reported reducing the  average time-to-hire to 126.5 days. Agency human capital officials told us  they believed further reductions were likely as the staff becomes more  familiar with the new tool.", "NARA continues to work on its hiring process in response to the May 2010  Presidential Hiring Reform Initiative, which set a deadline of November 1,  2010, for federal agencies to adopt certain streamlined hiring procedures,  including eliminating knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA) essays,  allowing applicants to apply using resumes and cover letters, and involving  the managers and supervisors responsible for hiring in the complete hiring  process.", "Agency human capital officials believe that these improvements will result  in a more efficient hiring process. However, the reforms under the  Presidential Initiative are still ongoing. Further, because the adoption of  the new staffing system is still recent, it is not possible to fully evaluate its  impact.", "In addition, for the hiring process to be fully effective, it is important that  NARA implement its strategic human capital plan and particularly that it  complete its skills needs analysis and gap analysis. Such analyses are  crucial for effectively determining hiring needs; they are also important for  helping determine how to allocate personnel to mission areas in which  NARA has identified resource-related backlogs, such as records  management and preservation. Until NARA completes these analyses,  there is no assurance that the agency will be able to manage its human  capital strategically, ensuring that it has staff with the right competencies  to perform its mission now and in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NARA Engages in Collaborative Efforts That Further Strategic Goals", "paragraphs": ["As a small agency with a broad mission, NARA has stressed the  importance of collaborative efforts in achieving the organization\u2019s goals.

The strategic plan itself emphasizes collaboration and  partnering. It spells out six strategic goals, for each of which the plan  describes a number of specific strategies. For five of the six goals in the  strategic plan, either one or two of the specific strategies are directly  related to collaboration and partnership; table 8 shows the specific  strategies associated with each strategic goal.", "NARA has established or begun to establish collaborative efforts that are  generally aligned with all these goals and strategies. For example, for the  third strategic goal, which focuses specifically on electronic records, the  specific strategy related to collaboration is to partner with agencies,  research institutions, and private industry to develop, implement, manage,  and promote NARA\u2019s electronic records program. According to its  workplan, multiple efforts in this area are planned to be managed by  NARA\u2019s Center for Advanced Systems and Technologies (NCAST) within  the Office of Information Services. NCAST serves as lead for collaborating  in information technology research and development with  governmentwide, interagency, professional, and academic organizations.  Among other things, NCAST is to organize, sponsor, and participate in  research in computer science, archival science, and related technologies  capable of improving the lifecycle management of records.", "In support of this responsibility, NCAST has both planned and completed  collaborative research agreements with partners that include federal  organizations and consortia, industry, and academia, including the  National Science Foundation. For example, NCAST has worked with the  Records Management Services Working Group of the Object Management  Group (OMG), an international, open membership, not-for-profit  standards-setting consortium of the computer industry and other  information technology organizations, on the creation of new software  specifications for records management. The working group identified  and documented key requirements for records management functionalityin systems that manage electronic records.

One of these is the NARA-chaired Advisory Committee on  the Electronic Records Archives. According to its charter, this committee  brings together experts from many different fields to make  recommendations to the Archivist on development of ERA, and its  membership includes experts from private organizations with an interest  in records management, members of academia, researchers, and state  officials with responsibility for electronic records. NARA also established  the Federal Records Council to provide advice and support from other  federal agencies to the Archivist on all aspects of records management,  with special emphasis on the management of electronic records.  Membership on the council, as stated in its charter, includes  representatives from OMB and GSA, officials from cabinet-level  departments, and representatives from communities such as science,  intelligence, and the federal court system. Several other organizations  outside of these groups have also sent members to Federal Records  Council meetings. Members are departmental records officers and officials  from other divisions with records management responsibilities, such as  information technology, information security and privacy, and Web  content. According to its charter, the council contributes strategic advice  and support to the Archivist in issuing records management guidance, and  provides a mechanism for agencies to work together to identify strategies  and best practices for electronic information and records issues.", "In one instance (the second strategic goal, involving the accessioning and  processing of records), NARA did not set a specific strategy related to  collaboration. However, in discussing this goal, the strategic plan refers to  seeking out and developing partnerships to assist in improving work  processes to deal with a backlog of holdings that had been accessioned, or  legally transferred to NARA\u2019s possession, but not yet processed.  (Processing involves such steps as flagging records based on  classification, providing enhanced descriptions of the content of the  records, and making records available to the public.) In support of this  goal, NARA has established, for example, a working agreement with a  private company through which the company would provide metadata for  digitized NARA information according to the agency\u2019s standards.  According to an official, having these metadata would provide the agency  with more information about the content of the records, which assists in  their processing.", "Table 9 summarizes NARA\u2019s collaborative efforts related to its strategic  goals and provides examples.", "NARA\u2019s Open Government Plan describes further collaborative initiatives  in addition to these.

Among these is a collaboration with the Department of Justice on the  development of a dashboard that would provide information on agencies\u2019  performance in fulfilling Freedom of Information Act requests. Another is  collaborating with academic law and policy groups, such as the Legal  Information Institute at Cornell University and the Center for Innovative  Technology Policy at Princeton University.", "Furthermore, in accordance with the open government principles of  transparency, participation, and collaboration, NARA has established new  collaborative efforts with the public. For example, according to its Open  Government Plan, NARA used Ideascale, a commercial collaboration  platform, to gather perspectives from the public on the content of the plan.

This will require that it continue to build and  improve its oversight activities, including studies, surveys, inspections,  and reporting. As NARA continues to refine its approach to oversight, it  will be important for it to consider how to validate self-assessment data  (for example, by doing followup interviews) and how to strategically plan  inspections to maximize their value as oversight tools, by, for example,  defining key practices and inspecting these at multiple sites. Further, it  will also be important going forward for NARA to assess the risk that its  capacity to process and approve schedules may not be sufficient to meet  the demand.", "As an agency with a broad mission, NARA faces numerous challenges, for  which its strengths in seeking collaborative opportunities should be  helpful.
