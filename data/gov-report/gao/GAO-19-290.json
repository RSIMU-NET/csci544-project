According to Federal Transit Administration (FTA) officials, the best information available is an August 2015 report developed by the Department of Transportation (DOT) and other federal stakeholders to produce transportation job projections. However, the report's transit data are combined with ground passenger transportation data (e.g., school buses, taxis), and many of these services are specifically excluded from the statutory definition of transit. Transit-specific data were not available and would be costly to obtain, according to the researchers who wrote the report. Thus, the report does not exclusively reflect the transit workforce. The views of stakeholders GAO interviewed varied regarding whether additional workforce data were needed. Working with stakeholders to understand what, if any, additional information is needed could enable FTA to weigh the complete costs and benefits of developing future transit workforce data.

We conducted interviews with a selection of transit  agencies and stakeholders. We selected a non-generalizable sample of  eight stakeholders, which included two research organizations, two  unions, two trade groups, one membership association of workforce  boards, and one transportation-consulting firm. In addition, we  interviewed officials from six transit agencies we selected for size and  geographic diversity (western, central, and eastern U.S.), among other  factors.

Transit infrastructure for those rides  includes railways, roads, bridges, tunnels, and stations. According to the  2017 American Public Transportation Association\u2019s (APTA) Fact Book,  more than 6,700 organizations provided public transportation in a variety  of modes in 2015. Transit modes include:  fixed-route bus services\u2014the most prevalent transit mode in the  country\u2014vehicles operate according to regular schedules along  prescribed routes with designated stops;  rail services\u2014vehicles operating along railways;  ferryboat services\u2014vessels carrying passengers and/or vehicles over  a body of water; paratransit services\u2014generally, accessible, origin-to-destination  transportation services that operate in response to calls or requests  from riders; and other demand-response services\u2014sometimes called \u201cdial-a-ride.\u201d", "Public transportation, or transit, is statutorily defined as regular,  continuing shared-ride surface transportation services that are open to  the general public or open to a segment of the general public defined by  age, disability, or low income. This definition has multiple statutory  exclusions including intercity bus service, school bus service, and charter  bus service.", "The transit infrastructure requires appropriately trained personnel to  operate, maintain, and oversee services and assets (e.g., vehicles).  APTA estimated that, in 2015, U.S. public transit agencies employed  more than 430,000 fulltime and part-time personnel, including contractors.  The transit workforce consists of a variety of occupations, such as bus  operators, train conductors, dispatchers, mechanics, supervisors, and  other occupations (see fig. 1 for examples.)", "FTA supports transit agencies\u2019 workforce development by providing  financial and technical assistance, among other things. FTA\u2019s financial  assistance efforts include implementing the Innovative Public  Transportation Frontline Workforce Development Program, which  provides competitive grants to transit agencies (transit workforce grants)  to assist with the development of innovative human resources activities.  FTA awarded transit workforce grants in fiscal years 2011, 2012, and  2015. Grant-eligible projects included employment training, outreach to  increase minority and female employment in transit, research on transit  personnel and training needs, and training and assistance for minority  business opportunities. Grant recipients included transit agencies, non- profit community groups, schools, and others. Additionally, recipients can  use up to one-half of one percent of certain grant funds, such as  Urbanized Area Formula Grants, for eligible human resources and  training activities with the approval of DOT.", "FTA also administers the National Transit Database (NTD), which is  intended to provide information to assist in transit planning efforts. All  recipients and direct beneficiaries of grants from the Urbanized Area  Formula Program and Rural Area Formula Program, such as local  transit agencies, are required to report certain data to the NTD. FTA  also encourages agencies not receiving grants from these programs to  report voluntarily so the NTD can be more complete. In 2016, over 2000  transit agencies submitted full or partial reports to the NTD. The NTD  stores information from local transit agencies, such as financial and  operating data, to inform transit service planning for government agencies  and other organizations. Some workforce data, such as the number of  full-time and part-time transit agency employees, is reported to the NTD.  NTD data provide information on the transit workforce at the time the data  are reported, but are not used to project future transit workforce needs.", "FTA partners with the National Transit Institute (NTI), hosted and staffed  by Rutgers University, to provide workforce development educational  resources and training. NTI delivers over 300 courses per year  nationwide to public transit employees and government transportation  agency employees at all levels. These courses focus on compliance with  federal regulations and developing skills to operate a transit agency.", "At the department level, in August 2015, DOT, DOL, and the Department  of Education worked with industry stakeholders to project the employment  and skill needs of the transportation industry from 2012 to 2022. Primary  sources for the report included the DOL\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics  (BLS) employment projections, current population survey (demographics),  and analysis from Economic Modeling Specialists International. The effort  developed a variety of transportation workforce statistics and resulted in  the Strengthening Skills Training and Career Pathways Across the  Transportation Industry: Data Report on Future Transportation Workforce  Needs (Transportation Industry Report). Among other things, the report: projected that an additional 4.6 million transportation workers will  need to be hired to fill vacancies created by separations (occupational  transfers, retirement, and other exits from the workplace), and net job  growth from 2012 to 2022; provided data on current worker distribution (at that time) by age and  sex for six transportation sectors and by race and ethnicity for  selected transportation occupations; and  included top job occupations by sector and projected industry and  occupational job openings based on separations and job growth."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Information Exists on Future Transit Workforce Needs", "paragraphs": ["The extent of future transit workforce needs is unclear due to the absence  of transit-specific workforce projections, unclear communication on the  data that are available, and because the data that are available do not  extend past 2022.

The Transportation Industry Report  does have projections on transportation workforce needs, but the transit  industry data are combined with other ground passenger transportation  industries such as intercity buses, charter buses, taxis, school buses, and  limousines. Thus, the report does not exclusively reflect the transit  workforce.", "According to researchers who wrote the report, the transit and ground  passenger transportation data were reported as one industrial sector  because it would be a significant undertaking to focus solely on transit  workforce data without funding a study for this specific area. The  Transportation Industry Report was developed with data, in part, from  BLS, which does not exclusively report on occupational projections for  public transportation. BLS develops workforce projections of the U.S.  labor market by industry, subsector, and occupational codes, including  the number of employees and types of employers. BLS officials we  interviewed said that industry and occupational data sets do not allow the  level of specificity that would be needed to identify only transit agencies.", "The Transportation Industry Report predicted 1 million job openings in the  transit and ground passenger transportation sector from 2012 to 2022  and listed the top 10 projected job openings. However, these projected  job openings include a number of occupations within services that are  statutorily excluded from the definition of transit. For example, the three  largest categories of job openings\u2014comprising about 72 percent of the  projected openings\u2014have the following key transit exclusions:", "School bus and special client bus drivers made up approximately  33 percent of the projected openings (330,699 job openings).  However, school bus services are specifically excluded from the  statutory definition of transit, as are sightseeing services, charter bus  services, courtesy shuttle services for patrons of one or more specific  establishments, and intra-terminal or intra-facility shuttle services.", "Transit and intercity bus drivers made up almost 20 percent of the  projected openings (199,727 job openings). However, intercity bus  service (for example, Greyhound bus service) is specifically excluded  from the statutory definition of transit.", "Taxi drivers and chauffeurs made up almost 19 percent of the  projected openings (188,895 job openings). However, these services  may not meet the statutory definition of transit.", "However, when communicating about the report, FTA has not always  made clear that the data in the Transportation Industry Report combine  both transit and ground passenger transportation workforce projections,  though this was not intentional, according to FTA officials. FTA has  presented the combined data as representing the \u201ctransit\u201d or \u201cpublic  transit\u201d workforce in recent annual reports to Congress and a few public  presentations. For example, one of the findings in the Transportation  Industry Report is that the combined sector of transit and ground  passenger transportation has the highest percentage of older workers  who are at or nearing retirement age. However, in recent reports to  Congress, FTA states that, public transit has the highest percentage of  older workers at or nearing retirement age. However, this statement did  not reflect that the percentages included transit and ground passenger  transportation data. We also found similar information involving retirement  percentages and job openings in a number of FTA presentations that are  available to the public online. In addition, we found two examples of  incorrect numbers in recent reports to Congress that FTA officials said  were \u201ctypos\u201d that have now been corrected in the most recent fiscal year  2017 report.", "FTA\u2019s characterization of this data could confuse transit stakeholders,  including Congress, on needs, retirements, and growth in the transit  industry. When FTA identifies combined information as \u201ctransit\u201d  projections, the audience may not understand the extent to which the  data reflect services that do not meet the statutory definition of transit. We  found evidence that this may have already occurred to some extent.  During our review, we found examples of stakeholders in the industry  repeating the same statistics that FTA has presented as \u201ctransit\u201d in  publications and in our interviews with them, raising questions about  whether the industry may have misconceptions about the future transit  workforce. FTA officials told us that the combination of transit and ground passenger transportation is appropriate because of similarities in the  industries and the common practice of transit agencies hiring contractors  from ground passenger transportation to supplement workforce  personnel. However, the context of this information has not always been  clear in reports to external parties.", "Further, the Transportation Industry Report\u2019s projections on the future  transportation workforce are only estimated through 2022. DOT officials  said that they do not have plans to update the report beyond 2022 or to  develop a report that focuses solely on transit workforce projections. FTA  officials told us that they plan to hire a data scientist to assist them with  transit workforce issues. FTA officials also told us in November 2018, that  the report was intended to provide trend information and that they do not  plan to use the transit numbers from the Transportation Industry Report in  future reports and presentations, and considering that the report will soon  reach the end of its projections in 2022, we are not making a  recommendation about how to communicate the context of the  information in the Transportation Industry Report.", "Opinions on the need for additional transit workforce data and projections  varied among transit stakeholders we interviewed. Several stakeholders  cited the difficulties of collecting transit-specific projections or other types  of data, while others pointed to the need for more data such as data  identifying shortages in specific occupations and retirement age of transit  employees. However, officials from the Community Transportation  Association of America, which represents small and rural transit agencies,  said that requiring additional data from transit agencies could be a time- consuming burden for local transit officials. The association officials  suggested that transit stakeholders should work together to use existing  workforce data from FTA or BLS to develop workforce projection data.  Transportation Research Board officials also said that additional transit  workforce data would be costly and difficult for transit agencies to provide.  However, the Director of Eno\u2019s Center for Transportation Leadership, a  research organization, stated that it is extremely difficult to develop  national policies, programs, and grants to address systemic workforce  problems because of the gaps in transit workforce data.", "Federal Internal Control Standards highlight the importance of using  quality information to make informed decisions and identifying the  information requirements needed to do so while considering the  expectations of internal and external users. While the views of  stakeholders we interviewed varied on the extent to which additional  transit workforce data and projections are needed, new transit workforce  projections could inform decision-making on transit workforce planning to  address potential future shortages or other needs. We have previously  reported that agencies should weigh data collection decisions carefully,  noting that there is a cost to data collection, and that only needed data  should be collected.

Focusing on the intended  results of FTA\u2019s transit workforce efforts can promote strategic and  disciplined management decisions that are more likely to be effective  because managers are better able to target areas most in need of  improvement and to select appropriate interventions. Further, agency  accountability can be enhanced when both agency management and  external stakeholders\u2014such as Congress\u2014can assess an agency\u2019s  progress toward meeting its goals.

Disaggregating transit workforce data from other  transportation data has proved to be challenging, and the best projections  of the future transportation workforce needs will expire in 2022.  Additionally, how vehicle automation and other technology advances will  affect the future transit workforce is unclear, and FTA\u2019s presentations on  the transit workforce projections that do exist may have contributed to the  lack of clarity on the future needs of the industry. Whether additional,  refined data on transit workforce needs\u2014for example, an updated version  of the Transportation Industry Report\u2014would provide greater benefits to  the industry than the cost of collecting these data is something FTA can  determine when it better understands the information the industry needs  to make effective workforce decisions. At that point, FTA can decide what  additional data need to be collected strategically, if any, and at what cost,  as part of strategic planning efforts.", "FTA has identified the need to create a transit workforce strategy, and  has expressed its intention to create one in a number of different ways,  but has taken no clear action yet to ensure that FTA\u2019s intention will be  realized. By taking the initiative to develop a strategy to help address  future transit workforce needs, FTA will be in a position to better manage  its ongoing transit workforce activities. FTA is undertaking a number of  efforts that could provide the foundation for sound strategic planning,  including sponsoring an assessment of transit workforce needs, hiring a  data scientist, starting a workforce consortium, and initiating research on  future automation that could provide more clarity regarding a key aspect  of future transit that is, as of now, an unknown factor. Further, FTA has  already drafted some performance measures for its transit workforce  grants that it may be able to use as a foundation for creating goals and  measures for transit workforce development at large. However, more  specific strategic planning efforts that include developing a strategy and  performance goals and measures can better enable FTA to effectively  help transit agencies identify, prepare, and provide a sufficient workforce  for the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making three recommendations to the FTA Administrator:", "The FTA Administrator should determine, in collaboration with transit  stakeholders, whether additional transit workforce data are needed to  identify potential future occupational shortages in the transit industry  and whether the benefits of this collection would outweigh the cost of  gathering it.
