Given their common roles and customer bases, opportunities for collaboration among IRS and states\u2019 revenue offices exist. IRS is facing budget reductions and downsizing. Because of decreasing resources, it becomes even more important to identify ways that IRS and the states can cooperate to improve efficiencies and maximize their return on investment.", "IRS and the states have been involved in cooperative tax administration efforts since the 1920s. By engaging in cooperative efforts, state agencies and the federal government have attempted to achieve greater compliance and efficiency than they could by working separately. Early cooperative efforts involved the sharing of taxpayer income and tax liability information. In 1957, these activities became governed by formal agreements between IRS and the states to specify the types of tax information to be shared. In 1978, IRS fixed responsibility for the exchange of federal and state tax information with the disclosure officers in its regional and district offices. IRS also charged its district directors with responsibility for working personally with state tax agencies to establish and conduct FedState cooperative projects. In 1991, the Office of FedState Relations was established in the National Office to facilitate cooperative tax administration and foster joint projects. IRS originally assigned a senior executive and five staff to this office. IRS chose to not provide full-time field staff to facilitate and foster projects. District directors continued to be responsible for liaison and personal involvement. Most disclosure officers were assigned responsibility for coordinator and facilitator duties on a part-time basis. As of November 1995, 49 states were participating in the FedState program, and, according to IRS officials, approximately 600 to 700 projects were ongoing or proposed.", "In recent years, IRS and the Department of the Treasury have drafted and proposed legislation to further the FedState program. In June 1995, the President announced that he would submit to Congress proposed legislation to facilitate additional FedState cooperative efforts to streamline tax administration, such as joint filing and processing of return information. The proposed legislation would allow IRS and state taxing agencies to delegate tax administration powers and compensate one another pursuant to agreements. The most recent version of the legislation was submitted to Congress in March 1996. No action has been taken yet.", "In 1978 and 1985, we issued reports on the FedState program. The 1978 report to the Joint Committee on Taxation concluded that the program had a low priority within IRS and had no unified direction because responsibility for the program was not fixed. In response, IRS assigned program responsibility to the Office of Disclosure Operations. Both the 1978 and 1985 reports concluded that IRS and the states were not using much of their exchanged data and were not sharing other potentially useful information.

Our objectives for this report were to (1) identify the potential benefits of FedState cooperative efforts; (2) determine what, if any, conditions may impede the success of the program; and (3) determine what, if any, FedState program concerns the states have with IRS\u2019 planned reorganization.", "To achieve our interrelated objectives, we interviewed IRS officials responsible for the FedState program in IRS\u2019 national and southeast regional offices, as well as its Albany, NY; Atlanta, GA; Baltimore, MD; Columbia, SC; Phoenix, AZ; and St. Paul, MN, district offices.

For example, taxpayer data tape exchanges can improve compliance and enforcement by enabling IRS and the states to identify noncompliant taxpayers and take appropriate action. Similarly, joint federal and state taxpayer education and assistance efforts can reduce taxpayer burden by making it easier for taxpayers to obtain information about tax requirements. More sophisticated technology provides additional ways for IRS and the states to reduce taxpayer burden. For example, in one district the state and IRS can automatically transfer telephone taxpayer assistance calls to each other to respond to taxpayers more quickly and efficiently.", "Data limitations prevented us from ascertaining whether the existing mix of FedState projects has helped IRS toward meeting its goals of improving compliance, increasing efficiency, and reducing taxpayer burden. A project designed to increase compliance may also have the positive effect of reducing burden or increasing efficiency.

Although comprehensive data on the revenues collected through this effort have not been systematically tracked, the data collected by some states and IRS districts demonstrate that computer tape exchanges have increased revenues. For example, one state billed taxpayers for $37.5 million in 1990 state income taxes on the basis of data in IRS tapes that showed IRS adjustments to taxpayers\u2019 federal taxes.

While no systematic effort has been made to assess the benefits of joint electronic filing, IRS believes that joint filing increases efficiency because it encourages electronic filing and thus eliminates the costs of processing and storing paper returns. Also, according to IRS, electronic filing reduces administrative costs to both IRS and the states because mathematical errors are detected electronically and transcription errors are eliminated.

Another IRS district and state tax agency targeted a localized group of nonfiling and underreporting self-employed taxpayers. To increase efficiency, IRS and the state tax agency each audited a segment of such taxpayers\u2019 returns and assessed taxes, shared audit results, and based assessments on each other\u2019s audits.

While IRS\u2019 Office of FedState Relations is responsible for facilitating cooperative projects between IRS and the states, the office offers little guidance to help local units choose the most productive projects, nor does it help local units to determine whether their project efforts are helping IRS to achieve its strategic goals. For example, such guidance to local units might identify FedState efforts that are most beneficial to both IRS and state offices, efforts that link strategically to IRS\u2019 main goals, and efforts that help ensure that IRS resources are most efficiently used. Absent such guidance, local units may be missing out on projects that offer greater benefits or operating projects that are not worthwhile.", "We found that most decisionmaking about FedState programs occurred at the district level, where IRS district and state officials worked together to identify and initiate projects. The local level was a natural decisionmaking location since participation by the district or state was voluntary and depended on the project. State and IRS officials told us that it is important to maintain the local focus of the efforts because of the variation in needs, resources, and taxpayer issues. According to the IRS district and state officials we interviewed, the level of FedState activity that existed between district IRS offices and state tax agencies was highly dependent on the working relationship between their respective managers and the top managers\u2019 commitment to the FedState program.
