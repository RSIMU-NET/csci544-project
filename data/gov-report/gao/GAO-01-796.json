One segment of attorney fee processing--the fee approval process--was substantially simplified in 1991.

Indeed, even though these improvements have been part of SSA's system's plans since 1998, SSA has yet to establish a firm schedule for carrying out its plans. Additionally, although SSA has a draft plan for improving the process, agency officials told GAO that the details of the plan have not been completed and SSA has yet to complete a cost estimate for the project. There are also other gaps in the plan--such as not creating an attorney master file or establishing an electronic connection between the payment processing staff and the Office of Hearings and Appeals fee approval staff--where taking additional actions could improve the process. Furthermore, SSA's performance plan did not have goals related to attorney fees--neither for cost reduction of the program nor payment timeliness. SSA would need such goals as part of its current planning effort for improving the attorney fee payment process as well as for its future operations. Without such quantifiable goals, future efforts to track and oversee SSA's progress in these areas will be difficult."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that people claiming Disability Insurance (DI) benefits can obtain legal representation at a fair price, the Social Security Act requires that the Social Security Administration (SSA) regulate the fees that attorneys charge people to represent their disability claims before the agency. Balancing the needs of claimants with those of their attorneys, the act limits the fees that attorneys can charge claimants, but also guarantees that those fees will be paid from the claimants\u2019 past-due benefits. Over the years, however, relations between SSA and attorneys representing DI claimants have become increasingly strained. While SSA points to the growing administrative burden of processing these fees, attorneys are frustrated with delays in receiving their fees. The situation intensified recently after the Ticket to Work Act imposed an assessment (or \u201cuser fee\u201d) to be deducted from the attorney fees. This act tied the amount of the user fee to SSA\u2019s administrative costs in providing fee services, requiring SSA to determine (for calendar years after 2000) the percentage rate necessary for \u201cfull recovery of the costs of determining and certifying fees,\u201d not to exceed 6.3 percent of the attorney\u2019s fee.", "This report responds to the requirements of the Ticket to Work Act that we study various aspects of attorney fee services in the DI program. The objectives of our review were to evaluate (1) SSA\u2019s administrative cost estimates, (2) the time SSA takes to process the fee payments, (3) whether SSA\u2019s operations could be improved to reduce costs and processing times of fee payments, and (4) other matters related to the services and the user fee. In June 2000, we reported our preliminary results to the Subcommittee on Social Security, House Committee on Ways and Means. We provided additional information to the Subcommittee in May 2001. To carry out our work, we reviewed SSA\u2019s administration of the fee services, interviewing officials from the Office Central Operations, the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), Office of Budget, Office of Financial Policy and Operations, the Office of Systems, and other offices. We observed the attorney fee payment practices at two of SSA\u2019s process service centers and examined SSA data on these services, focusing particularly on activities and information related to costs and payment timeliness. We also talked to attorneys, claimant advocacy groups, and representatives of the legal services community about aspects of attorney representation and attorney fees. We performed our work between March 2000 and May 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

These benefits are financed through payroll taxes paid by workers and their employers and by the self-employed. Proof of disability can involve complex technical issues, and the Social Security Act permits claimants to appoint an attorney to represent them at proceedings before SSA, at any level of administrative review.", "The disability claims process is complex, multilayered, and lengthy. The following scenario portrays the process for DI claimants who are typically represented by an attorney before SSA\u2014i.e., those cases where the claim is ultimately appealed to OHA. Initially, the claimant would have filed a claim for DI benefits with a local SSA field office. This office would have then forwarded the claim to a state agency to examine the claimant\u2019s evidence for medical disability. The state agency would then have denied the claim in an initial review and denied it again after reconsidering the claim. Once SSA notified the claimant of denial of benefits, the claimant would have then appealed to OHA. At OHA, the claimant would have had a hearing before an administrative law judge who would have reversed the decision of the state agency, finding the claimant eligible for DI benefits. Generally, the claimant appoints an attorney for the OHA level appeal.", "The fees that attorneys representing DI applicants can charge are limited by law and must be approved by SSA. Since 1967, SSA has administered fee payments to attorneys representing DI claimants. To be compensated, attorneys must file with SSA either a fee agreement\u2014a formal contract signed by the applicant and the attorney setting the fee as a percentage of the applicant\u2019s past-due benefits\u2014or a fee petition that lists services provided by the representative for the case. Of the two, the fee agreement is the much simpler arrangement; generally, it specifies fees limited to 25 percent of the claimant\u2019s past-due benefits up to a maximum of $4,000. In contrast, the fee petitions require attorneys to itemize expenses and hourly charges, and SSA must determine a reasonable fee to compensate the attorneys. Assuming either a fee agreement or a fee petition is approved, SSA withholds the amount of the fee from the beneficiaries\u2019 past-due benefits and pays the attorneys directly.", "Historically, attorneys representing claimants before SSA submitted fee petitions for their services. As the percentage of claimants represented by attorneys in DI hearings increased from 19 percent in fiscal year 1967 to 66 percent in fiscal year 1987, fee petitions became a significant administrative burden for SSA. To alleviate some burden, the Congress streamlined the fee approval process in 1990 by requiring that SSA approve the fee agreements subject to the limits cited above, in cases where SSA finds the claimant eligible for past-due benefits. Since the introduction of the much simpler fee agreements in 1991, their use has become nearly universal\u2014in 2000, about 88 percent of the attorney fees were based on fee agreements. However, even with the prevalence of the simpler fee agreement, SSA continued to have significant delays in paying attorney fees, and attorneys increasingly turned to court action to obtain their fees.", "In 1995, SSA proposed to stop regulating the attorney fees process for DI claimants and estimated that, if this were done, it would save $20 million in administrative costs. This cost estimate was the basis for a 6.3-percent assessment on attorneys for use of SSA\u2019s processing services enacted in the 1999 Ticket to Work Act, a charge deducted directly from the attorney\u2019s fee. Under this law, SSA is to determine (for calendar years after 2000) a percentage rate that allows \u201cfull recovery of the costs of determining and certifying fees to attorneys for the past-due benefits of the claim,\u201d but is not to exceed 6.3 percent of the total fee.

Neither OHA nor the processing centers routinely collect information that specifically identifies the costs associated with these services. To develop its estimate, SSA relied on various data it adapted from its regular operations, as well as surveying its regional offices to determine time spent on attorney fees in OHA. Our review indicated flaws in these data and suggested that the original estimate should be adjusted downward. However, without adequate data, we were unable to make exact corrections to the estimate.

Within SSA, its field offices, OHA, and the processing centers all have important roles in managing a disability claim. However, for the most part, OHA and the processing centers have the central functions of fee processing. OHA must review and approve fee arrangements, while the processing centers pay the attorney fee once the amount of past-due benefits is determined.", "For OHA fee approval services, SSA estimated costs of $12 million for 1999\u2014which we restated in terms of 2000 costs as $13.8 million. Within OHA only a small portion of staff time is spent reviewing fee arrangements. For fee agreements, SSA estimated that its staff spent about 1\u00bd hours handling each agreement during an OHA appeal that may take about 1 year to complete. However, the small amount of time spent reviewing each fee agreement becomes significant when all such review time is totaled. For example, OHA processed about 179,000 fee agreements in 1999\u2014if each took 1\u00bd hours to process, the total time to process fee agreements would be the equivalent of 129 work years and result in millions of dollars of costs.", "While OHA did not have any data system that routinely collected information about the time spent on each fee arrangement, it used operational data to determine the general types of work considered to be related to these costs\u2014for example, approving fee agreements, reviewing fee disputes, etc. For each category of work, OHA developed a series of tasks necessary to perform the work. Then, to obtain information on how long it took to complete each task, OHA surveyed its regional offices.", "Most of SSA\u2019s administrative costs, however, were for paying the attorney fees\u2014in 2000, SSA estimated that this service by its processing centers cost $40.2 million, or three-quarters of the total estimate of $54 million. For the most part, this cost relates to manually handling the attorney payments. Once a claimant\u2019s past-due benefits are determined, a clerk manually processes the payment\u2014filling out a form that shows what payment is authorized, calculating the user fee, and giving the form to the data entry clerks. As with the OHA fee approvals, even though the time on each task may be small, it becomes significant when all such time is summed up.", "To develop its estimates for payment processing, SSA relied on the cost allocation system it uses in its normal operations. SSA generally uses this system to account for the expenses of its various types of work so that the proper trust fund account can be charged; the system allocates SSA\u2019s administrative costs to one of the various trust funds SSA administers or to the general fund. Although the system was not developed to analyze the costs related to fee payments, SSA has adapted it to collect information on attorney fee work.

For example, there was no data available to calculate exactly how much overtime had been used to process the payment backlogs.

For example, SSA stopped sending case files that needed additional documentation out of the processing centers to storage centers; instead, the case files stayed in bins near where staff processed the cases. Processing center staff also contacted OHA staff to better track information on attorney fee approvals.", "However, many of the reasons that it takes an extra period of time to process an attorney\u2019s payment remained the same\u2014for example, the centers still need to track down state workers\u2019 compensation information, they still need to have proof of age to process a claimant\u2019s benefits, and they still need to wait for all claims related to the principal beneficiary to be resolved to determine what to pay the attorney. For many of these information needs, it is the responsibility of the claimant and/or attorney to furnish documentation of the claim to SSA. Recently, SSA conducted a 1-day sample of cases with attorney fees that looked at factors, such as those listed above, that complicate the payment process. Of the 669 attorney fees processed on August 10, 2000, 48 percent had some factor that complicated the processing of the case.

Joint checks might delay payment to the claimant because the claimant would need to wait until the attorney deposited the check into an escrow account. Also, using a joint check would reduce SSA\u2019s ability to enforce the fee limits and could increase the risk that attorneys might short-change claimants. A number of administrative issues would need to be addressed, as well.

The specific elements of SSA\u2019s plan include some features from our recommendation; but not all elements of the recommendation were addressed. For example, we state that SSA should consider whether it is feasible to capture management information required to track its administrative costs and payment timeliness. While SSA\u2019s task force is planning to identify\u2014via an independent audit\u2014the costs of attorney fee processing, there is no mention of an ongoing system to monitor the costs or timeliness of the payments.

SSA says that in the interim it will use other measures, such as disability claims processing times, to measure attorney fee processing. While we can appreciate the need to fully consider the plan for improvement in establishing final processing goals, we believe that measures such as disability claims processing times are not going to provide enough information to track attorney fee processing in the interim.

We observed the attorney fee payment practices at two of SSA\u2019s process service centers and examined SSA data on these services, focusing particularly on information concerning costs (detailed below) and payment timeliness.

For the possibility of linking the user fee to payment timeliness, we interviewed SSA officials at OCO and the Office of System to determine SSA\u2019s capabilities for linking attorney fee payments to the timeliness of the payments. Additionally, we interviewed an official at NOSSCR and private attorneys to discuss the issue of payment timeliness. 2.  In determining whether to express the user fee as a fixed amount or a percentage, we analyzed SSA data on attorney fee payments and the user fee. 3.  In determining whether to raise the cap on attorney fees, we primarily analyzed payments made to attorneys to see if the current cap was being reached frequently. Additionally, we interviewed OCO and OHA officials regarding this issue. 4.  In analyzing the possibility of extending attorney fee withholding to SSI claims, we interviewed OHA and Office of System staff to determine what policy and practical considerations might arise from such a move. Additionally, we interviewed an official at NOSSCR, various claimant advocacy groups, representatives from the legal services community, private attorneys, and an official from the Association of Administrative Law Judges to help flesh out pros and cons to extending attorney fee withholding to the SSI program. 5.  In determining if attorney representation rates have been affected by the imposition of the user fee, we analyzed SSA data related to attorney fee representation to see if there had been a change in the representation rates following the user fee. 6.  In analyzing whether SSA should issue joint checks to attorneys and beneficiaries, we interviewed SSA officials at the Office of Systems.

Specifically, SSA provided us cost information from 1999 for the OHA fee approval process and from 2000 for the fee payment process. We describe our adjustments to the costs of each component in the following sections. In general, we were unable to precisely correct the estimate because of inadequate data and unclear cost definition. However, with rough adjustments to the original estimate, we have attempted to approximate a \u201clower bound\u201d of the SSA costs. We have discussed each of our adjustments, and our proposed corrections, with SSA officials."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OHA Fee Approval Process", "paragraphs": ["According to SSA\u2019s estimate, OHA staff spent 235 work years on about 206,000 fee approval actions, at a cost of $13 million in 1999. These actions included approval of both fee agreements and fee petitions, as well as reviews of disputes over fees. The vast majority of these actions involved approval of fee agreements\u2014in 1999, OHA approved about 179,000 fee agreements.", "The cost estimate, however, included work not related to disability insurance (DI) cases and used an unrealistically high estimate of staff time taken to review fee agreements. While we could identify these problems, we could only approximate the actual adjustment needed to correct the original estimate because of insufficient data.", "First, the estimate included costs spent on cases that were not DI cases. In 1999, there were about 185,000 OHA cases with attorney representation that resulted in favorable decisions for the claimant. However, of these cases, only about 79 percent (146,000) involved claims for DI benefits, and the remaining 21 percent (39,000) involved claims for benefits under the SSI program only. SSA officials acknowledged that their estimate included work on fee approvals for other than DI cases, but they were unable to provide us with a more detailed breakout of workload (e.g., the number of fee agreements that were also DI cases).", "In addition, SSA\u2019s estimate appears to overstate the time it takes to routinely handle a fee agreement. Over the past 10 years, SSA\u2019s role in regulating attorney fees has become much less burdensome. With the simplified fee agreement, SSA staff can, for the most part, verify that the claimant has agreed to pay his or her attorney 25 percent of past-due benefits, instead of reviewing itemized hourly charges commonly presented in fee petitions. Despite the steady trend towards uniform use of the simplified fee agreement, the most recent estimate of the time it takes to review a fee agreement is twice that used in SSA\u2019s 1995 cost estimate. In 1995, SSA estimated that it took about 45 minutes of staff time to review and process a fee agreement. In 1999, however, its estimate of the same review had risen to 94 minutes per agreement. The 1999 estimate included about 47 minutes to evaluate whether each agreement meets the regulatory criteria\u201432 minutes by a senior case technician, and once this is done, 15 minutes by the administrative law judge (who also takes 6 minutes to sign each agreement). After the judge signs the order, the estimate included 16 minutes for a clerk to mail the fee approval agreement (with the rest of the case file) to the payment processing center.", "While we were unable to quantify the actual staff time, the 1995 estimate of 45 minutes appears to be the better approximation of staff time spent handling routine fee agreement approvals, particularly in view of the increasingly uniform use of this simplified fee contract. To develop the 1999 estimate of staff time, SSA officials told us that they polled the OHA regional offices in a 4-day period. They received responses from only 6 of the 10 regional offices, and those responses included wide variations for staff time\u2014for instance, the estimate for the review by the administrative law judge went from 1 minute to 5 days. Additionally, the time for the mailing the fee agreement included the time spent to mail the entire OHA decision.", "Our review suggests that the adjusted estimate for OHA costs in 1999 may be as low as $6.4 million, which represents a reduction of 51 percent of the original estimate. Our adjustments to the OHA estimate are as follows: 1.  Because SSA could not provide us with a detailed breakout of the OHA work on DI cases, we reduced the total estimate by 21 percent\u2014the proportion of non-DI cases in the OHA 1999 workload. This adjustment reduced the estimate by $2.7 million, to $10.3 million. 2.  Once we removed the non-DI cases from the estimate, we then reduced the estimate of staff time spent on fee agreement approval by one-half, roughly the difference between the 1995 and the 1999 staff estimate. This change lowered the OHA estimate by $3.9 million (30 percent), to $6.4 million. 3.  We restated the estimated costs in terms of costs in 2000, to be compared with SSA estimates of processing costs. To do this, we inflated the estimated costs (and our proposed adjustments) by 6.6 percent, the amount by which the cost of the average OHA staff year increased in 2000 over 1999.", "The original OHA estimate, our adjustments to the estimate, and the limitations to these adjustments are shown in table 2."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fee Payment Processing Costs", "paragraphs": ["According to SSA, its payment processing centers processed $512 million in attorney fee payments in 2000, at a cost of $40.2 million.

Under this cost allocation system, each payment center\u2019s workload is quantified by a random check, conducted daily, of the work done by all employees at the center. Each type of work at the payment centers is categorized, and one major category of work includes that done on attorney fee processing. This work category (called \u201catfee\u201d in the centers) includes all work done at the payment centers related to handling and paying fee agreements and fee petitions. The work includes all cases that involve attorney fees\u2014field office cases (initial determinations and reconsiderations) as well as OHA cases.", "Our review indicated that the payment processing estimate appears high. The estimate included an incorrect cost amount; failed to adjust for one- time use of premium overtime pay to reduce processing backlogs; included costs not clearly associated with fee payments; and it used average salary costs when the staff who routinely work on most payment processing receive below-average pay. However, we were, for the most part, unable to make precise adjustments for these problems because of limited data and unclear definitions as to what counts as a fee processing cost.", "First, the original estimate erred in a calculation of the total estimate by using the wrong amount of total costs for the largest processing center. In creating the estimate, SSA used an incorrect category from its cost accounting system to calculate the center\u2019s costs. This cost category included costs unrelated to the work necessary to process attorney fees.", "Second, the estimate did not adjust for premium overtime pay. Because the user fee required by the Ticket to Work Act was effective February 1, 2000, SSA staff worked overtime in February and March to clear out the backlog of fee payment cases pending as of February 1. According to testimony by SSA\u2019s Deputy Associate Commissioner for Hearings and Appeals before the Subcommittee on Social Security, House Committee on Ways and Means, in June 2000, SSA provided an extra 111 staff work years to handle the backlog of fee cases, diverting resources from other workloads to process the claims on a priority basis.", "Third, the general \u201catfee\u201d work category used to designate attorney fee processing in the centers appears to include subcategories of work too broad to be included in the estimate\u2014in our view, the subcategories include work that would be necessary for normal case processing even if SSA did not pay attorney fees. According to staff in the centers, the subcategory \u201catfee misc\u201d includes correspondence from attorneys that cannot be clearly categorized as dealing with either fee agreements or fee petitions. For example, a letter would be classified as \u201catfee misc\u201d if it included issues related to the claimant as well as a question about fees. One supervisor told us that the designation of work category was made by a GS 4 or 5 file clerk who would classify any correspondence with an attorney\u2019s letterhead as \u201catfee misc\u201d if the letter could not be clearly identified to another specific work category.", "Finally, the staff salary costs included in the estimate should be adjusted to reflect more accurately the lower staff salaries of the technicians who routinely work on payment processing. SSA\u2019s estimate is based on the average salary of all its employees who work on DI cases involving OHA decisions. However, the staff working on these cases includes both claims authorizers (generally paid a GS-11 salary) and benefit authorizers (generally paid between GS-7 and GS-9 salaries). For the most part, the lower-paid benefit authorizers process the attorney fees, while the higher- paid claims authorizers perform the main case processing. From SSA data, it appears that over 50 percent of the work on DI cases with OHA decisions is case processing work routinely performed by the higher-paid claims authorizers.", "Taking into account the data just mentioned, we believe that the lower bound costs for the processing centers could be as low as $28.6 million for 2000. Our calculation of the adjusted estimate is as follows: 4.  We corrected the SSA estimate for an error in its calculations of the processing center costs. This correction reduced the estimate by $1.9 million (5 percent), to $38.3 million. 5.  We adjusted for the premium overtime pay. We reviewed data provided by SSA on the increase in overtime pay in 2000 over the prior year. Using this information, we allocated a part of the increase in overtime pay to the center\u2019s attorney fee work, reducing the estimate by $0.5 million (1 percent), to $37.8 million. 6.  We eliminated the costs associated with the subcategory \u201catfee misc\u201d from the costs. When these costs were subtracted from the estimate, the original estimate was reduced by $5.5 million (13.7 percent) to $32.3 million. Because some of the work included in this subcategory was likely to be directly related to the fee processing, eliminating this subcategory most likely understated some of SSA\u2019s actual costs. 7.  We adjusted the estimate to better reflect the below-average pay of the staff who routinely handle attorney fee processing. SSA was unable to provide us with data to precisely allocate the salary costs of those working on fee processing; hence, we assumed that all staff who worked on attorney fee processing were paid at a GS-8 step 5 level ($33,202) in 2000, while all the rest of the staff who worked on the same cases were paid at GS-11 step 5 level ($44,369).
