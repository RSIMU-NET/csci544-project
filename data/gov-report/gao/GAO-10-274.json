In addition, State issued 4,634 SIVs to Iraqis pursuant to two programs, established by Congress to help Iraqis who previously worked for the U.S. government in Iraq. Resettlement agencies, working under cooperative agreements with State, have resettled Iraqis throughout the United States but particularly in California and Michigan. These agencies have found that Iraqis arrive in the United States with high levels of trauma, injury, and illness, which contribute to the challenges they face in resettling in a new country. In addition, entry-level jobs normally available to refugees are scarce and more competitive in the current economic downturn. Iraqi refugees generally have high levels of education, according to U.S. officials and representatives from the resettlement agencies. Nevertheless, Iraqis have struggled to find entry-level employment in the United States. Iraqi refugees and SIV holders are eligible for resettlement assistance and public benefits upon arrival in the United States. State provides resettlement agencies $1,800 per person to cover basic housing, food, and assistance for accessing services during their first 30 days in the United States; however, support may continue for up to 90 days if basic needs have not been met. Refugees automatically receive these benefits; Iraqi SIV holders must elect to receive them within 10 days of receiving their visas. In addition, qualified Iraqi refugees and, as a result of December 2009 legislation, qualified SIV holders can receive certain assistance for up to 7 years through public benefits programs. Prior to December 19, 2009, Iraqi SIV holders' eligibility for public benefits generally ceased after 8 months. Both groups can also receive up to 8 months of cash and medical assistance from HHS if they do not qualify for public benefits. In addition, HHS funds social services, including job preparation, English language classes, and assistance with job interviews, for which Iraqi refugees and SIV holders may be eligible for up to 5 years. Iraqi refugees and SIV holders, including those who acted as interpreters and linguists for civilian agencies and military commands in Iraq, have limited opportunities for federal employment. Most federal positions in the United States require U.S. citizenship and background investigations; certain positions, including most positions related to Arabic or Iraq, also require security clearances, which noncitizens cannot obtain. However, GAO did identify positions at DOD's Defense Language Institute and State's Foreign Service Institute open to qualified noncitizens. Finally, State and DOD have not established the temporary program intended to offer employment to Iraqi SIV holders under authority granted the agencies in fiscal year 2009 legislation. Although both agencies have positions requiring Arabic language skills, neither identified any unfilled needs that could be met by employing Iraqi SIV holders through this joint program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The February 2006 bombing of the Al-Askari Mosque in Samara triggered  sectarian violence in Iraq and increased the number of displaced Iraqis.

We also  interviewed representatives from 10 resettlement agencies that work with  PRM and ORR to provide benefits and services to refugees and SIV  holders. In addition, we analyzed relevant laws, regulations, executive  orders, and agency policies on U.S. government employment and  personnel security requirements. We interviewed officials from the Office  of Personnel Management (OPM) regarding requirements for U.S.  government employment.

According to the Convention, a refugee is someone who, \u201cowing to a well- founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality,  membership of a particular social group, or political opinion, is outside the  country of his nationality, and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling  to avail himself of the protection of that country.\u2026\u201d UNHCR is mandated  to find solutions to the plight of refugees. According to UNHCR, three  solutions are available:    First, voluntary repatriation is the preferred solution for the majority of  refugees. Most refugees prefer to return home as soon as circumstances  permit (generally when a conflict has ended and a degree of stability has  been restored). UNHCR promotes, supports, and facilitates voluntary  repatriation as the best solution for displaced people, provided it is safe  and reintegration is viable.", "Second, UNHCR may help refugees integrate and settle in the \u201casylum,\u201d or  host, country where they reside as refugees. Some refugees cannot or are  unwilling to return because they would face persecution. According to  UNHCR, relatively few host countries allow refugees to settle.", "Third, UNHCR may assist refugees in permanently resettling in third  countries. According to UNHCR, only a small number of nations take part  in UNHCR resettlement programs worldwide and accept annual quotas of  refugees. According to State, historically, less than 1 percent of registered  refugees are resettled in third countries. Of the Iraqis resettling in third  countries in 2009, UNHCR referred 75 percent (about 62,000) for  resettlement in the United States.", "This report focuses on the third solution\u2014those Iraqis resettled in the  United States.

Certain categories of Iraqis with  U.S. affiliations do not need a referral and may apply directly for refugee  consideration under a direct access program in Jordan, Egypt, and Iraq.  Overseas processing entities (OPE), working under a cooperative  agreement with State, prescreen the referrals and prepare application  forms by collecting and verifying personal and family information,  obtaining details of persecution or feared harm, and initiating security  name checks.

In addition, we  interviewed representatives from 10 resettlement agencies that work with  PRM and ORR to provide benefits and services to Iraqi refugees and SIV  holders: Church World Service; Episcopal Migration Ministries; Ethiopian  Community Development Council; Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society; Iowa  Department of Human Services, Bureau of Refugee Services; International  Rescue Committee; Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service; U.S.  Committee for Refugees and Immigrants; U.S. Conference of Catholic  Bishops; and World Relief. We also interviewed two nongovernmental  organizations (NGO) that work with PRM and ORR to provide technical  assistance to resettlement agencies on refugee employment and cultural  adjustment issues. We reviewed reports issued by NGOs on the status of  Iraqi refugees in the United States and the challenges they face in  resettling in this country. We interviewed several Iraqi refugees about their  resettlement experiences; their views or experiences may not be  representative of other refugees or SIV holders.", "To determine the reliability of Consular Affairs data on Iraqi SIV issuances,  we interviewed the Consular Affairs official who maintains this data. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to report on the number  of Iraqi SIVs issued between fiscal years 2007 and 2009. USCIS provided us  with data on the number of Iraqi and Afghan SIV holders who were  admitted into the United States as permanent residents (or green card  holders) between fiscal years 2007 and 2009. Iraqi and Afghan SIVs are  issued based on an applicant\u2019s nationality. USCIS provided us these data  by applicants\u2019 country of birth, but could not provide the data by  nationality. As a result, we determined that these data were not  sufficiently reliable to indicate how many Iraqi SIV holders were admitted  into the United States during this time period. Therefore, we report only  Iraqi SIV issuance data. To determine the reliability of PRM data on  resettled Iraqi refugees and SIV holders, we interviewed the PRM officials  who monitor and use these data. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable to report on the number, locations, and reported  general education levels of resettled Iraqis between fiscal years 2006 and  2009.", "To review the benefits afforded Iraqi refugees and SIV holders, we  collected and analyzed relevant laws, regulations, and agency policies  regarding federally and state-funded and administered refugee  resettlement programs. We interviewed officials from PRM and ORR to  determine the types of benefits available and their eligibility requirements.  The majority of our audit work was completed prior to the December 2009  passage of the fiscal year 2010 Department of Defense (DOD)  Appropriations Act, which changed Iraqi SIV holders\u2019 eligibility for public  benefits.", "To review the challenges Iraqi refugees and SIV holders face in obtaining  employment with the federal government, we analyzed relevant laws,  regulations, executive orders, and agency policies on U.S. government  employment and personnel security requirements. The majority of our  audit work was completed prior to the December 2009 passage of the  fiscal year 2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which made changes to  a long standing restriction on the use of appropriated funds to employ  noncitizens by the federal government in the United States. We  interviewed officials from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)  regarding requirements for U.S. government employment. We also  interviewed program, human resource, and security officials from five key  agencies\u2014DOD (specifically, the Army), State, DHS, the Department of  Justice, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)\u2014 regarding their employment and personnel security requirements positions  in the United States. We chose these agencies because they have national  security missions, ongoing programs in Iraq, and needs for personnel with  Arabic language skills; we did not include the intelligence community. We  focused on employment in the United States because generally Iraqi  refugees and SIV holders who want to apply for U.S. citizenship must  reside in the United States for a certain period of time. In addition,  refugees\u2019 ability to apply for permanent resident status could be delayed if  they travel overseas. We did not develop an inventory of the agencies\u2019  needs for Arabic language skills or Iraqi expertise. We also interviewed  policy officials at DOD and State regarding the temporary program  authorized by the fiscal year 2009 Duncan Hunter National Defense  Authorization Act to employ Iraqi SIV holders who have resettled in the  United States as translators, interpreters, and cultural awareness  instructors at DOD and State.", "To assess the reliability of data on Arabic positions at DOD\u2019s Defense  Language Institute (DLI) and State\u2019s Foreign Service Institute (FSI), we  interviewed human resource officials at DLI, DOD\u2019s U.S. Army Training  and Doctrine Command, and FSI. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable to report on the number of Arabic positions at DLI and  FSI."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Initial Resettlement, by State, of Iraqi Refugees and Special Immigrant Visa Holders, Fiscal Years 2006 through 2009", "paragraphs": ["Table 4 provides data on the numbers of Iraqi refugees and special  immigrant visa (SIV) holders who were resettled in the United States from  fiscal years 2006 through 2009.
