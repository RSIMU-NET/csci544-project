If the U.S. MNC disagrees with the adjustment, it can ask the United States Competent Authority (USCA) within the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to help resolve the dispute through the mutual agreement procedure (MAP). Generally, disputes are resolved by one country withdrawing some or all of the adjustment and the other country providing other relief to the MNC to address double taxation of income.

In such cases, an MNC can go  directly to the country\u2019s tax authority to try to resolve the dispute.  According to tax experts we spoke with, if, however, a U.S. MNC views  this process as unlikely to be successful or if it was unsuccessful and  believes the adjustment would result in double taxation, the corporation  can ask USCA for assistance in resolving the dispute.", "In the United States, the designated USCA is the commissioner of the  Large Business and International Division of the IRS.

It  should be noted that a single U.S. taxpayer can be involved in multiple  MAP cases because disputes are resolved bi-laterally. For example, if a  U.S. MNC had a dispute involving the allocation of overhead costs across multiple subsidiaries in different countries, then there would be separate  dispute cases for each country involved.

For example,  USCA analysts would ensure that the request involves potential double  taxation and that the foreign country was a treaty partner.", "If USCA accepts the MAP request for assistance, it reviews the technical  facts of the dispute and prepares its position prior to negotiating on a  resolution with the foreign competent authority. When IRS, rather than the  foreign tax authority, initiates the adjustment, USCA will discuss the facts  of the case with the IRS examiner who proposed the adjustment, but  determines on its own how much of the adjustment is justified. In the case  of foreign-initiated adjustments, USCA will contact the foreign competent  authority while developing its position to provide updates and obtain any  needed information. According to USCA officials, based on its review, the  USCA determines whether it considers the adjustment valid and the  amount of the adjustment that should be withdrawn by the initiating tax  authority, and what amount of relief USCA may provide. USCA can also  unilaterally decide to fully withdraw the IRS adjustment or provide full  correlative relief for a foreign-initiated adjustment that USCA considers  valid.", "USCA resolves disputes brought to it by MNCs according to MAP  specified in the tax treaties.

For example, a MAP case resolved in 2017 could have been  filed in 2008 for a dispute over 2005 taxable income. However, cases  may be shorter when the tax treaties include provisions for binding  arbitration. The United States has treaties with four counties that include  provisions for binding arbitration.

According to tax experts that we interviewed, if the  adjustment is small, a taxpayer may prefer to accept the double taxation  rather than incur the cost of going through the MAP process. These costs  can include direct costs of retaining tax advisors as well as the indirect  costs of listing the amount of funds that are in dispute on their financial  statement as an unresolved tax issue.

The figure shows  that the number of cases resulting from an adjustment by IRS ranged  from a low of 22 in 2015 to high of 85 in 2017. Conducting similar analysis  of trends in volume may help APMA better plan for allocating its limited  resources to different teams in anticipation of increased case volume. In  addition, because APMA allocates staff across teams that focus on  particular countries, tracking trends in case load by country could help  USCA prepare to anticipate spikes in cases and allocate resources more  effectively across country teams. By conducting regular trend analyses,  APMA could also identify areas for further analysis to determine what  may be driving variations in case load by country.", "Similarly, figure 3 shows our analysis of the average time to resolve a  case. Average case time ranged between 15 and 40 months, with the  average case time exceeding the OECD-recommended 24-month period  for a number of countries and years.

In 2017, 74 percent of IRS  adjustments were withdrawn. The data show that U.S.-initiated cases  were more often resolved entirely by the United States than with the  foreign country providing some of the relief.", "However, these data on case resolutions need to be interpreted with  caution. For example, as pointed out by IRS officials, a measure like the  percent withdrawn may be misinterpreted if it concerns a small number of  large MNCs with operations in many countries, and the adjustments are  small unless this information is provided as context. Nonetheless, the  case resolution data can be useful for guiding further analysis by helping  to identify areas that would merit further analysis of the reasons for  withdrawing cases or the reasons IRS examiners are making adjustments  that are not upheld by USCA. Analyzing trends in outcomes would help to  ensure that APMA is not missing opportunities to protect the U.S.  corporate tax base and that IRS examiners are cognizant of tax treaty  treatment of foreign source income of U.S. MNCs.

Reliable information systems are  essential for effective management. Without assessing APMAs\u2019 current  and past performance, APMA may be less able to identify areas for  improvement. Conducting analysis and improving the quality of data could  help inform APMA\u2019s allocation of resources and inform other parts of the  agency concerning international tax issues.

However, IRS tracks issues in other similar  areas. For example, IRS\u2019s Office of Appeals, which handles a wide range  of tax controversies covering both international and domestic issues,  tracks the tax issue in dispute.", "Furthermore, APMA includes categories of tax transactions in its annual  statutory reports. The categories are used in Advanced Pricing  Agreements (APA) to distinguish between a U.S. entity and non-U.S.  entity, and to determine whether a transaction covered by an agreement  involved the sale of tangible property, use of intangible property or the  provision of services. APAs are agreements between IRS and MNCs on  how transactions among related entities of the MNC should be priced.  APAs can prevent potential disputes by having agreement on the  transaction prior to filing a tax return with IRS. These categories or  alternative categories that APMA has already developed could be added  to the inventory database to provide additional information on the tax  issue in dispute.", "To illustrate how the additional information on tax issues can help inform  management decisions, we categorized the tax issues in our sample of  MAP cases using APA categories. As shown in figures 6 and 7, we  compared the estimated percentage of certain tax issues in all MAP  cases between 2015 and 2017 with those in APA cases in 2014. We also  compared tax issues with other characteristics of the MAP cases. As  figure 6 shows, an estimated 37 percent of MAP cases involved disputes  over a tax adjustment related to services provided by a non-US entity  such as a foreign corporation. Figure 6 also shows that disputes  concerning the provision of services (both U.S. and non-U.S.) are  estimated to account for 61 percent of cases, which far exceeded  disputes over the use of intangible property, at 17 percent or the sale of  tangible property at 15 percent. Conducting similar reviews of this type  of information could help APMA better match its resources in terms of  experience with different types of tax issues.", "We also compared tax issues identified in MAP cases with the  transactions covered in APAs. The results illustrate how tracking tax  issues could be useful for improving the administration of both programs.  For example, as shown in figure 7, 23 percent of APA transactions  covered sales of tangible property into the United States in 2014. Our  categorization of MAP cases reported in figure 6 shows sales of tangible  property into the United States as a disputed issue in only an estimated 8  percent of those cases. This difference in relative frequencies may  suggest a connection between the programs, as tax practitioners have  suggested increasing the use of APAs as a way of reducing international  tax disputes. However, some of the differences in percentages between  figure 6 and 7 could arise from differences in years covered and in  categorization of tax issues.", "We also categorized the information to illustrate how tracking tax issues  and other characteristics, such as location and the outcomes of the  dispute resolution process could help with administration. For example,  as shown in table 2, the tax issue with the largest estimated share of  foreign MAP cases (67 percent) involved the provision of services. U.S.  MAP cases, in contrast, were spread more evenly across tax issues, with  no single tax category having an estimated share greater than 50 percent.  Conducting a similar review of this type of information could help APMA  match its resource allocations in terms of staff experience with different  types of tax issues within its country-focused teams.", "Additionally, table 3 shows when we tracked outcomes of the dispute  resolution process, we found that an estimated 69 percent of cases  resolved by a combination of withdrawal and correlative relief involved the  provision of services. For other outcomes, this tax issue of provision of  services is estimated to occur 49 percent of the time. Further research  on how outcomes and tax issues may be related could also inform how  APMA trains and assigns staff.", "Other analyses could examine the tax issue and whether an economist  was assigned or the average processing time. These statistics may help  identify insights into complex cases. Undertaking similar reviews across  tax issues may help identify areas for increased scrutiny to ensure  effective administration.", "Federal internal controls standards state that as part of an effective  internal control system, management should establish activities to monitor  program performance.

First,  USCA has not provided clear guidance to taxpayers on how the MAP  process works. As a result, taxpayers may be unaware of the process  and not fully understand what to expect when they undergo it.  Furthermore, USCA does not record when and for what reason there is  contact between the taxpayer and USCA, therefore making it difficult for  USCA to ensure that taxpayers are informed about the progress of their  case.", "Second, USCA does not track the hours that analysts spend on cases  and the milestones of cases. As a result, USCA does not have a full  understanding of the efficiency of the MAP process, including ways to  improve it. It also does not have processes to ensure the quality of the  data it collects, therefore cannot ensure accurate performance  measurement. While APMA aims to meet the minimum standards of the  OECD, it does not analyze the data to identify areas for improvement.", "Analyses of USCA\u2019s data could more fully inform its management  decisions.

Having determined that the Advanced Pricing  Mutual Agreement Program (APMA) does not conduct analysis of mutual  agreement procedure (MAP) case data, we used information from its  existing inventory data to illustrate the types of analysis that may be  possible. The inventory database APMA provided us contained all MAP  cases that were closed from 2013 to 2017, as well as the current stock of  open MAP cases. Because of a change in the method of recording the  outcome variable between 2013 and 2014, we restricted our analysis of  outcomes to 2014 to 2017.", "The inventory database did not include a variable for the tax issue in  dispute. To illustrate the type of analysis that could be conducted if the  tax issue were recorded we collected a sample of MAP case files. To  estimate features such as tax issue and outcome for the inventory  database, we selected a generalizable random sample of 84 cases that  was proportionally allocated across four strata described in table 4. The  strata included wither the initiating country was U.S. or Non-U.S. and  whether an Economist was involved. This sample was selected from the  population frame that consists of all files from APMA 2013-2017 Resolved  and 2017 Pending inventory for cases resolved in years 2015 to 2017.  Overall, this sample was designed to produce 95 percent confidence  intervals for percentage estimates that are within approximately +/- 10  percentage points. The sample is not designed to provide estimates for  other reporting groups at the same level of precision, and all margins of  error are reported along with estimates.", "To create a tax issue variable, we reviewed the summary of competent  authority issues required by Rev.Proc. 2015-40 to be included in the MAP  request letter. We then allocated the tax issue described in the narrative  to APMA\u2019s advanced pricing agreement transaction categories. Some  case files included multiple tax issues, but these cases accounted for less  than 18 percent of the sample. The illustrations provided rely on the first  tax issue noted in the narrative.

Table 6 provides a hypothetical example of U.S.- initiated adjustment to a transfer price and a resolution that provides full  relief from double taxation through a combination of partial withdrawal  and correlative relief. In this example, the U.S. multinational corporation  (MNC) parent sells a product to its subsidiary incorporated in a foreign  country for $1,000. The U.S. parent is taxed on the income of $1,000 from  the sale and the subsidiary is able to deduct that payment.", "The U.S. tax authority audits the parent\u2019s return and determines that the  price the parent sold the product for was too low and adjusts to price up  from $1,000 to $2,000, resulting in an increase in taxable income. The  U.S. MNC parent disputes the adjustment and requests assistance from  the U.S. Competent Authority (USCA). The new adjusted transfer price  results in $1,000 that is subject to double taxation because the foreign  subsidiary has not deducted the additional $1,000 as the price paid to the  U.S. parent, while the U.S. tax authority is now considering that income  taxable.", "USCA negotiates with the foreign competent authority and the two parties  agree on a revised transfer price of $1,600. The negotiated resolution  results in USCA agreeing to withdraw $400 of the original adjusted  amount of the transfer price. In turn, the foreign competent authority  agrees to correlative relief in the form of an increased deduction of $600  of the additional price that the foreign subsidiary will pay the U.S. parent.  The taxpayer receives full relief from double taxation since the total of the  withdrawal and the correlative relief erases the $1,000 of double-taxed  income that resulted from the increased adjustment.", "Alternatively, foreign tax authorities can make adjustments that affect a  U.S. taxpayer. Table 7 provides a hypothetical example of a foreign  initiated adjustment to a cost-sharing arrangement, and a resolution that  provides full relief from double taxation, again, through a combination of  partial withdrawal and correlative relief.", "In this scenario, the U.S. parent and its foreign subsidiary agree to share  the costs of developing a product that will yield income of $10,000. As  part of the agreement, the subsidiary will receive 10 percent of the  income yield while the parent will receive 90 percent.", "The foreign tax authority audits the subsidiary\u2019s tax return and determines  that the amount of income assigned to the subsidiary is too low. It then  adjusts the percentage to 50 percent, increasing the income allocated to  the subsidiary from $1,000 to $5,000. This adjustment results in a  potential $4,000 of income that is now subject to double taxation. The  subsidiary decides that resolving this dispute locally is unlikely and  through the U.S. parent requests assistance from USCA.", "USCA and the foreign competent authority negotiate a new allocation of  35 percent resulting in new income allocated to the subsidiary of $3,500.  This resolution results in a combination of withdrawal and correlative  relief.

One possible indicator of complexity is whether an  economist was assigned to a case. United States Competent Authority  (USCA) ranks the cases in order of complexity and assigns economists to  the more complex cases. Our analysis of Advanced Pricing and Mutual  Agreement Program (APMA) data in figure 8 shows how the use of  economists varies by source of MAP cases. For most years, APMA  assigned economists to a higher percentage of cases that involved U.S.  than Canadian initiated adjustments. For most years, the share of  economists assigned to foreign initiated cases was similar to U.S. initiated  cases. However, in 2015 and 2016 the share of U.S. cases receiving an  economist was more than double that of all foreign initiated cases. For  most years, an economist was assigned to less than a quarter of foreign  and U.S. MAP cases.", "We also analyzed USCA inventory data to compare the percentage of  cases that were assigned an economist and the average time it took to  resolve cases. As figure 9 shows, the average time a case was in  processing tends to decrease when the percentage of cases that are  assigned an economist increases. This relationship suggests that  assigning economists to a case may reduce the time it takes to resolve it  despite the greater complexity of the case. However, there may be many  other factors that could influence processing time. APMA officials noted  that many these factors include the readiness of the foreign competent  authority to discuss the case in a timely fashion.
