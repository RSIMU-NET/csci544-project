With this act, Congress raised the rates to their current levels in response to the President\u2019s proposal that direct beneficiaries of the regulatory provisions pay a greater share of the cost incurred to administer the SOT program.", "In July 1987, ATF assumed the responsibility for administering the alcohol SOT program from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). There are separate occupational taxes for alcohol producers, wholesalers, and retailers. Each tax is a fixed amount per business location per year. The per location tax is $1,000 for large producers and $500 for small producers who grossed less than $500,000 the previous year. Producers include distillers, breweries, wineries, wine-bottling houses, and bonded wine cellars and warehouses. Wholesalers are required to pay a $500 occupational tax for each location. Retailers are required to pay a $250 occupational tax for each operating location. Retailers, who make up the largest group of alcohol SOT taxpayers, cover a wide variety of businesses\u2014for example, liquor stores, bars, restaurants, sports facilities, grocery stores, convenience stores, airlines, caterers, and hotels.", "Alcohol businesses are required to obtain a special tax stamp from ATF for each operating location before commencing business.

The flyer informs the retailer that it is being notified because a state or local jurisdiction has issued it a license to sell alcoholic beverages. The flyer advises the retailer that it must file a tax return and pay the occupational tax and that failure to do so could result in costly penalties and interest. Retailers that had not engaged in or are not currently engaged in the sale of alcoholic beverages are instructed to report this so that the Bureau can update the retailer\u2019s account and not mail additional notices.

Tax year 1998 ATF data showed that there were about 18,000 registered alcohol producers and wholesalers compared to about 372,000 known retail entities.

(App. II contains more information on computing civil penalties and interest.) Examination of SOT revenue data for fiscal year 1995 showed that ATF assessed and collected about $972,000 in failure-to-file penalties, about $164,000 in failure-to-pay penalties, and about $410,000 in interest from alcohol, tobacco, and firearm businesses. The total penalty and interest amounts accounted for about 1.4 percent of the total SOT payments for the fiscal year. ATF was unable to separate the penalty and interest amounts collected for the three business categories but estimated that over 90 percent of the tax, penalty, and interest amounts were from the alcohol SOTs.", "ATF also has authority to assess criminal penalties to enforce SOT compliance. Businesses and individuals can be fined up to $5,000 or imprisoned up to 2 years, or both, for each willful failure to comply with the SOT requirements. ATF uses these criminal penalties to enforce compliance with wholesale and retail operating requirements.

ATF officials acknowledged that they have not identified all alcohol businesses. They could not estimate the number of illegal producers and wholesalers that might be operating, without federal permits, as moonshiners and bootleggers. Registered alcohol businesses are required to certify that all operating locations have been correctly reported to ATF, but ATF does not verify that this has been done. However, the Bureau is confident that there is high compliance among producers and wholesalers because ATF issues federal permits for these alcohol businesses to operate and closely monitors their operations. In addition, alcohol producers and wholesalers account for a small number of businesses. ATF could not estimate the number of retailers not known to ATF who had not paid their occupational taxes. SOT compliance among retailers is more difficult to manage because they do not need federal permits to operate, have a high turnover rate, and account for a large universe of business entities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IG\u2019s Estimated Retailer Compliance Rate", "paragraphs": ["The IG reported an estimated average compliance rate of about 83 percent for retailers over tax years 1993, 1994, and 1995. The IG made this estimate by comparing ATF data on the total number of SOT stamps issued in each state and the District of Columbia and the total number of retail operating locations where alcohol is sold, as reported by state and the District licensing officials whom it surveyed. A total of 43 states and the District provided usable data.", "Because the IG simply compared the federal government\u2019s count of all retail locations in a given state with that state\u2019s own count, rather than doing a detailed matching of specific retail locations, it could have overestimated or underestimated the rate of compliance. The IG did not verify whether the states followed its instructions for enumerating the number of retail locations. The IG requested data from each state that (1) included all locations that were in operation at any time during the SOT tax years and (2) did not include locations that had ceased operations before the start of each SOT tax year. States may or may not have been able to produce enumerations from their information systems that met these exact criteria. Given the high rate of turnover among alcohol retailers, if the state data did not cover the time periods set by the IG, then those data could overestimate or underestimate the number of locations liable for tax. The fact that five states reported fewer retail locations than the ATF data showed had tax stamps for tax years 1993, 1994, and 1995 suggests that at least some states\u2019 data did not accurately represent the occupational taxpayer population. Also, like ATF\u2019s estimate, the IG\u2019s estimate did not cover retail locations that operate without the required state or local licenses, such as illegal after-hour clubs.", "The reliability of the ATF and IG estimates is difficult to assess without a more detailed examination of the methods used and data collected. To evaluate the accuracy of the state data, one would need to know what methods the states used to collect and verify their statewide data. One would also have to estimate the number of unlicensed retailers that do not appear on any records.

Congress reinstated the SOTs in the 1860\u2019s for the purpose of raising revenue. More recently, supporters have also justified the SOTs as providing revenues intended to recoup the federal costs of regulating the alcohol industry. Congress enacted special occupational tax rates increases under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 so that the beneficiaries of ATF regulation would pay a greater share of the costs of regulation. In addition to regulatory costs, economists believe that taxes on alcohol, such as the SOTs, may be used to offset the social cost of alcohol abuse.", "The SOTs have long been a source of revenue for the federal government\u2019s General Fund. After repeal in 1817, the taxes were reinstated in the 1860s to generate revenue. Under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 as amended, Congress must offset the budget impact of tax legislation that would reduce revenue. Eliminating the SOTs, or changing the SOTs in ways that reduce revenue, would require that Congress identify and enact revenue increases and/or spending reductions. For example, an increase in alcohol excise taxes has been suggested to offset revenue losses from repeal of the alcohol SOTs, and an increase in SOTs paid by producers and wholesalers has been proposed to offset revenue losses from repeal of the SOT on retailers. We have not evaluated these or other tax and spending alternatives.", "Supporters of the SOTs have justified the taxes as payments by the industry for the benefits that they claim the industry receives from regulation. If ATF\u2019s regulatory activities benefit the industry, SOT revenue may offset the costs of providing these benefits. ATF\u2019s regulatory activities, such as operating laboratories for testing and labeling alcoholic products, may benefit the industry if, by assuring consumers of the safety and quality of those products, the activities increase demand for alcohol products. ATF\u2019s law enforcement activities may benefit the industry, for example, by protecting the industry from the influence of organized crime.", "Economists have justified taxes on alcohol as providing revenues to recoup the social cost of alcohol abuse. Although this justification is usually made for alcohol excise taxes, both the excise taxes and the SOTs can be viewed as offsetting the costs to the government and society of alcohol abuse. People who abuse alcohol may use certain government programs, such as government-provided health-care and criminal justice services, more than nonabusers. People who abuse alcohol also impose costs on other members of society, such as the lives and property lost in alcohol-related traffic accidents.", "The SOTs are not well designed to reflect the benefits received by the taxpayer, the cost to the government of providing the benefits, or the costs to society. First, the SOTs are not likely to reflect how much individual taxpayers may benefit from ATF\u2019s regulatory activities because each alcohol retailer, wholesaler, and producer (collectively known as dealers) pays the same amount of tax for each premise. To the extent that dealers benefit from ATF\u2019s activities, the benefits are likely to vary considerably across premises because profits are likely to vary considerably from one location to another. Second, the tax rates are not likely to reflect the current costs of regulation because they are rarely changed. Before 1987, the rates had not been changed since the 1950s. Although rates were increased in 1987 for the stated purpose of recouping regulatory costs, SOT revenues may have been higher or lower than regulatory costs in 1987, and the rates have not been changed since 1987 to reflect any changes in costs. Finally, the revenue from SOTs is small relative to total federal excise taxes on alcohol, and therefore, their role in offsetting the regulatory or social costs associated with alcohol is likely to be small."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ATF Has Justified the SOTs as Facilitating ATF\u2019s Enforcement of Laws and Regulations", "paragraphs": ["The SOTs have been justified as facilitating ATF\u2019s enforcement efforts by giving the agency the authority to enter the premises of alcohol dealers and to require that the dealers keep certain records.

ATF officials believe that the access and recordkeeping authority provided by the SOTs is necessary for ATF enforcement efforts.", "The SOTs allow ATF inspectors entry into establishments that permits them to inspect for other violations. Provisions of the IRC permit ATF inspectors to enter premises to examine records, documents, and any alcohol stored on the premises. Once on the premises, ATF officials say that inspectors are able to check for nonpayment of the SOTs and other violations. For example, alcohol dealers are subject to fine and/or imprisonment for refilling or reusing liquor bottles. Inspectors can check for this violation, which prohibits dealers from refilling bottles of more expensive brands with cheaper liquor. ATF officials note that ATF has access to producers and wholesalers as part of its licensing and inspection authority. Except for the provisions of the IRC that are related to SOTs, ATF has only limited authority over retailers and no access to retailers\u2019 premises.", "The SOTs give ATF the authority to require that retailers and wholesalers keep records that help ATF control the alcohol distribution system. Under provisions of the IRC related to SOTs, retailers are required to record all of their purchases of alcohol and sales of alcohol of 20 gallons or more to the same person at the same time. The records must include the name and address of those from whom they purchased or to whom they sold the alcohol. Wholesalers are required to keep similar records for all of their purchases and sales. These records of transactions between dealers may help ATF enforce laws and regulations throughout the distribution system. For example, ATF officials say that the requirement that retailers record individual sales of 20 gallons or more helps ATF identify retailers who are operating as wholesalers by selling to other retailers. Retailers not paying the SOTs and unknown to ATF can be identified from the sales records of wholesalers, and the records of wholesalers and retailers can be used to trace transactions between dealers to check for payment of excise taxes. According to ATF officials, the SOTs are also useful to ATF for identifying retailers who owe floor-stock taxes. The floor-stock taxes are imposed on inventories when alcohol excise tax rates are increased and are generally equal to the difference between the old and new tax rates.", "ATF officials believe that the SOTs are useful in diversion cases to control distribution and enforce taxes. Diversion occurs when alcohol is sold at an illegal destination to evade federal and state excise taxes, rather than the legal destination stated on the required federal form. There are two kinds of diversion. Export diversion occurs when a dealer claims that alcohol is exported but actually sells the alcohol domestically. The dealer avoids an excise tax on this alcohol because excise taxes are not imposed on exports. Domestic diversion occurs when a dealer purchases alcohol in a low tax jurisdiction and smuggles the alcohol to a jurisdiction with higher excise tax for illegal sales.", "Provisions related to the SOTs can be used by ATF to combat both kinds of diversion. ATF officials say that ATF uses its access to records required by the SOTs to detect diversion by reviewing sales of unusually large volumes of alcohol and sales in certain types of containers that are easier to divert. The retailers\u2019 records may show evidence of the domestic sale of alcohol intended for export; or the absence of such records may be grounds to prosecute retailers for receiving the alcohol intended for export.", "ATF has pursued both criminal and civil prosecutions of diversion cases using SOT provisions. According to ATF data, there were 23 criminal alcohol diversion cases involving SOT violations between October 1, 1996, and March 31, 1998. ATF has also pursued civil prosecutions in 86 cases of diversion involving 62 companies between December 1, 1992, and December 19, 1996.

ATF was uncertain whether the access and recordkeeping authority may exist under other provisions of current law. ATF was not sure whether recordkeeping could be imposed under other provisions of the IRC if the retailer does not have a special occupational tax liability. If the SOTs were repealed, ATF said it could attempt to write regulations requiring specific records be kept by retailers. According to ATF officials, the courts could rule that the recordkeeping requirement is a valid exercise of the taxing power, or they could deny the authority because the activities that the Bureau wants recorded are not closely enough related to the excise tax collection process.", "If SOTs are eliminated and access and recordkeeping authority do not exist under other provisions of current law, ATF officials believe that the laws concerning regulation of the alcohol industry may have to be changed to permit the Bureau the same enforcement powers. The Federal Alcohol Administration Act of 1935 (FAA) regulates fair trade practices, chiefly promotional activities of dealers that affect the sales of other dealers. The act also imposes licensing requirements for wholesalers and producers, but there is no authority in this act for imposing recordkeeping requirements.

These criticisms have led some to propose changes in the SOTs that include (1) eliminating the tax on retailers to reduce administrative costs and (2) changing the structure of the tax from a fixed amount per business location to one that is based on business volume to make tax burdens fairer. Others have proposed that the SOTs be eliminated entirely."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SOTs Have Been Criticized for High Administrative Costs and Low Compliance", "paragraphs": ["We concluded in two separate reports that the administrative costs of the SOTs were high relative to the costs of administering the alcohol and tobacco excise taxes and that compliance among retailers may have been low. Since these reports were issued, the costs of administering the SOTs have declined. Estimates of current compliance with the SOTs among retailers are uncertain. An evaluation of whether administrative costs are excessive would require that the SOTs be compared with specific alternatives in terms of compliance rates and administrative costs, as well as other factors such as the compliance burden of taxpayers.", "In our 1990 report, we concluded that SOT costs were high relative to the costs of administering the alcohol and tobacco excise taxes. In fiscal year 1989 (in 1997 dollars), ATF spent $13 million to collect $162.6 million of SOTs\u2014a cost of 8 cents for every dollar collected. In the same year (also in 1997 dollars), ATF spent $64.9 million to collect $12.7 billion in alcohol and tobacco excise tax revenue\u2014a cost of 0.5 cents per dollar collected. Thus, the cost per dollar collected was 16 times greater for the SOTs than for the excise taxes. We also found in our 1986 study of compliance with the SOTs in four states that only about 60 percent of the retailers had paid the SOTs. ATF stated that it believed that the compliance rate found in our study was probably representative of compliance nationwide in 1986.", "According to ATF data, the costs of administering the SOTs, and the amount of revenue collected, have declined since 1989. In fiscal year 1997, ATF spent an estimated $1.9 million to collect $107 million of SOTs\u2014a decline in both costs and revenue from the $13 million spent to collect $162.6 million in 1989. The cost per dollar collected fell from 8 cents in 1989 to 1.8 cents in 1997. ATF also spent $55.1 million in 1997 to collect $12.6 billion in excise tax revenue\u2014a cost of 0.4 cents per dollar collected. The relative cost of administering the SOTs dropped from 16 times as great as the cost of the excise taxes in 1989 to 4.5 times as great in 1997.", "SOT revenues have declined in inflation-adjusted terms, despite the fact that the number of active business locations has increased from 350,000 in 1987 to 426,370 in 1998. Part of the decline is due to the fact that the tax, as a fixed amount per business location, does not increase with price inflation. Also, according to ATF officials, SOT revenues in 1989 included large amounts of back taxes, penalties, and interest that ATF discovered were owed when ATF took over administration of the SOTs from IRS. SOT administrative costs declined because ATF has devoted fewer resources to administering the SOTs. According to an ATF official, administrative costs depend largely (1) on ATF priorities that determine how many field staff are allocated to SOT enforcement, (2) on the number of contacts with taxpayers, and (3) on the number of congressional inquiries. Currently, the SOTs are not a high priority enforcement issue for ATF. Field staff have been instructed by ATF not to pursue SOT enforcement alone, but to check for SOT payment only as part of an investigation of alcohol dealers for other violations.", "While administrative costs have declined, the compliance rates, especially for retailers, are uncertain. As previously discussed, some estimates indicate that compliance among retailers may have increased from the 60 percent that we reported in 1986, but these estimates have limitations that make their reliability difficult to assess. An ATF official believes that compliance rates may have increased since 1986 because, when the Bureau took over enforcement of the SOTs from IRS in 1987, it devoted more resources to enforcement than IRS had and began matching state and federal records of alcohol dealers as part of its enforcement effort.", "Determining whether the administrative costs of the SOTs are excessive may be difficult because one would have to compare the costs and compliance rate for the SOTs with those of alternative revenue sources. It is important to compare both administrative costs and compliance rates because a tax may appear less costly to administer only because compliance rates (and enforcement costs) are lower. However, complete and reliable data on compliance and administrative costs for both the SOTs and alternative revenue sources may not be available. For example, ATF has estimates of the costs of collecting excise taxes but does not have estimates of compliance rates for the excise taxes.", "A complete evaluation of the SOTs relative to alternative ways of raising revenue would have to include other factors besides administrative costs and compliance rates. The evaluation would have to include an assessment of the compliance burden imposed on taxpayers by the SOTs relative to the compliance burden of alternatives that may be proposed, as well as the relative impact of the SOTs and alternatives on the efficiency and equity of the tax system. These factors affect the total cost to society of a tax in terms of the resources taxpayers use to comply with the tax, the loss of income and output that occurs when taxes interfere with economic decisionmaking, and the losses to taxpayers who perceive the tax as producing an unfair distribution of tax burdens."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opponents Have Criticized the SOTs for Being Unfair", "paragraphs": ["Opponents of the SOTs have criticized the taxes for being unfair. Because the taxes are a fixed amount per location, they may take more income from those with less ability to pay the tax, and, if compliance rates are low, compliant taxpayers would pay an unfair share of the tax burden. Other features of the SOTs, such as the requirement that businesses operating for only part of the year pay the full yearly rate, have also been criticized for imposing unfair tax burdens. The fairness of the SOTs depends on factors such as who actually bears the burden of the tax (i.e., how much of the tax is shifted from alcohol dealers to others in the economy in the form of higher prices); the income of those who pay the tax; and the rate of compliance with the SOTs.", "The SOTs have been criticized as inequitable because the fixed amount of tax per business location does not vary according to the taxpayers\u2019 ability to pay. There is no universally accepted measure of tax fairness. However, one commonly used criterion of fairness is that a tax burden should increase, at least proportionately, with the incomes of taxpayers. When this criterion is violated and the tax burden, as a percentage of income, is higher for low-income taxpayers, then the tax is considered to be \u201cregressive.\u201d Whether the SOTs are regressive depends on the incidence of the taxes, i.e., who actually bears the burden of the taxes, and the amount of the SOT paid by these individuals relative to their total income.", "The incidence of the SOTs depends on how much of the tax is shifted from the dealers to others in the economy through price changes, such as price increases to consumers of alcohol. The incidence of the SOTs is uncertain, but it is likely that, in the long run, at least a part of the SOTs is passed forward in higher prices to consumers. Determining whether the taxes are regressive requires measuring the share of the tax paid by the dealers and consumers relative to their total income. Thus, in order to determine regressivity, data are required on factors such as the total income of dealers and consumers, the effect of the SOTs on alcohol prices, and consumers\u2019 expenditures on alcohol. However, whether the taxes are shifted to consumers or paid by the dealers, the size of the SOTs means that their effect on prices and incomes is likely to be very small.", "The fairness of the SOTs may also be viewed from the broader perspective of the entire tax system. In this context, whether the SOTs are regressive depends on the income of those paying the tax relative to those not paying the tax. The taxes may be judged regressive if they are paid by individuals who tend to have lower incomes.", "The SOTs also have been criticized as inequitable because of allegedly low rates of compliance. Another commonly used criterion of fairness is that a tax should provide equal treatment of individuals with equal ability to pay. Noncompliance can create inequity because people with equal ability to pay and equal tax liability end up paying different amounts. Some critics of SOTs believe that the nonpayment of tax by some alcohol dealers puts the compliant dealers at a competitive disadvantage. Some industry representatives believe that compliance among retailers may be low relative to producers and wholesalers because retailers are unaware of their tax liability and because ATF has difficulty identifying retailers who have not paid the SOTs.", "Critics claim that other features of the SOTs, besides the fixed amount per location and low compliance, impose unfair tax burdens. Establishments open on a seasonal basis, such as marinas and campgrounds, have shortened sales periods but still pay the annual tax. As previously described, a standard for judging the fairness of a tax requires that the tax be related to the taxpayer\u2019s ability to pay. The SOT requirement that seasonal establishments pay the annual rate may make the taxes more regressive if the shortened sales period results in less income and the seasonal dealers bear the same tax burden as year-long dealers.", "Critics also claim that the SOTs are unfair because retailers who are unaware that they owe the tax can face substantial, accumulated tax, penalties, and interest if they have been in operation for several years without filing returns and paying the taxes. Generally, the IRC limits the period during which the SOTs and other taxes can be assessed to 3 years from the date the tax return was filed. The purpose of this provision is to limit the taxpayers\u2019 compliance costs of keeping and maintaining records. However, the IRC contains exceptions to this limitation that permit assessments at any time if, for example, the taxpayer fails to file a return or files a false return with the intent to evade taxes. This statute of limitations with its exceptions applies to taxpayers who owe income taxes and other taxes as well as those who owe the SOTs.
