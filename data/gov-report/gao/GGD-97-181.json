Weaknesses in the branch\u2019s internal controls, including inadequate segregation of duties in trading and lack of security or access restrictions in electronic funds transfer (EFT) activities, had enabled an employee to trade illegally and to hide the activities and resulting losses. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board said that before the losses were reported, the Federal Reserve had noted, but had not fully appreciated, the seriousness of some of the branch\u2019s weaknesses in internal control. One reason for this, according to the Federal Reserve, was that those weaknesses did not appear to be extraordinary in comparison to those found at other U.S. offices of foreign banking organizations (FBO).", "In response to concern about possible risks to the U.S. financial system, the Chairwoman and the Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, House Committee on Banking and Financial Services, requested that we review the supervision of the U.S. operations of FBOs and determine the extent of serious weaknesses in their internal controls and audits.", "This report is the final of three reports that respond to that request. The objectives of this report are to (1) identify U.S. supervisors\u2019 expectations for adequate internal controls and audits in U.S. branches and agencies of FBOs (FBO branches), (2) determine the extent of serious weaknesses in FBO branches\u2019 internal controls and audit reported by U.S. supervisors, and (3) describe U.S. supervisors\u2019 efforts to address these weaknesses. In our two prior reports, we provided the results of our reviews of the Federal Reserve\u2019s implementation of the Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement Act of 1991 and the implementation of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Foreign Banking Organization Supervision Program (FBO Program)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Congressional concern about the adequacy of internal controls and audits of FBO branches in the United States was raised in part by the illegal activities that occurred at a New York branch office of Daiwa Bank, which is headquartered in Japan. In September 1995, senior officials of Daiwa Bank informed the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that one of Daiwa Bank\u2019s New York branches had incurred losses of $1.1 billion from trading activities undertaken by a senior branch official, Mr. Toshihide Iguchi, over a period of 11 years, from 1984 to 1995. The Federal Reserve later found that these losses, which should have been reflected in the bank\u2019s books, records, and financial statements, were concealed from federal and state banking supervisors through liquidations of securities held in the bank\u2019s custodian accounts and falsification of its custody records.", "Not only was Mr. Iguchi able to conceal massive losses over an extended period, but the Federal Reserve found that senior management of Daiwa Bank also took steps to conceal the losses from U.S. supervisory authorities. Senior management of Daiwa Bank said they had learned about the trading losses 2 months before informing Federal Reserve officials. They also directed Mr. Iguchi to continue transactions during the 2-month period to avoid the disclosure of the losses.", "In October 1995, the New York Superintendent of Banks and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), together with the Federal Reserve, issued cease-and-desist orders against Daiwa Bank, requiring a virtual cessation of trading activities in the United States. In November 1995, Daiwa Bank was indicted on federal criminal charges. At the same time, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, the New York State Banking Superintendent, and a number of other state banking authorities jointly issued a series of orders that terminated Daiwa Bank\u2019s U.S. banking operations. In February 1996, Daiwa Bank pled guilty to numerous criminal offenses related to its scheme to cover up trading losses from U.S. bank supervisors and law enforcement authorities. The guilty plea resolved all outstanding criminal proceedings against Daiwa Bank, and it paid a criminal fine of $340 million. Mr. Iguchi and the former General Manager of Daiwa Bank\u2019s New York branch also pled guilty to criminal offenses associated with misconduct at the branch office."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "U.S. Supervisors Identified Conditions That Aided Illegal Activities at Daiwa Bank but Did Not Appreciate the Seriousness of Those Conditions", "paragraphs": ["Federal Reserve officials and staff who reviewed 1992, 1993, and 1994 examination records for the Daiwa Bank\u2019s New York branch office found that certain conditions had been identified at the branch that proved to be instrumental in the conduct of illegal activities. However, U.S. supervisors did not recognize all of the potential dangers associated with these conditions at the time of identification.", "According to Federal Reserve officials, U.S. supervisors first became aware in November 1993 that Mr. Iguchi was responsible for both some securities-related activities, possibly including trading, and custody operations as well as some related back-office settlement functions at the branch. The supervisors were concerned that Mr. Iguchi could use his position as overseer of the custody account, including his ability to gather information on the volume and nature of customer trades, to gain an improper advantage in carrying out the bank\u2019s trading activities. After finding no evidence of improper advantage, supervisors requested and received written confirmation that the identified dual capacities had been split. This confirmation was later determined to be false and misleading. Supervisors also noted weaknesses in security and access restrictions in EFT activities, which can enable unauthorized transfer of funds out of an FBO branch.", "While supervisors recognized that Mr. Iguchi\u2019s dual capacities were a potential problem, Federal Reserve staff said they did not recognize them as a potential opportunity for misappropriation of customer and bank funds. Prudent policy dictates that certain operations within an FBO branch be executed by different individuals to limit the possibility for any person to both perpetrate and conceal errors or irregularities in the normal course of his or her duties. As evidenced by Daiwa Bank and other cases, a lack of separation of trading and back-office settlement activities can have very adverse consequences. This lack of separation of duties was a weakness in internal control at Daiwa Bank.", "According to a report prepared by Federal Reserve Board staff, a number of factors contributed to the fact that supervisors did not perceive Mr. Iguchi\u2019s functions as a more serious problem when they were identified. One of the factors mentioned in the report was that the internal control problems of Daiwa Bank\u2019s New York branch during 1992 to 1993 did not appear to be extraordinary in comparison to those that supervisors were finding in their examinations of other U.S. offices of foreign banks.

As of that date, 498 FBO branches were operating in the United States, holding total assets of $821 billion. As legal and operational extensions of their parent foreign banks, FBO branches have no capital of their own. FBO branches serve primarily their home country and U.S. corporate customers and engage in lending, money market services, trading, trade financing, and other activities with banks and other financial institutions. The FBO branches can access the U.S. payments system through the Federal Reserve and obtain other Federal Reserve services.

The IBA sought to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d between branches and U.S. domestic banks by introducing the FBOs to the dual-bank regulatory system that is in effect for domestic banks. This policy of \u201cnational treatment\u201d allowed FBO branches to obtain a state charter or a federal charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and served as the basis for provisions in the IBA that eliminated certain advantages and disadvantages of state-only regulation.", "The regulatory regime established by the IBA did not fully account for certain safety and soundness and other concerns, however. In 1991, Congress passed the Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement Act (FBSEA). This act, which amended the IBA, authorized federal oversight of all foreign bank operations in the United States and vested this responsibility with the Federal Reserve. FBSEA also established uniform standards for the combined U.S. operations of foreign banks, generally requiring them to meet financial, management, and operational standards equivalent to those required of U.S. banking organizations. Finally, FBSEA prohibited foreign branches from accepting retail deposits (deposits of $100,000 or less that are insured by FDIC), although it grandfathered the branches that already offered insured deposits.", "Under FBSEA, the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory and regulatory powers over FBOs include (1) approving all FBOs seeking to establish U.S. offices, whether these offices are licensed by federal or state authorities, in accordance with standards set forth in the act; (2) terminating the activities of a state-licensed FBO branch or recommending that OCC terminate the license of a federally licensed FBO branch; and (3) ensuring that FBO operations in the United States are examined in a comprehensive and coordinated manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Foreign Banking Organization Supervision Program", "paragraphs": ["To enhance their supervision of foreign banking operations in the United States, the Federal Reserve began to implement its interagency FBO Program in March 1995.

Likewise, internal control can only help ensure the reliability of financial reporting and compliance with laws and regulations because judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and breakdowns can occur due to simple error or mistake.

We classified these weaknesses by type of weakness, such as inadequate segregation of duties, and by type of operation at the branch where the weakness occurred, such as trading operations.

This product is intended to provide U.S. supervisors with information about the overall condition of the U.S. offices, including branches, of individual FBOs, including information on control or audit weaknesses, which can then be factored into their supervision of the U.S. offices under their jurisdiction.", "Annual Comprehensive Examination Plan. This plan is intended to help better coordinate examinations of U.S. offices of FBOs with multiple U.S. banking operations and/or significant U.S. nonbanking operations. U.S. banking supervisors we interviewed reported many instances of increased coordination and cooperation among federal and state supervisors, which is important because problems, including internal control or audit weaknesses, identified at a particular office could manifest themselves at other offices of an FBO.", "Review of Home Country Financial System and Review of Significant Home Country Accounting Policies and Practices. These products are to provide information about the financial system and the supervisory and governmental policies in the FBO\u2019s home country and information about significant accounting policies and practices in the home country. For example, these products might include information about a general lack of a rigid internal auditing system in the financial institutions of a particular country or about a country\u2019s lack of a history of independent external auditors. This information may be useful to U.S. supervisors for overseeing the U.S. operations of an FBO from such a country.", "Strength-of-Support Assessment (SOSA). The SOSA is to provide an analysis and a ranking to reflect the U.S. supervisors\u2019 judgment about the FBO\u2019s ability to provide its U.S. operations with the necessary financial and managerial support. The SOSA ranking is to categorize all FBOs with U.S. banking operations by levels of supervisory concern, highlighting those whose U.S. operations are thought to warrant higher levels of supervisory attention. In some cases, an asterisk may be appended to a SOSA ranking when there are concerns about the ability of the FBO to maintain adequate internal controls and compliance procedures at its U.S. offices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rating System for FBO Branches", "paragraphs": ["In 1994, U.S. supervisors began phasing in the replacement of the previous asset-focused system of rating FBO branches, which was called the AIM rating system, with the new ROCA rating system. By the beginning of 1996, the ROCA rating system was fully phased in. The ROCA rating system places greater emphasis on the effectiveness of risk management processes and operational controls and was devised to better assess the condition of a branch within the context of the FBO. As we discussed in chapter 1, the ROCA rating system divides an FBO branch\u2019s overall activities into three individual components: risk management, operational controls, and compliance. These components represent the major activities or processes of the FBO branch that may raise supervisory concern. The ROCA rating system also provides for a specific rating of the quality of the FBO branch\u2019s stock of assets as of the examination date.", "Supervisory staff we interviewed said the shift from a focus on asset quality, under the AIM rating system, to a focus on risk management and operational controls, under the ROCA rating system, was an appropriate shift in emphasis. Staff said that the ROCA rating system was designed to look forward, while the AIM rating system\u2019s focus on assets was effectively a backward-looking approach because asset quality reflects an institution\u2019s past business decisions. Staff also said that they found that, to improve their examination rating, some foreign banks had focused on manipulating asset classification ratios and moving assets off the books of the branch to the head office or another entity in the bank. Although asset quality is still considered under the ROCA system, staff said it is not the primary emphasis.", "Officials representing the foreign banking industry also told us that the ROCA rating system is a better measure of an FBO branch\u2019s operations than was the AIM rating system. The officials said that the change from the AIM rating system to the ROCA rating system mirrored the way FBO branches had changed their businesses to focus on better risk management strategies and operational controls. An official from the Federal Reserve also told us that, although domestic banks are rated under a different system than FBO branches, the use of ROCA is consistent with national treatment because U.S. supervisors are still reviewing the same things that they review in domestic banks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Examination Manuals", "paragraphs": ["Along with the development of the ROCA rating system, the Federal Reserve, in cooperation with other federal and state banking agencies, developed the examination manual for conducting individual examinations of FBO branches. This manual was drafted to provide a common approach among all supervisory agencies with respect to individual FBO branch examinations. The manual was initially sent out for comment to U.S. supervisors in October 1993 and became effective in January 1995. Its content was drawn in large part from commercial bank examination procedures. However, all aspects of this examination manual were drafted to specifically address the unique characteristics of FBO branch examinations. Supervisory staff we interviewed told us that this is the first examination manual to be used by both state and federal supervisors for examinations of FBO branches, and that this has resulted in more consistent examinations. According to Federal Reserve officials, the examination manual has also been widely used as a reference tool by the foreign banking community in the United States to improve its internal controls. The examination manual has also supplemented the U.S. supervisors\u2019 efforts to inform foreign bankers and supervisors about U.S. internal control and audit standards.", "In 1994, the Federal Reserve also adopted a new Trading Activities Manual. Although developed primarily for U.S. commercial banks, the trading activities manual also applies to FBO branches, many of which are actively engaged in transactions involving trading activities. This manual includes detailed examination procedures for evaluating controls in trading activities; for example, it emphasizes the importance of separations of duties in a trading operation such as Daiwa Bank\u2019s.", "Federal Reserve staff also told us they are in the process of developing a module for supervisors to use during examinations that is intended to help the supervisors give a more risk focused approach to their review of internal controls and audits.

However, such rough measures do not determine whether there are appropriate linkages between examination results and the Federal Reserve\u2019s initiatives, such as training and education.

To that end, they have developed and implemented several initiatives in the past 2 to 3 years to improve the supervision of FBO branches and educate bank officials and home country supervisors about the importance of resolving internal control and audit weaknesses. These efforts include the FBO Program, the ROCA rating system, the development of new examination manuals, education and training programs, and the new requirement for special audits.", "The supervisors\u2019 efforts\u2014as they are designed\u2014appear to provide a basis for raising and maintaining control standards at FBO branches, and Federal Reserve supervisors told us that their efforts have already resulted in improved internal controls and audits at fair or lower rated FBO branches. However, supervisors have not yet developed a strategy for evaluating the results of these initiatives, including whether those results satisfactorily address the weaknesses identified or whether additional initiatives may be needed. Such a strategy could, for example, determine whether there are appropriate linkages between examination results and training and education efforts. For information to be available to monitor the impact of the initiatives when they are fully implemented, it is important that the supervisors promptly identify the data that are needed and ensure that the systems necessary to gather and maintain those data are in place and operating."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Federal Reserve develop a strategy, including objective measures, for assessing the progress it is making through its efforts to improve internal controls and audits at FBO branches and ensure that the procedures and systems necessary to collect the data relevant to those measures are in place and operating.

The Board also said that several rough measures currently indicate some degree of improvement in those areas. As an example of such measures, the Board noted a decline, since 1993, in the number of FBO branches with fair or lower overall examination ratings or component ratings that are substantively affected by internal control and audit weaknesses."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
