For example, as of February 2015, the number of records with missing data had increased by more than 600 since 2012.

The annual internal report divides the inventory into the categories of  requirement-related munitions stock, economic retention munitions stock,  contingency retention munitions stock, and potential reutilization and  disposal stock. The manual also directs the departments to develop an  external report identifying inventory in the same categories for each  ammunition listed. The military departments are to use these reports,  among other things, to identify opportunities for redistributing ammunition  to meet unfilled needs in other military departments.

For example, the Executive Director for  Conventional Ammunition reported in September 2014 that DOD avoids  an average of $72 million annually in procurement costs by using the  redistribution process regarding each service\u2019s inventory holdings that  exceed their needs. During the fiscal year 2014 redistribution process,  the services transferred approximately 5 million items among each other,  of which approximately 3 million were small-caliber items such as  ammunition for rifles or pistols, about 2 million were for larger-caliber  weapons such as mortars, and about 383,000 were a mixture of other  types of ammunition.

According to  DOD officials, the reasons for the missing data in the CAD stockpile are  related to the types of items transferred into the stockpile, such as older  ammunition stocks that do not have complete weight data, nonstandard  ammunition, foreign ammunition used for testing, components removed  from larger weapons, and ammunition with records that migrated from  legacy data systems. DOD officials stated they are trying to correct  current records with missing or inaccurate data, particularly weight. In  some cases, such as older stocks, the only solution is to locate and  physically weigh the ammunition item(s). DOD officials have not weighed  the items because they said it would be costly and labor intensive.  However, since the items without weight data are not factored into DOD\u2019s  demilitarization determination, DOD is not positioned to optimally  demilitarize the most ammunition possible with the given resources  available.

Specifically, the military services have achieved benefits such as cost  avoidances from access to the information in LMP on the CAD stockpile.  For example, an Air Force need for 280,000 rounds of 40 millimeter  ammunition was met by the remanufacture of Navy 40 millimeter shells  drawn from the CAD stockpile, which according to Joint Munitions  Command officials saved an estimated $30 million. Also, the Marine  Corps identified the need for signal flares at security check points in Iraq  and Afghanistan, so they pulled 95,594 flares out of the CAD stockpile,  which according to Marine Corps officials saved the service an estimated  $3.8 million. When the services have been able to fulfill needs by  drawing ammunition from the CAD stockpile, financial benefits have  arisen both in reduced demilitarization costs over time and reduced new  procurements.", "DOD also has reduced its demilitarization costs by transferring some  excess ammunition to other government agencies as opposed to  demilitarizing the ammunition, but has made such transfers only on a  limited basis.

Many  munitions are harmful to human health and the environment, and  demilitarizing large quantities of ammunition requires the rigorous  control and processing of toxic substances. Some of the  demilitarization processes generate additional environmental hazards,  such as air pollutants and waste water. Figure 2 shows the release of  air pollutants from the open burning of munitions. Other  demilitarization processes, such as open detonation, generate noise  pollution affecting the local community. According to SMCA officials,  open burn and open detonation are the primary and cheapest  methods to demilitarize conventional ammunition; further, some  munitions can only be demilitarized by this process. All seven  depots that demilitarize conventional ammunition have the capability  to demilitarize ammunition through open burn/open detonation.  However, officials stated there are environmental concerns with open  burn/open detonation that may force DOD to use alternate and more  costly methods of disposal, like closed disposal technology, in the  future. For example, officials at one demilitarization facility noted that  they generally operated their open detonation demolition ranges at  less than 50 percent of capacity (weight of explosive charge) due to  air and noise pollution concerns.", "According to DOD officials, DOD works to ensure compliance with  various environmental regulations by applying for and maintaining  permits issued by federal and state agencies that regulate its  demilitarization operations. Officials indicated that these permits are  granted by federal and state agencies and specify which pollutants  can be released and in what quantities, as well as describe in detail  how each process controls pollutants and meets applicable standards.  If environmental regulations change, DOD officials indicated they may  need to renew their permits; if the permits are revised, DOD may be  required to fund capital investments in equipment and processes to  conform to the requirements of any new permits. SMCA officials  stated they address these challenges by including in each annual  demilitarization plan sufficient work for each depot to exercise existing  environmental permits so the permits do not lapse. Also, they recycle  or remanufacture, when possible, materiel that otherwise would be  destroyed. Finally, the officials indicated that they contract with private  companies to conduct some of the demilitarization work as well.", "Treaty Compliance: The U.S. government is considering two treaties  that, if ratified, would significantly impact U.S. demilitarization  operations. One treaty is the Convention on Cluster Munitions and  the other is the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,  Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their  Destruction. DOD has an inventory of 471,726 tons of cluster  munitions and 23,436 tons of anti-personnel landmines that will have  to be disposed of if the United States ratifies the two treaties.   Specifically, the conventions require the destruction of the respective  cluster munitions and landmines inventories, and to comply, DOD  officials stated that they would be forced to prioritize disposal of these  weapons without concern to maximizing the reduction of the CAD  stockpile.", "Service Forecasts: SMCA officials said that DOD\u2019s demilitarization  budget request frequently does not match actual funding needs. The  request is based upon the estimated disposal costs required to reduce  the existing CAD stockpile, as well as costs for disposing of  ammunition the services forecast they will submit for disposal. Each of  the services is required to submit a 5-year forecast on the amount of  ammunition they expect to turn in for demilitarization each year.  However, program officials indicate the services\u2019 forecasts are  generally inaccurate, which can make demilitarization planning  challenging. In 2010, the Army Audit Agency found that Army officials  had significantly understated the forecasted annual additions the  services would transfer to the CAD stockpile from 2005 to March  2009, and these estimates were based on the projections furnished by  the services. The Army Audit Agency recommended the Joint  Conventional Ammunition Policies and Procedures 7 (Demilitarization  and Disposal) be revised to help the military services develop better  forecasts for additions to the stockpile. In their 2013 follow-up report,  the Army Audit Agency found that the Joint Conventional Ammunition  Policies and Procedures 7 (Demilitarization and Disposal) had been  revised in 2011; however, the forecast additions for fiscal year 2012  were still inaccurate.

The critical requirement is the funding  necessary to demilitarize 3 percent of the existing stockpile and the  full amount of ammunition the services plan to add to the CAD  stockpile during the year. In December 2013, Army Audit Agency  reported the Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics (G-4) estimated  the critical funding level for the demilitarization of conventional  ammunition at approximately $185 million. Further, the report stated  that the conventional ammunition demilitarization program is  considered a lower priority when compared to other needs. The  Department of the Army\u2019s budget request for conventional  ammunitions demilitarization in fiscal year 2015 was $114 million and  for fiscal year 2016 it was $113 million. Officials stated that the  amount of funding has caused them to be reluctant to initiate projects  that increase demilitarization capacity or efficiency, since these  capabilities may not be utilized in the future due to funding shortfalls.  Furthermore, officials state they lack Research, Development, Test,  and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding to develop demilitarization  processes for the disposal of some materiel in the CAD stockpile that  cannot be demilitarized using current processes, but they expect  these funds will be increased in fiscal year 2017.

Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that an  entity should have controls to ensure that all transactions are complete  and accurately recorded. DOD does maintain data on conventional  ammunition in the stockpile and uses it to manage demilitarization efforts,  but officials have not fully maintained accurate and complete weight data  on some ammunition items, which factors into their decision making about  what to demilitarize in a given year. Without complete and accurate data,  DOD is not well positioned to make the best demilitarization decisions  and to use demilitarization resources as efficiently as possible.  Furthermore, efficient management of the CAD stockpile is not solely a  matter of demilitarization, since some materiel in it potentially could be  transferred to other agencies, in keeping with DOD regulations and  statutory requirements. Such transfers could allow DOD to reduce  demilitarization costs and the size of the CAD stockpile while also  reducing the need for other government agencies to procure new stocks  of ammunition.

The scope of the audit was limited  to the materiel in the CAD stockpile and ammunition in the services\u2019  inventory that was unserviceable or in excess of the services\u2019 needs. We  interviewed Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force officials to  determine how they manage unserviceable ammunition and serviceable  ammunition that is beyond the services\u2019 needs.

We interviewed Single Manager for  Conventional Ammunition (SMCA) and service officials to learn how  information on excess, obsolete, and unserviceable ammunition is  shared.  After initial discussions with DOD officials, we determined that  the department does not consider the value of ammunition in the  management of its CAD stockpile so we did not review the value of the  conventional ammunition. Further, we conducted a data reliability  assessment of the Air Force Combat Ammunition System, the Navy\u2019s  Ordnance Information System, the Marine Corp\u2019s Ordnance Information  System \u2013 Marine Corps, and the Army\u2019s Logistics Modernization Program  by reviewing the services\u2019 responses to questionnaires on the internal  controls they use to manage their systems.

The questions seek to determine if  there were controls that restricted access to the information system to  prevent unauthorized access or inappropriate use and that there were  data quality controls that ensured completeness, accuracy, authorization,  and validity of all transactions. We interviewed service officials in the  Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps to learn how ammunition is  managed once the decision is made to demilitarize and transfer it to the  CAD stockpile. We also interviewed officials on the visibility, accessibility,  accuracy, and usefulness of the data on the CAD stockpile and determine  if they have identified problems regarding the reliability of the data. Lastly,  we reviewed policies and legislation to determine what guidance was  provided on communicating excess conventional ammunition to other  government agencies, and we interviewed SMCA officials about the  extent to which they communicate the availability of excess ammunition to  other government agencies and the challenges involved with making  conventional ammunition available to government entities outside of  DOD.", "To examine challenges, if any, DOD has identified in managing the  current and anticipated CAD stockpile, and if so, actions taken to address  those challenges, we reviewed DOD reports on the management of the  current CAD stockpile to identify any problem areas and DOD\u2019s plans to  address these problems. We visited McAlester Army Ammunition Plant  and examined the management of its ammunition demilitarization  operation to include storage practices and a variety of methods to destroy  the ammunition. We selected McAlester Army Ammunition Plant to visit  because a large portion of the CAD stockpile was stored there, and it  used several methods to demilitarize ammunition.

Autoclave - Autoclave capability removes and reclaims main charge  cast explosives (such as TNT) from projectiles and bombs. Munitions are  prepared for the autoclave by disassembly or cutting to expose the main  explosive charge. They are placed in the autoclave and the vessel is  heated using steam. As the munitions body heats up, the explosive melts  and flows to the bottom of the autoclave for collection in heated kettles.  2. Hot Water Washout - Washout capability removes and reclaims main  cast explosive charges from projectiles, bombs, and mines. Munitions are  prepared for washout by disassembly to expose the main explosive  charge. Munitions are placed over a washout tank where low-pressure  hot water is injected into the cavity to wash out the explosives into a  recovery tank.  3. Cryofracture - Cryofracture involves the cooling of the munitions in a  liquid nitrogen bath, followed by fracture of the embrittled item(s) in a  hydraulic press and the subsequent thermal treatment of the fractured  munitions debris in order to destroy the explosives and decontaminate  any residual metal parts.  4. Hydrolysis \u2013 Hydrolysis uses a sodium hydroxide solution to dissolve  the aluminum casing and expose the energetic materials contained  within. The sodium hydroxide solution then reacts with the energetic  materials, breaking them down and rendering them inert.  5. Improved Munitions Convention Download \u2013 Joint Munitions Command  officials describe this as a process developed to demilitarize artillery  projectiles that contain submunitions, which are small bombs. The base  plate of the projectile is removed to access the submunitions and they are  removed for disposition on the open detonation range. The metal parts  including the projectile body and base plate are often reused in the  manufacture of new rounds.  6. Incineration - Incineration provides an environmentally acceptable  means to destroy munitions not suitable for other demilitarization methods  and reclaim the metal scrap for sale. Small munitions and/or components  are fed on conveyor(s) into the incinerator where they burn or detonate.  Metal residues are discharged and collected for salvage.  7. INERT \u2013 According to Joint Munitions Command officials, INERT is the  shredding, cutting, or mutilation of munitions items, components, or  packaging that do not contain energetic materials.  8. Open Burn/Open Detonation - Open burn and open detonation are the  intentional combustion or detonation of explosives or munitions, without  control or containment of the reaction, and are the preferred method for  cost-effective demilitarization of many items. Open burn and open  detonation techniques were the primary means used to demilitarize  munitions for several decades.  9. Slurry Emissions Manufacturing Facility \u2013 According to Joint Munitions  Command officials this facility combines energetic material recovered  from munitions items with other commercial ingredients to produce  blasting charges the mining industry uses.  10. Steamout - Steamout is similar to hot water washout in that both  processes essentially melt out energetic fillers in large-caliber projectiles,  bombs, and other munitions. With the steamout process, items are placed  on an inclined cradle, and steam is jetted in to melt out the fill. The molten  slurry is collected and sent to corrugate cooling pans. The pans are held  in a vented and heated hood until the water is all evaporated and the  explosive solidifies. The solidified explosive is broken into chunks, boxed,  and then according to Joint Munitions Command officials, used as donor  material for open detonation projects.  11. White Phosphorus Plant - The White Phosphorus-Phosphoric Acid  Conversion Plant provides an environmentally acceptable means to  demilitarize munitions containing white phosphorus by converting it into  phosphoric acid. The munitions are punched to expose the white  phosphorus and quickly burned. Smoke from the burning munitions is  pulled through a closed loop ducting system into the wet scrubber in the  acid plant system for conversion to phosphoric acid. The phosphoric acid  is collected and packaged for sale. Metal parts are discharged and  collected for salvage."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: DOD Processes to Determine the Ammunition to Demilitarize", "paragraphs": ["To determine what conventional ammunition should be demilitarized,  Joint Munitions Command officials stated they use a database tool called  the Demilitarization Optimizer.

Officials stated they use the optimizer as a  starting point in developing the annual demilitarization plan; they make  adjustments to the optimizer output to maintain demilitarization capability  at the depots and to balance the work load over the years. For the  demilitarization of missiles, Army Aviation and Missile Command officials  stated they do not use the optimizer because they prepare their plan  using the number of missiles; however, they consider many of the same  factors in determining what missiles to demilitarize in a given year."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Process to Determine What Non-Missile Ammunition to Demilitarize", "paragraphs": ["The optimizer is a database tool used to determine the ammunition, with  the exception of missiles, that will be demilitarized, given certain  parameters (e.g., inventory, depot capability and capacity, funding,  transportation costs, and any mandatory workload requirements). The  optimizer has been used by Joint Munitions Command since 1999 as a  tool to assist in demilitarization program planning, provide justification to  answer questions received from Congress as well as Army headquarters,  and provide the most economic allocation of resources among the  government depots. Further, the optimizer provides Joint Munitions  Command with an auditable trail of decision making and an ability to  provide a quick response to \u201cwhat if\u201d questions. The optimizer database  uses several data points to determine what items should be demilitarized:  1.  Demilitarization inventory and forecasted additions to the CAD  stockpile \u2013 the amount of ammunition currently in the CAD stockpile  and the estimated amount of ammunition that the services determine  they will add to the stockpile that year.  2.  Depot capability, capacity, and costs of carrying out demilitarization \u2013  depot capability is the type of demilitarization work the depot has the  ability to conduct. For example, most of the depots have the capability  to conduct demilitarization through open burn and open detonation.  Depot capacity is the amount of work that the depot has the ability to  conduct by demilitarization capability. For example, Letterkenny  Munitions Center has the capacity to demilitarize 3,500 tons of  ammunition each year by open burn and 1,250 tons by open  detonation. The cost of carrying out demilitarization is an estimate,  prepared by the depot, of the cost to demilitarizing specific  ammunition using a particular demilitarization capability. Data on  storage costs is not entered into the optimizer for cost calculations.  3.  Funding \u2013 the amount of funding available for demilitarization based  on the current fiscal year budget allocation.  4.  Packing, crating, handling, and transportation \u2013 the cost of moving  ammunition to the appropriate demilitarization location.  5.  Mandatory workloads \u2013 any directives or management initiatives that  would change the priority of demilitarization work that must be  conducted. For example, if the United States signed the Convention  on Cluster Munitions, DOD would be required to demilitarize all cluster  munitions within 8 years. This information would be entered into the  optimizer to ensure the treaty requirement would be met.", "Joint Munitions Command officials cautioned that there are some inherent  uncertainties in the optimizer process that affect the outcome. One of the  uncertainties is the incoming workload. While Joint Munitions Command  has an estimate of how much inventory will be generated each year for  demilitarization, the estimates are not perfect and leave uncertainty in the  quantity of items that will be turned over for demilitarization and the time  at which those items will enter the CAD stockpile. Joint Munitions  Command officials stated that the optimizer provides a good starting point  for decision-making, based on the specific parameters described above,  but they do not assign demilitarization projects based solely on the  optimizer output.", "Officials stated that the optimizer produces a list of projects, based on  tons, that would be most economical to demilitarize for that given year.  However, adjustments are made to balance complex, expensive  demilitarization projects with simple, inexpensive demilitarization projects.  Since the optimizer attempts to maximize the amount of conventional  ammunition demilitarized, it tends to recommend a number of inexpensive  projects. This results in pushing the expensive demilitarization projects  into the future, which may increase future demilitarization costs.  Therefore, to maintain a balance between future demilitarization funding  needs and the current funding provided for demilitarization, officials  replace some of the inexpensive projects the optimizer recommends with  expensive projects.", "Additionally, officials make adjustments to the optimizer results to ensure  each depot is provided sufficient work to maintain demilitarization  capabilities. Officials are concerned that if they do not provide some work  to each of the depots, the depots would lose their demilitarization  capability because some processes require specialized skills or training  and retaining those personnel would be impossible if demilitarization was  curtailed for a significant amount of time. The loss of trained personnel  would create a significant deficit in training and delay the restart of any  future demilitarization operations. Further, officials are concerned they  risk losing their environmental permits if demilitarization operations were  stopped at an installation for a significant amount of time.
