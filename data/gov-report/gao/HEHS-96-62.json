At that time, its primary purpose was to prevent \u201closs or reduction of benefit rights\u201d for wage earners who became disabled and were considered unable to continue paying Social Security taxes. The program provided payment of cash benefits to disabled workers aged 50 or older. Benefits for dependents of disabled workers were provided by the 1958 Social Security Amendments, and benefits to disabled workers under age 50 were provided by the 1960 amendments.

For SSA to determine whether an applicant qualifies for disability benefits, the application proceeds through a five-step evaluation process (see app. II). In step one, an SSA field office determines if an applicant is currently engaged in SGA. If an applicant is found not to be engaged in SGA, the field office forwards the application to a state Disability Determination Service (DDS) office for processing through the remaining four steps until a determination of disability or no disability is reached. A DDS office develops medical, functional, vocational, and other necessary evidence; evaluates it; and determines whether the applicant meets the disability criteria set forth in SSA regulations.

Generally, a beneficiary loses eligibility for benefits under one of two conditions: (1) a beneficiary earns more income than allowed by program rules (the monthly ceiling is $500 for disabled DI beneficiaries and $960 for blind DI beneficiaries; for SSI, the ceiling varies from state to state\u2014for example, $1,464 in Pennsylvania and $1,855 in California) or (2) SSA decides that a beneficiary\u2019s medical condition has improved to the point that he or she is no longer considered disabled and can now perform work at the SGA level. In order to make this latter determination, SSA periodically performs continuing disability reviews. The law requires SSA to conduct such a review at least once every 3 years on DI beneficiaries whose medical improvement is possible or expected. When medical improvement is not expected, SSA is required to schedule a continuing disability review at least once every 7 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Statute Provides for Returning Beneficiaries to Work", "paragraphs": ["The Social Security Act states that people applying for disability benefits should be promptly referred to state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies for services in order to maximize the number of such individuals who can return to productive activity.

DDS offices decide whether or not to refer applicants to state VR agencies. DDS offices make referral decisions using SSA\u2019s recommended criteria and additional criteria developed in consultation with state VR agencies to screen out applicants who are not considered to be reasonable candidates for rehabilitation.", "Once a referral has been made, a state VR agency weighs the candidate\u2019s potential for rehabilitation against that of other VR applicants. If the VR agency decides to offer services to the applicant, it contacts the applicant directly. State VR agencies also provide rehabilitation services to people not involved with the DI and SSI programs. VR services include, for example, guidance, counseling, and job placement, as well as therapy and training. State VR agencies are reimbursed by the federal government for the rehabilitation cost of each DI/SSI client who is returned to employment at the SGA level for 9 continuous months. The Social Security Act provides for withholding benefits from beneficiaries for refusal, without good cause, to accept rehabilitation services offered to them.", "A beneficiary who engages in work encounters additional challenges, however. By returning to work, a beneficiary trades guaranteed monthly income and premium-free medical coverage for the uncertainties of competitive employment. To reduce this risk, the Congress has established program provisions, referred to as work incentives, to safeguard cash and medical benefits while a beneficiary tries to return to work. For example, DI provisions allow beneficiaries to engage in a trial work period during which they can earn any amount without affecting their benefits.Beneficiaries who complete a trial work period but who do not medically recover can retain Medicare coverage for at least an additional 39 months. In addition, cash benefits can be reinstated for any month within a 36-month period following the end of a trial work period if a beneficiary\u2019s earnings drop below the SGA level. Under SSI provisions, beneficiaries whose impairments continue are allowed to earn above the SGA level and to continue to receive reduced cash benefits indefinitely. Also, SSI beneficiaries whose earnings eliminate eligibility for cash benefits can continue to receive Medicaid coverage if their incomes remain within certain limits.", "Despite congressional interest in helping return DI and SSI beneficiaries to employment, few beneficiaries engage in work while on the rolls and fewer still leave the rolls to return to work. In a recent month, for example, about 8 percent of SSI recipients aged 18 to 64 reported any earnings, and about 1 percent of DI beneficiaries reported earning $500 or more. Moreover, during each of the past several years, about 6,000 of the more than 3 million DI beneficiaries have been terminated from the rolls because they returned to work. Although SSA does not count the number of SSI beneficiaries terminated because of return to work, it has estimated that few are terminated for this reason.", "The proportion of beneficiaries who return to work (1 in 500 for DI) would be higher if candidates unlikely to obtain gainful employment were excluded from the equation. Such candidates include, for example, beneficiaries who are expected to die or to reach retirement age within a few years following benefit award. SSA research findings provide some estimate of the size of these groups. Among a cohort of beneficiaries who entered DI in 1988, 28 percent died and 17 percent reached 65 within 5-1/2 years. Also, among cohorts of recipients who entered SSI between 1974 and 1982, 28 percent died or reached 65 within 10 years. Moreover, 46 percent of all working-aged DI and SSI beneficiaries are 50 or older.

Compared with beneficiaries with shorter-term impairments, a lower proportion of beneficiaries with longer-term impairments are terminated from the rolls each year because of death.

Also, the U.S. economy may be moving toward more temporary or part-time work (which generally offers little if any health care coverage and other benefits).

Through 1981, SSA allocated funds to state VR agencies to finance VR services provided to beneficiaries regardless of rehabilitation outcome. Under the current VR reimbursement program established by the Congress in 1981, SSA reimburses state VR agencies only for costs incurred in successfully rehabilitating DI and SSI beneficiaries (SSA-defined success). The Congress intended this \u201csuccess-based\u201d reimbursement system to provide state VR agencies with an incentive to rehabilitate beneficiaries to SSA\u2019s standards.", "We reported previously that VR agencies became more cautious about accepting DI beneficiaries for services following implementation of the current reimbursement system. They were more cautious because of (1) the perceived lower likelihood of success with DI beneficiaries and (2) the uncertainty of getting SSA reimbursement for the cost of VR services because SSA had a considerable backlog of claims for VR reimbursement at the time. The HHS/OIG found little evidence in 1990 that the reimbursement system was inducing states to increase the number of SSA clients served.With two exceptions, the sampled states had made no special efforts to enroll SSA beneficiaries in VR programs, and none had established any special rehabilitation activities for them. In spite of the Congress\u2019 intent to motivate state agencies to rehabilitate beneficiaries, the OIG found that, because of implementation problems, states had little incentive to rehabilitate SSA clients. Problems included, for example, delays in receiving reimbursements from SSA and policies in some states that required reimbursements to be deposited into a state\u2019s general fund rather than into a VR agency\u2019s operating budget. Thus, problems in implementation have hampered testing the full potential of the success-based reimbursement system."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Beneficiaries Are Unaware of VR Services and Are Not Encouraged to Use Them", "paragraphs": ["SSA field office employees are required by agency regulations to inform applicants for disability benefits that they may be contacted by a state VR agency about an opportunity for rehabilitation.

Moreover, employees are expected to give written materials about VR services to anyone who inquires about disability benefits.", "In spite of these policies, a 1995 HHS/OIG survey of DI and SSI applicants found that respondents were generally uninformed about VR. More than two-thirds of the respondents said that they had not been told or did not recall having been told that they might be contacted about VR services. Three out of every four respondents said that they had not been told or did not recall having been told that benefit payments might stop if they refused to participate in VR. Moreover, three out of every four respondents said they had not received or did not recall having received materials about VR services. If not informed about VR services, the chances of beneficiaries\u2019 becoming rehabilitated and returning to the workforce may be reduced.", "Responding to findings by the Joint VR Referral Task Force that beneficiaries lacked awareness about rehabilitation opportunities, SSA has recently developed and distributed a brochure on VR for its field offices to disseminate to beneficiaries. The availability of updated materials on VR, however, does not guarantee that a beneficiary will be thoroughly familiar with VR services, as SSA and DDS employees generally lack incentives to educate beneficiaries about VR.", "In addition to the lack of awareness and support, beneficiaries generally lack encouragement to take part in VR services. For example, some state VR agencies make little or no attempt to contact beneficiaries and involve them in their VR programs or actively encourage them to become interested in VR. Additionally, fewer than half the applicants surveyed by the OIG in 1995 reported that someone had encouraged them to participate in VR. And only one out of every four applicants surveyed reported having received encouragement from SSA employees to take part in VR services.

We found that gains in employment and earnings of clients who had been successfully rehabilitated (VR-defined success) faded after about 2 years, with earnings for many returning to near or below the pre-VR program level after 8 years. Clients who had been successfully rehabilitated had better work and earnings histories than clients who had dropped out of the VR program.", "However, clients who had not been rehabilitated, but had received many of the services that rehabilitated clients had received, did no better in later employment and earnings than VR dropouts who had received no services after an initial VR evaluation.", "Obtaining sustained, gainful work for clients is not always the focus of state VR agencies, which may be one reason that long-term gains are limited. Each client served works with the state VR agency to establish an individual rehabilitation plan. The plan includes an achievable vocational goal considered to be \u201csuitable employment\u201d for the client. The VR agency considers a client to be successfully rehabilitated following 60 days of suitable employment (VR-defined success). Suitable employment need not involve wages or salary and may include, for example, working as an unpaid homemaker or family worker. The suitable employment found for about 10 percent of state VR agencies\u2019 successful cases in fiscal year 1992 was as unpaid homemakers. Moreover, more than one of every four DI beneficiaries rehabilitated in fiscal year 1992 was an unpaid homemaker.", "The VR 60-day measure of success is less rigorous than SSA\u2019s criterion of employment at SGA for 9 continuous months. State VR agency employees, accountable to their states for success according to the 60-day measure, may not necessarily be geared toward providing beneficiaries with services oriented toward achieving and maintaining long-term gainful employment.

SSA researchers reported that certain VR services\u2014job placement, vocational training, and general education\u2014had a significant and positive effect on the tendency for DI beneficiaries to return to work. This finding is supported by another study of the same population, in which about one-half to two-thirds of DI beneficiaries who received these types of VR services indicated that the services helped them return to work or continue working. The latter study found, however, that these VR services were offered to a small segment of the relatively few DI beneficiaries who received VR: only 6 percent received job placement services, 12 percent received vocational training, and 7 percent received general education.

Beneficiaries cannot choose among public and private service providers operating in a competitive market to find the one that provides the services they believe are most valuable.", "New authority in SSA\u2019s regulations allows SSA to refer people to private VR providers when the state VR agencies refuse or are unable to serve referrals. SSA put into place the information system needed to begin implementation of these regulations early in 1996 and expects to have some private entities providing VR to its referrals by the summer of 1996. Although the regulations introduce limited competition in providing VR services to DI and SSI beneficiaries, two factors may limit participation by private VR providers. First, state VR agencies have 4 months to accept or reject a referral before beneficiaries can receive services from private providers. This first right of refusal may result in state agencies\u2019 selecting beneficiaries who are the easiest to rehabilitate and employ, thereby leaving the most difficult cases for the private market to serve. Second, some private providers have criticized the practice of reimbursing for services only after clients have been employed at SGA for 9 continuous months.

The Congress has signaled an interest in taking advantage of these changes to enhance the employment opportunities for DI and SSI beneficiaries.", "A significant portion of people receiving disability benefits may not be likely candidates for rehabilitation and return to work, however. For instance, almost one-half of a cohort of beneficiaries who entered DI in 1988 died or reached the age of 65 in less than 6 years. Furthermore, almost one-half of the adult DI and SSI beneficiary population was aged 50 or older in 1994.", "On the other hand, there is a meaningful portion of working-age beneficiaries who can be expected to survive for many years, and who may be candidates to return to work. SSA testified before the House Committee on Ways and Means in 1990 that almost one-third of DI and SSI beneficiaries are very good candidates for VR. Furthermore, 35 percent of the 84,000 DI beneficiaries who responded to a questionnaire in May 1993 that asked if their medical conditions had changed indicated an interest in receiving rehabilitation or other services that could help them get back to work.", "Weaknesses in the design and implementation of the DI and SSI programs, however, mean that little has been done to identify and encourage the productive capacities of beneficiaries who might be able to benefit from rehabilitation and employment assistance. The disability determination process encourages applicants to focus on their incapacities and, coupled with a strong financial incentive to retain benefits, may create little interest in returning to work. Work incentives may not overcome the risk of lost income faced by beneficiaries attempting trial work or the risk of losing medical coverage when successfully employed. SSA does not adequately promote work incentives, and the complexities of the work incentives\u2014especially in the absence of clear guidance from SSA staff\u2014are difficult for beneficiaries to understand. Also, state VR services do not appear to be accessible to many beneficiaries, and their effectiveness in securing long-term financial gains for beneficiaries has been called into question. The cumulative effect of these weaknesses is diminished capacity of the DI and SSI programs to return people to work. Indeed, we testified in May 1995 that SSA required a broader management focus to do more to improve the productive capacity of DI and SSI beneficiaries.", "In light of these weaknesses, SSA needs to place much greater emphasis on achieving return-to-work outcomes. Doing this will require SSA to restructure its existing strategies for identifying and enhancing the productive capacities of beneficiaries. SSA\u2019s success in restructuring is likely to be dependent upon a multifaceted approach. For instance, expanding VR opportunities may not facilitate long-term employment among beneficiaries if people continue to fear that working their way off the rolls will lead to loss of health insurance. Also, educating beneficiaries about work incentives and VR services may have little impact if beneficiaries are better off financially not working than attempting to work. Examples such as these suggest that the full impact of restructuring return-to-work efforts may be limited unless these efforts are integrated into a unified and consistent strategy.", "As an initial step in restructuring its return-to-work strategy, SSA needs to identify the size and characteristics of the beneficiary population that has a reasonable chance of achieving gainful employment. SSA also needs to identify how the design and implementation of the DI/SSI application process, benefit structure, work incentives, and VR service provider system can be restructured to facilitate employment opportunities. Throughout such efforts, special attention should be given to developing data on the costs and benefits of various return-to-work strategies, as this will be essential input for policymakers considering redesign options. Finally, success in improving return-to-work rates will be likely to extend beyond the control of SSA alone to other federal agencies\u2014such as the Department of Education and the Department of Labor, which have jurisdiction over issues affecting the rehabilitation and employment of people with disabilities\u2014and to the private sector as well.", "SSA may find that restructuring its return-to-work strategies requires legislative action. For instance, the experts we interviewed, as well as much of the literature we reviewed, underscored the influence of treatment, supports, and services on the work capacities of people with disabilities. However, current law does not require the evaluation of an individual\u2019s capacities to consider such enabling supports and services.
