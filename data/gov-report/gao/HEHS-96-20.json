Structure indicators measure the capacity of an institution, health system, practitioner, or provider to deliver quality health care. Having a safe and clean facility and a quality assurance program in place in an organization are examples of structure indicators. Process indicators measure what a provider does to and for the patient. Identifying and evaluating what diagnostic tests a physician performs when examining a patient with chest pain is an example of a process indicator. Outcome indicators measure the results of providers\u2019 actions and are viewed as the most direct measure of the quality of care furnished because they represent the providers\u2019 success.

If the standards are not met, then providers and regulators must develop approaches to make it more likely that health care is furnished in ways that meet the standards.", "In the past, quality assurance programs focused on the care provided to individual patients. These programs tended to direct improvement activities toward individual providers identified as responsible for mistakes rather than encourage improvement in overall health care delivery. As a result, quality assurance efforts focused on a few providers, and the effects of these efforts were limited to a small percentage of the population. Furthermore, these programs often resulted in adversarial relations between the reviewers and those being reviewed. In recent years, approaches to quality assurance have begun to focus on continuous quality improvement. Under this approach, attempts are made to identify and establish excellent care by focusing attention on inappropriate variation in the quality of care furnished to identified populations and eliminating the variations. This approach strives to make everyone\u2019s performance better, regardless of prior performance. Other recent approaches to quality assurance have also included initiatives for collecting and disseminating information on performance measures. The Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) is a major attempt to advance the collection of information on quality of care indicators.HEDIS indicators of health plan activities in five performance areas have been adopted by many large health care purchasers and some regulators to gauge the quality of care provided by health plans. Attempts to advance the dissemination of HEDIS and other information on quality of care include the publication of \u201creport cards\u201d by health plans intended to describe their performance measured against selected performance indicators. Employers are also providing quality of care performance information to their employees about health plans with which they contract.

This program, however, tended to focus more on utilization of medical services rather than the quality with which they were delivered.", "As a result of hospital and HMO reimbursement changes in the early 1980s intended to control rising Medicare costs, hospitals had the perverse incentive to admit patients unnecessarily and discharge them prematurely. Also, hospitals and HMOs had an incentive to skimp on costly care.

These requirements are usually called conditions of participation. Conditions of participation identify minimum standards that policymakers thought were necessary to be met for quality health care to occur. In the past, the conditions related almost exclusively to structural quality of care indicators. This remains largely true for hospitals, although a 1986 revision added some process indicators. A full-service community hospital must meet 20 conditions of participation regarding such matters as the hospital\u2019s governing body, physical plant, clinical and emergency services, nursing service, and food service. Each condition is subdivided into multiple standards, most of which must be met if an institution is to comply with the condition. Surveyors who review the hospital to determine its compliance with the conditions have usually only determined whether the institution has established the necessary policies and procedures to meet the conditions of participation. Federal regulations and survey procedures do not require surveyors to determine what actual patient outcomes have been.", "In the mid-1980s, HCFA officials began to work toward modifying conditions of participation for other types of institutions to focus the conditions more toward beneficiary outcomes. According to the officials, this process began in 1986 with modification of the survey process for nursing homes to emphasize review of patient outcomes and the provision of patient care services. HCFA implemented major revisions of the conditions of participation for home health agencies and nursing homes in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Finally, in April of 1995, HCFA implemented new outcome-oriented survey procedures for renal dialysis facilities.", "Certification surveys intended to determine whether an institution is in compliance with the conditions are performed by either state agencies or private accrediting organizations. HCFA contracts directly with state agencies to perform certification surveys of some institutional providers. However, HCFA deems a hospital\u2019s or home health agency\u2019s accreditation by a designated private accrediting organization to be adequate assurance that the provider meets the conditions of participation. If a hospital or home health agency does not request accreditation from such an accrediting organization, the state agency where the institution is located will perform the certification survey.", "When deciding whether to grant a private accrediting organization deeming status, HCFA reviews the policies of the accrediting organization to determine that the organization, among other things, has accreditation requirements that are at least equivalent to Medicare has survey teams and procedures adequate to detect problems, ensure corrective action, and meet Medicare requirements for the frequency and prior announcement of visits; and is willing to provide HCFA with a copy of the most current accreditation survey and any other information on the survey, including corrective action plans, that HCFA may require.", "HCFA grants private accrediting agencies deeming authority for a 6-year period. (app. III lists the organizations whose accreditation is deemed equivalent to HCFA certification; it also lists other organizations that accredit institutional health care providers or units within providers.)", "Regardless of whether HCFA or state agency personnel perform the review, the process used to determine whether an institution meets certification requirements involves an on-site survey by a team of registered nurses and persons trained in other health-related disciplines. This survey may take several days depending on the type and size of provider. The survey includes a thorough review of the provider\u2019s policies, procedures, and systems. At the conclusion of the inspection, the team meets with appropriate provider officials and informs them of its findings. Subsequently, the team prepares a formal written report and sends it to the provider. If the team finds that the provider does not comply with one or more conditions of participation, it will ask the provider to submit a corrective action plan, including a timetable. At the end of the time period specified in the plan\u2019s timetable, the surveying agency may perform a limited resurvey to ensure that all identified problems have been corrected, or it may require the provider to submit documentation that corrective action has occurred.", "If the provider does not comply with conditions by the end of the time period in the plan\u2019s timetable, or if the problem was severe enough to seriously endanger Medicare beneficiaries, HCFA may revoke the provider\u2019s certification to receive Medicare payment. In our 1991 review of the Medicare hospital certification program, however, we found that HCFA rarely terminated hospitals from the Medicare program even though they might have been out of compliance with Medicare requirements months longer than anticipated or allowed by regulation. This situation occurred because federal and state officials preferred to work with substandard hospitals to bring them into compliance, political pressures were exerted to keep them open if possible, and quality problems less obvious than gross negligence were difficult to document. This apparent unwillingness to terminate noncompliant hospitals has cast some doubt on HCFA\u2019s willingness to act against any but the very worst hospitals. While terminating hospitals from Medicare is usually undesirable except as a last resort, we reported that HCFA should terminate facilities that are persistently noncompliant with conditions of participation.", "To ensure that state agencies and private accrediting organizations are performing their surveys adequately, HCFA performs validation surveys. HCFA personnel conduct validation surveys on a small percentage of the facilities surveyed by state agencies; in addition, HCFA contracts with state agencies to conduct validation surveys of the facilities surveyed by private accreditors. In 1993, state agency personnel performed 181 validation surveys among the approximately 5,200 hospitals accredited by the Joint Commission. The 1993 HCFA annual report on validation surveys of hospitals accredited by the Joint Commission concluded that a decline over several years in the percentage of hospitals found by the validation surveys to have general health and safety deficiencies provided increased assurance that accredited hospitals met federal standards. However, some problems continued with the Joint Commission\u2019s enforcement of the Life Safety Code. In 1994, HCFA personnel performed 863 validation surveys among 15,493 nursing homes surveyed by state agencies. HCFA officials told us that the results of HCFA\u2019s monitoring program for state survey agencies indicate that state agency performance of nursing home reviews is in some cases uneven.

Furthermore, HCFA often found that the same problems existed when it made its next annual monitoring visit. We found the same problems again in an August 1995 report. We concluded that HCFA\u2019s Qualification Program is inadequate to ensure that Medicare HMOs comply with standards for ensuring quality of care. Specifically, this program remains inadequate for four main reasons:", "HCFA does not determine if HMO quality assurance programs are operating effectively.

The reviews check only that HMOs have procedures and staff capable of quality assurance and utilization management\u2014not for effective operation of these processes.", "HCFA does not systematically incorporate the results of PRO review of HMOs or use PRO staff expertise in its compliance monitoring. A routine HCFA site visit to an HMO generally involves about three people without specialized clinical or quality assurance training, who spend a week or less focused largely on Medicare requirements for administration, management, and beneficiary services rather than on medical quality assurance. About a third of staff time is typically spent on quality-related matters. PRO staff generally have the specialized clinical training needed to perform quality assurance reviews.", "HCFA does not routinely collect utilization data that could most directly indicate potential quality problems. In the fee-for-service sector, claims data are available and can be used to detect potential overutilization of services. Although HCFA has the authority to require HMOs to collect such data and federal standards require that HMOs have information systems to report utilization data and management systems to monitor utilization of services, no comparable data exist for use in the Medicare HMO Qualification Program to detect potential underutilization. As a result, even such basic information as hospitalization rates; the use of home health care; or the number of people receiving preventive services, such as mammograms, is unknown.", "HCFA does not evaluate HMO risk-sharing arrangements with providers. The agency does not routinely assess whether HMO risk-sharing arrangements create a significant incentive to underserve, although in the Omnibus Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990, the Congress gave the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) authority to limit arrangements that it found provided an excessive incentive to underserve. As of March 15, 1996, the Department had not yet issued final regulations on methods for gauging how much risk an HMO can legitimately pass to providers and requirements that providers must meet to accept such risk. However, a HCFA official told us that HCFA expected to publish these regulations shortly.", "We also found that enforcement processes remain slow when HCFA does find quality problems or other deficiencies at HMOs that do not comply promptly with federal standards. For example, between 1987 and 1994, HCFA repeatedly found that a Florida HMO did not meet Medicare quality assurance standards and received PRO reports indicating that the HMO was providing substandard care to a significant number of beneficiaries. During this period, it permitted the HMO to operate as freely as a fully compliant HMO. We also found that HCFA does not routinely release its site visit reports to the public.

Although HCFA may use the PRO program to review care provided to beneficiaries in other settings such as physicians\u2019 offices, it has chosen not to use this authority because reviewing care at all private U.S. physicians\u2019 offices would be overwhelming.", "Until recently, the PROs\u2019 primary review method was to monitor providers\u2019 actions through reviews of individual medical records. A number of sampling strategies have been used to select records for review. The prevailing strategy in the fee-for-service sector has been to draw a random sample only from Medicare hospital admissions. However, other samples drawn from hospital admissions have focused on areas perceived to be at high risk, for example, cases in which potentially adverse events such as hospital readmission within 31 days of a discharge have occurred. In the HMO sector, the PROs drew a random sample of enrolled beneficiaries, both living and recently deceased, and asked the HMOs to determine which of these sampled beneficiaries had received either ambulatory or inpatient services during the period in question. For these beneficiaries, the PRO reviewed the medical records for all care furnished by the HMO over a 12-month period in both ambulatory and inpatient settings.", "PRO medical review usually begins when a reviewer employed by the PRO reviews the selected medical record. If a problem is found, the medical record is referred to a PRO physician. If the PRO physician believes that a quality concern might exist, the PRO writes to the providers responsible for the patient\u2019s care and gives them the opportunity to provide an explanation for the potential concern. Then, if the concern is not resolved, it is referred for further review to a physician who is a specialist in the type of care being questioned. If a provider demonstrates a pattern of confirmed problems, the cases are sent to the PRO\u2019s medical review committee, composed mainly of physicians, which determines whether a corrective action plan is necessary to prevent similar problems from occurring in the future. If the provider will not or cannot correct the identified poor practice, the PRO may recommend that the HHS Office of Inspector General impose a sanction. Possible sanctions include suspension of eligibility to receive reimbursement from the Medicare program for a specified period or monetary penalties.", "The PRO program has been criticized by providers and other health care experts because of the adversarial role some experts believe the PROs have taken. Furthermore, relatively few substandard providers have been identified as a result of this approach. The medical review model used by the PROs focused on the detection and correction of individual aberrant providers. HCFA officials found this particular model to be confrontational, unpopular with the physician community, and of limited effectiveness.", "In the past, we have also been critical of HCFA\u2019s use of the PRO program to monitor HMOs. In a 1991 report, we cited several problems with the PROs\u2019 ability to monitor care provided by HMOs with risk contracts. First, although HCFA contracted with PROs to perform an initial review of the adequacy of risk HMO quality assurance plans in 1987, HCFA failed to require HMOs to submit their plans for review. Furthermore, when the PROs found deficiencies in HMO quality assurance plans, HCFA did not require HMOs to correct them.

The experts stressed the importance of outcome performance measures, recognizing that these measures are not yet fully developed. Therefore, they suggested that other, more traditional, performance measures be used until consensus is reached on appropriate outcome measures.
