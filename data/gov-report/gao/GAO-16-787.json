The  objectives are unclear in part because the terms are so general that they  do not enable management to assess risks, establish control procedures,  or link to related performance measures.

For example, many participants identified an objective of  assigning revenue officers a mix of cases that reflects the current  inventory. IRS officials explained that the mix of cases refers to the ratios  between cases where the taxpayer has a balance due versus those that  have not filed a tax return.

For example, territory and group managers  in our focus groups offered a variety of opinions and perspectives of how  to assure fairness in case selection.

Federal internal control standards state that measurable  objectives allow management to assess program performance in  achieving them. For example, if one of Field Collection\u2019s objectives was to  achieve fairness and it defined fairness to include ensuring broad  coverage of the taxpayer population in collection status, then the Field  Collection program would need to establish measures to assess its  achievement of this objective. Similarly, if a case selection objective was  to assign them so that cases assigned to revenue officers reflect the Field  Collection group inventory, then IRS would need to clearly link this  objective to related performance measures to which staff were held  accountable. We identified a number of potential data elements in the  case selection system that could be helpful to IRS in developing such  performance measures, as shown in table 5.", "We found that IRS currently has two approaches for assessing risks  within the agency. These approaches are:  Internal controls framework. The procedures in IRM 1.4.2 govern  IRS\u2019s processes for monitoring and improving internal controls, which  include identifying and mitigating risks. Managers are expected to  understand the risks associated with their operations and ensure that  controls are in place and operating properly to mitigate those risks.", "Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). ERM is broader in scope than  internal controls, focusing on service-wide risks. ERM is intended to  help the service in setting strategy to consider risk and how much risk  the service is willing to accept.

Federal internal control standards state that effectively  managing a program to achieve its mission involves comprehensively  considering and assessing potential risks in the program\u2019s internal and  external operating environments and establishing risk tolerances (the  acceptable level of variation in performance relative to the achievement of  objectives). Such tolerances are often stated in terms of performance  measures, which allow performance assessment toward achieving  objectives. Lacking clearly defined and associated performance  measures therefore hinders the Field Collection program\u2019s ability to  effectively assess, identify, and address risks to the achievement of its  mission. Without clearly defined objectives, risks to achieving those  objectives cannot be identified and analyzed, nor can risk tolerances be  determined. According to IRS officials, the Field Collection program has  not assessed risks posed by case selection processes because selection  processes are well designed.

Our  concern is that it is not clear how these efforts will address our  recommendation to establish Field Collection (not division-level) program  and case selection objectives. As described in this report, listing distinct  activities or case types to focus on in a fiscal year does not meet the  internal control standard of clearly defining and communicating program  objectives in specific and measurable terms.", "Since it is not clear that the actions IRS described will result in Field  Collection program and case selection objectives sufficient for internal  control purposes, IRS\u2019s ability to address our related recommendations to  establish performance measures, assess program risks, and monitor  control procedure effectiveness may be limited. Clearly defining  objectives is the foundation for effective implementation of internal control  standards, including assurance that program operations effectively  address risks to program objectives and support the achievement of  objectives over time.", "In response to our recommendation to develop, document, and  communicate control procedures guidance for Field Collection group  managers to exercise professional judgement in case selection, IRS  stated they would review current procedures and guidance and make  changes if necessary. Given that we found little documented guidance on  the appropriate use of professional judgement, IRS lacks sufficient  assurance that case selections support achievement of the program\u2019s  mission of applying the tax law with integrity and fairness to all.", "IRS provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairmen and Ranking  Members of other Senate and House committees and subcommittees that  have appropriation, authorization, and oversight responsibilities for IRS.  We will also send copies of the report to the Secretary of the Treasury,  Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and other interested parties.

Our document review included guidance in the  Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) and automated system manuals. Our  analysis included both automated and manual processes that may involve  IRS staff. We analyzed these processes to outline and graphically depict  systems and processes IRS uses to prioritize and select cases.", "To provide information on the assigned and unassigned case inventory,  we analyzed data from IRS Field Collection\u2019s main inventory  management and case selection information system, ENTITY. The data  included characteristics such as the dollars due on selectable and  assigned cases, the age of the cases, and the priority levels of the cases  as determined in the prioritization process. These data describe a one- time snapshot of IRS Field Collection case inventory characteristics on  March 10, 2016. The data were only available as a snapshot because,  according to IRS officials, ENTITY is the only source for data on the  priority level of each case and the data on priority levels are updated  frequently and are not stored.", "To assess the reliability of the ENTITY March 10, 2016, snapshot data we  present in the report tables, we interviewed knowledgeable IRS officials  and manually tested the data for missing data, outliers, or obvious errors.  We also reviewed relevant documentation on management reports and  case routing data. In addition, we received another snapshot of the case  inventories for May 25, 2016, and compared the data to the March 10  snapshot. We analyzed the data to determine if it changed significantly  between the two points in time\u2014which, for the purposes of our analysis,  we determined would be a greater than 10 percent change\u2014and found  no significant changes. We found the data sufficiently reliable for the  analysis that we conducted in this review.", "To evaluate how well the case selection processes support program  goals, we compared the selection process and procedures to selected  standards in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, to  include the standard that managers define program objectives, assess  risks to the objectives, and design controls to support the achievement of  the objectives and address the risks. We selected the standards by  assessing which are among the most relevant to ensuring the selection  processes support mission achievement given our objectives and the  program context. These standards include  to define program objectives in clear and measurable terms, which is  an internal control foundation for other selected standards to assess  risks and establish risk tolerances;  to design and implement control procedures to guide operations and  address risks; and  to establish performance measures and procedures for assessing  control procedures to assess program performance in achieving  objectives and ensure that controls effectively address risks and  support achievement of objectives over time.", "Our review of the design of controls included the IRM and other Field  Collection program documents that we used to describe the case  selection process in objective one.", "We conducted eight focus groups with a non-generalizable, nation-wide  random sample of IRS Field Collection managers\u2014two focus groups with  territory mangers and six with group managers\u2014to collect evidence on  the implementation of the case selection process. We received a list of all  Field Collection group and territory managers from IRS. To ensure that  managers selected had sufficient experience in their respective positions  to actively contribute to the focus groups, we removed managers that  were \u201cacting\u201d or had less than two years of experience in their position.  We arranged the list of managers in a random order. Managers were  assigned a focus group date and time in order of their random selection,  controlling for their time zones, and were given the option to participate in  the focus group or not. 43 of the 46 group managers that agreed to  participate in the focus groups actually did; all 16 territory managers  participated. All of the focus groups were conducted by phone in the week  of March 28, 2016.", "We asked all eight focus groups questions about internal controls in the  Field Collection case selection process, including the program objectives  of the case selection process and the case characteristics managers  consider when making case selections and assignments. We  documented the responses from the focus group participants and  categorized the responses into themes. We analyzed the themes for their  frequency and pervasiveness through the focus groups. We looked for  patterns or trends across all eight focus groups and for differences  between the group and territory manager focus groups.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2015 to September  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
