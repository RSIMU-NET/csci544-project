These requirements include acquiring electronic products that meet certain environmental standards, extending the useful life of electronic equipment, implementing power management on computers, and managing federal data centers in a more energy efficient manner. In meeting these and other sustainability requirements, agencies are required to designate senior sustainability officers and develop performance plans that prioritize actions for meeting the requirements in the executive orders. The six agencies in GAO's review (the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, and Health and Human Services; the Environmental Protection Agency; and the General Services Administration) have developed sustainability performance plans and taken additional steps to implement the executive orders' requirements. For example, they have increased their acquisition of certified energy-efficient IT equipment, established and implemented policies to extend the useful life of agency equipment, and developed environmental policies for disposing of electronic equipment. However, the overall effectiveness of the agencies' efforts cannot be measured because key performance information is not available. Specifically, the agencies have not identified the information needed to measure the progress or results of their efforts. For example, the agencies have generally not established baselines (starting points) or developed performance targets that are consistently defined in terms of quantifiable benefits, such as a reduction in energy. This is in part because the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and a key White House council--the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ)--have not developed specific guidance on establishing performance measures for green IT efforts. Without such guidance, the effectiveness of these efforts and their contribution to overall federal sustainability goals will remain unclear. GAO identified a number of leading practices used by federal, state, and local government and private-sector organizations that are relevant to green IT. These practices include enhanced leadership, dedicated funding, prioritization of efforts, and improved employee training, as well as acquiring IT equipment with the highest energy efficiency ratings; consolidating equipment and services; reducing use of paper; and using new, more efficient computers. For example, according to a 2009 survey of federal employees, agencies spend about $440.4 million per year on unnecessary printing. By contrast, in the non-federal sector, a major IT equipment company implemented managed print services that reportedly reduced the number of printers by 47 percent globally, cut per-page print costs by up to 90 percent, and saved more than $3 million in 2 years in the United States alone."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends OMB and CEQ develop green IT guidance to help agencies more effectively measure performance and encourage the use of leading practices.

As  part of a 2010 private-sector survey of federal chief information officers,  industry officials also offered some observations, including that agencies  should work with the Office of Personnel Management to improve the IT  workforce. The survey noted that, in doing so, government organizations  should use existing best practices, such as those found at the  Department of Defense, to train employees and develop new leaders. In  recognition of the importance of training, the 2007 executive order states  that agencies are to establish programs for environmental management  training. Implementing instructions associated with that order require that  each agency shall ensure that all personnel whose actions are affected  by the executive order receive initial awareness training as well as  necessary refresher training on the goals of the executive order.

The products are then rated gold,  silver, or bronze based on whether the products met 75 percent or  greater, 50 percent to 74 percent, or less than 50 percent, respectively, of  28 optional criteria. The three EPEAT level ratings differ to a small, but  measurable, extent in their environmental benefits. As we reported in  2009, if federal agencies replaced 500,000 non-EPEAT rated laptop  computers and computer monitors with either EPEAT bronze-rated,  silver-rated, or gold-rated units, the federal government would achieve  energy savings equivalent to 182,796 U.S. households, 183,151  households, or 183,570 households, respectively.

In an earlier  2011 report, we noted that, because procurement at federal departments  and agencies is decentralized, the federal government is not fully  leveraging its aggregate buying power to obtain the most advantageous  terms and conditions for its procurements. The report also stated that  applying strategic sourcing best practices throughout the federal  procurement system could produce significant savings. Similarly,  according to a 2010 report by a private-sector IT council, the federal  government\u2019s costs of operating IT systems are higher than they need to  be, in some cases by more than a factor of two. The report estimated  that at least 20 percent to 30 percent of the more than $70 billion spent  annually on IT assets could be eliminated by reducing overhead,  consolidating data centers, eliminating redundant networks, and  standardizing applications. Therefore, the report recommended that the  federal government consolidate IT infrastructure. In the non-federal  sector, the IT council report indicated that IBM had cut its overall IT  expenses in half over the past 5 years through consolidation and  standardization. In addition, the National Association of State Chief  Information Officers (NASCIO) identified consolidation/optimization,  through centralizing or consolidating services, operations, resources,  infrastructure, and data centers, as its number one priority for 2011.", "Implement print management actions beyond duplex printing. Using  responses obtained from its 2009 survey of federal employees, an IT  provider estimated that the federal government spends about $1.3 billion  annually on employee printing, and about one-third of that total, or about  $440.4 million per year, is spent on unnecessary printing. The survey  indicated that 89 percent of federal employees report that their agencies  do not have formal printing policies in place\u2014for example, according to  federal employees, just 20 percent of agencies have restrictions on color  printing; only 11 percent of agencies have policies dictating when to print  or not to print; and only 5 percent of agencies require personal password  codes to print. The survey further noted that 69 percent of federal  employees believe that their agencies\u2019 documentation processes could  realistically be converted from paper to digital trails. In the non-federal  sector, Hewlett-Packard implemented managed print services that  reportedly allowed a customer to reduce the number of printers by 47  percent globally, cut per-page print costs by up to 90 percent, and save  more than $3 million in 2 years in the United States alone.

In the comments, the department concurred with  the findings as they apply to the Department of Commerce. These  comments are reprinted in appendix II. \uf0b7  The Department of Energy\u2019s Deputy Chief Information Officer  provided written comments in which the department agreed with our  assessment of DOE\u2019s progress in meeting green IT requirements  associated with Executive Orders 13423 and 13514. These comments  are reprinted in appendix III. \uf0b7  The Department of Agriculture\u2019s representative from the Program  Management Office, Office of the Chief Information Officer, e-mailed  comments for GAO\u2019s consideration. We incorporated these comments  as appropriate. \uf0b7  The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s GAO Liaison Team Lead in  the Office of Budget provided e-mail comments. The agency offered  technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. \uf0b7  A General Services Administration management analyst from the  Office of the Chief Financial Officer e-mailed a response in which the  agency provided no comments. \uf0b7  A representative from the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019  Office of the Assistant Secretary for Legislation provided an e-mail  response.

We also interviewed OMB, White House Council on  Environmental Quality (CEQ), and selected agency officials about agency  requirements for electronic stewardship or green IT. We focused on a  nonprobability sample of six agencies: the Departments of Agriculture  (USDA), Commerce (DOC), Energy (DOE), and Health and Human  Services (HHS); the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); and the  General Services Administration (GSA).  \uf0b7  USDA was selected because it developed a strategic plan focused  solely on green IT, and the department had implemented a green  purchasing program. Further, for fiscal year 2009, USDA IT spending  was $2.4 billion. \uf0b7  DOC and HHS were among the top four federal departments in IT  spending for fiscal year 2009, spending $3.8 and $5.7 billion,  respectively. (The Departments of Defense and Homeland Security  were also among the top four agencies in IT spending for fiscal year  2009. They were not selected because we have extensive ongoing  work at these departments.) \uf0b7  DOE and EPA have missions and initiatives related to green IT. They  jointly operate the Energy Star program. DOE\u2019s Federal Energy  Management Program has developed guidance that specifies the  conditions for agencies to meet executive order requirements. In  addition, EPA has a partnership program, known as the Federal  Electronics Challenge, which among other things, encourages federal  agencies to purchase green electronic products and manage obsolete  electronics in an environmentally safe way. \uf0b7  GSA is the federal government\u2019s supply arm, property manager, and  procurement agency. The agency has several ongoing initiatives and  has published information on some federal, state and local, and  foreign initiatives.", "At each agency, we focused on the electronic stewardship (i.e., green-IT- related) requirements found in Executive Orders 13514 and 13423. We  analyzed internal guidance developed in response to the green IT-related  requirements in the orders, and instructions obtained; identified ongoing  or planned initiatives; and obtained and analyzed examples of reported or  proposed cost savings for these initiatives. In addition, we analyzed the  sustainability plans produced by the agencies. As part of this analysis, we  used GAO developed criteria on measuring performance.", "GAO, Executive Guide: Measuring Performance and Demonstrating Results of  Information Technology Investments, GAO/AIMD-98-89 (Washington, D.C.: March 1998). standards.
