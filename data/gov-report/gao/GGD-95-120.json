Program Management and Budgeting required departments to define the program goals they sought to achieve, plan how they would achieve those goals, measure program effectiveness and efficiency, report on program performance, and adjust the operations of their programs on the basis of that performance information.

Line managers were responsible for planning to meet departmental goals by devising strategies and operational plans to implement the strategies. For example, the Department of Education, Employment, and Training linked its overall strategic plan to individual program strategic plans and annual operational plans that defined specific objectives and targets. The Department of Health, Housing, and Community Services developed operational plans for each work area within its programs. The operational plans consisted of strategies that were broken down into measurable targets and specific tasks.

A common theme in the countries we selected was that some departments failed to simplify or eliminate self-imposed rules or were slow to devolve authority because they feared the risks associated with devolved decisionmaking. Also, devolved decisionmaking by itself could be ineffective if line units were not given incentives to find efficiencies in the form of shared savings.", "Officials in or reviews by the four countries noted hesitancy by departments to devolve decisionmaking authority to line management or the existence of internal department rules that worked against devolution. A Canadian official noted that once authority had been given to a department, department officials were sometimes hesitant to use it or to delegate it to other levels of management. In the United Kingdom, a 1988 review of the Financial Management Initiative found that much progress had been made with devolution of budget authority\u2014more than 7,000 line managers had their own budgets, which accounted for about three quarters of the civil service\u2019s running costs. However, the reviewers found some departments created their own restrictions that prevented managers from moving money from one item to another within their budgets. New Zealand and Australian reviews noted similar uneven devolution of authority within departments.", "Australian, New Zealand, and United Kingdom evaluations of their reforms suggested that another problem departments faced in devolving authority to line management was the tendency to respond to initial implementation difficulties by taking back the authority. An example of this problem was provided by a New Zealand official. According to the official, the government gave department chief executives the flexibility to purchase real estate services from the private sector at the same time that downsizing had resulted in significant vacant government office space. Some members of parliament were concerned that departments were not making enough effort to use the vacant government space and temporarily recentralized the real estate function. Eventually, the government decided to return authority for real estate functions to department chief executives but added responsibility for coordinating real estate decisions to their performance agreements. The official emphasized that it was the New Zealand government\u2019s view that holding individuals responsible for their decisions was more effective than centralizing control or creating detailed rules, which could result in inefficient decisionmaking.", "The Australian Department of Finance promoted risk management as the means to improve purchasing effectiveness and efficiency in a devolved decisionmaking environment. According to government reports, risk management involves the evaluation of purchasing controls in terms of their costs and benefits and determines an acceptable level of risk. The government considered the more common practice of risk avoidance\u2014treating all risks as equally unacceptable\u2014as not cost-effective. Recognizing that occasional abuses would occur with the implementation of risk management, Australian authorities increased the penalties for misuse of funds.", "The effectiveness of devolution was also tempered by a lack of incentives for line managers with operating budgets to save funds if they did not benefit from the savings. Australian managers suggested that departments created disincentives to save funds when unexpended year-end funds were taken away from one program and used to fund another program. The United Kingdom\u2019s assessment of its provision allowing departments to carry forward unspent end-of-year funds found that although departments centrally managed unspent funds in some cases, passing the funds down to the line management that generated the under-spending was the approach most likely to maximize efficiency. Nine out of the 16 departments surveyed that commented on their use of the carry-forward provision passed the funds down to the line unit that generated them. One department requested bids for how line units would use such funds and awarded the funds to the unit that would provide the best financial return."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Confusion Between Devolution and Decentralization Led to Inefficiencies in Some Australian Departments", "paragraphs": ["According to government studies in the four countries, managers generally welcomed the increased authority to make decisions about spending, personnel, and program operations that were formerly made by central authorities.
