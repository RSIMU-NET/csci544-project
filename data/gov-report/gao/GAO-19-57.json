For example, this guidance does not direct agencies to develop a comprehensive approach to asset management that incorporates strategic planning, capital planning, and operations, or maintaining leadership support, promoting a collaborative organizational culture, or evaluating and improving asset management practices. In addition, the guidance does not reflect information on successful agency asset management practices, information that officials from three of the six agencies GAO spoke with said would be helpful to them. OMB staff said that they did not plan to update existing government-wide guidance because OMB's real property management focus has shifted to the Reduce the Footprint initiative, which emphasizes efficiently managing and using buildings and warehouse space, rather than all assets.

Coast Guard officials told  us they were using the ISO 55000 standards as a benchmark to compare  against their existing framework. According to OMB and GSA officials,  some of the differences in agencies\u2019 asset management frameworks can  be attributed to differences such as agency mission needs and the types  of assets that each manages. For example, the real property asset  portfolios of the six agencies we reviewed differed substantially in the  types, numbers, and total replacement values of the assets. See table 1  for more information on the agencies\u2019 asset portfolios and fig. 3 for  examples of agency assets and their primary uses.", "Below we discuss the six key characteristics of an effective asset  management framework and how the six selected agencies performed  asset management activities in these areas."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Establishing Formal Policies and Plans", "paragraphs": ["Formal policies and plans can help agencies utilize their assets to support  their missions and strategic objectives.

In addition, several experts we  interviewed stated that having an asset management plan that describes  the overarching goals of the organization and how the organization\u2019s  assets relate to those goals is an important element of an asset  management framework. Each of the six agencies we reviewed had some  documentation such as asset management plans, investment strategies,  or technical orders that lay out how the agency conducts asset  management activities. This documentation covered important areas such  as collecting data, prioritizing assets, and making investment decisions,  along with documentation detailing the roles and responsibilities of key  officials, for example:  In 2014, the Corps published a Program Management Plan for Civil  Works Asset Management that laid out a vision, tenets, and objectives  for asset management along with the roles and responsibilities of key  officials.

Some agency officials told us that scoring  projects in this manner provides an objective foundation for decision  making that can lead to more consistent investment decisions and  improved transparency. In addition, each of the six agencies have  implemented, or are in the process of implementing, a centralized  decision-making process for prioritizing high value projects and  delegating approval for lower cost projects to local or regional offices.

Additionally,  since 2017 GSA has been using an Asset Repositioning Tool, which  uses more detailed data analysis to rank assets within each tier.  GSA uses these designations when prioritizing asset investments. For  projects with projected costs below the prospectus level  (approximately $3.1 million in fiscal year 2018), GSA regions use  each asset\u2019s tier and core designation to allocate funds across the  region\u2019s asset portfolio. For larger projects, the GSA Administrator  and GSA\u2019s Public Buildings Service Commissioner and Deputy  Commissioner are responsible for determining the priority level of  projects.", "The Corps is in the process of implementing a procedure that would  base funding decisions for maintenance and repair projects on a  portfolio-wide comparison of scores, with the goal of approving the  projects that will reduce the greatest amount of risk. This differs from  the Corps\u2019 previous system of allocating projects\u2019 funding to local  divisions and districts based on historical amounts and staff  judgement. To prioritize projects, the Corps calculates a score for  each project based on an assessment of the asset\u2019s condition and the  risk the asset poses to operations. For example, the Corps measures  risk for a lock and dam component such as a gate (see fig. 5) based  on the potential economic impact of failure to users (e.g., shipping  companies that use the waterway). The Corps has a plan to  implement this process by 2020, a plan that Corps officials told us  they expect to complete on schedule.", "Officials from these agencies told us that more centralized decision- making processes can provide improved standardization and clarity in the  prioritization process, particularly for high value projects, and can help  ensure that mission-critical projects receive funding. As an example,  Coast Guard officials cited a project involving a permanent repair to a  failed steam heating pipe at the Coast Guard Yard near Baltimore. They  said that this failure left several key buildings, including the Coast Guard\u2019s  primary ship-painting facility, with intermittent service and an inability to  complete certain critical tasks. According to officials, the Coast Guard\u2019s  centralized decision-making process scored this project as a high priority  because of the importance of the facilities involved, the impact of the  failure, and the fragility of the temporary pipe that runs on the surface  amongst other equipment (see fig. 4).", "Leadership buy-in is important for organizational initiatives, and experts  told us that management support is vital to implementing an asset  management framework.

For  example, in response to Executive Order 13327 in 2004, the FRPC\u2014 chaired by OMB\u2014developed guiding principles for agencies\u2019 asset  management practices and for developing a real property asset  management plan. Specifically, the guidance stated that each real  property asset management plan should, among other things:  link the agency\u2019s asset management framework to the agency\u2019s  strategic goals and objectives, describe a process for periodically evaluating assets, and describe a process for continuously monitoring the agency\u2019s  framework.", "In addition, OMB\u2019s Circular A-11 describes requirements for the agency  capital planning process, such as prioritizing assets to support agency  priorities and objectives, while OMB\u2019s Circular A-123 describes risk  management requirements for agencies, and OMB\u2019s Memorandum 18-21  describes requirements for an agency\u2019s senior real property officers, such  as coordinating real property planning and budget formulation.

These  initiatives emphasize efficiently managing and using space, rather than  overall asset management. OMB staff said that they view asset  management as a tactical activity, separate from broader strategic and  capital planning efforts, where agencies make operational-level policies to  support their real property portfolio. However, this approach to asset  management differs from ISO\u2019s definition of asset management, which  encompasses both the capital-planning and asset management levels of  OMB\u2019s policy model. Under the Reduce the Footprint initiative, federal  agencies are required to submit annual Real Property Efficiency plans  that specify their overall strategic and tactical approach to managing real  property, provide a rationale for and justify their optimum portfolio, and  direct the identification and execution of real property disposals, efficiency  improvements, and cost-savings measures. As a result, according to  OMB staff, they no longer require agencies to develop a comprehensive  asset management plan.", "We recognize that reducing, and more efficiently managing government- owned and leased space are important goals. However, effective asset  management is a more comprehensive objective that seeks to best  leverage assets to meet agencies missions and strategic objectives. For  example, some agencies have high-value real property assets that are  not building space, such as those at the Corps and the Park Service. See  table 2 for examples of these types of assets at the six selected agencies  in our review. For example, the Corps has over 700 dams\u2014the age and  criticality of which require the Corps to conduct regular maintenance and,  in some cases, major repairs to assure continued safe operation. In 2015,  the Corps estimated the cost of fixing all of its dams that need repair at  $24 billion. Similarly, in 2016, we reported that the Park Service\u2019s  deferred maintenance for its assets averaged about $11.3 billion from  fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2015 and that in each of those years,  deferred maintenance for paved roads made up the largest share of the  agency\u2019s deferred maintenance\u2014about 44 percent. Assets classified as  paved roads in the Park Service\u2019s database include bridges, tunnels,  paved parking areas, and paved roadways. For these and other agencies  with similar portfolios, the agencies\u2019 Real Property Efficiency plans are  not relevant to managing the bulk of their assets, and the guidance  primarily focused on buildings and office space is of limited use. In  addition, without specific information to help all federal agencies evaluate  their current practices and develop more comprehensive asset  management approaches, federal agencies may not have the knowledge  needed to maximize the value of their limited resources.", "In addition, while Executive Order 13327 requires the FRPC to provide a  clearinghouse of information on best practices for federal real property  management, this information is currently lacking from existing guidance  or other available sources. GSA officials and OMB staff stated they do not  currently have plans to compile this information. Because of this, existing  guidance falls short of what an effective asset management framework  might include. GSA officials told us that while certain agencies have  shared information on asset management at meetings of the FRPC, the  council does not take minutes or make this information readily available to  agencies outside of the meetings. Given OMB\u2019s shift in focus, OMB staff  said that they did not plan to update their guidance.

Such information could include practices that are described in ISO 55000  and that federal agencies have successfully used to improve asset  management. For example, one agency official stated that it would be  useful to have a compilation of asset management practices that federal  agencies use to determine if any of those practices might be applicable to  an agency.

More recently, the federal government  and several provincial governments have promoted asset management  for municipalities in a variety of ways including by awarding grants and  attaching requirements to infrastructure funding. Some of these programs  have focused on small municipalities that make up the large majority of  the total but may face particular challenges in obtaining the resources to  develop and implement an asset management framework.", "The federal government provides infrastructure funding to municipalities  through several programs, including the Federal Gas Tax Fund.

Each of Canada\u2019s municipalities receives funding through  this program by formula, and funds are routed through the provinces,  which can attach their own requirements. In the 2014 set of agreements  between the federal government and the provinces, provinces were  required to institute asset management requirements for municipalities to  receive gas tax funds, and each of the provinces developed separate  requirements for municipalities under its jurisdiction. These requirements  took several forms.

In addition to this regulation, in 2014, Ontario also introduced  a funding program for small and rural municipalities to provide long-term,  formula and application-based funding for these municipalities to develop  and repair their infrastructure. Under the program, municipalities are  required to have an asset management plan as a condition of receiving  funding. In addition, municipalities can use formula-based program funds  for certain asset management activities including purchasing software,  staff training, or direct staff activity related to asset management. In 2016,  Ontario announced plans to increase the funding available per year from  about $75 million to about $150 million in 2019."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Experiences with Implementing Asset Management Frameworks", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selected Federal Asset Management Experiences", "paragraphs": ["Much of the federal government\u2019s real property is managed by a federal  department known as Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC)  whose nationwide portfolio includes around 350 owned buildings and an  additional 1,200 building leases. PSPC uses a portfolio-wide asset  management framework, which begins with developing national portfolio  strategies and plans every 5 years. Staff in each of PSPC\u2019s five regional  offices then use these plans to develop regional and community-based  portfolio strategies and plans, which then inform annual management  plans for each PSPC asset. To determine how to best allocate funds  across its portfolio of assets, PSPC places each of its assets into one of  four tiers based on three major criteria: (1) the asset\u2019s strategic  importance to PSPC\u2019s portfolio as measured by criteria such as the  asset\u2019s location and design, (2) the asset\u2019s operating and functional  performance such as cost per unit area, and (3) the asset\u2019s condition  based on a metric called the Liability Condition Index, which measures  the risk an asset poses to continuing operations and occupant safety.  Using this method, PSPC designates its highest tier assets as those that  have excellent financial performance, that have non-financial attributes  that support PSPC\u2019s objectives, and that are not expected to need major  capital investments in the next 5 years. The lowest tier assets have poor  performance and are in need of either major investments or disposal in  the next 5 to 10 years.", "PSPC officials told us that they are in the midst of making major changes  to their asset management framework, including by moving to a  component-based system of accounting where they will treat each asset  as 12 components, including 11 for the building such as roofs or heating  and air conditioning systems, and 1 for tenant equipment. Additionally,  PSPC plans to move to more modern enterprise systems to eliminate  paper records and improve the quality of the data they use to make  budgeting decisions. Officials said that they consider the ISO 55000  requirements when evaluating their asset management framework, but  they also use other best practices from the private sector that they said  better suit their needs by providing more detailed information on how to  develop and implement the various elements of an asset management  framework."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Municipal Asset Management Experiences", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 20 years, several Canadian municipalities have developed  detailed asset management frameworks to improve management  efficiency and cost-effectiveness as well as to obtain improved levels of  service from municipal infrastructure. In the late 1990\u2019s, the City of  Hamilton, Ontario, began developing an asset management framework  for its core municipal infrastructure assets, and in 2001, the city  established an office dedicated to asset management within its public  works department, which produced its most recent municipal asset  management plan for public works in 2014. This plan sets a strategic  vision and goals for the asset management program, which are designed  to align with the city\u2019s overall strategic plan, capital and operating  budgets, master plan, and other business documents, and describes how  the city\u2019s asset management activities will support the objectives laid out  in those documents. Additionally, the asset management plan provides an  overview of the current state of Hamilton\u2019s infrastructure assets in four  categories: drinking water supply, wastewater management, storm water  management, and roads and bridges. The plan states the total value of  the assets in each category and, the condition of those assets and has an  indicator of the recent trends in the condition of those assets. The plan  also defines the levels of service Hamilton aims to provide in each of the  four main asset categories and sets goals for each category such as  safety, reliability, regulatory compliance, and customer service. Next, the  plan defines an asset management strategy for the city, which includes  taking an inventory of assets, measuring asset condition, assessing risk,  measuring the performance of the asset management framework, making  coordinated citywide decisions, and planning for capital investments.  Finally, the document contains a plan for managing each of the four main  asset categories over their entire life cycles.", "Hamilton officials stressed the importance of collecting and using quality  data when deciding where and when to allocate resources. They told us  that the data they have collected under their asset management  framework have allowed them to make better-informed investment  decisions, and have provided them with the information necessary to  make business cases for investment and to better defend their decisions  when they solicit funding from the City Council. For example, officials  described how the city assesses the condition of its road network and  uses the results to prioritize investment in its assets. To assess the  condition of each road, the city uses a 100-point scale where, for  example, above 60 indicates the road is only in need of preventative  maintenance and 20 or less indicates the road is in need of total  reconstruction. Officials said that a total reconstruction could cost ten  times as much as a minor rehabilitation and that the window of time  between when a road needs only a minor rehabilitation and a full  reconstruction is only around 10 years. Because of this, Hamilton officials  said that it is important to conduct rehabilitation on roads and other  infrastructure assets before they deteriorate to the point where they either  fail or are in need of a full rehabilitation. For example, Hamilton undertook  a major re-lining project for a storm sewer that was in danger of complete  collapse, as shown in fig. 6. Officials told us this project would preserve  storm sewer service at significantly lower cost than waiting for the  structure to fail or completely rebuilding it, either of which would have  been cost prohibitive. Additionally, Hamilton officials noted that they do  not need all of their assets to be at a 100 rating and that their asset  management framework directs them to allow some assets to deteriorate  to a certain extent while rehabilitating others by making investment  decisions on a system-wide service basis, as opposed to an individual  project basis.", "The City of Calgary, Alberta, began developing its asset management  framework in the early 2000\u2019s, first focusing on the Calgary\u2019s municipal  water-management assets because they are expensive to maintain and  are only funded from water utility customer bills, as opposed to tax  revenue. City officials told us that the primary impetus for initially  exploring asset management was to be able to maintain levels of service  as the city rapidly expanded in both population and physical size; this  expansion forced Calgary to make major investments in the water  system. Since that time, Calgary has expanded its asset management  framework to include nearly all of its assets, including its software,  bridges, public recreation facilities, and even its trees. Between 2008 and  2010, the Calgary took steps to align its asset management to its  business processes, steps that culminated with the development of the  city\u2019s first citywide asset management policy in 2010.", "Calgary officials told us that between 2004 and 2008 they worked to align  their initial asset management framework with the British Standards  Institution Publicly Available Specification 55 (PAS 55). After this  experience, officials from Calgary participated in the development of the  ISO 55000 standards and provided the Standards Committee information  about tactics for asset management such as policy development and  business strategy. When the ISO 55000 standards were officially  published in 2014, the city began working on aligning their asset  management framework with the new standards, a process that led to a  new framework including a strategic asset management plan, which city  officials published in 2016. Calgary officials said that aligning their asset  management framework with the ISO 55000 standards has given them  support from the city\u2019s top management and has improved their  relationship with the various bodies that audit the city\u2019s operations  because it gives them a common language to use when describing  management processes. Calgary officials told us that the ISO 55000  standards are credible internationally recognized best practices and that  in practice they are a good guide for developing an asset management  framework. However, Calgary is not planning on certifying its operations  to the ISO 55000 standard because officials told us that they are not  required to be certified; certification is expensive and needs to be  repeated; and they are unsure of what additional value certification to the  standards would provide.", "The City of Ottawa, Ontario, began developing its asset management  framework in 2001. Since that time, the city\u2019s asset management  framework has gone through several versions, the most recent of which it  developed beginning in 2012 based on PAS 55. Ottawa officials told us  that implementing their asset management framework has allowed them  to collect better information about their assets and improve their long-term  financial-infrastructure-planning process. While Ottawa officials  developed and implemented an asset management framework, they have  a number of ongoing initiatives to further develop some areas of the  framework. For example, officials said that they consider determining the  levels of service to be provided by each asset class the most difficult  aspect of asset management, especially for those assets that do not  necessarily provide a measureable service. Ottawa officials are working  on ways to better measure the services each of their assets provides and  the levels of risk that each asset poses to these service levels. Officials  said that accurately measuring service and risk levels is critical for their  financial planning and will allow them to improve how they prioritize  funding and ensure that funds are spent on priority assets. See fig. 7 for  an example of an asset officials said was intended to improve levels of  service for Ottawa\u2019s pedestrian multi-use pathways. Another ongoing  initiative is an updated report card for the condition of the city\u2019s assets,  which officials said they use to transparently communicate to  stakeholders the current state of their infrastructure."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["This report discusses: (1) key characteristics of an effective asset  management framework, and how selected federal agencies\u2019 frameworks  reflect these characteristics; (2) views of selected asset management  experts and practitioners on challenges and benefits to implementing an  asset management framework; and (3) whether government-wide asset  management guidance and information reflect standards and key  characteristics of an effective asset management framework.", "To obtain information for all three objectives, we reviewed relevant  literature, including academic and industry literature on asset  management, publications describing asset management leading  practices, and the ISO 55000 and related standards. We selected the ISO  55000 standards because they are international consensus standards on  asset management practices. We also reviewed laws governing federal  real-property asset management, Office of Management and Budget\u2019s  (OMB) guidance and prior GAO reports describing agencies\u2019 real-property  management and efforts to more efficiently manage their real property  portfolios.", "In addition, to address all three objectives, we collected information from  and interviewed a judgmental sample of 22 experts to obtain their  perspectives on various asset management issues. To identify possible  experts to interview, we first worked to identify relevant literature  published in the topic area. Specifically we searched in October 2017 for  scholarly and industry trade articles and other publications that examined  effective asset management practices. We limited our search to studies  and articles published from January 2014 through January 2017. From  this search, we screened and identified studies and articles for relevance  to our report and selected those that discussed asset management  practices and the ISO 55000 standards. In addition, we conducted  preliminary interviews with selected asset management practitioners, who  included representatives from public and private organizations  knowledgeable about asset management practices, to learn about key  asset management issues and obtain recommendations about experts in  this field. Through these methods, we identified a total of 82 possible  candidates to interview.", "To ensure a diversity of perspectives, we used the following criteria to  assess and select a sample from this group: type and depth of an expert\u2019s  experience, affiliations with asset management trade associations,  experience with government asset management practices, relevance of  published work to our topic, and recommendations from other entities.   We selected a total of 22 experts representing academia, private  industries, foreign private and public entities, and entities that have  implemented ISO 55000. See table 3 for a list of experts whom we  interviewed. Their views on asset management practices are not  generalizable to those of all experts; however, we were able to secure the  participation of a diverse, highly qualified group of experts and believe  their views provide a balanced and informed perspective on the topics  discussed.", "We interviewed the selected 22 experts between January 2018 and  February 2018 and used a semi-structured interview format with open- ended questions for those interviews. We identified the topics that each of  the experts would be able to respond to, based on the individual\u2019s area of  expertise and each responded to questions in the semi-structured  interview guide in the areas in which they had specific knowledge. During  these interviews, we asked for experts\u2019 views on key characteristics of an  effective asset management system, opportunities for improving federal  agencies\u2019 asset management approaches, experiences with using ISO  55000, and their views on the applicability of ISO 55000 to the federal  government. After conducting these semi-structured interviews, we  conducted a content analysis of the interview data. To conduct this  analysis, we organized the responses by interview question, and then one  GAO analyst reviewed all of the interview responses to questions and  identified recurring themes. Using the identified themes, the analyst then  developed categories for coding the interview responses and  independently coded the responses for each question. To ensure the  accuracy of our content analysis, a second GAO analyst reviewed the first  analyst\u2019s coding of the interview responses, and then the two analysts  reconciled any discrepancies.", "To identify key characteristics of an effective asset management  framework and how selected federal agencies\u2019 frameworks reflect these  characteristics, we obtained and analyzed the ISO 55000 standards,  which include leading practices, and asset management literature, and  we analyzed information collected from our interviews with experts. We  synthesized information from these sources to identify six commonly  mentioned characteristics. We then selected six bureau-level and  independent agencies as case studies and compared these agencies\u2019  asset management frameworks to the six key characteristics that we  identified. Because the agencies are not required to follow the key  characteristics we identified, we did not evaluate the extent to which  agencies\u2019 efforts met these characteristics. Instead, we provide this  information as illustrative examples of how the agencies\u2019 asset  management practices reflect these characteristics.", "We used a variety of criteria to select these agencies, such as: whether  the agency was among the agencies that had the largest real property  portfolio; replacement value and total square footage of the portfolio;  extent to which the bureau or independent agency had a notable asset  management program as described by recommendations from  practitioners we interviewed; and whether the agency was implementing  the ISO 55000 standards. In order to ensure that we had a diversity of  experiences and expertise from across the federal government, we  limited our selection to independent agencies and one bureau-level entity  from each cabinet department. Based on these factors, we selected: (1)  U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard); (2) U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  (Corps); (3) General Service Administration (GSA); (4) National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); (5) National Parks  Service (Park Service); and (6) United States Forest Service (Forest  Service). While our case-study agencies are not generalizable to all Chief  Financial Officers Act (CFO) agencies, they provide a range of examples  of agencies\u2019 experiences with implementing asset management  practices.", "We reviewed documents and interviewed officials from each of the six  selected agencies to learn about the agency\u2019s practices, its experiences  with the ISO 55000 standards, and challenges it has faced in conducting  asset management. In addition, we analyzed fiscal year 2017 Federal  Real Property Profile (FRPP) data, as managed by GSA, to obtain  information about each agency\u2019s portfolio, such as the number of real  property assets and total asset-replacement value, and to obtain  examples of the types of buildings and structures owned by the six  selected agencies. The Corps and Coast Guard noted small differences  between our analysis of the FRPP data and the data from their reporting  systems. For example, the Corps reported having 139,744 real property  assets as of August 2018 with an estimated asset replacement value  $273.4 billion as of September 2017. In addition, the Coast Guard  reported 44,226 real property assets with an estimated asset replacement  value of $17.6 billion as of September 2017. To ensure consistency, and  because these differences were small, we relied on FRPP data rather  than data from these agencies\u2019 reporting systems.", "We conducted a data reliability assessment of the FRPP data by  reviewing documentation, interviewing GSA officials, and verifying data  with officials from our selected agencies, and concluded the data were  reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives. We also visited four  locations from our case study agencies to discuss and view examples of  how our selected case-study agencies are conducting asset  management. Specifically, we visited the Park Service\u2019s Santa Monica,  CA, Mountains National Recreation Area; the Coast Guard\u2019s Baltimore  Shipyard in Curtis Bay, MD; the Corps\u2019 Washington Aqueduct in  Washington, D.C.; and the Brandon Road Lock and Dam in Joliet, IL. We  selected these locations based on several factors including geographic  and agency diversity, costs to travel to location, recommendations from  officials at our case study agencies, and extent to which the location  provided illustrative examples of how federal agencies are managing their  assets.", "To determine the 32 experts\u2019 and practitioners\u2019 views on challenges and  benefits to implementing an asset management framework, we analyzed  information collected from our interviews with the 22 experts previously  mentioned. We also reviewed documents from and interviewed asset  management practitioners from 10 additional organizations familiar with  asset management practices and the ISO 55000 standards. The 10  organizations included representatives from private industry, one federal  agency and local municipalities in Canada. We selected these additional  10 organizations by reviewing published materials related to asset  management and referrals from our preliminary interviews. We  interviewed the 32 experts and practitioners about their views on  challenges and benefits to conducting asset management, ISO 55000,  and illustrative examples of practices in other countries. The information  gathered from our interviews with experts and practitioners is not  generalizable but is useful in illustrating a range of views on asset  management issues. See table 4 for a list of organizations we  interviewed.", "To assess whether government-wide guidance and information on asset  management reflect standards and key characteristics of an effective  asset management framework, we reviewed current federal guidance and  evaluated the extent to which this guidance incorporates practices  described in the ISO 55000 standards and the six key characteristics of  an effective asset management framework that we identified. Specifically,  we reviewed the Federal Real Property Council\u2019s (FRPC\u2019s) 2004  Guidance for Improved Asset Management, OMB\u2019s, National Strategy for  the Efficient Use of Real Property 2015-2020: Reducing the Federal  Portfolio through Improved Space Utilization, Consolidation, and Disposal  and OMB\u2019s Implementation of OMB Memorandum M-12-12 Section 3:  Reduce the Footprint, Management Procedures Memorandum No. 2015- 01. We also reviewed other OMB guidance, such as OMB\u2019s 2017 Capital Programming Guide, OMB\u2019s Circular A-123, OMB\u2019s Memorandum 18- 21 and other guidance. In addition, we reviewed asset management requirements in the Federal Real Property Management Act of 2016 and in the Federal Assets Sale Transfer Act of 2016. We interviewed OMB and GSA officials about their role in supporting federal agencies\u2019 asset  management efforts. In addition, we obtained information from our  interviews with the 32 asset management experts and practitioners about  practices that could be applicable to the federal government and  opportunities to improve federal agencies\u2019 asset management  approaches.", "Lastly, we obtained documents and, as previously discussed, interviewed  representatives from private organizations, federal agencies, and local  municipalities in Canada\u2014a country with over 20 years of experience in  conducting asset management\u2014to learn about their asset management  practices, including their use of the ISO 55000 standard.
