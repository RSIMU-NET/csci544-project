This included one school that did not provide any services to three students.

We  compiled and analyzed data for a nationally representative, random  sample of 138 students with IEPs at 30 randomly selected BIE schools.

We then compiled and  coded the information from school documents for statistical analysis to  determine the extent to which students in our sample received the  services required by their IEPs, based on school documentation. Our  results are generalizable to all BIE students who had an active IEP in  place between September 2017 and February 2018, which included 2,904 students from 169 schools.

Before an  IEP is developed, a child with a disability must be identified, located, and  evaluated through a process known as Child Find. Generally, an adult  familiar with the student\u2019s abilities makes an official referral for a special  education services evaluation. With parental consent, the student is  then evaluated using a variety of assessment tools and strategies  designed to help determine the student\u2019s unique needs. Once a child is  evaluated and determined to be eligible for special education and related  services under IDEA, an IEP is developed describing the school\u2019s delivery  of required services to the child. IDEA regulations require that the  services specified in a child\u2019s IEP be provided to the child as soon as  possible following the development of the IEP. Moreover, IDEA requires  that a student\u2019s IEP include, among other things, a projected date for the  beginning of services and the anticipated frequency, location, and  duration of those services. However, IDEA does not specifically address  the steps that schools must take in cases where services are not provided  in accordance with the anticipated service duration and frequency in the  student\u2019s IEP, such as cases where services were not provided at all or  the duration was less than the amount of time specified in a student\u2019s  IEP. Educators are required to track the child\u2019s academic progress over  the school year and then annually review and update the IEP as needed  at least once a year.

Education services include math, reading, and written  expression, among others, while related services include occupational  therapy, physical therapy, and speech-language pathology, among  others, according to BIE\u2019s policy.

The letter  notified BIE that failure to provide services in a student\u2019s IEP violated the  IDEA requirement that a free appropriate public education be made  available to all eligible students with disabilities. OSEP\u2019s investigation  also determined that six other BIE-operated schools were under the same  contracts and may not have delivered IEP-required services to students.  OSEP\u2019s August 2018 letter required BIE to take several corrective actions  within 30 days, including determining whether other schools had IEP  service disruptions. In addition, the letter required that BIE develop a plan  by the end of October 2018 to prevent contractual problems that could  result in a similar disruption of services in the future.

Some school officials said in interviews and written responses  that in some cases students did not receive education services because  their schools either did not have any or enough qualified staff to provide  them. For example, according to a BIE official, one BIE school reassigned  its only special education teacher to fill a vacant science teacher position  and did not provide required services to 18 students during the 2018-19  school year. In another example, one school reported that it did not have  qualified staff to provide services to two students with IEPs for 12  consecutive weeks during the 2017-2018 school year. Officials said the  school was unable to find a substitute special education teacher, and as a  result, each student missed about 5 hours of service time per week during  this period. An official at another school said that after advertising for a  special education teacher for three years, the position is still vacant.", "These examples illustrate challenges with hiring and retaining special  education staff that may exist more broadly across the country. For  example, according to recent Education data, 43 states reported  shortages in special education providers in the 2018-2019 school year.  However, promising practices may be found within the BIE system as well  as across the states that could provide BIE schools direction in  addressing shortages of special education providers. For example, two  BIE schools recruited and hired special education staff through  international work exchange programs meant to facilitate the employment  of qualified teachers from other countries. Some schools also reported  using outreach to other local BIE or public schools to find and share  contractors. Further, OSEP has developed resources for addressing  special education teacher shortages that it has made available to states  and school districts. In particular, in 2019 OSEP hosted a series of online  symposia on general strategies and best practices for schools to attract  and retain effective special education personnel. These sessions featured  experts and practitioners who discussed strategies for attracting and  retaining personnel. Such strategies and other relevant state and tribal  resources for addressing special education teacher shortages could  provide BIE with additional support to address its own challenges in this  area.", "BIE has not taken steps, however, to establish a mechanism, such as a  community of practice, to identify and communicate promising practices  for schools, especially those in remote locations, to address their special  education staffing and contracting challenges. BIE\u2019s advisory committee  on special education stated in its 2018 annual report that BIE needed to  better support the recruitment of special education and related service  providers at BIE schools. Further, BIE\u2019s 2018-2023 strategic plan has a  goal of supporting schools by identifying and sharing best practices and  collaborating with schools to recruit, hire, and retain highly effective staff.  In addition, federal standards for internal control state that agencies  should select an appropriate mechanism for communicating externally.", "Without greater support from BIE, some schools will continue to struggle  to find the special education staff and contractors they need, and students  at these schools may not receive the special education services they  need to thrive academically."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Limited Monitoring and Technical Assistance Hampered BIE\u2019s Oversight and Support for Special Education at Schools", "paragraphs": ["Limited monitoring and technical assistance have hampered BIE\u2019s  oversight and support for special education at BIE schools.

BIE investigators reported that school staff had  falsified service records showing that services were provided when a  teacher was not present, and that services were provided in multiple and  inappropriate settings (e.g., math services recorded at the same time and  date during reading, physical education, and science periods), among  other things. As a result, BIE required several corrective actions from the  school. As this example illustrates, the verification process provides BIE  with an important oversight mechanism. This mechanism, however, is not  being fully utilized by BIE\u2019s largest school division.

We then compared the change in  standard errors for various sample sizes of schools and students to those  from a simple random sample of size 150. Based on these results, we  observed that the decrease in standard errors began to level out at a  sample size of 30 schools (n=30) and that selecting more than 5 students  (m=5) per school would not significantly decrease the standard errors. To  estimate the likely margin of error we expected to achieve from this  sample, we conducted a simulation of 10,000 samples of 30 schools and  150 students and examined the distribution of outcomes from these  results for 3 proportion estimates.
