For many years, this act was interpreted to exclude Native Americans living in or near tribal areas. In 1961, however, HUD and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) determined that Native Americans could legally participate in the rental assistance for low-income families authorized by the 1937 act and issued regulations to implement this determination. In 1988, the Indian Housing Act established an Indian housing program separate from public housing under the Housing Act of 1937 and prompted HUD to issue regulations specific to this program. With the recently enacted Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (regulations are scheduled to take effect on October 1, 1997), the Congress completed the process of separating Indian housing from public housing.", "According to the May 1996 report by the Urban Institute, the housing needs of Native Americans are growing. Their population rose sixfold over the past four decades to over 2 million in 1990, 60 percent of whom live in tribal areas or in the surrounding counties. Compared to non-Indians, Native Americans are more family-oriented\u201437 percent of Native American households are married couples with children versus 28 percent of non-Indian households. Compared to non-Indians, Native Americans have a higher unemployment rate (14 percent versus 6 percent), a smaller number of workers in \u201cfor-profit\u201d firms per thousand people (255 versus 362), and a higher share of households with very low incomes (33 percent versus 24 percent). Moreover, Indian housing conditions are much worse than housing conditions in other areas of the country: 40 percent of Native Americans in tribal areas live in overcrowded or physically inadequate housing, compared to 6 percent of the U.S. population.", "Through its Native American Programs headquarters office and its six field offices, and with the help of approximately 189 Indian housing authorities (IHA), HUD administers the majority of the housing programs that benefit Native American families in or near tribal areas. Several significant differences exist, however, between HUD\u2019s assistance to these families and to families (non-Indian and Indian) living in urban and other areas. First, HUD\u2019s support for Native Americans derives, in part, from the nation\u2019s recognition of special obligations to the Native American population and is reflected in treaties, legislation, and executive orders. Second, the federal government deals with recognized tribes directly in a sovereign-to-sovereign relationship, rather than through the general system of state and local government. This status allows tribes to establish their own system of laws and courts. Third, the BIA often holds in trust a considerable amount of land for a tribe as a whole; thus, this land is not subdivided into many private holdings as occurs in the rest of the country. This trust arrangement has frustrated the development of private housing markets in tribal areas and has long been seen as providing special justification for government assistance in housing production."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Provides Most Funding for Housing Assistance Through Indian Housing Authorities", "paragraphs": ["Under current regulations, IHAs administer most of the low-income housing assistance that HUD provides to Native Americans. But HUD also provides some housing assistance directly to tribes and individuals. Funding provided through housing authorities is used to develop housing for eventual ownership by individual families through the Mutual Help Program, under which families lease and then buy their home by making payments to an IHA of approximately 15 percent of their income and must cover their own routine operating and maintenance expenses; develop and maintain rental housing for low-income families through the Rental Housing Program, under which, as with the public housing program, low-income families rent housing from the IHA at a cost of 30 percent of their adjusted income; modernize and rehabilitate established low-income housing through the public housing modernization program; and subsidize IHAs to defray operating expenses that rental income does not cover and provide rental vouchers for low-income families.", "Funding available to tribes and individuals includes loan guarantees for home mortgages, block grants through the HOME Investment Partnership Program for tribes to develop affordable housing in tribal areas, and community development block grants to enhance infrastructure and other economic development activities.", "Figure 1 shows the funding for fiscal year 1995 for these programs, and table 1 describes the programs\u2019 results.", "As shown in figure 2 and table 2, over the past decade HUD provided a total of $4.3 billion for these programs, which have produced or planned to produce a total of 24,002 housing units.

Because there are over 550 separate Indian nations, with unique cultures and traditions, not all of these conditions are equally prevalent throughout tribal areas, nor do they have a common impact on developing and maintaining housing. Among the challenges and conditions highlighted in our discussions with officials of HUD and several IHAs, as well as in the May 1996 study by the Urban Institute, are the remoteness and limited human resources of many IHAs and the Native American communities they serve; the lack of suitable land and the inhospitality of the climate; the difficulty contractors and IHAs have in complying with statutory requirements to give hiring preference to Native Americans; and the pressure that vandalism, tenants\u2019 neglect, and unpaid rent put on scarce maintenance funds."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Remote Reservations Limit Infrastructure and Availability of Human Resources", "paragraphs": ["The extent and pattern of Native American landholding are very different today from what they were at the beginning of the 19th century. During that century, the land area over which Indians had sovereignty and which was available for creating reservations was often reduced to small pieces in isolated areas.", "The remoteness of some tribal areas has created significant problems for housing development. In contrast to metropolitan areas, where basic infrastructure systems (sewers, landfills, electricity, water supply and treatment, and paved roads) are already in place, remote tribal areas require a large capital investment to create these systems to support new housing. Table 3 shows the investment needed at the Gila River Housing Authority in Sacaton, Arizona, to build a single-family home. According to HUD officials, the cost of site improvements\u2014creating and connecting to the \u201coff-site\u201d infrastructure\u2014is 43 percent higher than for a public housing project in an urban area near the Gila River Indian Reservation.", "The remoteness of many of the tribal areas also increases the cost of transporting supplies, raises labor costs, and reduces the availability of supplies and of an \u201cinstitutional infrastructure\u201d of developers and governmental and private entities. For example, transporting a drilling rig over many miles and hours into the desert to a tribal area in California is far more costly than if the well had been needed in a less remote area. In addition, in its study of Native Americans\u2019 housing needs, the Urban Institute found that private housing developers, contractors, and suppliers; governmental planners and building inspectors; private financial institutions; and nonprofit groups are all less available in remote tribal areas.", "The limited human resources of many IHAs also contribute to the high cost of developing and maintaining housing. HUD\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretary for Native American Programs told us that housing authorities that recruit their staff from a small tribal population often have difficulty finding qualified managers to administer multimillion-dollar housing grants. This problem is made worse when coupled with the statutory requirement to give Indians first consideration for such jobs. According to the Deputy Assistant Secretary, because many Indian applicants lack formal education, the time they need to become familiar with specialized housing operations can be longer than that needed by applicants from the larger pool enjoyed by a public housing authority in an urban area.", "The executive director at the Gila River Housing Authority echoed these views when he described his inability to hire skilled and dependable tribal members. He pointed out that many skilled members have personal problems caused by drugs and alcohol, causing the housing authority to search outside the tribal area for much of its labor force. He also said that because members of the available semiskilled workforce need a significant amount of training before they are employable, he cannot afford to hire them. Moreover, some of the tribe\u2019s laborers are drawn to cities away from the reservation, he explained, because of the greater employment opportunities and higher wages there.", "This lack of skilled human resources is costly. HUD officials told us that as a general rule in the construction industry, labor costs should not exceed 50 percent of the total cost, but in tribal areas labor costs can run as high as 65 percent because contractors generally have to bring in skilled workers and pay for lodging or commuting costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Land-Use Restrictions and the Inhospitality of the Land Complicate the Development and Maintenance of Low-Income Housing", "paragraphs": ["Although the dominant visual impression in many tribal areas is a vast expanse of unused land, a lack of available land is, in fact, a constraint that many IHAs face as they develop low-income housing. Factors that limit the availability of land for housing include the trusts in which BIA holds the land that, until this year, limited leases to 25 years in many instances. Special environmental and other restrictions also exist. For example, in planning for development, IHAs and tribes avoid archaeological and traditional burial sites because cultural and religious beliefs preclude using these sites for housing. In many cases, sufficient tribal land exists for housing, but environmental restrictions prohibit the use of much of it for housing. The Urban Institute\u2019s survey of IHAs revealed that, overall, wetlands restrictions, water quality considerations, and contaminated soils add to the cost of housing in tribal areas.", "In the Western desert, once low-income housing is developed, the severity of the climate can complicate maintenance. The effects of the high salt and mineral content in the water and soil were evident at the Gila River Housing Authority, where water damages water heaters and copper and cast iron pipes. The executive director told us that the average life of a hot water heater costing $300 is about 6 months. To remedy the problem with the corrosion of plumbing, the Gila River IHA has begun placing plumbing in ceilings for better access and converting to plastic piping. The high mineral content in the water also damages water circulation systems of large fans called \u201cswamp coolers,\u201d used for summer cooling. The executive director told us that because of calcium buildup, the IHA must replace the coolers annually. He also explained that the soil\u2019s high salt content causes housing foundations and sewer systems to deteriorate. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the damage caused to swamp coolers and foundations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Complying With Indian Hiring Preference and Davis-Bacon Act Requirements Adds Additional Burden to IHAs", "paragraphs": ["Certain statutes, including the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act and the Davis-Bacon Act, are intended to protect and provide opportunities for specific groups. However, IHA officials and HUD officials whom we contacted believe that these statutes can make developing housing in tribal areas more costly because they have the the effect of raising the cost of labor in comparison to local wage rates or restricting the supply of labor.", "The Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 requires IHAs to award contracts and subcontracts to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises. IHA executive directors find that complying with the requirement is difficult and believe that it adds to contractors\u2019 time and cost to bid on work for IHAs. The officials said that factors that undermine the requirement include a lack of qualified Indian contractors in the area, the creation of fraudulent joint ventures that are not owned or managed by Indians, and the occasional need to use qualified firms outside the region that do not understand local conditions.", "Under the Davis-Bacon Act, firms that contract with IHAs for housing development must pay wages that are no less than the wage rates prevailing in the local area. However, HUD officials told us that this requirement generally increases IHAs\u2019 cost of developing housing in tribal areas. The increased cost occurs because the applicable Davis-Bacon wage rate is often based on HUD\u2019s wage surveys of large unionized contractors who are based in larger metropolitan areas; therefore, the rate is about $10.00 per hour higher than the wage rate prevailing in the local tribal area. Officials of the Chemehuevi Housing Authority, in California, told us that because of high Davis-Bacon wage rates, their cost to develop a single family home ranges between $85,000 and $98,000. Using the prevailing rate of approximately $6.50 to $8.00 per hour, they estimate the development cost to be between $65,000 and $80,000. ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Neglect and Vandalism Draw on Maintenance Budgets That Are Shrinking Because of Unpaid Rent", "paragraphs": ["If housing units are abused through neglect or vandalism and not well-maintained on an ongoing basis, costly major repairs can be needed.

The Urban Institute also reported that fewer than 10 percent of the officials identified any of the survey\u2019s other contributors to maintenance costs, including poor materials, poor construction, and a lack of preventive maintenance. For units under the Mutual Help Program (which are owned or leased by the residents), the Urban Institute reported that IHA officials cited residents\u2019 neglect to perform needed maintenance as accounting for 30 percent of poor physical conditions of this segment of the housing stock.", "Our discussions with IHA officials reinforce these findings. The executive director at the Gila River Housing Authority told us that vandalism by juveniles was a major problem for him and that because the tribal area borders Phoenix, Arizona, it is more susceptible to gang activity and violence. Chemehuevi Housing Authority officials pointed out that once a family that has neglected to perform expected maintenance moves out and the tribe turns the housing back to the IHA, the housing authority often incurs a large and unexpected rehabilitation cost before it can lease the unit to another family. Figure 5 shows the effects of vandalism at the Gila River Indian Reservation.", "The high level of unpaid rent among assisted Native American families has exacerbated the problem of accomplishing needed maintenance. Routine and preventive maintenance is an operating expense that an IHA pays for with rental income and an operating subsidy that HUD provides to help defray expenses. However, according to HUD, appropriations for these subsidies have not been sufficient to cover all operating expenses not covered by rental income. Therefore, shortfalls in rental income will generally result in less funds to spend on maintenance.", "In recent years, these shortfalls have been at high levels for both the Rental Housing and the Mutual Help programs. For example, the Urban Institute reported that at the end of 1993, 36 percent of all tenants in the rental program were delinquent in their rent payments, and the cumulative accounts receivable for tenants\u2019 rent averaged $208 per rentable unit. In contrast, the average delinquency rate in public housing is only 12 percent.", "To counter shortfalls in rental income, some IHAs enforce strong eviction policies. Others, on the other hand, are either unwilling or unable to do so. They attributed their ineffective policies to such factors as tribal court systems that do not support evictions, the conflict of such policies with tribal culture, and their own lack of forceful management. Regardless of the reason, these shortfalls coupled with insufficient operating subsidies likely will lead to deferred maintenance and higher costs for major repairs in the future."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Native American Housing Assistance and Self- Determination Act of 1996 Could Initially Increase HUD\u2019s Workload", "paragraphs": ["By establishing a block grant mechanism to replace all housing assistance that tribes currently receive indirectly through their IHAs and HUD\u2014except for the funding set aside for Native Americans in the Community Development Block Grant Program\u2014the act allows greater discretion for tribes to address their housing needs. Moreover, block grants will ensure that Indian housing is separate from public housing not only administratively in HUD\u2019s line organization\u2014as the 1988 legislation accomplished\u2014but also financially.", "The new statute stipulates that tribes will not receive less housing assistance under the new law than they did in fiscal year 1996 for the modernization of existing rental housing and operating subsidies to pay for expenses not covered by rental income.

In distributing the block grants, HUD shall consider, among other factors, (1) the number of low-income housing units that a tribe already owns or operates, (2) the extent of poverty and economic distress and the number of Native American families, and (3) other objectively measurable conditions specified by HUD and the tribe. These conditions could include the relative affluence and other sources of income, if known, of the tribe.", "The Secretary of HUD shall monitor block grant recipients\u2014who must submit performance reports to the Secretary\u2014for compliance with the law and take corrective actions when a tribe or its housing entities do not comply with the program\u2019s requirements.", "A tribe can pledge future grant funds to secure a guaranteed loan and can lease land held in trust for up to 50 years.", "The new act could, at least initially, cause HUD\u2019s oversight workload to increase. One reason for this is that the number of entities receiving funding will likely rise: Under current law, HUD funds only 189 IHAs, while under the new law, HUD may have to fund all 550 tribes independently. Both HUD and IHA officials we contacted believe that tribes will abandon some \u201cumbrella\u201d IHAs\u2014those that serve more than one tribe\u2014that have not performed well. And some tribes will simply choose to manage their own housing assistance programs.", "HUD\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretary for Native American Programs believes that new requirements needing oversight, such as the housing plans, and tribes\u2019 new opportunities, such as the borrowing program and ability to lease land for up to 50 years, will put added pressure on HUD\u2019s field offices to work closely with the grant recipients.

About one-third of the construction has taken place during the 10-year period between 1986 and 1995. As shown in the figures below, over the 10-year period, HUD provided almost $2.4 billion to 189 IHAs specifically to develop housing for low-income families. With these funds, the IHAs have built or planned to build over 24,000 housing units. Sixty-five percent of these units, 15,721, were Mutual Help units and the remainder were Low-income Rental units."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Modernization Program Also Supports IHAs\u2019 Housing", "paragraphs": ["Under its housing modernization program, HUD provides funds to IHAs to rehabilitate properties in deteriorated physical condition and to upgrade the management and operation of existing Indian housing developments. HUD allocates modernization funds under both the Comprehensive Grant Program (CGP) to IHAs that own or operate 250 or more units and the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP) to IHAs with fewer than 250 units. Overall, since 1986, congressional appropriations to HUD for the modernization of all public housing have steadily increased, and IHAs have benefitted proportionately. However, as is shown in table I.1, after HUD implemented the CGP in fiscal year 1992, funding for CIAP declined, and in fiscal year 1995, funding for both programs declined."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Operating Subsidies Provide Funds for IHAs\u2019 Ongoing Expenses", "paragraphs": ["Section 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended, authorizes HUD to subsidize the operation of low-income public housing projects. Because rental income may not be sufficient to cover all the expenses incurred by a housing authority in its operation and maintenance of rental housing, HUD provides such subsidies to IHAs through its Performance Funding System on the basis of their projected operating expenses. The subsidy amount for an IHA is the difference between the projected estimate of operating costs and an estimate of income from rents and other sources. Overall, HUD has provided just over $500 million in operating subsidies to IHAs for Indian housing programs between 1985 and 1995. As shown in table I.2, since 1992 the trend in HUD\u2019s funding for operating subsidies for the Mutual Help and Rental Housing programs has been upward, with a sharp increase (almost 34 percent) for the latter program between 1993 and 1994. Well over 60 percent of the operating subsidy funding HUD provided IHAs supported the Rental Housing Program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Loan Guarantee Program Is Another Source of Funding", "paragraphs": ["Section 184 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 authorized the Indian Home Loan Guarantee Program to give Indian families and IHAs access to sources of private financing that might otherwise not be available without a federal guarantee. HUD uses the funds to guarantee loans for constructing, acquiring, or rehabilitating one to four family dwellings per loan. The guaranteed loans must be for homes that are standard housing (i.e., conforming to HUD\u2019s standards), located on Indian trust lands, or in Native American tribal areas. The approval of guarantees is based on applicants\u2019 having a satisfactory credit record, enough cash to close the loan, and sufficient steady income to make monthly mortgage payments without difficulty. During fiscal year 1995\u2014the program\u2019s first year of operation\u2014HUD used the program\u2019s appropriation of $3 million to guarantee $22.5 million in home loans in tribal areas.

These governments, in turn, make loans or grants for rehabilitating, acquiring, or newly constructing both owner-occupied and rental housing. Recipients must have a low income (an adjusted family income must be 80 percent or less of the area\u2019s median income), and in the case of rental housing, some tenants must have very low income (50 percent or less of the area\u2019s median income). The HOME program first became available to Native Americans in 1992.
