It described ongoing and planned actions intended to respond to our July 1995 recommendations to correct management and technical weaknesses. It concluded that despite some qualified success, IRS had not made progress on TSM as planned because systems development efforts had taken longer than expected, cost more than originally estimated, and delivered less functionality than originally envisioned. It further stated that significant changes were needed in IRS\u2019 management approach and that IRS did not currently have the capability to develop and integrate TSM without expanded use of external expertise.", "Treasury\u2019s report delineates, and we verified, that IRS has initiated a number of actions and is making some progress in addressing our recommendations. For example, IRS (1) is preparing a comprehensive strategy to maximize electronic filing, (2) has created an investment review board to select, control, and evaluate its information technology investments, (3) has updated its systems engineering process, is updating its systems life cycle methodology, and is working across various IRS organizations to define disciplined processes for software requirements management, quality assurance, configuration management, and project planning and tracking, and (4) has completed a descriptive overview of an integrated, three-tier, distributed systems architecture.", "However, as we reported in June 1996, many of these actions are still incomplete and do not respond fully to any of our recommendations.Examples include the following:", "The comprehensive business strategy for electronic filing is not scheduled for completion until early fall 1996. Completing this strategy is central to maximizing electronic filings and achieving IRS\u2019 business vision of significantly reducing the volume of paper returns. IRS does not yet have a complete and repeatable process for selecting, controlling, and evaluating its technology investments. Implementing such a process is necessary to make sound investment decisions on planned and ongoing systems.", "The procedures for requirements management, quality assurance, configuration management, and project planning and tracking are being developed, but are still incomplete. Overcoming these weaknesses is critical to successful systems modernization. IRS has not completed its integrated systems architecture or its security and data architectures, and has no schedule for doing so. Completing these architectures is fundamental to designing and building TSM systems.", "As a result, IRS has not made adequate progress in correcting its management and technical weaknesses, and none of our recommendations have been fully implemented. IRS expects to improve the accountability for and probability of TSM success by increasing its reliance on contractors. However, IRS has not addressed the risk inherent in shifting hundreds of millions of dollars to additional contractual efforts before it has the disciplined processes in place to manage all of its current contractual efforts effectively.", "As we reported, until IRS\u2019 weaknesses are corrected and our recommendations are fully implemented, we believe the Congress should consider limiting TSM spending to only cost-effective modernization efforts that support ongoing operations and maintenance; correct IRS\u2019 pervasive management and technical weaknesses; are small, represent low technical risk, and can be delivered in a relatively short time frame; and involve deploying already developed systems that have been fully tested, are not premature given the lack of a completed architecture, and produce a proven, verifiable business value.", "As the Congress gains confidence in IRS\u2019 ability to successfully develop these smaller, cheaper, quicker projects, it could consider approving larger, more complex, more expensive projects in future years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Imperative Need for an Effective Business Vision Implementation Strategy", "paragraphs": ["In 1986, IRS initiated TSM primarily to replace the computers that it was using to process and store the information on tax returns. IRS planned to introduce the new technology without changing its existing organizational and operating structure, which included 10 service centers that processed tax returns, over 70 telephone call sites that provided various types of service to taxpayers, and 63 district offices that were responsible for many of IRS\u2019 compliance activities.", "In 1992, in response to recommendations by GAO and others, IRS began to analyze how it might use new technology to change its business operations. As a result, IRS developed a vision for 2001 that called for organizational, technological, and operational changes affecting the way it processes tax returns, provides customer service, and ensures compliance.", "Specifically, IRS\u2019 vision calls for moving from a paper-laden, labor-intensive tax return processing environment to a modern electronic environment; providing better service to taxpayers through wider use of the telephone, better access to data, and new information systems; and improving compliance through access to accurate, up-to-date data, earlier identification of noncompliant taxpayers, and increased efficiencies in its field enforcement functions.", "Since 1992, IRS has made some progress in modernizing its operations, but the differences between IRS\u2019 current operations and those proposed in its vision are great. Part of the reason IRS has not been more successful in significantly changing its business operations is that it does not have a well-defined business strategy for achieving its vision. As discussed in the following sections, IRS is, for example, revisiting its electronic filing strategy and looking for alternative ways for improving customer service.", "The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) provides an excellent vehicle for IRS to reach agreement with the Congress on a business strategy and for the Congress to assess IRS\u2019 performance in implementing an agreed upon strategy. Under GPRA, each agency is to develop strategic plans for its program activities, laying out the organization\u2019s fundamental mission and long-term goals and objectives for accomplishing that mission. GPRA requires that these plans be submitted to OMB and the Congress by September 30, 1997. Recognizing the value of such plans, OMB has accelerated the legislative schedule and is currently working with agencies in developing key elements of their strategic plans."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "IRS Does Not Yet Have a Comprehensive Strategy to Significantly Reduce the Volume of Paper Returns", "paragraphs": ["One of the biggest problems facing IRS is its inefficient system for processing most tax returns. IRS has made little progress either in reducing the number of paper returns it processes or in delivering the new systems needed to better process paper.", "IRS\u2019 strategy for receiving and capturing data from tax returns was and still is a critical component of IRS\u2019 business vision. Initially, IRS\u2019 strategy focused on replacing computers in its 10 service centers with more efficient ones. However, in 1992, IRS began examining other processing options. As a part of that analysis, IRS concluded that it had to make various organizational and business changes.", "One of the most important business changes was IRS\u2019 decision to significantly increase, by the year 2001, the number of tax returns received electronically. Compared with IRS\u2019 current procedures for processing paper returns, electronic filing has several benefits for IRS. These benefits include reduced processing, storage, and retrieval costs; and faster, more accurate processing of returns and refunds.", "Although IRS has implemented some initiatives that have increased the number of electronic returns since 1993, IRS does not have a comprehensive business strategy to reach or exceed its electronic filing goal, which was 80 million electronic filings by 2001. IRS\u2019 estimates and projections for individual and business returns suggested that, by 2001, as few as 39 million returns may be submitted electronically, less than half of IRS\u2019 goal and only about 17 percent of all returns expected to be filed.", "We have reported that IRS\u2019 business strategy would not maximize electronic filings because it primarily targeted taxpayers who use a third party to prepare and/or transmit simple returns, are willing to pay a fee to file their returns electronically, and are expecting refunds. Focusing on this limited taxpaying population overlooked most taxpayers, including those who prepare their own tax returns using personal computers, have more complicated returns, owe tax balances, and/or are unwilling to pay a fee to a third party to file a return electronically.", "To date, most of the returns filed electronically are ones that, if filed on paper, could be filed on forms (like the 1040EZ) that are among the least costly paper returns to process. With that in mind, we recommended, in October 1995, that IRS identify those groups of taxpayers that offer the greatest opportunity to reduce IRS\u2019 paper processing workload and operating costs if they filed electronically and develop strategies that focus on eliminating or alleviating impediments that inhibit those groups from participating in the program.", "Some of IRS\u2019 21 electronic filing initiatives have realized some positive results. For example, certain taxpayers who are eligible to file a Form 1040EZ are now allowed to file electronically using a toll-free number on touch-tone phones. This year, about 2.8 million taxpayers used that filing method, known as TeleFile.", "Also, IRS has not yet successfully addressed one of the major impediments to the expansion of electronic filing\u2014its cost to taxpayers. We concluded that, without a strategy that also targets these taxpayers, IRS would not meet its electronic filing goals. In addition, if, in the future, taxpayers file more paper returns than IRS expects, added stress will be placed on IRS\u2019 paper-based systems. Accordingly, we recommended that IRS refocus its electronic filing business strategy to target, through aggressive marketing and education, those sectors of the taxpaying population that can file electronically most cost-beneficially.", "To respond to our recommendation, to date, IRS has performed an electronic filing marketing analysis at local levels; developed a marketing plan to promote electronic filing; consolidated its 21 electronic filing initiatives into its Electronic Filing Strategies portfolio; and initiated a reengineering project with a goal to reduce paper tax return filings to 20 percent or less of the total volume by the year 2000. It plans to complete its electronic filing strategy in early fall 1996. These initiatives could result in future progress toward increasing electronic filings.", "However, these initiatives are not far enough along to determine whether they will culminate in a comprehensive strategy that identifies how IRS plans to target those sectors of the taxpaying population that can file electronically most cost-beneficially. It also is not clear how the reengineering project will affect the strategy, or how these initiatives will affect TSM systems that are being developed.", "IRS has also experienced problems in delivering the systems to process paper returns in the future. IRS\u2019 business vision for 2001 included consolidating the processing of all paper documents (tax returns, correspondence, and information returns) into 5 of its 10 service centers. IRS identified which five centers will specialize in paper processing and consolidated the processing of paper information returns and Federal Tax Deposit coupons in those centers with the roll out of an interim scanning and imaging technology known as the Service Center Recognition Image Processing System (SCRIPS). Besides information returns and tax deposit coupons, SCRIPS was originally expected to process all forms 1040EZ, 1040PC, and 941 (employment tax returns). Instead, for 1996, SCRIPS is processing about 50 percent of the 1040EZs and none of the 1040PCs and 941s.", "Also, in 1988 IRS began designing a Document Processing System (DPS) in an effort to use imaging and optical character recognition technologies to process paper tax returns and capture 100 percent of the data on those returns. In April 1992, we said that IRS had not adequately assessed the cost-benefit trade-offs associated with its strategy for receiving and capturing tax return data using DPS. We recommended that IRS develop a comprehensive analysis to determine the cost and benefits of alterative strategies for receiving and capturing tax return information.", "IRS proceeded with the development of DPS without this analysis and estimates that it spent about $270 million on DPS through fiscal year 1995. According to IRS officials, IRS is now uncertain whether the benefits of DPS outweigh the costs and IRS is currently reevaluating its needs. With the problems encountered with both the SCRIPS and DPS systems, IRS is left without a proven system for more efficiently processing paper returns in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Faces Several Challenges in Implementing Its Customer Service Vision", "paragraphs": ["The second part of IRS\u2019 business vision is to improve service to taxpayers. A key IRS goal is to resolve 95 percent of taxpayer issues after one contact. For service to improve, taxpayers must be able to reach IRS by telephone when they have questions or problems, and IRS employees must have easy access to the information needed to help taxpayers.", "Taxpayers have long had a problem reaching IRS by telephone. The percentage of taxpayer calls that IRS assistors answered decreased from 58 percent for the 1989 filing season to 8 percent for the 1995 filing season. Although the accessibility rate improved during the 1996 filing season, assistors were still only able to answer 20 percent of taxpayers\u2019 telephone calls.", "Also, even when a taxpayer reaches IRS, assistors do not always have easy access to the information needed to resolve taxpayers\u2019 problems. As a result, the assistor may have to either (1) refer the taxpayer to another office, (2) research the problem and call the taxpayer back, or (3) tell the taxpayer to call back later.", "IRS\u2019 strategy for improving customer service includes consolidating work units, changing work processes, and increasing the use of or implementing new information systems. For instance: IRS\u2019 customer service vision calls for consolidating the work of different functional areas that do not have face-to-face interaction with taxpayers. IRS is making some progress in consolidating the work of 70 such organizational units in 44 locations that traditionally have non face-to-face interaction with taxpayers into 23 customer service centers. This consolidation effort will continue through 2002. The consolidated centers would, for example, absorb the functions of toll-free taxpayer assistance sites, which answer calls about tax law and procedures, taxpayer accounts, and notices that taxpayers receive from IRS. IRS\u2019 customer service vision emphasizes use of the telephone to interact with taxpayers. To fulfill this vision, IRS must complete actions directed at converting to telephone much of the work now being done by correspondence and at making it easier for taxpayers to reach IRS and resolve their problems by telephone. IRS is making some progress in (1) extending its hours of operation, (2) improving its ability to route calls nationwide, (3) increasing the use of interactive systems, and (4) reducing demand for assistance.", "IRS\u2019 strategy offers promise as it is designed to improve taxpayers\u2019 ability to get assistance from IRS and to provide IRS employees easy access to information. However, IRS must address several important managerial, technical, and human resource challenges to fully achieve that vision. Specifically, IRS has to manage the transition to the customer service vision while continuing to answer taxpayer inquiries, manage taxpayer accounts, and collect unpaid taxes. IRS also has to determine the scope of responsibilities for those staff employed at customer service centers and provide the requisite training for that staff. IRS also has to develop the information systems necessary to support the accomplishment of its vision, including an interactive telephone system that is easy for taxpayers to use."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Achieving Customer Service and Compliance Goals Depends on Better Access to Critical Data", "paragraphs": ["Achieving IRS\u2019 customer service and compliance goals depends in large measure on increasing the use of and implementing new information systems.

Until 1995, account information in IDRS was spread among 10 service centers, and employees in each center had access to information on only a small percentage of IDRS accounts. When an employee did not have access to the account information needed to respond to a taxpayer\u2019s question, the employee typically wrote down the question and mailed it to the location that had access to the information. Then, that office would respond to the taxpayer\u2019s question.", "Early in 1995, IRS implemented a networking capability among the 10 service centers so that employees could have access to IDRS data nationwide. This networking capability is referred to as Universal IDRS. Although Universal IDRS gives IRS employees access to taxpayer account information nationwide, IDRS does not always contain complete information on a taxpayer\u2019s account. Other information needed to help the taxpayer may reside in different systems that are not linked to IDRS.", "Making it easier for taxpayers to reach IRS by telephone is of limited value if IRS employees on the other end of the line do not have access to the data needed to help the taxpayers, which has been a long-standing problem in IRS. IRS eventually intends to provide its employees with access to greater amounts of on-line taxpayer data in shorter time frames than current systems can provide.", "Another major goal of IRS\u2019 vision is to increase compliance. Achieving this goal hinges on the ability of enforcement staff to readily access good data. For example, as we discussed in recent testimony on IRS\u2019 debt collection practices, existing IRS computer systems do not provide ready access to needed information and, consequently, do not adequately support modern work processes. Access to current and accurate information on tax debts is essential if IRS is to enhance the effectiveness of its collection tools and programs to prevent taxpayers from becoming delinquent in the first place.", "Although technology plays a key role in helping an organization collect good data and make it readily accessible to employees, it is critical that the organization first determine what data it needs. IRS has not yet identified all of the data that enforcement staff need to do their job.", "IRS currently captures about 40 percent of the data provided by taxpayers on their individual income tax returns. IRS\u2019 intent, as part of modernization, was to capture either through electronic submission or imaging, 100 percent of the data. However, as part of the TSM reassessment effort, IRS has decided that it will continue capturing about 40 percent of the individual income tax return data for at least the next 5 years, with the intent of moving to 100 percent later. If IRS is going to continue capturing 40 percent of the tax return data, it is critical that it capture the right 40 percent. IRS does not now know if it is capturing the right data.", "It is also important that any data IRS captures, whether 40 percent or 100 percent of the universe, be easily accessed by staff who need it.

Reengineering could result in new business requirements that are not addressed by planned TSM projects or that make those projects obsolete.", "For example, IRS\u2019 strategy for returns processing needs to be based on a clear definition of its downstream business requirements for customer service and compliance, and on an analysis of the cost and benefits of meeting those requirements. These requirements may evolve from the different scenarios that IRS is currently considering as a part of its reengineering efforts.

To overcome this, and provide the Congress with insight needed to assess IRS\u2019 priorities and rationalization for TSM projects, we recommended that the IRS Commissioner take immediate action to implement a complete process for selecting, prioritizing, controlling, and evaluating the progress and performance of all major information systems investments, both new and ongoing, including explicit decision criteria, and using these criteria, to review all planned and ongoing systems investments by June 30, 1995.", "IRS has taken positive steps that indicate a willingness to address the strategic information management problems we have raised. IRS has, for example, created the executive-level Investment Review Board for selecting, controlling, and evaluating all of IRS\u2019 information technology investments; developed the Business Case Handbook that includes decision criteria on costs, benefits, and risks; and developed the Investment Evaluation Review Handbook designed to assess projected costs and benefits against actual results.", "But, as noted in Treasury\u2019s report on TSM, the investment process is not yet complete. According to Treasury, it was missing (1) specific operating procedures, (2) defined reporting relationships between different management boards and committees, and (3) updated business cases for major TSM technology investments. Our own analysis shows serious weaknesses, such as inadequate data, an incomplete portfolio, and the lack of an effective investment evaluation review process.", "These concerns coincide with two central criticisms we have repeatedly made about TSM. Because of the sheer size, scope, and complexity of TSM, it is imperative that IRS institutionalize a repeatable process for selecting, controlling, and evaluating its technology investments, and that it make informed investment decisions based on reliable qualitative and quantitative assessments of costs, benefits, and risks. Although IRS is planning and is in the initial stages of implementing parts of such a process, a complete, fully-integrated process does not yet exist. Specifically, IRS has not provided us evidence to justify its claims that its decisions were supported by acceptable data on project costs, benefits, and risks.", "To help ensure that agencies such as IRS have the capacity to manage information technology as an investment, the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 establishes a framework for improving the capital planning and control of investments in information technology.

Second, the amounts reported for various types of taxes collected (social security, income, and excise taxes, for example) cannot be substantiated. As a short-term resolution for these two issues, IRS has developed software programs that it believes will capture, from its revenue financial management system, the detailed revenue and refund transactions that would support reported amounts in its future financial statements until longer term system fixes can be made to achieve more reliable reporting of these amounts.
