USAID receives the majority of funding allocated for this assistance, although State has received 32 percent of funding since 2004. In recent years, both USAID and State have provided more funding for program implementation to for-profit and nongovernmental organizations (NGO) with a worldwide or regional focus than to universities and to NGOs that focus only on Cuba. All types of implementing partners, but worldwide or regional organizations in particular, used subpartners to implement program activities under 21 of the 29 awards and contracts that GAO reviewed.", "USAID and State legal officials view the Cuba democracy program\u0092s authorizing legislation as allowing the agencies discretion in determining the types of activities that can be funded with program assistance. Agency officials added that the agencies ensure that program activities directly relate to democracy promotion as broadly illustrated in related program legislation. The officials stated that organizations are expected to work with agency program officers to determine what activities are permitted or appropriate. In addition, they said that program partners and subpartners are expected to spend U.S. government funds consistent with U.S. laws, and that requirements in primary award agreements generally flow down to any subpartners.", "USAID has improved its performance and financial monitoring of implementing partners\u0092 use of program funds by implementing new policies and hiring contractors to improve monitoring and evaluation and to conduct financial internal controls reviews, but GAO found gaps in State\u0092s financial monitoring. While GAO found some gaps in implementing partners\u0092 performance planning and reporting, both agencies are taking steps to improve performance monitoring. For financial monitoring, USAID performs financial internal controls reviews of its implementing partners with the assistance of an external auditor. Since 2008, USAID has used a risk-based approach to determine the coverage and frequency of the 30 reviews the auditor has conducted, which have identified weaknesses in implementing partners\u0092 financial management, procurement, and internal controls. However, because of resource constraints, State did not perform financial internal controls reviews for more than two-thirds of its implementing partners during fiscal years 2010 through 2012. State procured an external financial auditor in September 2012 that plans to review more than half of State\u0092s implementing partners, and has taken steps toward implementing a risk-based approach for scheduling these reviews. Federal regulations generally require agencies to approve the use of subpartners. GAO found that USAID issued specific guidance in 2011 to its implementing partners on requirements for subpartner approval. While State told GAO it has similar requirements, State\u0092s requirements are not clearly specified in its written guidance.

We selected at least one partner from each of the four USAID  and State bureaus and offices implementing program assistance. The six  selected partners were among the top 15 recipients of program funding  awarded in fiscal years 2007 through 2010 and represented about 60  percent of funding for awards active in fiscal year 2011.

Furthermore, there is no  free press in Cuba, and independent journalists and activists are  harassed and imprisoned. The Cuban government substantially restricts  and controls the flow of information, limiting access to the Internet, cell  phones,  radio antennas, and other items, and restricting their use  through high costs, punitive laws, and the threat of confiscation.  Moreover, the government routinely jams all external, non-Cuban  broadcasts, including the U.S. government-supported Radio and TV Mart\u00ed  broadcasts.", "The United States, which maintains an embargo on most trade with Cuba,  does not have diplomatic relations with the Cuban government.  Consequently, USAID does not work cooperatively or collaboratively with  Cuban government agencies, as it does in most other countries receiving  U.S. democracy assistance. USAID does not have staff in Cuba, and  State does not have staff dedicated to the Cuba democracy program in  Havana. USAID and State program staff have been unable to obtain  visas to visit Cuba over the past decade, which poses challenges for  program implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. In addition, Cuban  law prohibits citizens from cooperating with U.S. democracy assistance  activities. In December 2009, a subcontractor working for one of USAID\u2019s  partners was arrested in Cuba while delivering computer equipment to  provide Internet access to Jewish communities on the island.

The RFP issued in 2010 specified that M/E plans should  include a baseline and target for each indicator and data collection  methods and sources, among other characteristics. In addition,  the RFP referenced M/E guidance available on State/DRL\u2019s  website that included more details on how to develop an effective  M/E plan.", "State/WHA. For the State/WHA award in our sample, the RFP  issued in fiscal year 2010 required the prospective partner to  submit an M/E plan outlining performance indicators, sources and  means for verification, risks and assumptions for goals and  objectives, and expected results and activities. For WHA\u2019s most  recent RFPs issued in fiscal year 2012, State/WHA also included  additional guidance for prospective partners\u2019 M/E plans, for  example, including by defining indicators and providing a sample  M/E plan. In addition, State/WHA further clarified that all indicators  in M/E plans must include measurable, numerical targets.", "Performance Reporting: Both State bureaus require their partners to  submit quarterly progress reports. According to State/DRL and  State/WHA officials, they review partners\u2019 quarterly reports against the  partners\u2019 planned performance to confirm that the awards are making  progress toward established targets and that activities align with the  award\u2019s objectives. State officials then analyze the quarterly  progress reports to aggregate progress for each of its bureaus with  USAID\u2019s progress to be able to report government-wide performance  for the Cuba democracy program to State\u2019s Office of U.S. Foreign  Assistance Resources.", "State\u2019s partners that we reviewed ranged in the amount and kind of detail  they included in their M/E plans as well as in their progress reports. For  the State awards in our sample, we found that State/WHA\u2019s partner had  the most clearly defined M/E plan (see table 4). This partner\u2019s M/E plan  included specific and clearly defined indicators, targets against which the  partner could measure its performance, and clear plans for data  collection. For the four State/DRL awards, the partners included  indicators in their M/E plans but did not define them.", "We also found that one partner with three State/DRL awards did not set  clear targets for a number of its indicators. In addition, two partners  identified some data collection methods in their M/E plans, but did not  clearly identify which methods would be used to collect data for each  individual indicator.", "We also found that, for State/WHA\u2019s award, progress reports included  detailed reporting against each indicator, as well as additional qualitative  and quantitative information on overall progress including survey results  and statistics. On the other hand, reporting for the State/DRL awards  lacked such detail. For example, for one State/DRL award, the partner  tracked its performance in quarterly reports for only 3 of the more than 10  indicators in its M/E plan. For three other awards, the partner did not  aggregate or track performance against any specific indicators in their  progress reports. While not reporting on progress against specific  indicators, these partners generally reported anecdotally on the topics  covered in the indicators or scattered some performance data throughout  their reports.", "In September 2012, State/DRL awarded a contract to a firm specializing  in M/E, which could address such gaps in its partners\u2019 performance  planning and reporting. In the area of performance planning, State/DRL  has directed the M/E contractor to provide training and technical  assistance to its partners to improve their M/E plans, such as to ensure  they include information on data collection methods. In addition,  State/DRL directed the M/E contractor to develop indicators for all  State/DRL partners to report on that meet or surpass data quality  standards. This should allow State/DRL to more easily aggregate  information on the overall performance of its Cuba program partners.", "The partners in our sample had various policies, procedures, and  mechanisms in place for monitoring subpartner performance, which they  compiled information on to report to the agencies. We found that  partners generally required subpartners to report on their activities  quarterly or monthly, and at the end of a subaward or subcontract. Some  partners also required subpartners to submit trip reports after any travel to  Cuba. Other monitoring practices cited by partners included site visits to  subpartners and frequent communication via phone, email, or in-person.", "Because of security concerns and limited on-site monitoring in Cuba,  partners and subpartners use a variety of methods to verify the delivery of  assistance to Cuban beneficiaries. Representatives from USAID\u2019s M/E  contractor indicated that partners have had difficulty collecting and  reporting data because of Cuban beneficiaries\u2019 reluctance to maintain and  provide specific information in writing (e.g., timesheets, attendance  sheets, or other documents naming beneficiaries). However, the M/E  contractor has found that partners and subpartners often communicate  with beneficiaries though various means. Similarly, according to  representatives of partners and subpartners we interviewed, some  delivery verification methods they used included the following: having future travelers ask beneficiaries how they used assistance observing beneficiaries\u2019 use of assistance through remote or indirect  means\u2014for example, through articles published online that  demonstrate that beneficiaries received training.", "Partners generally aggregate information obtained from such methods in  their progress reports to the agencies. However, in certain instances, the  monitoring methods selected have limited subpartners\u2019 ability to track and  report detailed information. For example, one subpartner reported on an  indicator, the number of signatures on petitions, by providing data that it  obtained over the phone (instead of through document reviews that would  prevent double counting of signatures and allow for other data quality  checks). In addition, USAID\u2019s M/E contractor has found cases in which  data could not be transmitted in a timely manner, preventing reporting on  activities in the quarter when they were implemented. As a result, both  the partners and the agencies can have difficulty knowing the exact  numbers and identities of beneficiaries in Cuba."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "USAID Has Improved Financial Monitoring of Partners; State Has Not Consistently Conducted Financial Internal Controls Reviews", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "USAID Has Bolstered Financial Monitoring of Its Partners", "paragraphs": ["Since 2008, USAID has made improvements to financial monitoring of its  Cuba program partners.

In sum, the external auditor questioned 11 percent  of the charges made to USAID/LAC during the external auditor\u2019s periods  of review.

Specifically, the external auditor found that four partners did not provide  any documentation of a cost-price analysis. In addition, the auditor found  that another four partners had insufficiently completed or documented  cost-price analyses, either by performing them verbally but not  documenting them or by having unorganized or unexplained  documentation of the cost-price analysis, limiting the external auditor\u2019s  ability to confirm the reasonableness of the costs in question.", "As a result of the external auditor\u2019s findings, USAID/LAC has provided  training to partners and, according to USAID/LAC\u2019s external auditor,  partners have made improvements. First, USAID/LAC asked the external  auditor to provide briefings to the Cuba program partners at their  December 2008 and March 2011 quarterly meetings on topics such as  unallowable expenses, internal control standards, and procurement  regulations. In addition, our review of audit reports issued from 2008  through 2011 showed that the external auditor found fewer inadequacies  at some partners that had previously been audited.

According to USAID officials, subpartners can be  considered pre-approved during the preaward phase if they are  described in award proposals, in accordance with the standard  provisions that are referenced in partners\u2019 awards. USAID officials  indicated that some of USAID\u2019s partners in the past had interpreted  the term \u201cdescribed\u201d to include any reference in a proposal to a  subpartner\u2019s activities, even if the proposal did not specify that the  work would be completed by a subpartner or provide specific  information about the subpartner.

In response, in June 2011,  USAID added guidance to its requests for applications (RFA) on the  type of information that partners must submit in order to receive prior  approval for all types of subpartners. This information includes, for  example, the name of the proposed subpartner, a description of the work to be performed by the subpartner under a detailed, line-item budget. the award,  the total estimated cost to be paid to the subpartner, and  In some cases, USAID accepts this information orally if the partner is  concerned that the leaking of this information could compromise the  security of individual consultants who travel to Cuba. To provide  further clarity to partners on whether or not USAID considers  subpartners as approved during the preaward phase, USAID stated in  its RFAs issued in fiscal year 2011 that a subaward or subcontract is  not considered approved until the USAID Agreement Officer in the  Management Bureau signs a letter approving it.", "Award phase. For USAID approval during the award phase, the  partner must submit all of the same information as required during the  preaward phase, as well as a copy of the proposed agreement with  the subpartner and documentation of the process through which the  subaward or subcontract was procured.  In May 2011, to further its  understanding of the work to be performed by its subpartners,  USAID/LAC set up a technical evaluation committee. For ongoing  awards, partners submit proposed subpartners for approval to the  committee. The committee may ask for information on proposed  subpartner activities, among other things, to ensure that the  programmatic content of the work to be performed by subpartners fits  in the scope of the overall award.", "State\u2019s Bureau of Administration is responsible for approving subawards  and subcontracts under State/DRL and State/WHA awards, and has  requirements similar to USAID\u2019s.

Specifically, State officials told us that the Bureau of Administration  requires certain information and documentation to approve subpartners,  including a copy of the draft agreement with the subpartner, the amount of and budget for the agreement,  the name of the subpartner organization, a description of the subpartner\u2019s role.  the period of performance, and  According to State officials, State\u2019s requirements are currently the same  whether a partner obtains preapproval during the preaward phase or  during the course of the award.

Instead, according to  officials, the Bureau of Administration requires information on the amount  of the consultancy contract, the consultant\u2019s budget, and a description of  the consultant\u2019s role and qualifications. Nevertheless, the detailed  information that State told us is required to preapprove subawards,  subcontracts, and consultants is not specified in written guidance to all  partners. For example, in State\u2019s handbook for grant recipients, State  informs recipients to provide in award proposals details on any  subpartners, but does not specify the type of information to provide. In  addition, based on our review of fiscal year 2010 and 2011 award  documents, we found that in cases when State/DRL is made aware of a  prospective partner\u2019s intention to have a subpartner through review of  their proposal, State/DRL included a requirement in the partner\u2019s award to  provide a copy of the agreement with that specific subpartner to State  within 10 days of its execution. However, State/DRL omitted this  requirement from awards for which it was not clear the partner intended to  use a subpartner. As a result, we found that many partners only received  the broad written guidance in State\u2019s Standard Terms and Conditions and  recipient handbook.", "Based on our analysis of the use of subpartners under recent State  awards, we found that State had sufficient information to preapprove the  subawards and subcontracts under State/WHA\u2019s awards.

Such an approach considers  key factors such as the value of awards, coverage, previously identified  deficiencies, award type, and the frequency of the reviews that will be  needed. USAID\u2019s auditor conducted 30 audits through fiscal year 2012,  which identified questionable charges and weaknesses in partners\u2019  financial management, procurement standards, and internal controls.  State did not conduct financial internal controls reviews for more than  two-thirds of its awards during fiscal years 2010 through 2012, although  State recently awarded funding to an external auditor for this purpose and  has taken steps toward implementing a risk-based approach for these  reviews. However, because these actions were taken recently, State\u2019s  ability to ensure that funds are being spent as intended remains unknown  until it has completed these reviews. Moreover, unlike USAID, State has  not provided clear guidance to its partners regarding requirements for  subpartner approval.

We  examined USAID\u2019s and State\u2019s program operational plans and  performance progress reports; agency and partner policy and procedure  manuals and program guidance; agendas and information presented at  quarterly partner meetings; partner and subpartner award agreements  and contracts; partner implementation, monitoring and evaluation (M/E)  plans; partner and subpartner interim and final performance and financial  reports; and audits of partner activities, among other documents and  data.", "To review partners\u2019 M/E plans, we assessed whether each plan had three  of the basic elements of M/E plans, as described in USAID and State  guidance: (1) clearly defined indicators, (2) targets set for each indicator,  and (3) data collection methods specified for each indicator. We selected  these criteria since they were common elements that M/E plans should  have, according to USAID and State guidance. Because we focus on  assessing the agencies\u2019 and partners\u2019 abilities to monitor, not to evaluate,  the Cuba democracy program, we did not select criteria for assessing any  portions of the M/E plans related to evaluation. We analyzed each M/E  plan to determine the extent to which the plan incorporated each element.  For example, we determined that an M/E plan partially met the criterion  for clearly defined indicators if the plan had indicators but did not provide  definitions for the indicators. For targets, we assessed a partner\u2019s M/E  plan as having partially met the criterion if there were relevant targets  specified for some but not all indicators. For data collection methods, we  assessed the partner\u2019s M/E plan as having partially met the criterion if  data collection methods were only described for some indicators or if the  plan generally described data collection methods, but did specify which  methods pertained to each indicator.", "To review partners\u2019 progress reports, we assessed whether progress was  clearly reported against each indicator identified in the M/E plans. We  determined that a partner\u2019s progress report met this criterion if the report  included specific updates on progress for each indicator, with any  progress for quantitative indicators (e.g., number of beneficiaries)  reported in numeric form. We assessed a partner\u2019s progress report as  partially having met the criterion if it reported progress in this specific way  on some but not all indicators. We assessed a partner\u2019s progress report  as not having met the criterion if the partner did not clearly report  progress on any of its indicators.", "Additionally, we interviewed officials from the two organizations  contracted by USAID/LAC to conduct performance and financial reviews  of partners. We reviewed partner and subpartner internal controls and  related residual fiscal accountability risk, and also performed walk- throughs of their disbursement processes and reviewed invoices and  other supporting documentation. We primarily focused our review on  compliance with internal controls standards relating to monitoring of  program funds and to reviewing certain control activities. We performed  selected expenditure testing at each partner and subpartner in our  sample, when applicable, to identify potential internal controls or financial  management issues. We also reviewed our previous reports and  interviewed experts to identify lessons learned and to better understand  challenges related to providing democracy assistance for Cuba.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2011 to January  2013 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the U.S. Agency for International Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the U.S. Department of State", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Leslie Holen, Assistant Director;  Elisabeth Helmer, Heather Latta, Joshua Akery, Laura Bednar, Beryl  Davis, David Dayton, David Dornisch, Ernie Jackson, Crystal Lazcano,  John Lopez, Reid Lowe, and Kim McGatlin provided significant  contributions to the work.
