Largely because spent fuel is hard to disperse and is stored in protective containers, these studies found that most terrorist or accident scenarios would cause little or no release of spent fuel, with little harm to human health. Some assessments found widespread harm is possible under certain severe but extremely unlikely conditions involving spent fuel stored in storage pools. As part of its ongoing research program and to respond to increased security concerns, NRC has ongoing and planned studies of the safety and security of spent fuel, including the potential effects of more extreme attack scenarios, including deliberate aircraft crashes. While NRC and DOE have found that spent fuel may be relatively safe and secure, DOE could potentially enhance the security of this fuel through options such as minimizing the number of shipments and picking up fuel in an order that would reduce risk, such as moving older less dangerous fuel first. These options could reduce the risk during transport and at some locations where the fuel is currently stored. However, contractual agreements between DOE and owners of spent fuel may limit DOE's ability to choose among these options. In addition, it is not clear that the benefits of these measures would justify the potential costs, including a possible renegotiation of the contracts between DOE and the spent fuel owners."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["One of the most hazardous materials made by man is spent nuclear   fuel\u2014the used fuel periodically removed from reactors in nuclear power  plants.

The pellets are fitted into  hollow metal rods, typically constructed of zirconium alloy, and the rods  are then gas pressurized. The rods are generally 12 to 14 feet in length and  are bundled together into assemblies. A portion of the assemblies must be  replaced every 1 to 2 years as the fuel in the reactor expends energy,  becoming less efficient at producing heat. As part of the process of  expending energy during a nuclear reaction, the fuel becomes highly  radioactive and thermally hot. Spent fuel emits radiation as a consequence  of radioactive decay. Barriers such as thick walls, sealed containers, and  water are used to shield individuals from exposure to this radiation.", "NRC regulates not only the construction and operation of commercial  nuclear power plants but also the storage, transportation (together with  the Department of Transportation), and disposal of spent fuel. NRC  requires each operating nuclear power plant to have safety and security  programs. For example, NRC requires protective shielding and security  systems, including armed guards, at nuclear power plants. When spent  fuel assemblies are removed from a reactor, they are stored in large  pools of cooling water. These pools are constructed according to NRC\u2019s  requirements, typically with 4- to 6-foot thick steel-lined concrete walls  and floors. Pools are typically 30 to 60 feet long, 20 to 40 feet wide, and  40 feet deep. The location of these pools is dependent on the type of  reactor. Essentially, all commercial power reactors in the United States  are one of two types, either a boiling water reactor or a pressurized water  reactor. For most boiling water reactors, the pools are located close to the  reactors, several stories above ground. For pressurized water reactors, the  pools are located in structures outside the reactor building, on the ground  or partially embedded in the ground. Regardless of reactor type, these  pools are required by NRC to be constructed to protect public health  against radiation exposure, even after a natural disaster, such as an  earthquake. The water in the pool is constantly cooled and circulated, and  the fuel assemblies are generally 20 feet below the surface of the water.", "In 1982, through the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the Congress directed DOE  to construct an underground repository for disposal of spent fuel and  other high-level radioactive waste. The Congress amended the act in 1987  and required DOE to only consider Yucca Mountain, Nevada, as a potential  site for a repository. In 2002, the President recommended to the Congress,  and the Congress approved, Yucca Mountain as a suitable site for the  development of a permanent high-level waste repository. As we reported  in 2001, for a variety of reasons, DOE is unlikely to open the repository as  planned in 2010.", "Lacking a long-term disposal option now, some nuclear utilities must  move a portion of their spent fuel into dry storage or face shutting down  their plants because their wet pools are reaching capacity. Currently, 25 of  the 72 storage sites use dry storage, and 11 other sites have plans to move  some of their inventory of spent fuel into dry storage. Dry storage facilities  for spent fuel typically consist of steel containers that are placed inside  concrete vaults or bunkers where the fuel is cooled by air rather than  water. These storage systems are required by NRC to be capable of  protecting against radiation exposure and of surviving natural disasters.  Because the move to dry storage is time-consuming and expensive,  utilities are, wherever possible, modifying wet pool storage capacity so  they can store larger quantities of spent fuel in these pools.", "To expose a large number of people to the harmful effects of radiation  from spent fuel, the fuel would have to be released from its protective  containers and dispersed over a wide or densely populated area. However,  unlike many other hazardous materials, spent fuel is a hard, heavy ceramic  material that is neither explosive nor volatile. To achieve a wide dispersal,  some portion of the spent fuel assemblies would have to be pulverized into  small particles by an external force\u2014such as a high-speed impact or a  violent explosion\u2014or some portion of the spent fuel assemblies would  have to burn in a sustained, high-temperature fire. According to NRC,  the redundancy and robustness of the designs of the fuel containers  make wide dispersal highly unlikely. In the event of a dispersal, the most  significant health effects would involve persons who inhaled very small  (respirable) particles\u201410 microns or less in diameter. Such particles  would be absorbed into the body and possibly remain there for  many years. In addition, these particles could be deposited on buildings  and the ground where, in the absence of a costly cleanup effort, they could  expose people to elevated levels of radiation.", "The transportation of spent fuel to Yucca Mountain\u2014most likely by both  truck and rail, but with a preference for using mostly rail\u2014will be a major  undertaking, spanning 20 to 30 years. According to DOE, more than  50,000 tons of the spent fuel have accumulated at 72 sites in 33 states,  many located near urban areas in the Midwest and the East. DOE has  estimated that the accumulated inventory will have grown to 69,000 tons  by 2010 and that moving this volume could require approximately  175 shipments per year over 24 years, relying on a combination of truck  and rail shipments.", "For the transportation of spent fuel, NRC has certification and inspection  requirements for shipping containers to ensure that the containers protect  against radioactive releases under accident scenarios. NRC has certified  a number of shipping container designs for use on trucks and rail. The  Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, requires DOE to ship  spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste to Yucca Mountain  in containers that have been certified by NRC. The act also requires DOE  to notify NRC in advance of spent fuel and high-level radioactive  waste shipments.", "In addition to NRC, the Department of Transportation plays a role in  regulating the transportation of spent fuel and other high-level waste. The  department\u2019s Research and Special Programs Administration sets certain  safety standards for the transportation of hazardous materials, including  spent fuel. These standards include, among other things, documentation  and labeling of containers, including placards identifying the shipment,  and requirements for separating certain radioactive materials while in  transit.

For example, these studies  repeatedly found that transportation containers would be very difficult to  penetrate, and in the worst-case scenarios where they may be penetrated,  only a small fraction of the material would be released. Some studies  involving spent fuel stored in pools of water found that widespread harm  is possible under severe but unlikely accident conditions. Such conditions  may include a catastrophic earthquake or a severe but unlikely accident  that could uncover the fuel for several hours, possibly allowing it to  spontaneously ignite and scatter radioactive material over a wide area.

DOE\u2019s contractor\u2019s  analysis explained that these cancer deaths should be considered against  a backdrop of an expected 1.1 million cancer deaths among the same  population expected from other causes.

The 2000 Sandia National Laboratory study, like preceding  accident studies, found that an accidental release of spent fuel in transit  is very unlikely and that significant human health impacts are even less  likely. The study estimated that in over 99.9 percent of all truck and rail  accidents, the shipping container would experience no significant damage,  and no radioactive material would be released. In fact, the analysis found  that only 7 in 100,000 (0.007 of 1 percent) truck accidents and 4 in 100,000  (0.004 of 1 percent) rail accidents would involve spent fuel casks in  impacts or fires that might cause a release of radioactive material. While  this study did not project the human health impacts of particular accident  scenarios, it concluded that the overall risk of human exposure to  accidental releases of spent fuel was far less than that estimated in the  1977 study, which confirmed that NRC\u2019s safety and security regulations  then in place were adequate.", "A subsequent DOE-sponsored study used the results of the 2000 Sandia  National Laboratory study to determine the potential health effects of the  estimated quantity of material released.

As part of this review, NRC commissioned  Sandia National Laboratory to examine more severe terrorist attack  scenarios involving spent fuel shipping containers.

Although these studies are still being designed, their preliminary  objectives include (1) validating past computer-based predictions of  damage to containers resulting from collisions, (2) validating past  computer-based predictions of how well containers withstand fires, and  (3) identifying the response of fuel pellets, fuel rods, and fuel assemblies in  severe impacts. In contrast to past analyses of severe accident scenarios,  the studies are to include physical tests of full-scale current model  shipping containers. The results of these physical tests will be compared  to the predictions of past computer-based analyses and serve to either  validate or to correct those results.

Such a loss could potentially lead to a  fire that would disperse radioactive material across a wide area. NRC\u2019s  most recent published study of this risk, released in 2001, found that,  though the potential consequences of such a fire could be severe\u2014nearly  200 early fatalities and thousands of latent cancer fatalities\u2014the likelihood  of such a fire is low. The study estimated that a catastrophic earthquake  or a severe but unlikely accident, such as dropping a 100- to 150-ton  storage container into the pool, could precipitate a pool fire.", "The study was conducted to assess the risks associated with accidents  at nuclear reactors that have been permanently shut down. According to  NRC, once the fuel is removed from the reactors, there is a risk associated  with the fuel stored in pools. NRC designed the study with conservative  assumptions to identify the most severe possible impact on public health.  The study assessed a variety of natural disasters and accidents that could  drain coolant and cause a fire. These events included loss of electrical  power, which would shut down the pool cooling system; an event that  would significantly damage the pool cooling system; a drop of a heavy  load, which could damage the pool wall or floor; a severe earthquake;  and an accidental aircraft crash. The study found that a catastrophic  earthquake and a heavy load drop were the events most likely to  significantly damage the pool, leading to sustained loss of coolant and  potentially causing a fire.", "The study then calculated the amount of radioactive material that might  be released by a fire and the possible human health effects stemming from  exposure to this material. In making these calculations, the study made  various conservative assumptions to ensure that NRC identified the most  severe consequences possible. For example, the study assumed that a pool  fire would involve 100 percent of the spent fuel assemblies in the pool,  releasing large amounts of radioactive material into the atmosphere.", "Two of the authors of the study noted that it was not certain how many  spent fuel assemblies would actually burn in a fire. The uncertainty in  the amount of radioactive material released depends on the fuel age and  distribution in the pool and the characteristics of the accident scenario.  The authors noted that some spent fuel assemblies might not reach the  high temperatures required to burn and that some of the radioactive  material might remain trapped in the pool or building. Because spent fuel  decays and thus becomes less dangerous over time, the study evaluated  scenarios in which the reactor had been shut down for 30 days, 90 days,  1 year, 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years. For each scenario, the study  evaluated two levels of radioactivity released from the fuel. NRC used the  results of this study to calculate the potential health effects of a fire in a  spent fuel pool. These results are shown in table 1.", "The study noted that the results are based on a natural disaster or an  accident severe enough to lead to a pool fire and that the risk of such an  event occurring is very low. NRC also noted that part of the reason for  the low probability is NRC\u2019s defense-in-depth policy, which states that  NRC establishes requirements to ensure that safety will not be wholly  dependent on any single system. Instead, NRC\u2019s requirements ensure  multiple or redundant safety systems. In the case of the storage pool  studied in the 2001 report, NRC noted that several factors combine to  make a pool fire unlikely, including the robust design of the pool; the  simple nature of the pool support systems; and the long time required to  heat up the fuel, which allows time for operators to respond. For  example, according to the 2001 report, heating the least-decayed spent fuel  to the ignition point\u2014were it to occur at all\u2014would take hours, perhaps  even days. Thus, NRC officials explained that even if a massive loss of  coolant occurred, plant operators might still have time to react, depending  on the extent of the damage. NRC requires that nuclear power plants have  a backup water supply that can cool fuel in case of an accident, so,  depending on the extent of damage, plant operators might be able to keep  the fuel submerged.", "The risk of a pool fire is also limited by the ability of some of the fuel to  be cooled by simple air ventilation if the coolant drains out. According to  NRC, completely draining a pool may allow enough air ventilation among  the stored fuel assemblies so that the spent fuel would stay below the  ignition point of a self-sustaining fire (about 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit).  Furthermore, even if a fire did begin in one assembly, there is considerable  uncertainty about whether the fire would spread to other assemblies. A  1987 study of spent fuel pools found that spent fuel in pools with fewer  assemblies, after being cooled for just a few weeks, would not ignite if  subjected to loss of coolant. Under the dense storage conditions  characterized by most spent fuel pools today, however, air ventilation  becomes less effective."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NRC Continues to Study the Risks of Storing Spent Fuel in Pools", "paragraphs": ["To begin addressing some of the uncertainties regarding the risks of  storing spent fuel in wet storage pools, NRC has some ongoing work, and  recently completed some initial evaluations of sabotage attacks on these  pools, and has more work planned and ongoing at two DOE national  laboratories.

The Corps conducted  several computer-based analyses of the potential effects of armor-piercing  weapons and high explosives on typical spent fuel pools. The analyses  found that the penetration of armor-piercing weapons and high explosives  could vary considerably, depending, among other things, on the size of the  weapon or explosive and the sophistication of the attacker.", "NRC is also conducting studies with less conservative assumptions to  more realistically evaluate the risks of spent fuel in a drained pool.

The studies by Sandia National Laboratory include a review of a variety of  terrorist scenarios, including attacks on fuel pools with aircraft and high  explosives. According to NRC, preliminary results of these studies indicate  that spent fuel may be more easily cooled than has been predicted in some  past studies and that off-site radiological releases may be substantially  reduced from previous worst-case estimates.

Fewer shipments would present fewer  potential targets for terrorists and could also enhance safety because there  would be fewer chances for an accident. Representatives of the nuclear  power industry and nuclear safety experts that we contacted agreed on  these points. For example, a representative of a consortium of nuclear  utilities told us that shipping spent fuel by rail is preferable to shipment  by truck because spent fuel containers designed for rail can carry about  5 times more spent fuel than truck containers. This larger capacity  translates to fewer shipments overall. Similarly, a frequent critic of the  safety of spent fuel shipments agreed that fewer shipments would be  better, noting that fewer, large shipments are easier to protect and track.  Beyond expressing a preference for shipping spent fuel to Yucca Mountain  mostly by rail, DOE has not yet developed its plans to implement the  shipping campaign.", "In addition to providing security advantages, minimizing the number  of shipments by using rail provides safety and efficiency benefits.

If strictly followed, the queue could result in many  more shipments than necessary. For example, the 12 spent fuel owners  with the largest quantities of spent fuel would make approximately  576 shipments based on the shipping queue.

Shipping fuel first from shutdown nuclear reactors would be  permissible under DOE\u2019s contracts with fuel owners, but the contracts  might preclude the other two options. Further, to some extent, these  options conflict with one another.

Although the contracts establish a shipping queue, the contracts  allow DOE to override the queue to make an exception for spent fuel  from shutdown reactors. Specifically, the contracts provide that,  notwithstanding the age of spent fuel, priority may be accorded any spent  fuel removed from a civilian nuclear power reactor that has reached the  end of its useful life or has been shut down for whatever reason."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Shipping Oldest Fuel First", "paragraphs": ["DOE could lower the risk of transporting spent fuel by shipping the  oldest spent fuel first. Radioactivity emitted by some components of spent  fuel declines significantly over comparatively short periods of time. For  example, one of the more radioactive elements in spent fuel\u2014cobalt\u2014 accounts for about 90 percent of the gamma radiation emitted by spent  fuel when it is first removed from the reactor. However, after about  25 years, cobalt, a  comparatively volatile element that would be a major component of any  accidental or deliberate release, declines by half after 30 years. Shipping  older spent fuel first could therefore be preferable in the event of a  deliberate or accidental release during transit. For example, a release of  spent fuel that is 25 or 30 years old would be a lesser\u2014though still  significant\u2014threat to public health than fuel that is only 5 or 10 years old.", "Analyses performed for DOE\u2019s environmental impact statement for the  Yucca Mountain repository illustrate the reduced impact that a release  of older spent fuel can have on public health. In the draft environmental  impact statement, DOE estimated that a particular release due to a  sabotage attack could result in about 16 latent cancer fatalities. This  scenario assumed that the shipped fuel was about 23 years old, which is  approximately the average age of the inventory of spent fuel. The final  environmental impact statement analyzed the same scenario, except that it  assumed that the shipped fuel was about 15 years old. This analysis found  that such a release would cause about 48 latent cancer deaths\u20143 times as  many as the older fuel. The age of the fuel was one of two major factors  that resulted in the higher estimate of latent cancer fatalities in the final  statement. DOE noted that the younger, more dangerous fuel, such as  spent fuel discharged 5 years or less from a reactor, makes up a small  percentage of the total inventory of spent fuel. As a result, the youngest,  hottest fuel would be less likely to be shipped or would represent a small  fraction of the fuel that is shipped. requires about 704 million years for its radiation output to be cut  in half. shipping older spent fuel first. An analyst under contract with the state  of Nevada noted that shipping the oldest fuel first would be the most  important factor in protecting public health during transit. Not only would  older fuel have lower consequences if released in an accident or a terrorist  event, but it also would be safer for transportation workers\u2014drivers and  handlers at intermodal transfer points\u2014and the general public. A  representative of the National Research Council\u2019s Board on Radioactive  Waste Management told us that shipping the oldest fuel first would help  minimize potential human health consequences in the event of a release  during transit. However, this representative said that if one assumes that  the robust shipping containers make a release unlikely, the potential risk  reduction associated with the age of the fuel becomes less important.", "Regardless of the potential transportation-related security benefits, DOE\u2019s  contracts with spent fuel owners limit its ability to ship the oldest fuel  first. In addition to establishing a shipping queue, the contracts allow each  fuel owner discretion to decide which of its spent fuel is actually delivered  to DOE, commensurate with the quantity of fuel associated with a  particular spot in the queue. For example, the Exelon company\u2014the  nation\u2019s largest nuclear power company\u2014has a place in the queue for  about 35 tons of spent fuel removed from a reactor located at its plant in  Zion, Illinois. When the time comes to ship this fuel to the repository,  Exelon may deliver either this fuel or an equal quantity of fuel\u2014possibly  much younger and more radioactive fuel\u2014from any of its facilities located  at sites in Illinois and sites in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.", "Because owners have discretion to choose which fuel they will actually  ship under the terms of the contract, DOE does not have the ability under  the contract to require that oldest fuel be shipped first. Fuel owners will  likely select spent fuel for shipment based on their operational needs. For  example, representatives of Progress Energy, a fuel owner with reactors in  the Southeast, said they would will likely ship from their pools first  because their pools are reaching capacity. Similarly, an Exelon official  said that shipping from pools first would minimize the need for dry  storage facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Shipping Fuel from Densely Packed Pools First", "paragraphs": ["As discussed in the first section of this report, a fire in a wet storage pool,  while highly unlikely, is theoretically possible. Shipping spent fuel from  densely packed spent fuel pools first could have security benefits.  Because DOE has not yet opened a permanent repository, spent fuel has  accumulated in quantities that pools were not originally designed to  contain. NRC officials noted that while a few spent fuel pools have low  density in at least part of the pools, nearly all pools are densely packed.", "These densely packed pools contain as much as 3.5 times more spent  fuel on average than the pools were originally designed to store. Reducing  the density of spent fuel in the pools would reduce the likelihood of a  fire. Recent NRC and independent studies show that lower-density  configurations allow for greater spacing between assemblies, which allows  air to more efficiently circulate in the event of coolant loss. According  to these reports, greater spacing could also help prevent a fire from  spreading among assemblies. Also, in the unlikely event of a fire, fewer  assemblies in the pool could result in reduced consequences.", "As noted earlier, DOE\u2019s contracts limit its ability to influence the order in  which spent fuel is shipped. Some owners may prefer to ship fuel from  densely packed pools first because when the pools reach full capacity, the  fuel must be removed or the plant must shut down. To the extent that, as  Exelon and Progress Energy officials stated, utilities are likely to ship from  their wet pools first, the threat would be reduced earliest at these pools.  This would, however, result in a relatively higher threat during transport  from relatively younger, more radioactive, spent fuel.

Such trains would typically consist of three to five rail cars, carrying one  container of spent fuel per car. A truck shipment can carry 1 to 2 tons of  spent fuel. In contrast, depending on the containers used, a 3-car train can  carry from 50 to 65 tons of spent fuel and a 5-car train can carry from  about 80 to 110 tons of spent fuel. Although dedicated trains could  enhance the security and safety of spent fuel shipments, these benefits  would have to be weighed against potential drawbacks. The benefits  would also have to be weighed against constructing a rail line to Yucca  Mountain. Currently, no rail line extends to Yucca Mountain.", "Advocates of dedicated trains told us that such trains offer two primary  security and safety advantages. First, the use of dedicated trains would  significantly reduce the exposure of spent fuel shipments to a terrorist  attack by significantly shortening the trip duration from its point of origin  to the repository. A representative of the Association of American  Railroads, which recommended that DOE use dedicated trains for the  shipment of spent fuel, explained that a spent fuel shipment from the East  Coast to Nevada would take about 3 to 4 days by dedicated rail, while the  same trip by regular rail would take about 8 to 10 days. Specifically, spent  fuel transported by regular rail would spend significant amounts of time in  rail yards where trains are broken up and reconfigured. While in the rail  yards, spent fuel containers could be stationary targets.", "Second, using dedicated trains would ensure that spent fuel was not  shipped with flammable hazardous materials. If spent fuel were released  from its containers in an accident or a terrorist attack, a fire fueled by  flammable materials could spread radioactive material over a wide area.  For example, NRC recently issued an analysis regarding a rail tunnel  fire that occurred in Baltimore in July 2001 that involved more than  28,000 gallons of a flammable solvent. NRC estimated that temperatures as  high as 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit were reached at certain locations in the  tunnel during the course of the fire but found that temperatures averaged  900 degrees in other parts of the fire. NRC studied the potential effects of  this fire on a spent fuel transportation container carrying spent fuel and  concluded that, when subjected to similar fire conditions, the container  would not release radioactive material.", "According to transportation officials we spoke to, dedicated trains can  also have safety and other benefits beyond sabotage prevention. For  example, officials of the Union Pacific Railroad and the Association of  American Railroads said that combining cars carrying fully loaded spent  fuel containers on trains with those carrying other cargo raises operational  and safety issues. Rail cars carrying spent fuel rail containers are  extraordinarily heavy\u2014such a car weighs about 470,000 pounds compared  to about 200,000 pounds for a standard loaded rail car. This weight  differential introduces difficulties in the physical dynamics of a train  carrying spent fuel and other cargo, making derailments more likely.", "On the other hand, it is not clear that the advantages of dedicated trains  outweigh the additional costs. In 1980, while considering amendments to  its security regulations, NRC examined the case for requiring dedicated  trains for rail shipments of spent fuel. NRC noted the advantages of  dedicated trains but also noted that dedicated trains are no more capable  of avoiding high-population areas than are regular trains, that a regular  train in a rail yard would be under surveillance by escorts and railroad  police, and that the necessary physical protection measures can be as  easily implemented on regular trains as on dedicated trains. For these and  other considerations, NRC declined to require dedicated trains. Further,  although DOE recognized the possible advantages of shipping spent  nuclear fuel by dedicated trains, DOE also concluded in its final  environmental impact statement that available information does not  indicate a clear advantage for the use of either dedicated trains or general  freight service."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The events of September 11, 2001, elevated lingering public concerns  about the security of spent fuel, and in particular the security and safety  of large-scale shipping of spent fuel.

The 1999 Sandia study is the most recent in a series of  federally sponsored studies dating back to the 1970s that have examined  the ability of armor-piercing weapons to penetrate spent fuel containers.  A draft version of a Sandia study from 1978, for example, concluded that  a successful sabotage attack on a spent fuel container would not cause  prompt fatalities but could cause several hundred latent cancer fatalities in  a densely populated urban area. The final version of this study reduced  the total latent cancer fatalities to fewer than 100, based on a re-evaluation  of the quantity of radioactive material released. Based largely on the  initial draft of this study, NRC established its regulations for security of  spent fuel in transit. Because this study was based on a conservative set of  analytical assumptions instead of on experimental data, there was a high  degree of uncertainty regarding the quantities of radioactive material  released, and the human health consequences. Consequently, in 1983, DOE  commissioned Sandia National Laboratory to conduct physical tests, in  which armor-penetrating missiles were fired at shipping containers  containing mock spent fuel assemblies. The study found that, under the  worst-case scenario, about 24 ten-thousandths (0.0024) of 1 percent of the  total solid fuel inventory in the container could be released as respirable  particles. To estimate the human health impact, the study included  conservative assumptions, including that the attacks occurred in  Manhattan, in New York City, on a business day, that the fuel had been  removed from the reactor for only 150 days (and thus was comparatively  more radiologically dangerous), and that no evacuation took place to limit  human exposure. Based on these results and assumptions, the study  predicted no early deaths and between two and seven long-term latent  cancer fatalities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accident Studies", "paragraphs": ["Methodology of Most Recent Studies. According to NRC, the 2000  Sandia National Laboratory study was conducted to address three  developments\u2014the likelihood that spent fuel shipments would be  increasing as a result of the progress on the Yucca Mountain repository,  the use of containers and transportation routes that differed from those  considered in previous studies, and the increased effectiveness in risk  assessment and computer modeling of spent fuel containers. The overall  objective of the study was to determine the degree of risk involved in  shipping spent fuel by truck and rail.", "The study examined the effects of severe collisions and fires on four  types of shipping containers\u2014a lead-lined steel truck container, a  depleted uranium-lined steel truck container, a lead-lined steel rail  container, and a monolithic steel container. The study relied on computer  analysis to estimate the probability of such events and the quantity of  radioactive material that might be released. The analysis developed  19 representative truck accidents and 21 representative rail accidents.", "The study simulated the effect on each of the truck and rail containers  after slamming them into a rigid surface from a variety of angles at 30, 60,  90, and 120 miles per hour. None of the cases modeled showed that the  body of the container would fail. Moreover, the modeling showed that the  seals around the lid at each end of the truck container would not allow a  release at 30, 60, and 90 miles per hour, although they may leak at  120 miles per hour. The results from modeling the two different rail  containers, however, showed that the seals may leak, for some collisions  at a speed of 60 miles per hour, depending on the angle of impact.", "DOE\u2019s study that predicted the health effects of these releases used a  computer code. The code calculated the dispersion of radioactive particles  and the resultant dose to the population. To estimate latent cancer deaths,  DOE made a number of key assumptions. DOE\u2019s analysis assumed the  accident occurred in the most populous center of an urban area and that  the population distribution from the accident site in the urban center to  the outer fringes was similar to the average populations\u2014projected to the  year 2035\u2014of the 20 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, plus Las Vegas,  Nevada. Stable weather conditions\u2014with comparatively slow wind  speeds\u2014were assumed to prevail at the time of the accident. Finally, the  population was assumed to be exposed to remnants of the release for 1  year after the accident, with no evacuation or cleanup.", "Previous Studies. The 2000 Sandia study reexamined the risks  associated with the transport of spent fuel by truck and rail and compared  the results to two previous studies\u2014one conducted by NRC in 1977 and  one performed by DOE\u2019s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in  1987. According to NRC, the 2000 Sandia study extended the methods  used in the 1987 report for container analysis and used improved risk  assessment methods.", "The 2000 Sandia study found that previous NRC-commissioned studies  overestimated the risks of human exposure due to transportation  accidents. According to NRC and Sandia officials, they have become more  confident in their results as analytical techniques and data have improved.  In 1977, NRC examined the risks of shipping a variety of radioactive  materials, including spent fuel. At that time, NRC determined that the  risks of accidental releases involved in shipping spent fuel and other  radioactive materials were quite small\u2014specifically, the study estimated  latent cancer deaths to be about 3 in 200 years of shipping spent fuel at  estimated rates for 1985. The study concluded that the existing NRC  requirements were adequate to protect public health. Partly because this  study was based on conservative engineering judgments and did not  include physical tests of shipping containers in severe accidents, NRC  subsequently commissioned a study published in 1987 that found that the  risks of spent fuel releases under transportation accident conditions were  much smaller. Performed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory  for NRC, this study included a more sophisticated analysis than the 1977  study, using historical data on past transportation accidents to determine  the likelihood of specific accident scenarios. The study then used a  computer-based analysis of accident scenarios involving collisions and fire  temperatures exceeding NRC standards. The 1987 study found that in  99.4 percent of all rail and truck accidents, the container would experience  no significant damage, and no radioactive material would be released."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Energy", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Doreen Feldman, Michael  Hartnett, Gary Jones, Cynthia Norris, Robert Sanchez, Amy Stewart,  Barbara Timmerman, and Dwayne Weigel made key contributions to  this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
