Safe havens allow terrorists to train recruits and plan operations against the United States and its interests across the globe. As a result, Congress has required agencies to provide detailed information regarding U.S. efforts to address terrorist safe havens. In this review, GAO assesses the extent to which (1) the Department of State (State) has identified and assessed terrorist safe havens in its Country Reports on Terrorism and (2) the U.S. government has identified efforts to deny terrorists safe haven consistent with reporting requirements. To address these objectives, GAO interviewed U.S. officials and analyzed national security strategies; State reporting; and country-level plans for the Philippines, Somalia, and Yemen."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["State identifies existing terrorist safe havens in its annual \"Country Reports on Terrorism\" but does not assess them with the level of detail recommended by Congress. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA) requires State to include in its annual \"Country Reports on Terrorism\" a detailed assessment of each foreign country used as a terrorist safe haven. It also recommends that State include, to the extent feasible, details in the report such as actions taken to address terrorist activities by countries whose territory is used as a safe haven. Since 2006, State has identified terrorist safe havens in its \"Country Reports on Terrorism.\" In August 2010, State identified 13 terrorist safe havens, including the southern Philippines, Somalia, and Yemen. However, none of the assessments in State's August 2010 report included information on one of the four elements recommended by Congress--the actions taken by countries identified as having terrorist safe havens to prevent trafficking in weapons of mass destruction through their territories. Also, about a quarter of the assessments in State's August 2010 Country Reports on Terrorism lacked information on another element recommended by Congress--the actions taken by countries identified as terrorist safe havens to cooperate with U.S. antiterrorism efforts. Including this information in State's reports could help better inform congressional oversight related to terrorist safe havens. The U.S. government has not fully addressed reporting requirements to identify U.S. efforts to deny safe haven to terrorists. In IRTPA and the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2010, Congress required the President to submit reports identifying such efforts. State responded to IRTPA with a 2006 report and subsequent annual updates to its \"Country Reports on Terrorism.\" However, efforts identified in State's August 2010 report include only certain efforts funded by State and do not include some State and other U.S. government agency funded efforts, such as those of the Departments of Defense and Justice. For example, our discussions with agency officials and analysis of agency strategic documents identified at least 14 programs and activities not included in State's reporting that may contribute to denying terrorists safe haven in Yemen. According to officials from the National Security Staff, the National Security Council is responsible for producing the report required by the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2010. As of March 2011, the report, which was due in September 2010, was not completed. According to agency officials, compiling such a list is challenging because it is difficult to determine if a given activity addresses terrorist safe havens or contributes to different, though possibly related, foreign policy objectives. While we recognize this challenge, a more comprehensive list that includes the efforts of all relevant agencies could provide useful information to Congress to enhance oversight activities, such as assessing U.S. efforts toward the governmentwide goal of denying terrorists safe haven."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends State and the National Security Council (NSC) improve reporting on assessments of and U.S. efforts to address terrorist safe havens.

Additionally, we  discussed U.S. strategies, programs, and activities related to terrorist safe  havens with U.S. officials from the Departments of Defense (DOD),  Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), State (State), and the Treasury  (Treasury); the Office of Management and Budget; the U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID); the National Security Staff; and the  intelligence community. We focused on these agencies because they are  involved in efforts that may contribute to addressing terrorist safe havens.  We also spoke to 13 subject matter experts from academic, governmental,  and nongovernmental organizations. We selected experts who met at least  four of the following criteria: (1) knowledge of and experience in one or  more of the following areas: (a) identification of terrorist safe havens or  failed states, (b) factors that contribute to terrorist safe havens, or (c)  process of terrorist recruitment or radicalization; (2) knowledge and  experience regarding key safe havens; (3) travel to at least one key safe  haven country or region; (4) writing and publishing of articles on key safe  haven countries, regions, or issues; and (5) knowledge of and experience  in government, for-profit organizations, nonprofit organizations, academia,  or journalism.", "To evaluate the extent to which State has identified and assessed terrorist  safe havens, we reviewed U.S. agency reports, such as State\u2019s annual  Country Reports on Terrorism.

To evaluate  the assessments, two analysts independently analyzed the terrorist safe  havens assessments against details included in IRTPA. Those analysts then  discussed and resolved any differences in the results of their analyses; a  supervisor reviewed and approved the final results of the analysis. We also  interviewed U.S. agency officials to determine the process and criteria  used to identify, assess, and prioritize these terrorist safe havens, and  spoke with subject matter experts to obtain their views on the  characteristics of and threats posed by terrorist safe havens identified by  State.", "To assess the extent to which the U.S. government has identified efforts to  deny terrorists safe haven consistent with reporting requirements, we  evaluated national counterterrorism and security strategies; agency budget  and planning documents, including reports from State\u2019s Foreign  Assistance Coordination and Tracking System (FACTS); and agency  reports against requirements included in IRTPA. Although we did not  independently audit the funding data in the FACTS database, and are not  expressing an opinion on them, based on our examination of the  documents received and our discussions with cognizant agency officials,  we concluded that the FACTS data we obtained were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of this engagement. We also examined country-specific  strategies related to addressing terrorist safe havens by interviewing U.S.  agency officials and reviewing mission strategic and resource plans  (MSRP) for three countries identified as having terrorist safe havens\u2014the  Philippines, Somalia, and Yemen. We selected these countries based on  consideration of the following criteria: (1) identification of a country or  area as a terrorist safe haven by State in its August 2010 Country Reports  on Terrorism, (2) priority placed on a particular safe haven as expressed  U.S. officials and subject matter experts, (3) consideration of related GAO  work, and (4) congressional interest. Our analysis does not include  intelligence-related efforts. We also considered information obtained  during our previous reviews of U.S. efforts to address terrorist safe havens  in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. To obtain a more in-depth  understanding of specific programs and activities, we traveled to Kenya  (where State\u2019s Somalia unit is located) and the Philippines, where we met  with U.S. government personnel involved in efforts to address terrorist  safe havens in Somalia and the southern Philippines. We planned to travel  to Yemen, but were unable to do so due to the unstable security  environment during the time of our review. To supplement our  understanding of U.S. efforts related to denial of terrorist safe haven in  Yemen we spoke with officials based in Washington, D.C., from DOD,  State, USAID, and the intelligence community.

Many insurgent groups, including Taliban  elements, the Haqqani Network, Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin, al-Qa\u2019ida (AQ), and Lashkar-e- Tayyiba, continued to use territory across the border in Pakistan as a base from which to  plot and launch attacks within Afghanistan and beyond. Narcotics trafficking, poppy  cultivation, and criminal networks were particularly prevalent, constituting a significant  source of funding for the insurgency as well as fueling corruption within Afghanistan. AQ  leadership in Pakistan maintained its support to militants conducting attacks in  Afghanistan and provided funding, training, and personnel to facilitate terrorist and  insurgent operations. Anti-Coalition organizations continued to operate in coordination  with AQ, Taliban, and other insurgent groups, primarily in the east.\u201d  \u201cColumbia\u2019s borders with Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Panama, and Brazil include rough  terrain and dense forest cover. These conditions, coupled with low population densities  and historically weak government presence, create potential safe havens for insurgent  and terrorist groups, particularly the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).  The FARC, retreating in the face of Colombian military pressures, thus operated with  relative ease along the fringes of Colombia\u2019s borders, and also uses areas in neighboring  countries along the border to rest and regroup, procure supplies, and stage and train for  terrorist attacks with varying degrees of success. The FARC elements in these border  regions often engaged the local population in direct and indirect ways, including  recruitment and logistical assistance. This appeared to be less so in Brazil and Peru  where potential safe havens were addressed by stronger government responses. Ecuador  and Panama have responded with a mix of containment and non-confrontation with  Colombian narco-terrorist groups, although some confrontations do occur depending on  local decisions and cross-border relations.\u201d  \u201cIraq was not a terrorist safe haven in 2009, but terrorists, including Sunni groups like al-  Qa\u2019ida in Iraq (AQI), and Ansar al-Islam (AI), as well as Shia extremists and other groups,  viewed Iraq as a potential safe haven. Together, U. S. and Iraqi security forces continued  to make progress against these groups. The significant reduction in the number of  security incidents in Iraq that began in the last half of 2007 continued through 2009, with a  steady downward trend in numbers of civilian casualties, enemy attacks, and improvised  explosive device (IED) attacks. AQI, although still dangerous, experienced the defection  of members, lost key mobilization areas, suffered disruption of support infrastructure and  funding, and was forced to change targeting priorities. A number of factors have  contributed to the substantial degradation of AQI. The alliance of convenience and mutual  exploitation between AQI and many Sunni populations has deteriorated. The Baghdad  Security Plan, initiated in February 2007, along with assistance from primarily Sunni tribal  and local groups, has succeeded in reducing violence to late 2005 levels and disrupted  and diminished AQI infrastructure, driving some surviving AQI fighters from Baghdad and  Anbar into the northern Iraqi provinces of Ninawa, Diyala, and Salah ad Din. New  initiatives with tribal and local leaders in Iraq have led Sunni tribes and local citizens to  reject AQI and its extremist ideology. The continued growth, professionalism, and  improved capabilities of the Iraqi forces have increased their effectiveness in rooting out  terrorist cells. Iraqis in Baghdad, Anbar and Diyala Provinces, and elsewhere have turned  against AQI and were cooperating with the Iraqi government and Coalition Forces to  defeat it.\u201d  \u201cThe Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) maintained an active presence in northern Iraq, from  which it coordinated attacks into Turkey, primarily against Turkish security forces, local  officials and villagers who opposed the organization. In October, the Turkish Parliament  overwhelmingly voted to extend the authorization for cross-border military operations  against PKK encampments in northern Iraq. Iraq, Turkey, and the United States continued  their formal trilateral security dialogue as one element of ongoing cooperative efforts to  counter the PKK. Iraqi leaders, including those from the Kurdistan Regional Government,  continued to publicly state that the PKK was a terrorist organization that would not be  tolerated in Iraq. Turkish and Iraqi leaders signed a counterterrorism agreement in  October.\u201d  \u201cHizballah remained the most prominent and powerful terrorist group in Lebanon, with  deep roots among Lebanon\u2019s large Shia community, which comprises at least one third of  Lebanon\u2019s population. The Lebanese government continued to recognize Hizballah, a  U.S.- designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, as a legitimate \u201cresistance group\u201d and  political party. Hizballah maintained offices in Beirut and military-style bases elsewhere in  the country and was represented by elected deputies in parliament. AQ associated  extremists also operated within the country, though their presence was small compared to  that of Palestinian groups operating in Palestinian refugee camps who were not aligned  with AQ. The camps are officially controlled by the Lebanese government. While the  Lebanese Armed Forces do not have a day-to-day presence in the camps, they have at  times conducted operations in the camps to combat terrorist threats.\u201d  \u201cDespite increased efforts by Pakistani security forces, al-Qa\u2019ida (AQ) terrorists, Afghan  militants, foreign insurgents, and Pakistani militants continued to find safe haven in  portions of Pakistan\u2019s Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), North-West Frontier  Province (NWFP), and Baluchistan. AQ and other groups such as the Haqqani Network  used the FATA to launch attacks in Afghanistan, plan operations worldwide, train, recruit,  and disseminate propaganda. The Pakistani Taliban (under the umbrella moniker Tehrik- e-Taliban or TTP) also used the FATA to plan attacks against the civilian and military  targets across Pakistan. Outside the FATA, the Quetta-based Afghan Taliban and  separate insurgent organizations such as Hizb-e-Islami Gulbuddin used the areas in  Baluchistan and the NWFP for safe haven. Islamist Deobandi groups and many local  tribesmen in the FATA and the NWFP continued to resist the government\u2019s efforts to  improve governance and administrative control. Despite the August death of the Pakistani  Taliban\u2019s leader Baitullah Mehsud and Pakistani military operations throughout the FATA  and NWFP, the Pakistani Taliban, AQ, and other extremist groups remained dangerous  foes to Pakistan and the international community. Despite international condemnation for  its November 2008 attacks in Mumbai, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LT) continued to plan regional  operations from within Pakistan. LT is an extremely capable terrorist organization with a  sophisticated regional network. It continued to view American interests as legitimate  targets. While the Government of Pakistan has banned LT, it needs to take further action  against this group and its front organizations, which find safe haven within Pakistan.\u201d  \u201cA small number of al-Qa\u2019ida (AQ) operatives remained in East Africa, particularly  Somalia, where they posed a serious threat to U.S. and allied interests in the region.  These elements were disrupted in late 2006 and early 2007 as a result of Ethiopian  military actions and again by the death of AQ operative Saleh Nabhan in September  2009. Somalia remained a concern given the country\u2019s long, unguarded coastline, porous  borders, continued political instability, and proximity to the Arabian Peninsula, all of which  provide opportunities for terrorist transit and/or safe haven and increased the regional  threat level. AQ remains likely to make common cause with Somali extremists, most  notably al-Shabaab. Al-Shabaab has expanded its area of control during its protracted  insurgency against the Transitional Federal Government and particularly since the  withdrawal of Ethiopian forces in early 2009. The group controlled most of southern  Somalia at year\u2019s end.\u201d  \u201cTerrorist operatives have sought safe haven in areas of the southern Philippines,  specifically in the Sulu archipelago and Mindanao. Philippine government control and the  rule of law in this area is weak due to rugged terrain, poverty, and local Muslim minority  resentment of central governmental policies. In addition to Jemaah Islamiya (JI) fugitives  and Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) terrorists, the New People\u2019s Army and Rajah Solaiman  Movement also operated in the southern Philippines.\u201d  \u201cIn Southeast Asia, the terrorist organizations Jemaah Islamiya (JI) and Abu Sayyaf  Group (ASG) have sought safe haven in the vicinity of the Sulawesi Sea and the Sulu  Archipelago, which encompasses the maritime boundaries of Indonesia, Malaysia, and  the Philippines. The area\u2019s thousands of islands make it a difficult region for authorities to  monitor, while a range of licit and illicit activities that occur there \u2013 worker migration,  tourism, and trade, for example \u2013 pose another challenge to identifying and countering the  terrorist threat. Although Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines have improved their  efforts to control their shared maritime boundaries, the expanse nevertheless remains  difficult to control. Surveillance is improved but remains partial at best, and traditional  smuggling and piracy groups have provided an effective cover for terrorist activities, such  as movement of personnel, equipment, and funds.\u201d", "Trans-Sahara (Algeria, Mali, Mauritania,  and Niger) \u201cThe primary terrorist threat in this region was al-Qa\u2019ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).  AQIM was based primarily in northeastern Algeria but factions also operated from a safe  haven in northern Mali, from which they transited areas of the Maghreb and Sahel,  especially Mali, Niger, and Mauritania. AQIM continued to conduct small scale ambushes  and attacks on Algerian security forces in northeastern Algeria, but in 2009 the group was  not able to conduct the \u201cspectacular\u201d attacks that were more common a few years ago  such as their bombing of the UN and Algerian government buildings. AQIM factions in  northern Mali used the safe haven to conduct kidnappings for ransom and murder of  Western hostages and to conduct limited attacks on Malian and Mauritanian security  personnel. AQIM derived financial support from the ransoms it collected, which were used  to sustain the organization and plan further terrorist operations. AQIM routinely demanded  the release of their operatives in custody in the region and elsewhere as a condition of  release of hostages. Regional governments sought to take steps to counter AQIM  operations, but there was a need for foreign assistance in the form of law enforcement  and military capacity building in order to do so.\u201d", "Tri-Border Area (Argentina, Paraguay, and  Brazil) \u201cNo corroborated information showed that Hizballah, HAMAS, or other Islamic extremist  groups used the Tri-Border Area (TBA) for military-type training or planning of terrorist  operations, but the United States remained concerned that these groups use the region  as a safe haven to raise funds. Suspected supporters of Islamic terrorist groups, including  Hizballah, take advantage of loosely regulated territory and the proximity of Ciudad del  Este, Paraguay and Foz do Igua\u00e7u, Brazil to participate in a wide range of illicit activities  and to solicit donations from within the sizable Muslim communities in the region. The  Argentine, Brazilian, and Paraguayan governments have long been concerned with arms  and drugs smuggling, document fraud, money laundering, trafficking in persons, and the  manufacture and movement of contraband goods through the TBA. Concerns about the  region moved the three governments to invite the United States to participate in the Three  Plus One Group on Tri-Border Area Security, which focuses on practical steps to  strengthen financial and border controls and enhance law enforcement and intelligence  sharing. Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay have made notable strides in launching  initiatives to strengthen law enforcement institutions and cooperation, including  developing financial intelligence units, broadening border security cooperation,  augmenting information sharing among prosecutors responsible for counterterrorism  cases, and establishing trade transparency units.\u201d  \u201cCorruption within the Venezuelan government and military, ideological ties with the  FARC, and weak international counternarcotics cooperation have fueled a permissive  operating environment for narco-traffickers. Other than some limited activities, such as the  bombing of remote dirt airstrips on the border, there is little evidence that the government  of Venezuela is moving to improve this situation in the near future. The FARC, as well as  Colombia\u2019s second largest rebel group, the National Liberation Army (ELN), regularly  used Venezuelan territory to rest and regroup, engage in narcotics trafficking, as well as  to extort protection money and kidnap Venezuelans to finance their operations.\u201d  \u201cThe security situation in Yemen continued to deteriorate. As Saudi security forces have  clamped down on terrorism and foreign fighters have returned from Afghanistan and  Pakistan, Yemen\u2019s porous borders have allowed many terrorists to seek safe haven within  Yemen. Al-Qa\u2019ida in Yemen (AQY) announced its merger with al-Qa\u2019ida (AQ) elements in  Saudi Arabia in January 2009, creating al-Qa\u2019ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). The  creation of AQAP coincided with fewer attacks within Yemen, possibly due to the desire of  its leadership to use Yemen as a safe haven for planning of future attacks and recruitment  because the central government lacks a strong presence in much of the country. The  absence of effective counterterrorism legislation contributed to Yemen\u2019s appeal as a safe  haven and potential base of operations for terrorists. The Yemeni government\u2019s response  to the terrorist threat was intermittent, and its ability to pursue and prosecute suspected  terrorists remained weak for most of the year due to a number of shortcomings, including  the stalling of draft counterterrorism in Parliament. The government\u2019s response improved  dramatically in December with security forces taking strong action against a number of  terrorist cells. Even with this turn of events, the government was often distracted by the  \u201cSixth War\u201d of the Houthi rebellion in the Sa\u2019ada governorate in the north of the country  and political unrest in southern Yemen.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Terrorist Safe Havens That Pose the Greatest Threats to U.S. National Security", "paragraphs": ["We spoke with 13 subject matter experts with knowledge related to  terrorist safe havens.
