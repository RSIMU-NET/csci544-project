Within this general approach, the selection process varies across workstreams. Differences include the number of review steps and manual processes, which are greater for field audits compared to correspondence audits which generally focus on a single compliance issue and are identified using automated processes. For fiscal year 2013, IRS reported that SB/SE's primary workstream for field audits identified about 1.6 million returns as potentially most noncompliant. About 77,500 returns (5 percent) were selected for audit, a much smaller pool of returns than was initially identified.", "SB/SE has control procedures for safeguarding data and segregating duties across the overall selection process, among others, but it has not implemented other key internal controls. The lack of strong control procedures increases the risk that the audit program's mission of fair and equitable application of the tax laws will not be achieved. Examples of internal control deficiencies include the following:", "Program objectives and key term of fairness are not clearly defined. Fairness is specified in SB/SE's mission statement and referenced in IRS's procedures for auditors. However, IRS has not defined fairness or program objectives for audit selection that would support its mission of treating taxpayers fairly. GAO heard different interpretations of fairness from focus group participants. Not having a clear definition of fairness can unintentionally lead to inconsistent treatment of taxpayers and create doubts as to how fairly IRS administers the tax law. Further, the lack of clearly articulated objectives undercuts the effectiveness of SB/SE's efforts to assess risks and measure performance toward achieving these objectives.", "Procedures for documenting and monitoring selection decisions are not consistent. SB/SE does not always require selection decisions and rationales to be documented. For example, SB/SE requires that some workstreams document survey decisions (when returns are not assigned for audit), rationale, and approval using a form. Other workstreams, such as its primary workstream for field audits, require a group manager stamp but do not require the rationale to be documented. Also, SB/SE does not always require classification decisions (when returns are assessed for audit potential and compliance issues) to be reviewed.

Several months after returns have been filed, AUR electronically matches  information reported by third parties, such as banks or employers, against  the information that taxpayers report on their tax returns. This matching  helps identify potentially underreported income or unwarranted  deductions or tax credits. ASFR also uses information return data to  identify persons who did not file returns; constructs substitute tax returns  for certain nonfilers; and assesses tax, interest, and penalties based on  those substitute returns. Although these and other compliance checks  may identify potentially noncompliant tax returns that are subsequently  audited, these programs are not the subject of this report.", "In March 2014, IRS\u2019s Chief Risk Officer, who oversees its agency-wide  program to identify and assess risks, completed a high-level, risk-based  review of the IRS audit selection process.

For example, the  criteria may be used for projects that explore or test ways to uncover  noncompliance or improve compliance.", "Computer programs. Computer programs use rules or formulas to  identify potential noncompliance across a type of tax return, rather  than for a specific tax issue.

About one-third of the workstreams use  some form of automation to identify the returns that should enter the  workstream. Most workstreams involve some form of manual review to  determine which returns have audit potential. For example, IRS auditors  review (i.e., classify) tax returns identified as having audit potential to  determine which returns have the highest potential and which parts of the  return should be audited.

For example, a few  workstreams use a committee to review proposals and authorize new  projects or investigations before returns can enter the workstream. Also,  for field audits, group managers generally decide whether to assign, hold,  or screen out returns for audit, whereas returns selected for campus  audits are generally assigned through automated processes after campus  analysts review the returns to ensure that they adhere to the selection  rules embedded in the automated processes.

According to  SB/SE officials, they modify the plan during the year as additional  budget and staffing information from IRS\u2019s finance unit becomes  available. Officials stated that changes to this audit plan are  documented by the budget information received and by the  recalculated plan. However, SB/SE did not document how it translated  the budget and staffing information into changes in the inventory  targets or staffing nor why some targets were changed but not others.", "Selection decisions and rationale. SB/SE did not consistently  document decisions for selecting certain tax returns over others for  audit and the rationale behind the decisions. SB/SE does not require  all of these decisions and rationales to be documented. Returns that  are stored electronically and are deemed to be excess inventory can  be screened out without documentation such as a form, stamp, or  signature. For discriminant function (DIF)-sourced returns, SB/SE\u2019s  primary workstream for field audits, and some referrals, only a group  manager stamp is required to screen out the returns, rather than also  documenting the rationale for screening them out. Documentation  requirements also vary within a workstream. For example, for returns  involving a tax shelter fostered by a promoter, audit screen-out  rationales are required to be documented at the group level in the field  but not at the area office level. Officials said that, aside from the Form  1900 for certain returns, they generally do not document why a return  was not selected. To illustrate, we found nine files without  documentation of the screen-out decision or rationale in our file review  of 30 screened-out returns. Regardless of whether a form is  required, the screen-out decision should be documented.", "Files not located. IRS could not locate 18 of the 233 files we  requested in time for our review. For example, for non-DIF pickup  returns, 5 out of 24 files requested were not located in time. For all  types of referrals we reviewed, we were unable to review 8 out of 56  files requested because they were not located in time. According to  officials, IRS could not locate these files because files for one audit  may be stored with files for any number of related audits, files for  open or recently closed audits may not yet be available, and files may  have been stored in the wrong location.", "In addition to internal control standards, the IRM requires all records to be  efficiently managed until final disposition.", "Having procedures to ensure that selection decisions and rationale are  clearly and consistently documented helps provide assurance that  management directives are consistently followed and return selection  decisions are made fairly. Further, being able to find files efficiently can  aid congressional and other oversight, and prevent unnecessary taxpayer  burden if IRS later needs to contact the taxpayer regarding material that  would have been in the file."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SB/SE Has Not Regularly Monitored Decisions Made and Coding Used for Audit Selection", "paragraphs": ["As discussed earlier in this report, SB/SE has procedures that, if  implemented, help provide some assurance that its return selection  process is generally monitored. However, we found that SB/SE did not  have requirements to monitor certain steps in the selection process.", "Internal Control Standard: Monitor  controls  Program managers should have a strategy  and procedures to continually monitor and  assure the effectiveness of its control  activities. Key duties and responsibilities  should be divided among different people to  reduce the risk of error and to achieve  organizational goals. Program managers need  operational data to determine whether they  are meeting their strategic and annual  performance plans and their goals for  effective and efficient use of resources.", "Dollar threshold for campus audits. We found that the dollar  threshold for selecting some returns for campus audits has remained  constant or has been adjusted informally based on inventory needs.  SB/SE has not evaluated whether the threshold should change or be  changed more formally. According to officials, the dollar threshold is  the break-even point for collecting enough tax to justify the audit.  However, the threshold is only a guide; sometimes the threshold can  be higher depending on how many returns need to be audited to meet  the audit plan. According to one official, the threshold amount has  been in place at least 4 years and possibly as long as 10 years.", "Classification review. We also found that classification decisions are  not always required to be reviewed. For DIF and NRP returns, about  10 percent of classified returns are required to be reviewed for  accuracy and adherence to classification guidelines. However, other  field audit selection methods, including some referrals, do not include  a formal classification quality review. Likewise, campus audit  selections by analysts are not formally reviewed.", "Review of group manager decisions. SB/SE does not always  require that group manager return selection decisions (i.e., screen- out) be reviewed. Even though multiple people are involved, in some  cases, the group manager can independently make the final selection  or screen-out decision. For state and agency referrals, and others to  varying degrees, screen-out decisions by group managers are not  reviewed. For example, in our file review of 30 screened-out returns, 8  were screened out by group managers. We did not see  documentation of the approval for screening out these returns  because such documentation was not required. According to SB/SE  officials, group managers are the most knowledgeable about the  resources available to meet audit goals. The managers also consult  with territory and area managers to determine which returns should be  screened out. For campus audits, approvals are not required to  screen out returns from audit. Officials said that workload selection  analysts communicate about the status of current and upcoming work  to determine which returns are excess inventory and not needed to  meet the annual audit plan or unable to be worked because of  resource limitations.", "Source codes. We found that some codes for identifying the return to  be audited, called source codes, were mislabeled, not used, or not  well defined, even though the IRM states that all data elements in IRS  databases should be defined and documented. In our review of 215  files, six returns were coded as non-Tax Equity and Fiscal  Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) related pickups. SB/SE officials  later explained that these returns were mislabeled and should be  moved to the source code used for TEFRA-related work. We also  found two files that were coded as information referrals that should  have been coded as related pickup audits, one file that was coded as  a DIF-sourced return that should have been coded as a claim by a  taxpayer to adjust a return he or she had filed, and three files that  were coded as compliance initiative projects that should have been  coded as returns selected to train auditors. For campus audits, source  codes are assigned to each return audited but are not used to identify,  select, or monitor campus inventory and do not serve any other  purpose in campus audits. As a result, a source code may not  represent the actual source of the inventory. Further, we found two  source codes that were not well defined. One source code associated  with about 35 percent of campus audits completed in fiscal year 2014  included references to DIF that were generally not applicable, since  these returns were not related to or identified using DIF scoring.  Another source code associated with about 18 percent of campus  audits completed in fiscal year 2014 was labelled as two different  items and did not accurately describe many of the returns using this  code.", "Spreading responsibility for reviewing selection and screen-out decisions  can reduce the potential for error and unfairness. In addition, adequate  controls can help ensure that audits are appropriately coded so that IRS  has accurate information to better ensure the efficient and effective use of  resources. For example, having better controls on how returns are coded  decreases the risk that data elements are misleading, which can hinder  the decision-making process, such as prioritizing returns to select for  audit and analyzing whether goals are met."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["SB/SE relies on a variety of sources and processes to select returns for  audit.

However, we identified some internal control  weaknesses that leave its audit program vulnerable to inconsistent return  selection or the perception of it. Without effective internal controls,  including defining fairness in selecting returns, SB/SE cannot know if it is  achieving its mission and whether its return selection policies and  procedures are aligned with its mission. Further, IRS will not be able to  manage risk or monitor performance as well as it otherwise could.

The Deputy Commissioner for  Services and Enforcement provided written comments on November 23,  2015, which are reprinted in appendix VII. IRS stated that it agrees with  the importance of sound internal controls and is committed to their  improvement, especially in the areas we recommended. IRS stated that it  agreed with our seven recommendations. Accordingly, the enclosure to  the letter listed specific IRS actions planned to implement the  recommendations. IRS also provided technical comments, which we  incorporated where appropriate.", "As IRS\u2019s letter mentioned, its audit program includes various features that  are intended to promote fair return selection, such as documents that  convey the importance of \u201cfairness,\u201d existing objectives and measures,  and types of monitoring. However, as our report discusses, these features  do not clarify what fair selection of returns for audit entails and how IRS  would know whether fair selections are occurring, except for when  someone such as a taxpayer questions the fairness of return selection.", "For our recommendations on defining and documenting \u201cfairness\u201d for  return selection activities and communicating examples of fair selections  to staff, IRS stated that the concept of fairness has both collective and  individual attributes. IRS noted that fairness for return selection  encompasses three components\u2014pursuing those who fail to comply,  objectively selecting noncompliant returns across all areas of  noncompliance, and respecting and adhering to taxpayers\u2019 rights. As  such, IRS has taken the first step to implement our recommendation.  However, to fully implement our recommendation, IRS will need to clarify  how each component relates to return selection. For example, the first  and third components also cover what happens after return selection,  such as pursuing noncompliance and interacting with taxpayers during  the audit.", "In regard to our recommendations on developing one or more program  objectives and related measures on return selection related to fairness,  as our report discusses, IRS\u2019s current program objectives and measures  do not address fair selection of returns. We believe that IRS should  develop at least one objective and related measure that tie to its definition  of fairness. Doing so would allow IRS to more conclusively demonstrate  and assess whether its selection decisions were fair.", "We also recommended that IRS improve the documentation and  monitoring of selection decisions. Our report acknowledges that  documentation and monitoring does occur in many areas but provides  examples of the need for more in other areas. As such, IRS needs  additional documentation and monitoring as opposed to merely a plan to  evaluate the need to take these actions.", "We note three other clarifications based on statements in IRS\u2019s letter.", "First, IRS\u2019s letter correctly stated that our report did not identify  any instances where the selection was considered inappropriate  or unfair. We did not design our study to look for inappropriate and  unfair selections, but rather to assess the internal controls that  help ensure a fair selection process. Further, even if we did design  our study to look for unfair selections, our design would be  hampered by the lack of a definition for fairness and related  objective(s) and measures(s) to evaluate whether selections were  fair.", "Second, IRS\u2019s letter stated that the seven groupings in our report  do not reflect how IRS views its workstreams for identifying  returns for potential audit selection. As discussed in the report, our  groupings are based on how a return was initially identified rather  than on IRS\u2019s workstreams. For example, related pickups,  including DIF-related pickups, are identified by auditors, whereas  DIF-selected returns are identified by a computer algorithm.  Therefore, we separately grouped DIF-related pickups from DIF- selected returns. Furthermore, IRS could not provide complete  data on the number of returns audited from each of its  workstreams but could provide data on audits selected from other  sources, such as related pickups. While some of these sources  could be associated with a workstream, it was not possible for all.  As a result, we used the available IRS data to show how all SB/SE  audits were distributed by these audit identification workstreams  and sources (shown in the report as figure 3).", "Third, DIF return selections do not involve the least amount of  discretion, as IRS\u2019s letter stated. As discussed in our report, many  returns that were initially identified through DIF automation as  having audit potential were not audited. The actual audit  selections do not occur until multiple IRS staff review those  returns, requiring some human discretion. Our report discusses  other groupings with less staff discretion than DIF, such as when  taxpayers request that IRS review their returns or when IRS  randomly selects returns for a research program.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date. At that time, we will send copies to the Chairmen and  Ranking Members of other Senate and House committees and  subcommittees that have appropriation, authorization, and oversight  responsibilities for IRS.

These documents included sections of the Internal  Revenue Manual (IRM), procedures documents, process flowcharts, and  summaries of selection processes prepared by SB/SE officials. We also  interviewed IRS officials responsible for overseeing audit selection. To  provide information on closed IRS and SB/SE audits, we analyzed data  for 2011 through 2014 from the Compliance Data Warehouse Audit  Information Management System (AIMS) closed table. We compared the  results of our analyses of data in AIMS to the IRS data book to assess  consistency of results. We determined that these data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes for which they were used in this engagement.", "For the second objective, we reviewed SB/SE\u2019s procedures for selecting  returns for audit and related internal controls intended to help SB/SE  achieve its stated mission of \u201cenforcing the tax law with integrity and  fairness to all.\u201d We then assessed whether these procedures followed  standards from Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  that were relevant to return selection. To determine which standards  were most relevant, we used our Internal Control Management and  Evaluation Tool, in conjunction with observations from our preliminary  audit work. We selected the most relevant internal control standards as  criteria in consultation with SB/SE officials and our financial management  and assurance and information technology teams.", "We also conducted eight focus groups with selected SB/SE staff who are  responsible for reviewing or selecting SB/SE returns for audit. We held  two groups with field office staff who review returns for audit potential, two  groups with area office staff who coordinate the review process, two  groups with field office group managers who select returns for audit, one  group with campus staff who review and select returns for audit, and one  group with specialty tax group managers who select returns for audit.  Within these five populations, we randomly selected participants who met  our criteria of having more than 2 years of IRS work experience, working  in different IRS offices nationwide, and covering a range of compliance  issue areas. In total, our groups involved 58 participants with an average  of about 9 years of IRS experience, with a range from 3 to 32 years of  experience. The focus groups were held by telephone. We asked  questions on internal control related topics, such as the clarity of SB/SE  procedures and the adequacy of guidance to apply these procedures.", "To assess the extent to which SB/SE implemented its procedures, we  conducted a file review. We used IRM sections and SB/SE procedures  documents as criteria. We obtained the population of SB/SE audits  opened from March 2014 to February 2015 as shown in the open AIMS  database and selected a nonprobability sample of 173 returns to review.  Although the results of our file review cannot be projected to the  population of SB/SE audits, they represent a variety of types of returns,  sources, and selection processes. We focused on processes that  required more manual review or affected a large number of taxpayers. As  reflected in table 2, we reviewed more files for referrals and compliance  initiative projects because they involve more human discretion in deciding  whether to include the return in the selection inventory and in reviewing  the returns for audit potential than for some other categories. We also  reviewed more files for discriminant function (DIF) returns compared to  some other categories because DIF returns are the largest portion of  SB/SE\u2019s field audit workload by selection method or workstream. We  reviewed the files to determine if decisions were documented and if staff  followed procedures, such as documenting the rationale and approval for  selecting or screening out returns. In sum, table 2 reflects the different  types of returns we sampled, the type of files we reviewed, and the  population and sample size of the files.", "As shown in the last two rows of table 2, we also reviewed  nongeneralizable, random samples of 30 returns that had been surveyed  (i.e., screened out) and 30 classification quality review records for the  same general time period as the audit files we reviewed. We created a  separate sample of screened-out returns because audits were not  opened on these returns. The database we used to create the audit file  sample only contained returns that had been audited. We obtained the  population of screened-out returns from SB/SE officials and randomly  selected our sample from this population. We created a separate sample  for classification quality review records because SB/SE reviews  classification decisions per auditor rather than per return. We obtained  the population of auditors that were reviewed during the same general  time period as the files for the other samples. We identified  subpopulations by region and selected a stratified random sample of  these subpopulations.", "Finally, we interviewed SB/SE officials about the procedures and  discussed deficiencies we identified. We designed uniform data collection  instruments for our file review to consistently capture information on the  completeness of required documentation and approvals related to return  selection. IRS reviewed the instruments and the data we captured. To  ensure accuracy, two of our analysts reviewed each file we assessed and  reconciled any differences in responses. We then analyzed the results of  these data collection efforts to identify main themes and develop  summary findings.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2014 to December  2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Audit Information Management Systems (AIMS)/AIMS Computer  Information System (A-CIS)/Previously Adjusted Exam Issues on  Subsequent-year Filings - Quarterly A-CIS reports are run to identify  every campus case closed agreed or default in each of the  discretionary audit programs. The subsequent year returns are  classified for the same issues that are on the closed audit cases.  3.  Audit Reconsideration - Reevaluates the results of a prior audit  where additional tax was assessed and remains unpaid, or a tax  credit was reversed. IRS also uses the process when the taxpayer  contests a Substitute for Return determination by filing an original  delinquent return.  4.  Campus Reporting Compliance (CRC) Compliance Initiative  Project (CIP) Usage - CRC uses CIP Authorization (Form 13498) to  document approval for testing potential new inventory in  correspondence audits.  5.  Category A Claims for Refund - Accounts Management staff refer  claims for refunds that meet criteria indicating audit potential directly  to Classification and Claim Teams within the campuses.  6.  Criminal Investigation Referral - CRC uses IRS\u2019s databases to  determine if the issues Criminal Investigation identified exist on the  referred returns.  7.  Claim - A request for refund or an adjustment of tax paid or credit not  previously reported or allowed.  8.  Collection Referral - CRC receives two kinds of referrals from  collection each year. CRC receives three referrals yearly of potential  nonfiler leads from the collection queue. CRC also receives  occasional referrals of Form 3949 Information Item referrals.  9.  Compliance Data Environment Release 3 - Identifies potential  audits through user-defined filters and queries, and forwards those  selected to the correct treatment stream.  10. Compliance Data Warehouse/Potential Unreported Heavy Use  Tax - Identifies Form 2290 returns (Heavy Highway Vehicle Use Tax  Return) with potential unreported heavy use tax.  11. Compliance Initiative Project (CIP) \u2013 When IRS identifies potential  noncompliance in specific groups of taxpayers, CIPs are used to  contact or audit taxpayers or collect taxpayer data within that group  when another method to identify such workload is not already in  place.  12.

National Research Program (NRP) - A comprehensive effort by IRS  to measure compliance for different types of taxes and various sets of  taxpayers. It provides a statistically valid representation of the  compliance characteristics of taxpayers.  22. Offers-In-Compromise/Doubt as to Liability - An offer in  compromise is an agreement between the taxpayer and IRS that  settles a tax debt for less than the full amount owed. Doubt as to  liability exists where there is a genuine dispute as to the existence or  amount of the correct tax debt under the law.  23. Payment Card Income Pilot - Potential underreporters are flagged  when Form 1099-K receipts, as a portion of gross receipts, are  significantly greater than for similar taxpayers, suggesting cash  underreporting.  24.
