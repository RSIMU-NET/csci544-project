Federal rapid response to invasive species varies: species that threaten agricultural crops or livestock are far more likely to elicit a rapid response than those primarily affecting forestry or other natural areas, including rangelands and water areas. A major obstacle to rapid response is the lack of a national system to address invasive species. Other obstacles to rapid response include the need for additional detection systems to identify new species; improved partnerships among federal, state, and local agencies; and better technologies to eradicate invasive species. The Invasive Species Council's Management Plan makes several recommendations for improving rapid response, including developing a program of coordinated rapid response and pursuing increases in discretionary spending to support the program. A concerted effort to improve the rapid response is clearly needed. If properly implemented, the Council's recommendations will go a long way toward developing a national system to address this pressing need."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Invasive species\u2014harmful, nonnative plants, animals, and  microorganisms\u2014are found throughout the United States, causing billions  of dollars of damage annually to crops, rangelands, and waterways. For  example, zebra mussels are a widely known aquatic invasive. Transported  into the Great Lakes in ships\u2019 ballast water, zebra mussels have clogged the  water pipes of electric companies and other industries; infestations in the  Midwest and Northeast have cost power plants and industrial facilities  almost $70 million between 1989 and 1995. Invasive species have also had a  devastating effect on natural areas, where they have strangled native flora,  taken over wetland habitats, and deprived waterfowl and other species of  food sources. Scientists, academicians, and industry leaders are  recognizing invasive species to be one of the most serious environmental  threats of the 21st century.", "Sometimes invasive species enter the United States accidentally; for  example, as weed seeds in commodities, in ballast water from ships, or in  untreated wood-packing material. In other instances, invasive species are  brought in deliberately as ornamental plants, as pets, or for purposes such  as erosion control. Increased travel and global trade have resulted in  growing numbers of invasive species gaining entry into the United States.  Species from countries such as China and Russia with habitats similar to  our own are especially likely to gain a foothold in the United States.  Expanded trade within North America has also increased the risk of  spreading established invaders from one country to another.", "Over 20 federal agencies\u2014including the U.S. Departments of Agriculture  (USDA), Commerce, Defense, and the Interior\u2014have responsibility for  some aspect of invasive species management. States also have a significant  management role, but the extent of their involvement varies considerably.", "USDA, and primarily its Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  (APHIS), has the largest federal role. In fiscal year 2000, USDA spent about  $556 million on a wide range of invasive species-related activities\u2014almost  90 percent of the total federal funding directed toward these activities.  Interior and Defense accounted for another 5 percent and 2 percent,  respectively. Federal invasive species activities include prevention (efforts  to keep invasive species from entering the country), detection (surveillance  for invasive species), and control (measures to eradicate or limit the spread  of invasive species).", "An important part of these activities is rapid response\u2014a response  conducted in time to eradicate or contain a potentially damaging invasive  species. Invasive species can be new to the United States or to an  ecosystem (a community of organisms and their environment) within the  United States.  The time required for rapid response varies depending on  the species and its habitat. A response within days may be needed to  eradicate many newly detected invasive species that reproduce and spread  rapidly; however, months or even years may be sufficient for some weeds  and pests that take a long time to proliferate. Since time, however, is often  of the essence, effective detection systems are integral to rapid response.  Without early detection, a rapid response may be infeasible. Efforts to  eradicate or control invasive species may involve, among other things,  pesticides, handpicking, and biological controls (that is, the introduction of  a natural enemy, predator, parasite, or disease, often from the pest\u2019s native  range). Because invasive species do not respect jurisdictional boundaries,  rapid response often requires cooperation among federal, state, and local  government agencies, private land managers/owners, and tribal  governments.", "In February 1999, invasive species received heightened attention with the  issuance of Executive Order 13112. The order was intended to help prevent  the introduction of invasive species, control their spread, and minimize  their impact on the U.S. economy, the environment, and human health. The  order established a National Invasive Species Council, comprising the  heads of eight federal departments and agencies, to provide national  leadership and coordination in federal invasive species activities.", "The Council was charged with issuing a National Invasive Species  Management Plan. Among other things, the plan was to (1) recommend  performance-oriented goals and objectives, (2) recommend measures to  minimize the risk of new introductions of invasive species, and (3) review  existing and prospective authorities for preventing the introduction and  spread of invasive species. The plan, issued January 18, 2001, contained 57  recommendations, including 3 aimed at improving the nation\u2019s ability to  respond rapidly to invasive species.", "Concerned about the growing threat of invasive species, you asked us to  conduct two reviews.

This report  responds to your request that we review federal efforts to provide rapid  response to invasive species. Specifically, we examined the extent to which  the federal government rapidly responds to new invasive species, the  obstacles that impede rapid response, and how rapid response can be  improved.", "Among the steps taken as part of our review, we collected funding data on  the rapid responses of federal agencies with invasive species  responsibilities, including those within the Departments of Agriculture,  Commerce, and the Interior. Since many agency officials were uncertain  about what activities should be considered rapid response and their  agencies did not routinely track rapid response funding, their estimates of  rapid response funding may be somewhat over- or understated. At the same  time, however, the officials believe that their estimates are a fairly accurate  representation of their rapid response activities.

The ruffe invaded North America in the  1980s through ballast water and soon colonized bays and tributaries along  parts of Lake Superior. A rapid response among federal, state, Canadian,  and other entities to contain the ruffe foundered because of a dispute over  whether to use chemical controls.   Although subsequent control efforts  have slowed the ruffe\u2019s spread, it is expected to reach the warmer waters of  the lower Great Lakes fisheries where its economic consequences may be  devastating.

Federal and state participants said the response was effective largely  because of the (1) early involvement of a public-private action team that  recognized the urgent need for rapid response and (2) active involvement  of several key players, including the consulting firm that discovered and  treated the infestation, the regional water quality control board, and the  state agriculture department. The regional water board was instrumental in  obtaining state emergency cleanup and abatement funding, enabling  eradication efforts to quickly begin. Surveying began a day after the  infestation was identified; within 2 weeks, an action team was formed and  initiated response measures. Initial treatment was completed in 3 months.", "Periodic monitoring and treatment are ongoing, but it will take years to  know whether complete eradication can be achieved.", "Executive Order 13112 emphasizes the need for federal agencies to  cooperate with states. Many state officials are concerned about what role  they will play in a national rapid response system and have differing views  on what their roles should be. For example, in commenting on  recommendations in the draft invasive species management plan, some  states emphasized the need to respect the sovereignty of state, local, and  tribal authorities, particularly in managing fish and wildlife within their  borders. Others emphasized the importance of a strong national effort to  address invasive species given their limited ability to address interstate  problems. The rapid response capabilities of states also vary. For example,  a 1993 Office of Technology Assessment study reported that most state  agencies rated their invasive species implementation and enforcement  resources as \u201cless\u201d or \u201cmuch less\u201d than adequate. Finally, some states,  such as Minnesota and Hawaii, have substantial legal structures in place,  while others have barely addressed the issue.", "To develop partnerships in areas relating to agriculture, APHIS has  established memorandums of understanding with state departments of  agriculture in all 50 states.

For example,  according to Forest Service scientists, research to develop control methods  and basic knowledge about sudden oak death, a new destructive invasive  forest disease in California, was delayed by the time-consuming process  used to obtain funding. The scientists noted that although $3.5 million was  needed to do the research, it took 7 months, from late June 2000 until late  January 2001, for the Forest Service to obtain about one-third ($1.1 million)  of the requested amount from Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC).  Consequently, the Forest Service was unable to develop basic knowledge  about this little known disease as quickly as it would have had the research  been fully funded immediately. Furthermore, the Service estimated that it  needed an additional $875,000 in fiscal year 2001 for immediate research  and development in connection with other emerging invasive threats, such  as the exotic spruce aphid which has caused severe damage to forests in  the Southwest.", "Likewise, a Geological Survey scientist said that his agency does little rapid  research relating to newly detected species because funding is not readily  available. He said that research managers must often seek resources from  other agencies if they want to initiate research and surveys  to support  rapid response. However, according to this scientist, whether the funding  comes from within the Survey or without, the amount of time spent in  obtaining it frequently makes rapid response infeasible.", "For certain invasive species, particularly those affecting aquatic areas,  environmentally sound control methods are not available. According to a  Commerce official, control methods in aquatic areas are much less  developed than those in terrestrial settings because (1) awareness of the  need for aquatic control methods is relatively recent and (2) industry has  little incentive to develop control methods for aquatic areas. Unlike  controls used in terrestrial settings, those developed for aquatic areas have  few commercial applications; thus, the return on investment tends to be  low. This official added that no feasible methods currently exist for  controlling some invasive species, such as the spotted jellyfish, which was  detected in the Gulf of Mexico in 2000.", "In other instances, effective chemical pesticides may be available, but have  not been registered under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and  Rodenticide Act for use in aquatic settings. A number of aquatic species\u2014 including the zebra mussel, round goby, and ruffe\u2014continue to spread, in  part because of the lack of environmentally sound control methods.  Moreover, the number of pesticides available for invasive species control is  declining. The Environmental Protection Agency has ruled that methyl  bromide\u2014the major fumigant option used in food and fiber quarantine pest  treatments\u2014is scheduled to be phased out by 2005. Reassessment of  important pesticides, including malathion and guthion, may result in these  being phased out as well.", "Finally, control methods are sometimes too costly. For example, in  assessing controls to prevent the Asian swamp eel from moving into the  Everglades National Park, an interagency task force considered installing  an electrical barrier. Although this was regarded as the most effective  control method available, it was rejected due to its high cost.

On March 21,  1996, the Secretary of Agriculture announced that he had signed a  Declaration of Extraordinary Emergency, which allowed USDA to take a  wide range of actions to control and eradicate the fungus, including  compensating farmers for losses and imposing quarantines in Arizona and  several counties in New Mexico and Texas.", "While the Plant Protection Act of 2000 expanded APHIS\u2019 authority to  address invasive species that threaten natural resources and the  environment, APHIS has done relatively little in this area.  APHIS has  recently revised its mission statement to specifically identify safeguarding  natural areas from invasive species; however, APHIS officials said that the  agency has been reluctant to rapidly respond to natural area infestations, in  large part because it lacks the funding to do so.

An  important reason for this is that while Interior and the Forest Service and,  to a lesser extent, entities such as Commerce and Defense have  responsibilities for protecting the environment, invasive species are a small  part of the activities conducted under their missions. As a result, competing  priorities and other factors have limited their ability to respond to natural  area infestations.", "The Department of the Interior\u2019s management of invasive species is limited  by several factors that are detailed below:  If an invasive species affects Interior lands, Interior can use its land  management authorities to address the situation as quickly as funding  and staffing allow. There are, however, many other environmental issues  that compete for Interior\u2019s resources, so there is little assurance they  will be available for responding to invasive species.", "Unlike USDA, Interior lacks access to another funding source for rapid  response. Also, unlike APHIS, Interior agencies rarely receive  appropriations from the Congress directing them to address specific  infestations. Therefore, Interior\u2019s invasive species programs tend to  focus on control and restoration rather than rapid response. For  example, a National Wildlife Refuge official noted that invasive species  funding on refuge lands is used for projects identified in previous annual  budget cycles. As a result, funds are directed toward recurring or well- established problems rather than toward rapid response.", "Although Interior has authority to conduct control and eradication  programs on its lands, its authorities are not nearly as specific as APHIS\u2019  invasive species authorities\u2014even in natural areas. APHIS\u2019 authorities  cover movement into the United States and interstate movement of  insects, plant pathogens, exotic plants, and aquatic organisms that might  threaten natural ecosystems. In contrast, rather than preventing the  spread of invasive species overall, many of Interior\u2019s statutes are general  land management statutes or protect a particular species or group of  species. For example, according to an Interior attorney, the Endangered  Species Act may result in actions against invasive species, but they  would be a byproduct of protecting listed endangered species.", "Competing priorities have also limited other agencies\u2019 abilities to obtain the  resources needed to rapidly respond. For example, the Forest Service has  authority and responsibility for promoting environmental protection of  forests and rangelands, including protection against invasive species.  However, this particular environmental objective must compete with  others for funding, including programs aimed at improving and protecting  water quality and quantity and reducing fire hazards near urban areas.  Moreover, the Service has additional priorities relating to the human use of  these natural resources, such as improving the capability of forests and  rangelands to provide products (water, timber, and minerals) and services  (recreational opportunities) and improving Service roads and facilities.", "According to Forest Service officials, a lack of resources for accelerated  research, management, and technical assistance has impeded their efforts  to be more actively involved in rapid responses. At the same time, they  emphasized that the agency works actively with APHIS and other partners  to perform risk assessments and surveys critical to eradication and control  of invasive species in national forests and in partnership on other lands.  In  commenting on a draft of our report, the Forest Service said that when  given adequate resources, it has successfully implemented rapid response  actions in full cooperation with its partners.", "A Defense official said that Defense\u2019s response to invasive species has been  minimal because it does not consider the activity to be directly related to  its mission. Although Defense is responsible for managing invasive species  on military installations, the manager acknowledged that some invasive  species are not being addressed. With many competing funding priorities,  only the most invasive plants have become rapid response priorities. The  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers also has invasive species responsibilities; it  helps manage and remove aquatic nuisance species. For example, the  Corps is authorized to implement cost\u2212sharing arrangements with state and  local governments for managing nuisance aquatic plants in waterways not  under the control of the Corps or other federal agencies.

The Council is to coordinate with other federal, state, local,  and tribal agencies in developing the program.

The explosive  growth of invasive species has been accompanied by an increased  awareness of the threat they pose and damages they cause. However,  heightened awareness has not yet resulted in a systematic national  approach to rapid response. As a result, opportunities for eradicating  potentially devastating invasive species continue to be lost.", "Currently, if an invasive species is a serious threat to agricultural crops or  livestock there is a good chance that APHIS will address it in some way.  APHIS has a process in place for evaluating new invasive species and  obtaining resources for responding to serious threats. On the other hand, if  an infestation threatens primarily natural areas, the odds of it being rapidly  responded to are significantly less. For these infestations, it is sometimes  uncertain which, if any, agency will take the lead; ready access to funds is  often a problem; and generally no one agency is held accountable if the  infestation spreads.", "At this point, it is unlikely that a single agency, such as Agriculture or  Interior, will unilaterally develop a systematic process for evaluating and  rapidly responding to invasive species that threaten natural areas. Without  specific responsibility for rapidly responding to natural area infestations  and resources to implement such a program, agencies have little impetus to  take on this responsibility. Thus, we believe that a coordinated approach  for dealing with rapid response nationwide offers the best opportunity for  ensuring that invasive species of all types will get a level of attention  commensurate with their risks.

In particular, many  agency officials are uncertain as to what types of activities should be  considered rapid response and, consequently, how much funding their  agencies devote to that activity. In order to make a convincing case for  additional legislation or resources, the Council must first define rapid  response and obtain a solid understanding of how much federal funding is  already being directed toward this activity.

Starting in January 2001, Interior (especially U.S. Geological  Survey/Biological Resources Division) and USDA, in cooperation with  the National Science Foundation and Smithsonian Institution, will  expand regional networks of invasive species databases (e.g., the Inter- American Biodiversity Information Network) and produce associated  database products, to cooperate with the Global Invasive Species  Programme and other partners to establish a global invasive species  surveillance and rapid response system.", "Actions Taken to Address Recommendation:  Interior\u2019s U.S. Geological Survey received a grant in September 2000 from  the U.S. Department of State to (1) provide technical assistance in  implementing the Inter-American Biodiversity Information Network and  (2) convene a meeting in conjunction with the Global Invasive Species  Programme and provide seed funding for regional hubs in Mexico and  South Africa. The meeting, a workshop on developing regional invasive  species information hubs, was held in February 2001. It brought together  scientists from Africa, North America, and international organizations who  are working on ways to facilitate invasive species efforts by strengthening  taxonomic services and/or information networks. 2.  By July 2003, the Council, in coordination with other federal, state,  local, and tribal agencies, will develop a program for coordinated rapid  response to incipient invasions of both natural and agricultural areas  and pursue increases in discretionary spending to support this  program.", "Actions Planned to Address Recommendation:   Establish interagency invasive species \"rapid response\" teams that  include management and scientific expertise.  Teams will focus on  taxonomic, ecosystem, and regional priorities, and coordinate with  local and state governmental and non-governmental efforts,  including standing and ad hoc state invasive species councils.", "Develop and test methods to determine which rapid response  measures are most appropriate for a situation.", "Review and propose revisions of policies and procedures (i.e.,  advance approval for quarantine actions, pesticide applications, and  other specific control techniques, and interagency agreements that  address jurisdictional and budget issues) concerning compliance  with federal (e.g., Clean Water Act, National Environmental Policy  Act, Endangered Species Act) and non-federal laws that apply to  invasive species response actions.  The proposed revisions will be  made available for public comment and will take into account local  and state requirements.", "Prepare a guide to assist rapid response teams and others that will  incorporate the methodology developed for response measures and  guidance on (1) regulatory compliance and (2) jurisdictional and  budget issues. 3.  Within fiscal year 2003 budget development, the Council, in  consultation with the states, will develop and recommend to the  President draft legislation for rapid responses to incipient invasions,  including the possibility of permanent funding for rapid response  efforts as well as matching grants to states in order to encourage  partnerships.  The recommended legislation will augment existing rapid  response mechanisms.", "Action Taken to Address Recommendation:  The Council is seeking recommendations from its member agencies for  nominees to a working group that will draft legislation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Summary of Agency Comments and Our Response", "paragraphs": ["The following summarizes the key points raised in the comments provided  on a draft of our report by the Departments, agencies, and Council staff and  our response, as appropriate.", "Agriculture\u2019s APHIS agreed with the need to develop criteria for what  constitutes a rapid response.  The Forest Service noted that (1) it has full  authority to respond to invasive species on national forests and in  partnership on other lands and that its response has been limited by  inadequate resources, not by lack of authority, as suggested in our report;  (2) our report does not discuss the impediments to rapid response resulting  from compliance with the National Environmental Protection Act; and (3)  regarding the statement in our conclusions that \u201ca national rapid response  system offers the best opportunity for ensuring that invasive species ...lgets  a level of attention commensurate with their risks,\u201d  Executive Order 13112  and the National Invasive Species Management Plan endorse building on  existing strengths, not creating new structures, to enhance coordination  and program response to invasive species.", "First, we agree that the Forest Service has the authority to rapidly respond  to invasive species under the conditions it described.  However, having  authority and having resources to carry out that authority are not the same  thing.  In particular, we believe that the ability to obtain resources for rapid  response is related to the centrality of invasive species to an agency\u2019s  mission.  Invasive species is one of many important Forest Service  responsibilities; however, it is not specifically identified in the Forest  Service\u2019s mission as it is for APHIS.  Second, regarding the National  Environmental Protection Act, agency officials that we interviewed during  our review had differing views on the extent to which compliance with the  act hindered rapid response, with some believing that adequate planning  could minimize the impediments and others maintaining that the act was a  major hindrance. While we agree that compliance with the act may slow  rapid response in some circumstances, we believe that any impediments it  creates are not of the magnitude of those described in our report. Finally,  we agree with the Forest Service that a national system for rapid response  should be built on existing strengths and we do not mean to imply  otherwise.  In fact, our conclusions note that the Council\u2019s plan provides a  structured framework for dealing with the treatment of invasive species  nationwide and that if its recommendations are properly implemented,  they will go a long way toward developing a systematic national approach  toward rapid response.", "Commerce said that the report was well written and accurate in its  discussion of the difficulties in rapidly responding to invasive species.    Commerce also commented on the problems posed by resource shortages.   It noted that rapid response needs in aquatic ecosystems are unpredictable;  in some years there may be no need to mount a rapid response effort and in  others, several seriously invasive species may be introduced.  Given this  variability, most of Commerce\u2019s invasive species funding is directed toward  preventing and controlling invasive species that have been identified in  advance.  Commerce further noted that a rapid response to a new,  potentially serious, infestation may require large amounts of money and  extensive reprogramming of funds committed to other priority areas.", "Interior said the report was well written and generally precise in its  observation of Interior\u2019s program efforts to support rapid response.   Interior also said that the report will focus congressional attention on the  opportunity to clarify authorities (particularly in interjurisdictional  response efforts) and consider multi-year emergency response funding for  such harmful, unpredictable invasions.  Interior also noted that (1) the  shortage of resources in the land and water management activities of the  bureaus continue to be exacerbated by broadening mission goals; (2) there  is an increasing need for technological improvements to enhance  monitoring and rapid assessment of priorities for action; (3) planning  processes have not yet been fully integrated with state and local  stakeholders into regional or statewide rapid response contingency plans;  and (4) an important aspect of assessing the true risk and cost of invasive  species on natural areas is the ability to assess economic value for wildlife  habitat and recreational losses resulting from plant infestations.  This is an  area that lags well behind agronomic assessment.", "The Invasive Species Council staff said that the report covered a high- priority area for the Council.  They further noted that the key issue  concerning rapid response is readiness and that a consistent and universal  agency complaint is that even when an infestation is detected early, the  lack of coordination and a contingency fund or funds-transfer mechanism  were major obstacles to quick action.   They added that our report\u2019s  recommendations did not reflect the need for a flexible contingency  funding mechanism.", "Regarding our first recommendation (developing criteria for what  constitutes a rapid response), the Council staff agreed that the definitions  for rapid response vary even among the Departments surveyed in our  review.   They also said that while this recommendation can be done  relatively quickly, it should not be the primary focus for the Council action  put forth in our report.  Regarding the second recommendation (developing  information on Departments\u2019 rapid response funding and the programs that  are receiving funding), the Council staff said that work on this effort is  already underway. Finally, they suggested that we recommend that the  Council fully implement the National Invasive Species Management Plan\u2019s  recommendations regarding early detection and rapid response.", "We appreciate the need that the Council staff and many agencies expressed  for additional funding and a flexible funding mechanism to rapidly address  new invasions.  Our report documents some of the consequences of the  lack of resources in addressing some invasive species.  At the same time,  we believe that the funding issue is ultimately a policy concern that is best  addressed by congressional decisionmakers in their deliberations on  national spending priorities.  Thus, we are not making a recommendation  or endorsing recommendations in the Invasive Species Management Plan  regarding the adequacy of rapid response funding or the need for a flexible  funding mechanism.  Finally, we continue to believe that before the Council  requests additional legislation or resources it must first develop criteria for  what constitutes a rapid response.  The considerable confusion regarding  this term makes it critical that Council members reach consensus on what  a rapid response is before they undertake activities to strengthen it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Gary Brown, Jacqueline Cook, Judith  Kordahl, Beverly Peterson, and Amy Webbink made key contributions to  this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ordering Information", "paragraphs": ["The first copy of each GAO report is free.
