The increase in costs reflected the combined effects of changes in actuarial assumptions; lower-than-expected rates of return on plan assets; demographic changes such as retirement, death, disability, new members, and pay increases; as well as an increase in plan benefit obligations. GAO determined that an adjustment to the judges' contribution rate was not needed because their average contribution share for the 3-year period exceeded the 50 percent minimum contribution goal specified by law.

To  satisfy our objectives, we used the normal cost rates determined by  actuarial valuations of the system for each of the 3 fiscal years. We also  examined participants\u2019 contributions, the federal government\u2019s  contribution, and other relevant information in each plan years\u2019 JSAS  actuarial valuation report. An independent accounting firm hired by the  Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AOUSC) audited the  JSAS financial and actuarial information included in the JSAS actuarial  valuation reports, with input from the plan\u2019s actuary regarding relevant  data, such as the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits. The  plan\u2019s actuary certified those amounts that are included in the JSAS  actuarial valuation reports. We discussed the contents of the JSAS  actuarial valuation reports with officials from AOUSC for the 3 plan years  (2005 through 2007).", "In addition, we discussed with the plan\u2019s actuary the actuarial assumptions  made to project future benefits of the plan.

We determined  that the use of 0.0 percent salary increase for the JSAS is reasonable, and  consistent with a recent trend analysis we performed on judicial pay  plans. We also reviewed the qualifications of the plan\u2019s actuary who  prepared the JSAS actuarial valuation reports for plan years 2005 to 2007  and nothing came to our attention that would lead us to question the  qualifications of the actuary.

Judges may elect coverage within 6 months of taking office, 6 months after  getting married, if they were not married when they took office, 6 months  after being elevated to a higher court, or during an open season authorized  by statute. Active and senior judges currently contribute 2.2 percent of  their salaries to JSAS, and retired judges contribute 3.5 percent of their  retirement salaries to JSAS. Upon a judge\u2019s death, the surviving spouse is  to receive an annual annuity that equals 1.5 percent of the judge\u2019s average  annual salary during the 3 highest consecutive paid years (commonly  known as the high-3) times the judge\u2019s years of creditable service. The  annuity may not exceed 50 percent of the high-3 and is guaranteed to be  no less than 25 percent. Separately, an unmarried dependent child under  age 18, or 22 if a full-time student, receives a survivor annuity that is equal  to 10 percent of the judge\u2019s high-3 or 20 percent of the judges\u2019 high-3  divided by the number of eligible children, whichever is smaller. JSAS  annuitants receive an annual adjustment in their annuities at the same  time, and by the same percentage, as any cost-of-living adjustment (COLA)  received by CSRS annuitants. Spouses and children are also eligible for  Social Security survivor benefits.", "Since its inception in 1956, JSAS has been amended several times. Because  of concern that too few judges were participating in the plan, Congress  made broad reforms effective in 1986 with the Judicial Improvements Act  of 1985. The 1985 act (1) increased the annuity formula for surviving  spouses from 1.25 percent to the current 1.5 percent of the high-3 for each  year of creditable service and (2) changed the provisions for surviving  child benefits to relate benefit amounts to judges\u2019 high-3 rather than the  specific dollar amounts provided in 1976 by the Judicial Survivors\u2019  Annuities Reform Act. In recognition of the significant benefit  improvements that were made, the 1985 act increased the amounts that  judges were required to contribute from 4.5 percent to 5 percent of their  salaries, including retirement salaries.", "The 1985 act also changed the requirements for government contributions  to the plan. Under the 1976 Judicial Survivors\u2019 Annuities Reform Act, the  government matched the judges\u2019 contributions of 4.5 percent of salaries  and retirement salaries. The 1985 act modified this by specifying that the  government would contribute the amounts necessary to fund any  remaining cost over the future lifetime of current participants. That  amount is limited to 9 percent of total covered salary each year.", "In response to concerns that required contributions of 5 percent may have  created a disincentive to participate, Congress enacted the Federal Courts  Administration Act of 1992. Under this act, participants\u2019 contribution  requirements were reduced to 2.2 percent of salaries for active and senior  judges and 3.5 percent of retirement salaries for retired judges. The 1992  act also significantly increased benefits for survivors of retired judges.  This increase was accomplished by including years spent in retirement in  the calculation of creditable service and the high-3 salary averages.  Additionally, the 1992 act allowed judges to stop contributing to the plan if  they ceased to be married and granted benefits to survivors of any judge  who died in the interim between leaving office and the commencement of  a deferred annuity.", "As of September 30, 2007, there were 1,303 active and senior judges, 223  retired judges, and 333 survivor annuitants covered under JSAS, according  to the JSAS actuarial valuation report for plan year 2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Calculation of Federal Share", "paragraphs": ["JSAS is financed by judges\u2019 contributions and direct appropriations in an  amount estimated to be sufficient to fund the future benefits paid to  survivors of current and deceased participants.

The normal cost rate is the level percentage of future salaries that  will be sufficient, along with investment earnings and the plan\u2019s assets, to  pay the plan\u2019s benefits for current participants and beneficiaries. Normal  cost calculations are estimates and require that many actuarial  assumptions be made about the future, including, but not limited to  mortality rates, turnover rates, and returns on investment, salary  increases, and COLA increases over the life spans of current participants  and beneficiaries. There are many acceptable actuarial methods for  calculating normal cost. Regardless of which cost method is chosen, the  expected total long-term cost of the plan should be the same; however,  year-to-year costs may differ, depending on the cost method used. The  expected annual federal, actuarially recommended contribution is the  product of the federal government\u2019s contribution rate and the participating  judges\u2019 salaries.

The difference  between these amounts, $157,839,846, must be financed through future  contributions to be paid by the participating judges and the federal  government. Using the same assumptions as used to estimate the present  value of future benefits, the actuary estimated the present value of  participating judges\u2019 future salaries to be $3,078,464,410 so that the  amount to be financed represented 5.13% ($157,839,846 divided by  $3,078,464,410) of the future participating judges\u2019 salaries. This percentage  is the JSAS\u2019s normal cost rate.

The  JSAS\u2019s actuary also estimated the present value of participating judges\u2019  future contributions to be $78,123,909. Thus the federal government\u2019s  share for plan year 2007 is the difference between $157,839,846 and  $78,123,909, or $79,715,937.", "Federal government\u2019s actuarially recommended contribution rate.

For the plan year 2007 the rate was 2.59% ($79,715,937  divided by $3,078,464,410).
