The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) plays a key role in guiding federal human capital initiatives, including the implementation of work/life programs. As requested, GAO determined the extent to which: (1) OPM provides assistance and guidance to federal agencies for establishing and enhancing work/life programs; (2) OPM or the federal agencies track, evaluate, or modify work/life programs; and (3) OPM has identified leading practices in the private sector for the implementation of work/life programs and shared this information with federal agencies. To do this, GAO reviewed OPM policy and guidance; surveyed 40 federal officials--20 Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO) and 20 work/life managers; and interviewed officials from seven private sector companies recognized for the quality of their work/life programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["OPM's Office of Work/Life/Wellness is available to federal agencies to provide assistance, guidance, and information as agencies develop and implement work/life programs. For example, OPM has established formal working groups, sponsored training for agency officials, promulgated regulations to implement work/life programs, and provided informal guidance to agencies that address issues related to these programs. Of the 33 agency officials who responded to GAO's survey, 24 indicated that OPM's assistance, guidance, and information sharing greatly helped or helped somewhat in implementing work/life programs. Another six agency officials indicated that OPM's assistance, guidance, and information sharing helped in some cases and hindered in others. OPM tracks and collects information on a few work/life programs across the federal government, including health and wellness programs which it recently began tracking in response to a White House initiative. Some federal agencies independently provide OPM with evaluations on other work/life programs. However, when asked, OPM officials said that they did not track or maintain an inventory of these evaluations nor review these evaluations due to the lack of time and available resources. Tracking, analyzing, and sharing information among federal agencies on the effect of work/life programs on agency-intended goals could be helpful for individual agency decision making in a budget-constrained environment. To follow up on the White House health and wellness initiative, OPM held several meetings and conferences with representatives from private sector companies to discuss their health and wellness programs and the effect of these programs on recruitment and retention. Although OPM has developed a health and wellness pilot program based on some of the information obtained from these meetings and conferences, OPM has not systematically shared with federal agencies other information about the private sector's health and wellness programs or other work/life programs. GAO also interviewed officials from seven private sector companies recognized for the quality of their work/life programs to identify leading practices in implementing private sector work/life programs. Private sector officials from four of the seven companies that GAO interviewed indicated that their programs have been effective in increasing employee job satisfaction, resulting in improved recruitment, retention, and workforce productivity. Systematically collecting and disseminating information on the implementation and evaluation of private sector work/life programs could help federal agencies compare their work/life programs with leading practices in the private sector."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OPM assist agencies in implementing their work/life programs by more systematically tracking and evaluating data on the implementation and evaluation of work/life programs and sharing this information with federal agencies.

For example, OPM promotes human capital leading practices  across federal agencies and conducts audits of human capital management  within the federal government to ensure compliance with laws,  regulations, and policies. To promote coordination among agencies  outside of Washington, D.C., OPM works with Federal Executive Boards  (FEB) to share guidance and leading practices and obtain feedback from  federal agencies on human capital issues. OPM also coordinates its efforts  through its involvement in the CHCO Council, which was established to  advise and coordinate the human capital activities of its members\u2019  agencies.

However, OPM is potentially missing  opportunities to provide federal agencies with additional information that  may be useful to agencies in their efforts to develop and implement  work/life programs. While OPM has limited its collection and evaluation of  federal work/life programs to only a few, some federal agencies are  independently tracking and collecting work/life program usage data on a  wider range of programs such as alternative work schedules and employee  assistance programs. The agencies are also using these data to conduct  assessments of these programs and use the results to make programmatic  changes. Sharing data among agencies on the effect of work/life programs  on agency-intended goals could be helpful for agency decision making in a  budget-constrained environment. OPM officials said that they did not track  or maintain an inventory of these evaluations nor review these  evaluations. OPM officials said that the recent addition of staff to the  Office of Work/Life/Wellness will enable them to review reports they may  receive in the future.", "OPM\u2019s Office of Work/Life/Wellness has met with private sector company  representatives to examine private sector health and wellness programs  and the leading practices used to implement those programs, however the  office does not systematically collect information on other private sector  work/life programs. A more systematic approach for examining how  work/life programs have been implemented and evaluated in public and  private sector organizations, as well as making this information more  readily available, could benefit federal agencies\u2019 own efforts to establish  work/life programs. In keeping with its mission to help federal agencies in  their human capital management efforts, OPM can play a key role in the  collection and dissemination of this type of information. Additionally, by  adopting this role, OPM can make progress on its strategic goal of  providing the agencies with various options that could be used to ensure  that their agencies\u2019 work/life program offerings are aligned with leading  practices identified in the public and private sector."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Director of OPM, working with the CHCO  Council, identify the resources, steps, and timetable necessary to complete  the following three actions:  (1) track on a more systematic basis information already being  collected by individual federal agencies on their work/life  programs, such as program usage data and evaluations;  (2) evaluate the results of work/life program surveys conducted by  leading private sector organizations, as stated in OPM\u2019s 2010-2015  strategic plan, that could help federal agencies as they implement  their work/life programs; and  (3) provide the information from both the public and private sectors,  including other comprehensive evaluations produced by academic  institutions, state entities, and other organizations, to agency  officials\u2014through available avenues such as the CHCO Council  and federal executive boards\u2014that could help them address  work/life program issues and determine if the work/life programs  are meeting their agencies\u2019 goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Director of OPM for review and  comment. OPM provided written comments which are reproduced in  appendix III.

OPM also provided technical comments  which we incorporated as appropriate.", "OPM concurred with our recommendation that OPM evaluate the results  of work/life program surveys conducted by leading private sector  organizations. However, OPM cautioned that there are enough differences  between private and public sector motivations and cultures that a direct  comparison of policies and practices may not provide federal agencies  with a comprehensive set of \u201cready-to-use\u201d solutions as they implement  their work/life programs. Also, OPM does not want to appear to selectively  endorse leading practices in the private sector as solutions for  implementing federal work/life programs. We agree with OPM that some  leading private sector practices may not be applicable to federal agencies  and that OPM should not appear to selectively endorse leading private  sector practices. However, we do believe that communicating these  leading practices without endorsing them could provide federal agencies  with additional information that federal agency officials could use in  implementing their work/life programs. We revised the recommendation to  reflect our agreement with OPM.", "OPM also concurred with our recommendation that OPM provide  information from both the public and private sector to agency officials that  could help the agency officials address work/life program issues and  determine if these programs are meeting the agencies\u2019 goals. However,  they asked that we add other evaluations of public and private work/life  programs published by academic institutions, state entities, and other  organizations such as the Sloan Foundation. We agree with OPM\u2019s  assessment that other available evaluations of public and private sector  work/life programs could provide information to federal agency officials  as they implement work/life programs.

Our requesters  asked us to determine the extent to which  (1) OPM provides assistance and guidance to federal agencies for  establishing and enhancing work/life programs;  (2) OPM or the federal agencies track, evaluate, or refine work/life  (3) OPM has identified leading practices in the private sectors for the  implementation of work/life programs and shared this information  with federal agencies.", "In order to address the first two objectives, we designed and administered  a Web-based survey (see app. II for a copy of our questionnaire and survey  results). The survey was conducted using a self-administered electronic  questionnaire which was sent to a nonprobability sample consisting of 20  Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO) at selected federal departments or  agencies who also serve as members of the CHCO Council. The same  Web-based survey was also sent to a separate nonprobability sample of 20  work/life program managers from subcomponents of these departments or  agencies. The purpose of the survey was to obtain respondents\u2019  perceptions on behalf of their departments or agencies of OPM\u2019s  assistance, guidance, and information sharing during a one-year period.  Because a portion of the survey focused on agency perceptions of OPM\u2019s  assistance, we excluded OPM\u2019s CHCO from our sample. Additionally,  because we intended the survey respondents to speak on behalf of their  department or agency, we excluded two CHCO Council members who  serve as proxies for numerous federal agencies, specifically one member  representing small federal agencies and another member representing  federal national security and intelligence agencies. Also included in the  survey questionnaire were questions designed to obtain information on  how these agencies track, evaluate, and modify their own work/life  programs. Table 3 lists the federal departments selected for our survey and  the number of respondents who completed our survey.", "We pretested the survey instrument with representatives from two federal  agencies during June and July 2010 and administered the survey to our  selected respondents from July through September 2010.", "The practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce errors,  commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For example, difficulties in  how a particular question is interpreted, in the sources of information that  are available to respondents, or in how the survey data are analyzed can  all introduce unwanted variability into survey results. To minimize such  nonsampling errors, a social science survey specialist designed the  questionnaire, in collaboration with GAO staff that had subject matter  expertise. As indicated above, the questionnaire was pretested to ensure  that the questions were relevant, clearly stated, and easy to comprehend.  When data were analyzed, an independent analyst reviewed the computer  program used for the analysis of the survey data. Since this was a Web- based survey, respondents entered their answers directly into the  electronic questionnaire, thereby eliminating the need to have the data  keyed into a database and avoiding data entry errors. The results of our  survey are not generalizable to all agency officials or to all agencies  because they are based on a nonprobability sample. Also, for those agency  officials responding that their agencies evaluate their work/life programs,  we did not independently determine whether or how well they actually  evaluate their work/life programs.", "We reviewed past GAO human capital reports on issues dealing with  work/life programs. We also interviewed OPM work/life officials to obtain  OPM\u2019s description of its role in interacting with federal agencies as they  develop and implement work/life programs. This included reviewing  OPM\u2019s A New Day for Federal Service: Strategic Plan 2010-2015, its  2006-2010 strategic plan; past OPM reports on work/life programs; and  available written policy, guidance, and directives. We also visited the  agency\u2019s Web site to examine the material available to federal agencies  and employees on work/life assistance, guidance, and identification of  leading practices.", "In order to address our third objective on the identification of some  leading practices in the private sector, we reviewed publicly available  information sources to identify private sector companies that are leaders  and award winners in providing work/life programs to their workforces.  The awards are based on the types of work/life programs offered and the  diversity of the company\u2019s workforce. Some of the awards include    Fortune Magazine, \u201cBest Places to Work\u201d\u2014includes separate awards  for work/life balance, child care, telecommuting, and unusual perks  (2009);    AARP, \u201cBest Employers\u201d (2008);    Working Mother\u2019s Magazine, \u201c100 Best Companies\u201d (2008);    Alfred Sloan Awards for Business Excellence in Workplace Flexibility  (2005, 2006);    Latina Style, \u201c50 Special Report\u201d (2008);    Black Enterprise, \u201c40 Best Companies for Diversity\u201d (2009); and    Diversity Inc., Top 50 (2009).", "After reviewing these information sources, we identified 17 companies  that received multiple awards from the sources we reviewed, based on a  process of weighting the awards received. Out of the 17 companies that we  reviewed, 7 agreed to be interviewed. The companies that we interviewed  represented 6 of the 7 industry categories that we identified.

We also asked the officials to describe  how their companies track, evaluate, and modify their work/life programs  and how this information is used to make decisions about their work/life  programs. Also, for those private sector company officials responding that  their companies evaluate their work/life programs, we did not  independently determine whether or how well they actually evaluate their  work/life programs. However, these seven companies are not  representative of all private sector companies and therefore, we cannot  generalize the information these private sector officials provided about  their work/life programs to other private sector companies.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2009 through  December 2010 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.
