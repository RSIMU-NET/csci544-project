The resulting  leasing decisions negatively impacted the CFTC\u2019s space utilization and  resulted in inefficient use of limited government resources. Federal  standards for internal control call for agencies to identify and analyze  relevant risks associated with achieving agencies\u2019 objectives. According  to these standards, management needs to comprehensively identify risks  and should consider all significant interactions between the entity and  other parties as well as internal factors at both the entity-wide and activity  level, including considering economic conditions. Although CFTC\u2019s  leasing decisions from fiscal years 2009 to 2012 significantly increased its  space, CFTC could not provide us with an analysis of risks related to  these decisions.

In the Chicago and New York regional offices, CFTC also  increased leased space\u2014adding approximately 20,000 square feet in  Chicago and 22,000 square feet in New York.

Figure 1 also shows that this period was followed by 5 years of  appropriations less than the amount requested. Therefore, the CFTC  could not expand its staff at a rate that would allow for full utilization of the  additional leased space. On average, the agency received about 109  percent of the funding it requested in fiscal years 2009 and 2010 and  about 76 percent of its requests from fiscal years 2011 through 2015.", "Figure 1 illustrates that\u2013\u2013while not always granting CFTC\u2019s full funding  request\u2013\u2013Congress increased funding in nominal terms for CFTC every  year from fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2015\u2013\u2013with the exception of  fiscal year 2013 when funding declined slightly. In other words, CFTC\u2019s  fiscal year 2015 appropriations represent an increase of nearly $138  million, or about 123 percent, when compared to fiscal year 2008. The  amount CFTC allocated versus the amount it requested for staff follows a  similar pattern. In fiscal years 2009 and 2010, based on its higher than  requested appropriation, CFTC hired more staff than it had anticipated. In  the following 5 fiscal years, with a lower appropriation, it hired fewer staff  than requested. CFTC, on average, hired about 13 percent less staff than  it originally requested between fiscal year 2008 and fiscal year 2015 (see  fig. 2).", "CFTC federal employee staffing increased in absolute terms by about 53  percent from fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2015, according to  CFTC data (see table 2 below). Moreover, CFTC greatly expanded the  number of on-site contractors it employs, an increase of about 324  percent during the same period. According to CFTC, since commodity  futures\u2019 trading is increasingly electronic and data intensive, most of the  CFTC\u2019s on-site contractors are involved with operating and maintaining  CFTC\u2019s electronic data systems. This increase also reflects the $35 to  $55 million Congress set aside for the purchase of information technology  in the appropriations for fiscal years 2012, 2014 and 2015. When CFTC\u2019s  employees and on-site contractors are combined, aggregate agency  staffing increased from 549 to 1006, or more than 80 percent, from fiscal  years 2008 through 2015.

According to CFTC officials, the only effective option to  cease paying for the vacant space in Kansas City involves negotiating  with the landlord to return the space. The landlord agreed to try to lease  the vacant floor; however, there has been limited interest thus far, and  CFTC continues to pay rent on the vacant space.", "In our review of CFTC leases, we found that all of the leases include  provisions for subleasing space. CFTC officials told us that the agency  was only authorized to enter into subleases in circumstances where the  sublease would further the purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act.  According to CFTC, subleasing the space in a manner that furthers the  purposes of the Act would, as a practical matter, be very difficult to  accomplish.", "The CFTC\u2019s OIG released additional reports in 2015 that found  underutilized space in the Chicago and New York City Regional offices  but not nearly to the extent found in the Kansas City Regional Office.

The Chicago office currently utilizes about 88 percent of its space  (see fig. 3). With regard to the New York City Regional Office, the OIG  recommended that CFTC sublet or negotiate returning the additional  space it leased beginning in fiscal year 2012. Our analysis of CFTC data  found that space utilization in the New York City office, similar to the  Chicago office, also improved as staff increased (including contractors)  from 80 to 91, or nearly 14 percent, from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year  2015. When we visited the New York City office in January 2016, we  observed vacant offices, some of which were unfinished, unventilated,  and not adjacent to one another. As of the end of fiscal year 2015, the  New York City office had a utilization rate of 68 percent (see fig. 3).

CFTC used TIA to complete  improvements and alterations to the CFTC office space in Washington,  D.C., Chicago, New York, and Kansas City, as well as to cover such  costs as architectural expenses, furnishings, equipment, cabling, and  moving expenses for the CFTC offices. In addition, under the terms of  certain leases, unused portion of the TIA could be converted to rental  abatement and then used to offset rental payments. For example, the  Kansas City Regional Office lease sets the TIA at $35 per rentable  square foot. According to our analysis, at this rate, $852,670 was  available for tenant improvements, and for this particular lease, any  amount not expended in the first 6 months was available as a rebate  against the rent expense.

However, CFTC has not calculated the complete analysis  of potential costs and benefits of relocating offices. Without this type of  analysis, CFTC cannot make fully informed decisions about the cost-  effectiveness of relocating its offices in the near term nor fully assess  alternatives available to improve its space utilization."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Teleworking", "paragraphs": ["According to a 2011 GSA study, federal agencies and private sector  organizations have been forced to continuously evaluate their current  workspace utilization. The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 required  the head of each executive agency to establish and implement a telework  policy for eligible employees and requires the Office of Personnel  Management to assist agencies in establishing appropriate qualitative  and quantitative measures and teleworking goals. GSA\u2019s study states  that federal agencies\u2019 expanded use of telework could reduce their real  estate footprint and real estate costs. With wireless communication tools,  such as smart phones and wireless networking available, federal  agencies and private organizations have turned to alternative work  environments with the potential to reduce workspace costs and optimize  physical workspace. OMB\u2019s National Strategy notes that employee  telework, among other things, has resulted in a need for less space. For  example, we found in 2013 that some agencies, such as GSA and the  U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Forest Service, have adopted \u201coffice  hoteling arrangements,\u201d a practice of providing office space to employees  on an as-needed basis. This reduces the need for an additional amount of  physical space that an agency needs to purchase or rent. Specifically,  GSA implemented a hoteling program for all employees that allowed it to  eliminate the need for additional leased space at four locations in the  Washington, D.C., area, resulting in projected savings of approximately  $25 million in annual lease payments and about a 38 percent reduction in  needed office space. Further, the U.S. Forest Service uses hoteling,  among other alternative workplace arrangements, to save an estimated  $5 million in annual rent.", "Currently, 77 percent of CFTC employees have agreements for either  recurring or episodic telework (see table 4).", "According to GSA\u2019s study, the average workspace typically costs  between $10,000 and $15,000 annually per person. Eliminating 100  workspaces, for example, could conceivably save an organization over $1  million a year. While CFTC officials told us that they do need an on-site  presence in certain cases, such as for oversight and enforcement  activities, since commodity futures trading is now wholly electronic,  according to CFTC officials, increased teleworking could be a possible  alternative to reduce CFTC\u2019s rental space costs in future leases. CFTC  officials said that their current policy allows for recurring telework 1 to 2  days every 2 weeks but have not assessed the option of increasing  telework and reducing leased space as current leases expire and are  renewed. However, CFTC officials said they have efforts under way to  consider what policy makes sense for their operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consolidating the Kansas City and Chicago Regional Offices", "paragraphs": ["OMB\u2019s National Strategy states that a key step in improving real property  management is to reduce the size of the inventory by prioritizing actions  to consolidate, co-locate, and dispose of properties. As discussed, the  Kansas City regional office currently has 31 staff working in office space  that accommodates 72. In addition, the Kansas City Board of Trade  merged with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 2012. According to  CFTC officials, the Kansas City Board of Trade only traded futures and  options for one product (hard-red winter wheat) during all or substantially  all the period from fiscal years 2008 through 2012. The majority of  Kansas City CFTC staff are involved with enforcement, swap dealer and  intermediary oversight, and market oversight\u2013\u2013similar to the staff in the  Chicago office. Further, the Chicago Regional Office also has  underutilized office space and, according to our analysis, could possibly  accommodate staff from the Kansas City office.

As noted  above, for the Kansas City regional office, CFTC officials have said that  they have been unable to return their unused space.

CFTC stated that it intends  to review its procedures to address the recommendation and to ensure  that the agency makes cost-effective decisions. In addition, CFTC noted  that its staff will engage the General Services Administration (GSA)  regarding how the two agencies can work together to better leverage  GSA's leasing expertise in addressing current leasing issues and  assessing future space requirements.

To identify leading government practices and guidance on  leasing, we reviewed GAO reports on real property and held discussions  with GSA officials. To identify requirements applicable to CFTC leasing,  we reviewed federal laws, and regulations. To address the extent to  which CFTC followed leading government practices and guidance for  leasing additional space, we reviewed and analyzed CFTC\u2019s strategic  plans, lease procurement policies, and space-planning documents  covering fiscal years 2008 through 2015. We also reviewed, analyzed and  evaluated the extent to which CFTC\u2019s leasing practice aligned with: the  Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) National Strategy for the  Efficient Use of Property, (National Strategy) its Reduce the Footprint  policy; GSA\u2019s leasing practices and guidance on lease procurement and  pricing; and evaluated the extent that CFTC leasing processes were  consistent with the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government. In addition, we also reviewed and analyzed relevant CFTC\u2019s  Office of Inspector General (OIG) reports on space utilization among  three of the four CFTC offices. We also obtained and analyzed CFTC  data on lease payments, rentable square feet (rsf) and lease expansions,  and CFTC\u2019s staffing history.", "To assess the reliability of CFTC data, we determined which CFTC data  were derived from computerized data systems, interviewed cognizant  CFTC officials about these systems, and reviewed system  documentation. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of our report. To determine costs per rsf, we divided the  lease costs for each CFTC office by its total rentable square footage for  fiscal years 2008 through 2015. To determine the impact of CFTC\u2019s  excess space on its utilization, we converted the leased space from rsf to  useable square feet (usf). We calculated the average rsf per staff member  (including CFTC employees and on-site contractors) for fiscal years 2008  through 2010\u2013\u2013the period before CFTC expanded existing or entered into  new leases\u2014and then determined the conversion factor to align this  average with the 300 usf per staff member cited in CFTC\u2019s 2009 Program  of Requirements. Using this factor (21.17 percent), we calculated the  average usf per staff member for fiscal years 2011 through 2015\u2013\u2013the  period after CFTC expanded existing or added new leases. To determine  how CFTC lease costs compare to the average cost per rsf of other  federal agencies leasing space in commercial buildings in the four  markets where CFTC offices are located, we analyzed data from GSA\u2019s  lease inventory for fiscal years 2013 through 2015\u2013\u2013the years for which  these data are available. We combined the monthly GSA lease inventory  reports into fiscal years and then sorted the data by leases by state and  county matching those where CFTC maintains offices. Next, to better  approximate CFTC leases, we sorted the data to include only those  offices that were 100 percent office space and \u201cfully serviced,\u201d before  dividing rsf by lease costs to determine the cost per square foot for each  lease. We then sorted the leases by size to approximate the size range of  CFTC leases and by location to include only the cities in which CFTC  maintains offices.", "To illustrate how CFTC lease costs may compare to the private sector,  we analyzed data from the Building Owners and Managers Association  (BOMA). Specifically, using BOMA\u2019s Experience Exchange Report (EER)  survey data for the four markets, we sorted the data to include privately  owned buildings within the city limits where CFTC maintains offices and  choose the BOMA average cost per rsf for Office Rent Income category.  We confirmed with BOMA officials that \u201cOffice Rent Income\u201d from the  building owners\u2019 perspective was the equivalent of cost per rsf from the  tenant perspective. BOMA\u2019s EER survey data have not yet been compiled  for fiscal year 2015. To assess the reliability of these data, we interviewed  GSA and BOMA officials about how they collect and maintain the data, as  well as the completeness of the data, and we determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report. However, BOMA  does not collect EER survey data in a way that allows for an assessment  of survey coverage, that is, there is no information available to measure  the percentage of buildings in any given market that are included in the  data, nor is there any information available to measure the extent to  which particular types of buildings may be under-or over-represented.  Therefore, the measures of lease cost per square foot resulting from  BOMA\u2019s EER survey data are not generalizable to other buildings in  those markets for which no BOMA survey data were reported. However,  when reporting measures of cost per square foot from the BOMA EER  survey data, we include the number of buildings with reportable data from  which the measure was derived. We attempted to use Federal Real  Property Profile (FRPP) data to determine per-square-foot lease costs  between fiscal years 2008 through 2014, but based on our analysis of the  data and meetings with GSA, we determined that the data were  unsuitable for that purpose.", "To identify what potential options exist that CFTC could consider towards  improving the cost-effectiveness of future lease procurement, we  reviewed and analyzed CFTC\u2019s legal authority to lease properties. We  also obtained and analyzed CFTC leases and conducted site visits at  each of the four offices (Washington, D.C., headquarters, (Kansas City,  MO; Chicago, IL; and New York, NY). We interviewed CFTC officials at  CFTC Headquarters and all of the regional offices about their business  processes, staffing, and space procurement planning and management  procedures. Additionally, we interviewed CFTC Office of Inspector  General (OIG) officials about their findings and ongoing reviews on CFTC  space utilization. Furthermore, we interviewed GSA officials to  understand their perspectives on lease procurement, including those by  agencies with independent leasing authority. Using our analysis of CFTC  leases, space procurement planning documents, policies and procedures,  our interviews with agency officials, along with our review of a current  presidential memorandum, OMB real property management initiatives  and GSA leasing guidance, we identified several potential options CFTC  may consider to improve the cost-effectiveness of its lease portfolio.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2015 to April 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
