Through discussions with budget experts and by working with two case studies, the Departments of Agriculture and of the Interior, we are able to describe in this report (1) how CAFs would likely operate, (2) the potential benefits and difficulties of CAFs, including alternative mechanisms for obtaining the benefits, and (3) several issues to weigh when considering implementation of CAFs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Capital acquisition funds (CAF) have been suggested as department-level funds that would use appropriated up-front borrowing authority to buy new departmental subunit assets.

If existing capital assets were transferred to the CAF, subunits would pay an annual capital usage charge to the CAF. CAFs might achieve the goals intended, but these goals can be achieved through simpler means. Alternative mechanisms, such as asset management systems, cost accounting systems, and working capital funds may achieve the goal of allocating annual capital costs and improving decision making for capital assets. Our case study agencies generally did not indicate problems with budget authority spikes. They budget in useful segments, use accumulated no-year authority, or finance capital assets using working capital funds. Many concerns about CAFs were raised, including the long-term feasibility of making fixed annual mortgage payments and the added complexity CAFs would create. Implementation would raise a number of issues. If CAFs were applied only to new assets going forward, all programs would not reflect the full annual cost of capital for decades. Yet the difficulties of including existing capital are numerous. Even if these issues were tackled, there is little assurance that CAFs alone would create new incentives for programs to reassess their use of capital since CAF payments would not affect the deficit. Implementation issues could overwhelm the potential benefits of a CAF. More importantly, current efforts under way in agencies would reflect asset costs as part of program costs without introducing the difficulties of a CAF. As long as alternative efforts uphold the principle of up-front funding, CAFs do not seem to be worth the implementation challenges they would create.

We then presented a  detailed description of CAFs to officials at the Departments of Agriculture  (USDA) and of the Interior (DOI) and some of their agencies. We obtained  their insights and opinions on the applicability of the mechanism at their  agencies and on how CAFs might compare to their current practices for  financing capital assets. We also spoke with Department of the Treasury  (Treasury) and General Services Administration (GSA) officials and  congressional staff to gain their perspective on CAFs.

Large sums of taxpayer funds are spent on these assets, and  their performance affects how well agencies achieve their missions. To  directly acquire an asset, agencies generally are required to have full up- front BA for the total asset cost\u2014usually a sizable amount. This  requirement allows Congress to recognize the full budgetary impact of  capital spending at the time a commitment is made; however, it also means  that the full cost of an asset must be absorbed in the annual budget of an agency or program, despite the fact that benefits may accrue over many  years. This up-front funding requirement has presented two challenges for  capital planning and budgeting at the federal level.", "One challenge is how to permit \u201cfull cost\u201d analysis and to promote more  effective capital planning and budgeting by allocating capital costs on an  annual basis to programs that use capital. Allocating capital costs over the  assets\u2019 useful lives ensures that the full annual cost of resources a program  uses is considered when evaluating the program\u2019s effectiveness. It can  make program managers more aware of on-going capital costs, thus  promoting more effective decision making for capital. It may also  contribute to equalizing comparisons across different programs or different  approaches to achieving similar goals.", "A second challenge is how to address the possible bias against the  acquisition of necessary capital assets that may be created by spikes (large,  temporary, year-to-year increases in BA), which can make capital assets  seem prohibitively expensive in an era of resource constraints. GAO has  reported in the past that agencies view up-front funding as an impediment  to capital acquisition because of the resulting spike in BA. CAFs have  been suggested as a capital asset financing approach that would benefit  federal departments and their subunits by addressing both of these  challenges. CAFs would be department-level funds that use annually  appropriated authority to borrow from the Treasury to purchase federally- owned assets needed by subunits of the department. These subunits  would then pay the CAF a mortgage payment sufficient to cover the  principal and interest payment on the Treasury loan. The CAF would use  those receipts only to repay Treasury and not to finance new assets.", "The CAF concept was formally proposed in the February 1999 Report of the  President\u2019s Commission to Study Capital Budgeting as a mechanism  that would help improve the process by which annual budget decisions are  made by promoting better planning and budgeting of capital expenditures  for federally owned facilities. The report states that by ensuring that  individual programs are charged the true cost of using capital assets, the  CAF encourages managers to make more efficient use of those assets. The  Commission report also argues that CAFs could help smooth out the spikes  in BA experienced by subunits with capital project requests. By aggregating  all up-front BA for capital requests at the department level, subunit budgets  would reflect only an annual payment for capital. Since the Commission  report, CBO, GAO, and the National Research Council (NRC) have all  agreed that CAFs should be explored as a capital financing mechanism.", "CAFs were also discussed in the President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2004 Budget  issued in February 2003. The section on \u201cBudget and Performance  Integration\u201d briefly described the concept and reports that draft legislation  creating CAFs has been developed, discussed with agencies, and improved.  It said that CAFs would be one way to show the uniform annual cost for the  use of capital without changing the requirement for up-front  appropriations. At this time, OMB\u2019s interest in CAFs appears to have  waned.

In addition, we spoke with officials at GSA to discuss  how a CAF might affect the FBF, used by some federal agencies to acquire  federal office space and the FTS, used by some federal agencies to  acquire IT.", "Finally, we reviewed agency documents including asset management plans,  accounting system descriptions, capitalization policies, and working  capital fund information.

The management and oversight responsibilities of the  departments would need to be clearly spelled out in order for CAFs to  operate effectively.

CAFs would be established at the department level as separate  accounts that would receive up-front authority to borrow (provided in  appropriation acts) on a project-by-project basis, for the construction and  acquisition of large capital projects for all of the subunits within a  department. For those departments with subunits split between two  appropriation subcommittees, it is likely that two CAFs would be  necessary. For example, DOI receives appropriations through two  subcommittees:  the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee, which  is responsible for Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) programs; and the  Interior and Related Agencies Subcommittee, which is responsible for all  other Interior programs. CBO, OMB, and agency officials we spoke with  generally believed that having a CAF that crossed subcommittee  jurisdictions would create many problems, thus it would likely be  necessary for departments to have a separate CAF for each subcommittee  with which they work. Using the example above, DOI would have one CAF  for Reclamation and a second for the remaining subunits within DOI.  Alternatively, CAFs could be situated at the appropriation subcommittee  level rather than the department level, with each of the 13 subcommittees  appropriating to their respective CAF for the agencies under their  jurisdiction. Some congressional officials did not seem to think that this  would be the most effective arrangement and raised the point that  increased resources might be needed at the subcommittee level to manage  CAF transactions. In addition, OMB argued that CAFs should be located at  the department level because the department is the focus of accountability  for planning and managing programs and capital assets, as well as for  budget execution and financial reporting.", "The CAF would receive appropriations for the full cost of an asset (or  useful segment of an asset) in the form of borrowing authority. Like all BA,  the borrowing authority for each CAF-financed project would specify the  purpose, amount, and duration of the authority. Unless the asset is to be  available for use in the same fiscal year, the subunit itself would receive no  appropriations. The CAF would use its authority to borrow from the  Treasury\u2019s general fund to acquire the asset for the subunit. When the asset  became usable, the subunit would begin to pay the CAF an amount equal to  a mortgage payment consisting of interest and principle. These equal  annual payments would consist of the principal amortized over the useful  life of the asset and include interest charges at a rate determined by  Treasury (based on the average interest rate on marketable Treasury  securities of comparable maturity). The CAF would use these mortgage  payments to repay Treasury for the funds borrowed plus interest. Unlike a  revolving fund, the mortgage payments collected by the CAF would be used  only to repay Treasury and could not be used to finance new assets.", "For each project funded through the CAF, the subunit\u2019s annual budget  request would need to include the annual mortgage payment in each year,  for the useful life of the asset (or until the asset was sold or transferred).  The subunit would need annual appropriations for these payments, along  with its other operating expenses. On the basis of our discussions, we  conclude that the appropriations from which the payments are made would  be discretionary as opposed to mandatory. They would not be provided as a  line item for mortgage payments to the CAF, but would be part of the  subunit\u2019s total appropriation. While the subunit would be required to make  the annual payment, there would be no guarantee that Congress would  include the additional amounts to cover the payment in the subunit\u2019s  appropriation.", "At some point, the mortgage on an asset would be \u201cpaid off.\u201d However, if  annual capital usage charges on existing capital were established,  payments would continue, although the amount of the payments would  depend on the method used to calculate the charges for existing capital.

Treasury officials  recommended that OMB establish guidelines to specify the useful life of  capital assets so departments would abide by an appropriate amortization  schedule and not attempt to lower payments by lengthening the asset\u2019s useful life. The standards issued by the Federal Accounting Standards  Advisory Board (FASAB) on how to account for property, equipment, and  internal-use software could be useful in developing these guidelines.  According to Treasury officials, FMS would also be responsible for  preparing the warrants, an official document that establishes the amount of  monies authorized to be withdrawn from the central accounts maintained  by Treasury, and would report annually on account activity. The Bureau of  Public Debt would have the most day-to-day interaction with the CAF. It  would be responsible for transferring the borrowed funds to the  department and for receiving payments.

Oversight functions  would include accounting for all the transactions between the CAF and  Treasury as well as between the CAF and the subunits.

Currently, annual appropriations, which allow program managers to  incur obligations and make outlays with no additional steps, are provided  for most capital acquisitions.

On a gross basis, the BA would have to be  appropriated twice, once as up-front borrowing authority and  incrementally over time through appropriations for the annual mortgage  payment. Since the annual mortgage payment is purely intragovernmental,  the subunit\u2019s BA and outlays are offset by receipts in the CAF, so the total  BA and outlays are not double-counted. Therefore, appropriation  subcommittee allocations would not need to be adjusted if a CAF were  used for new assets.", "The initial borrowing authority would be equal to the asset cost and would  be scored up front in the CAF budget.

The  mortgage receipt would be considered mandatory BA and be used to repay  Treasury; however, the portion of the mortgage payment that corresponds  to the amortization of the asset cost would be deducted from the BA (and  outlay) totals. When collections are used for debt repayment, they are  unavailable for new obligations, and therefore are not BA. If they were  counted, the BA and outlay totals would be overstated over the life of the  loan. According to OMB, the remaining mandatory BA would be obligated  and outlayed for interest payments to an intragovernmental receipt  account in Treasury, but would not be scored.

As a result, NASA officials said \u201cfull cost\u201d  budgeting provides officials and program managers a greater incentive to  improve the management of these institutional assets.

A few agency officials we spoke with said that  because of the up-front funding requirement, they have sometimes opted  for operating leases instead of capital leases or constructing buildings.  Operating leases are generally more expensive than construction,  purchase, or capital leases for long-term needs but do not have to be  funded up front. Nevertheless, the agencies we spoke with reported that  spikes are often created by the changing priorities of Congress and its  willingness to provide up-front funding for favored capital projects. For  example, ARS officials reported that appropriators have increased the  agency\u2019s budget in a given year to fund a new or expanded facility that the  subcommittee considered a priority. Historically, the appropriations  subcommittee for ARS (and all USDA agencies except FS) has been active  in initiating capital projects and following through with the up-front  funding necessary to build or acquire assets. From ARS\u2019s perspective,  budget spikes are not problematic because of the perceived ease in  obtaining needed funds. DOI also reported that some of its subunits have  received \u201cwaves\u201d of funding for capital projects largely dependent upon the  priorities of Congress and the President. Within DOI, BLM officials agreed  that budget spikes were mostly a result of congressional add-ons. On the  other hand, NPS reported that most of its capital projects are just not large  enough to cause a noticeable budget spike.", "Staff from the congressional budget committee suggested that  deliberations during the appropriations process result in some smoothing  at the subcommittee level.

For example, USDA is currently renovating its headquarters  in Washington, D.C., and is using funds the department receives every other  year to finance the overhaul of one discrete section of the building at a  time. APHIS and BLM have also broken up large projects by funding the  survey and design phases in the first year and requesting funds for  construction in subsequent years. In addition, ARS and APHIS have  authorities that allow them to accumulate a specified amount or  percentage of unobligated funds until the amount is sufficient to cover the  full up-front costs of the desired asset. For example, ARS is building an  animal health center in Iowa, which costs an estimated $460 million. ARS  received $124 million in fiscal year 2004 towards the project and can  accumulate that money in its no-year account until the total amount to  cover the costs is collected. In its efforts to consolidate field offices, APHIS  officials told us they were granted authority to convert $2 million in  unobligated balances into no-year money each year for 3 years.

As reported previously, we found that WCFs  can be effective for agencies with relatively small, ongoing capital needs  because the WCFs, through user charges, spread the cost of capital over  time in order to build reserves for acquiring new or replacement assets.  Also, WCFs help to ensure that capital costs are allocated to programs that  use capital by promoting full cost accounting. Since WCFs are designed to  be self-financing, the user charges must be sufficient to recoup the full cost  of operations and include charges, such as depreciation, to help fund  capital replacement.", "Some we spoke with use WCFs to finance capital assets such as  IT initiatives and equipment. For example, USDA\u2019s WCF provided funds to  the National Finance Center, one of its activity centers, to purchase and  implement a financial system. Department officials explained that after the  system became operational, the Finance Center charged the 28 user  entities a depreciation expense to recoup the costs of purchasing the  system so it could repay the WCF. In another example, the FS\u2019s WCF  purchases radio equipment, aircraft, IT, and other motor-driven equipment.  The equipment is rented out to administrative entities within the agency,  such as the National Forests and Research Experiment Stations, and to  outside agencies for a charge that recoups the costs of operation,  maintenance, and depreciation. The user charge is adjusted to include  sufficient funds to replace the equipment. Agency officials would like to  expand the WCF beyond just equipment and establish a facilities  maintenance fund. Through this fund, they would apply a standard charge  per square foot plus a replacement cost component. The charges would be  used for ongoing maintenance and replacement and they believe would  help influence line officers to reexamine capital needs. BLM\u2019s WCF  functions similar to that of the FS\u2019s WCF. BLM\u2019s WCF purchases vehicles,  then charges fees to users of the vehicles and uses the revenue to buy  replacement vehicles. In both of these examples, the WCF is designed to  accumulate the funds to absorb the up-front costs of the capital while the  user entities incur the annual costs of using the capital.", "This mechanism operates similarly to a CAF, but with more flexibility in  the funding requirements. First, since WCFs are revolving funds, they  allow agencies to purchase new capital without a specific congressional  appropriation whereas a CAF would require a new appropriation to  purchase new capital. Second, WCFs are not subject to fiscal year  limitations (they have no-year authority) while CAFs would have  project-by-project borrowing authority specified in appropriation acts.  Third, WCFs reflect annual capital costs through a depreciation charge  whereas CAFs would reflect this cost through an annual mortgage payment  of principal and interest. Hence, both would reflect the annual cost of  capital in the subunits\u2019 budgets.", "To obtain federal office space, many agencies lease from and make rental  payments to GSA, which deposits those funds into the FBF. Although  leasing is recognized as being more expensive in the long run than  ownership, some agencies lease because it does not require as much  up-front funding as ownership (i.e., to avoid spikes). Although a CAF is  conceptualized to reduce the amount of up-front funding needed by  subunits when acquiring capital assets (while still requiring up-front  funding at the department level), it is not clear that having a CAF would  encourage subunits to build rather than lease office space. Two agency  officials we spoke with said that they would likely continue leasing and one  commented that if planning outright ownership, it would be easier to deal  with obtaining the traditional up-front funding than worry about the annual  mortgage payments required by a CAF.

Treasury officials feared that over time other types of spending would take priority over debt repayment. They based their concerns on the record of  some other programs that have struggled to repay debt or for which debt  has been \u201cforgiven\u201d or otherwise excused. For example, the Black Lung  Disability Trust Fund, which provides disability benefits and medical  services to eligible workers in the coal mining industry, has growing debt  and will never become solvent under current conditions. Although Black  Lung Disability Fund revenues are now sufficient to cover current benefits,  they do not cover either repayment of the over $8 billion owed the Treasury  or interest on that debt. Another example is the Bonneville Power  Administration (BPA), which is a federal electric power marketing agency  in the Pacific Northwest with authority to borrow from Treasury on a  permanent, indefinite basis in amounts not exceeding $4.45 billion at any  time. BPA finances its operations with power revenues and the loans from  Treasury, and has authority to reduce its debt using \u201cfish credits.\u201d This  crediting mechanism, authorized by Congress in 1980, allows BPA to  reduce its payments to Treasury by an amount equal to mitigation  measures funded on behalf of nonpower purposes, such as fish mitigation  efforts in the Columbia and Snake River systems. BPA took this credit for  the first time in 1995 and has taken it every year since that time. The annual  credit allowed varies, but has ranged between about $25 million and  $583 million, including the use in 2001 and 2003 of about $325 million total  unused \u201cfish credits\u201d that had accumulated since 1980.", "Some officials at the department and subunit level also raised concerns  about the long-run feasibility of fulfilling their mortgage payments over the  entire repayment period given that the payments are made from their  annual appropriations, which they expect to become increasingly  constrained. The mortgage payments would be relatively uncontrollable  items within an agency\u2019s budget, to the detriment of other, more  controllable items, such as personnel costs. Because the mortgage costs  would not change unless the asset is sold, managers would have less  flexibility in making budgeting decisions within stagnant or possibly  declining annual budgets that occur in times of fiscal restraint. BLM  officials said this type of fixed obligation, which could consume an  increasing share of its budget, could hinder its ability to address emergency  needs that arise during the year. For example, they cited a case in which the  agency reprogrammed resources to deal with a landslide that occurred on  the Oregon coast in late 2003. BLM delayed other projects in order to  redirect funds for the removal and stabilization of the landslide and to  reopen Galice Creek Road, which is a major artery for public access,  recreation, and commercial activity such as timbering, as well as BLM and  FS administration. BLM officials questioned whether the fixed payment to  the CAF would constrain their ability to make adjustments such as this.  Many agency officials were skeptical of the idea that they could fulfill  annual mortgage payments to a CAF without squeezing program operations  and some said they would rather deal with the up-front funding  requirement than have to worry about annual mortgage payments.", "The alternative to force-fitting a mortgage payment within agencies\u2019 annual  appropriations is to adjust agency budgets with an automatic add-on equal  to agencies\u2019 mortgage payments.

Several agencies  feel that they have the expertise and experience to better assess their own  capital needs, which are often mission specific. For example, ARS\u2019s capital  consists of mostly scientific equipment, laboratories, and research facilities  designed for conducting agricultural research in various climates. In fact,  the agency has its own facilities division consisting of contractors and  engineers who are involved in the management and oversight of capital  projects. Similarly, APHIS\u2019s facilities are mission specific. BLM\u2019s use of  activity-based costing allows it to assign capital costs to the program level  and track those costs to desired outputs.

Since a CAF assumes up-front funding, some agencies may  still seek to use some of the alternative financing mechanisms that they  already use, such as operating leases or enhanced-use leases, to meet  capital needs without first having to secure sufficient appropriations to  cover the full cost of the asset. As currently envisioned, CAFs would  probably not help improve capital planning concerns, such as the need for  improved budgeting and management of asset life-cycle costs. According to  the NRC report, operation and maintenance costs are typically 60 to 85  percent of the total life-cycle costs of a facility while design and  construction typically account for only 5 to 10 percent of those costs.

And even if the  full cost of programs, including the cost of existing capital, was more  accurately reflected in the budget through the use of CAFs, incentives to  cut capital costs may not materialize except in times of severe budget cuts.  Even then, managers\u2019 abilities to eliminate unneeded capital assets would  probably be limited given mission responsibilities and legal requirements  that dictate the disposal of surplus federal property. To remedy this,  additional funding or agency flexibilities would be needed, as would  provisions to ensure debt repayment if CAF-financed assets were  transferred or sold. Additionally, it is likely that some capital projects for  federal office space, IT, and land would continue to be financed outside of  the CAF through mechanisms such as the FBF, WCFs, or the GSA IT Fund."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Imputing an Annual Capital Charge on Existing Capital May Offer Benefits but Would Be Difficult and Contentious", "paragraphs": ["There are arguments that the CAF concept be applied to existing capital  assets as well as new capital assets to ensure that the full costs of all  programs are reflected in the budget. OMB points out that if CAFs were not  applied to all capital, it would be many decades before programs reflected  full annual costs and before the cost of alternative inputs could be  compared. Developing an annual capital usage charge for existing assets  would establish a level playing field for federal capital investment and  allow for comparisons across programs. In addition, this new charge could  influence agency managers to get rid of excess capital assets.", "Accomplishing these goals would require developing a standard method of  computing an appropriate annual capital usage charge. Subunits would pay  these charges to the department\u2019s CAF using appropriated funds, which  would then be transferred to Treasury\u2019s general fund. In other words,  agencies would receive appropriations to pay for the use of capital assets  they already own and would not retain any of the funds to maintain or  replace assets. Imputing such a charge on existing capital is likely to be  difficult and very contentious given questions about how to estimate the  charge and the fact that the assets were already funded.", "Before imputing an annual capital usage charge, key players, including  OMB and Congress, would need to agree on some type of standard formula  to estimate the charge. Three possible approaches to compute annual  capital usage charges would be to (1) use historical cost for the asset by  applying a charge as though the original cost had been financed by  borrowing from Treasury, (2) use market rental rates, or (3) devise a  calculation incorporating asset replacement cost, depreciation rates, and  interest rates. There are arguments for and against each of these options.  For example, while using historical cost would make the charge congruent  with accounting data; the charge would not reflect the current cost of using  capital and so might be less meaningful for evaluating costs. Although  using market rates would theoretically be the right measure for comparing  the cost of using resources for federal versus private purposes, the fact that  many government assets fill unique purposes means there is not a measure  of market value for them. For example, some agencies occupy historic  buildings, such as the Old Executive Office Building, for which a  comparable market-based value would be difficult to determine. The third  approach might be considered an agreeable middle ground, but applying  depreciation rates poses problems since they are largely arbitrary.  Agreement on whether to apply Treasury or market interest rates would be  necessary.", "Some agency officials and congressional staff suggested that any charges  on existing capital should reflect the life-cycle costs of maintaining assets  and, similar to a WCF, receipts collected should be made available for  future maintenance and renovation costs. We have reported that repair and  maintenance backlogs in federal facilities are significant and that the  challenges of addressing facility deterioration are prevalent at major real  property-holding agencies. However, research and discussions on CAF design indicate that CAF receipts could only go to Treasury and not for  future projects. Officials were also skeptical about how to accurately  charge for highly specialized capital. For example, ARS has more than  100 laboratories located in various regions of the country, as well as  abroad, which are designed to carry out mission responsibilities ranging  from the study of crop production to human nutrition to animal disease  control. The highly technical and diverse nature of its objectives requires  capital assets that are suitable for varied climates, soils, and other  agricultural factors, which pose unique and difficult challenges in  establishing capital usage charges that would be viewed as acceptable by  agency officials.", "If key players were able to agree on the method for calculating usage  charges on existing capital assets, they would also have to examine the  budgetary effects of such charges. Budget scorekeepers\u2014OMB, CBO, and  the budget committees\u2014would need to develop additional scoring rules to  clarify how the usage charges would be treated in the budget. Unlike  charges on new capital, there is no corresponding debt to repay. As a result  scorekeepers would have to specify how to score the usage charges as they  are transferred from the CAF to Treasury. Although these charges would  not change agency or government outlays or the deficit, they could require  a permanent increase in agencies\u2019 total BA, which would require Congress  to consider adjustments of appropriations subcommittee allocations.  Oversight would be especially important for these transactions since CAF  collections would be greater than needed to repay Treasury loans, creating  a temptation to use accruing balances for other purposes.", "Similar questions about how to charge for and how to score capital usage  charges for existing assets would eventually pertain to new capital funded  through the CAF. Once an asset is fully \u201cpaid off\u201d through the CAF, it is  comparable to existing capital and would similarly incur an annual capital  usage charge. Some might argue that payments should continue in the  same amounts as before, while others may call for the calculation of a new  capital usage charge for \u201cpaid off\u201d assets based upon the formula used for  capital that existed before the creation of CAFs. In any case, numerous  decisions on capital usage charges for existing capital would need to be  made prior to implementing CAFs.", "Aside from the specifics of how to develop appropriate capital usage  charges, most agency officials and congressional staff with whom we  spoke were skeptical of the need for such a charge.

As discussed earlier,  asset management systems and full cost accounting approaches are also  beginning to provide the information managers need to make better  decisions about the maintenance or disposal of existing assets and the need  for new capital. Some congressional staff thought the mind shift required  for Congress to agree to impute this new charge on existing capital assets  would be even more difficult than that required for purchasing new capital  using borrowing authority.", "In the countries of New Zealand, Australia, and the United Kingdom,  charges on existing capital are being used to encourage the efficient use of  assets.

In New Zealand,  departments are appropriated a capital charge based on their asset base at  the beginning of the year; at the end of the year they must pay the  government a capital charge based on their year-end asset base. If a  department has a smaller asset base at the end of the year than the asset  base for which the appropriation was made, the department is permitted to  keep part of the appropriation made for the capital charge.

However,  officials in New Zealand\u2019s Office of Controller and Auditor General were  uncertain about the effectiveness of having a charge for capital in changing  behavior significantly. In addition, some analysts in New Zealand expressed  concern that capital charging could drive department executives to  decisions that are rational in the short term but damaging in the long term.

Although the  information on total program costs might be made more transparent, it is  not clear that this would create stronger incentives for more careful  deliberation on future asset needs than having these costs shown through  available methods such as cost accounting systems or the use of working  capital funds.", "A charge on existing assets might also have limited impact. If appropriation  subcommittee allocations were simply raised to accommodate new capital  usage charges, programs would appear more expensive but perhaps not  differentially so. As with new assets, the capital charge on existing assets  would not affect the deficit. As a result, incentives for rationalizing existing  capital would not necessarily be created. Even during tight budget years,  when mandatory CAF payments would squeeze operating budgets and be  most likely to force trade-offs among capital assets, managers may be  constrained by mission responsibilities, legal requirements, or the cost of  disposing of assets. Consequently, agencies might have to argue for  increased funding or case-by-case exemptions, which Congress has granted  in the past.", "Some agencies questioned the effectiveness of applying a charge to  influence managers\u2019 decision making given the unique locations or types of  assets required to accomplish mission goals. BLM officials said an annual  capital usage charge would have a limited impact on their ability to dispose  of capital assets because of its stewardship role over the nation\u2019s public  lands. Similarly, ARS officials justified having locations dispersed all over  the country because its research activities are diverse and require facilities  in various climates and environments. As discussed, Congress also plays a  role in determining where ARS will conduct its research. Likewise, many of  APHIS\u2019s capital assets are mission specific, including animal quarantine  stations, sterile insect-rearing facilities, and laboratories, and typically do  not have a comparable counterpart in the commercial sector. APHIS  officials said this limits managers\u2019 abilities to sell or transfer assets because  the land often must be converted to original condition, a costly  undertaking. For some subunits we spoke with, destruction of certain  assets, which also has an up-front cost, is the only viable option for  eliminating unneeded assets. For example, NPS and FS have many facilities  located on public land. If no longer needed, some of these facilities cannot  be sold or transferred and would have to be demolished. According to FS  officials, when they determine that an asset has exhausted its useful life  and needs to be disposed of, the agency will incur the cost for removal and  recover the salvage value.", "Many agencies are subject to certain legal requirements that create  disincentives for disposing of surplus property. In these cases, agencies  would need additional funding or more flexibility to modify asset holdings  if improved decision making were to be realized. For example, under the  National Environmental Policy Act, agencies may need to assess the  environmental impact of their decisions to dispose of property. In general,  agencies are responsible for environmental cleanup of properties  contaminated with hazardous substances prior to disposal, which can  involve years of study and amount to considerable costs. Agencies that  own properties with historic designations\u2014which is common in the federal  portfolio and certainly within the inventories of USDA and DOI\u2014are  required under the National Historic Preservation Act to ensure that  historic preservation is factored into how the property is eventually used.

However, Congress has granted special  authorities in some cases. For example, FS officials told us it owned a  number of trails and roads on public lands that ran through the city of Los  Angeles, California. When the city expanded, it was no longer feasible to  maintain the roads and trails. As a result, the agency was granted authority to sell the land and use the proceeds to build a new ranger station.

Both of these options would produce complications and issues to resolve.

However, departments have some discretion in defining capital. The  Commission report suggested that OMB issue guidance on which capital  items belong in the CAF to ensure uniform implementation of the CAF  proposal.

Most  agencies are not allowed to lease their own office space unless GSA  delegates its authority to do so to that agency, which GSA has done in the  past. Under the CAF mechanism, if GSA were to delegate this authority, the  CAF would lease the office space.

Departments and subunits would  also likely continue to rent certain capital assets from WCFs or to use their  WCFs to purchase some capital. As discussed, WCFs rely on user charges  to fund ongoing maintenance and replacement of capital assets and the  collections are used by some departments and subunits to finance capital  assets, such as vehicles and IT.", "Land, such as wilderness areas, is also likely to remain outside the CAF.  Land retains its value so concepts such as depreciation and amortization do  not apply to it. However, one subunit official stated that using borrowing  authority to buy land might be beneficial if it meant that land could be  purchased at a faster rate to obtain environmentally sensitive land before it  is damaged."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["There is little doubt that in the mechanical sense CAFs could work as a new  system for financing capital assets. However, the implementation and  operation of the CAF concept would be complicated. Managing the extra  layer of responsibilities for CAF administration and oversight would  require the devotion of resources within departments, subunits, and  Treasury and to a lesser extent, OMB, CBO, and Congress. Accounting for  CAF transactions would be complex and burdensome. The annual debt  repayment would be a source of concern for Treasury and agency officials,  especially as more assets were financed through the CAF and mortgage  payments became a larger percentage of agency appropriations.", "Beyond the complexities inherent in financing capital assets using  borrowing authority is a list of difficult issues that would have to be  resolved before benefits could be realized. The most difficult of these  issues, applying a capital usage charge to existing capital, would also be the  most important to address if annual capital costs were to be allocated to  program budgets. If CAFs were applied only to new assets going forward,  programs would not reflect the full annual cost of capital for decades and  programs purchasing new capital would appear more expensive than those  using existing capital. Even if this and other issues were tackled and  improved information about capital costs was provided to managers, there  is little assurance that CAFs alone would create incentives for programs to  reassess their use of capital. Even in times of severe budget constraints, it  is probable that managerial flexibility to adjust the amount of assets used  by a program would continue to be limited by agency missions, legal  restrictions, and limited funds for asset disposal. Given the execution  complexities and implementation concerns, the ensuing question seems to  be whether there are simpler methods that can be used to achieve the same  benefits as CAFs.", "We believe there is strong evidence that both benefits attributed to CAFs  could be more easily obtained through existing mechanisms. Asset  management and cost accounting systems, when fully implemented, will be  important tools for promoting more effective planning and budgeting for  capital. Cost accounting systems can provide the same information on  capital costs as CAFs are intended to provide, while the information  provided by asset management systems could be even more crucial for  helping managers with limited budgets prioritize capital asset maintenance  and replacement. For existing capital, incentives to rationalize assets might  be created if agencies were allowed to retain proceeds to recoup the cost of  disposal, or in some cases, for reinvestment in real property. While some of  our case study agencies did not view spikes as a problem, those that did felt  they were managing them well through the use of WCFs, no-year authority,  and acquiring assets through useful segments. In any case, spikes in  spending for capital assets are likely to continue as congressional and  presidential priorities change over time.", "When described in detail to executive branch and congressional officials,  we learned that the CAF proposal would likely have few proponents.  Almost everyone we consulted concluded that implementation issues  would overwhelm the potential benefits of a CAF. More importantly,  current efforts under way in agencies would achieve the same goals as a  CAF without introducing the difficulties. Given this, as long as alternative  efforts uphold the principle of up-front funding, then a CAF mechanism  does not seem to be worth the complexity and implementation challenges  that it would create."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Response", "paragraphs": ["We obtained comments on a draft of this report from OMB, Treasury, GSA  and our case study agencies\u2014USDA and DOI. Treasury, GSA, USDA and  DOI generally agreed with the report. Treasury, USDA, DOI and OMB  provided technical comments, which have been incorporated as  appropriate. OMB agreed with our description of the mechanics of CAFs  and concurred that spikes in BA for capital assets could be alleviated  through other means. OMB also acknowledged the problems with CAFs  that are highlighted in this report, including those related to existing  capital, and agreed that the complications of designing and operating CAFs  might outweigh the benefits. However, they disagreed with our description  of the primary goal of CAFs and therefore do not believe alternative  mechanisms achieve the same goal.", "OMB supports having program budgets reflect full annual budgetary costs  in order to change incentives for decision makers. In addition to proposing  to budget for accruing retirement benefit costs, OMB has suggested  budgeting for accruing hazardous waste clean-up costs and budgeting for  capital through CAFs. Budgeting for full annual budgetary costs should  facilitate decision makers\u2019 ability to compare total resources used with  results achieved across government programs. For capital, OMB has  suggested CAFs as a possible method to allocate and embed the cost of  capital assets at the program budget level. OMB recognizes the usefulness  of asset management and cost accounting systems regardless of whether  CAFs are adopted. It is OMB\u2019s opinion that these tools do not ensure that  the costs of capital are captured in individual program budgets and  therefore do not affect incentives for decision makers in allocating  resources among and within programs. We disagree on several points.", "We recognize that if the sole or primary purpose of a CAF is to embed costs  in the program budgets, then the alternatives discussed in this report do  not achieve that purpose. However we believe, as highlighted in the Report  of the President\u2019s Commission to Study Capital Budgeting, that the  primary goal of CAFs is to improve decision making for capital. We are not  convinced that CAFs and the annual mortgage payments they would  require would achieve this more effectively than other mechanisms. We  argue instead that the information provided by asset management and cost  accounting systems, when fully implemented, could assist decision makers  in efficiently allocating budgetary resources. While this information may  not necessarily be reflected in program budgets, it is available to aid in  budget and program decision making. The fact that many of these systems  are in relatively early stages of development also increases our concern  about CAFs. In a recent report, we noted the belief among some agency  officials, congressional appropriations committee staff, and budget experts  that improving underlying financial and performance information should  be a prerequisite to efforts to restructure program budgets. We argue this  would also be true for CAFs, since without adequate measures of program  costs and an ability to identify capital priorities, a new financing  mechanism would do nothing to address the basic challenges of  determining how much and what types of capital are needed.", "It is also unclear that CAFs would create new incentives as OMB argues. As  we describe in the section titled \u201cCost Allocation Efforts May Have Limited  Effect on Agency Decision Making,\u201d if the annual mortgage payments offset  each other within the department budget and at the appropriations  subcommittee level, the deficit would not be affected, and it is unlikely  incentives would be changed. Even during tight budget years, when CAF  payments would squeeze operating budgets, managers may be unable to  change the amount of capital assets they use because of mission  responsibilities, legal requirements, or the cost of disposing of assets.", "We also recognize the value of linking resources to results in comparing  programs; however, it is unclear that CAFs are necessary or would even  work to accomplish this. Institutionalizing CAFs could permit program  comparison, but fair evaluations would only be possible if existing capital  were included. Therefore, the difficult issue of including existing capital  would have to be addressed. Alternatively, we believe that cost accounting  systems, when well developed within and across agencies, provide a  similar opportunity for comparing programs. In conclusion, we remain of  the view that the operational challenges of CAFs outweigh the benefits and  that alternative mechanisms described in this report can more simply  accomplish the goals of CAFs.", "As we agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents  of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days from  its issuance date.
