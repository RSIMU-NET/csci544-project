Treasury officials make a positive finding of currency manipulation only when all the conditions in the Trade Act are satisfied--when an economy has a material global current account surplus and a significant bilateral trade surplus with the United States, and is manipulating its currency with the intent to gain an unfair trade advantage. Treasury said that in its 2003 and 2004 assessments, China did not meet the criteria for manipulation, in part because it did not have a material global current account surplus and had maintained a fixed exchange rate regime through different economic conditions. Japan did not meet the criteria in 2003 and 2004 in part because its exchange rate interventions were considered to be part of a macroeconomic policy to combat deflation. Treasury has generally complied with the reporting requirements for its exchange rate reports, although its discussion of U.S. economic impacts has become less specific over time. Recent reports stress the importance of broad macroeconomic and structural factors behind global trade imbalances, which Treasury officials contend meets the intent of economic impact requirements. Many experts have concluded that China's currency is undervalued, but by widely varying amounts, while some maintain that undervaluation cannot be determined. The significant variation in estimates can be attributed in part to different methodological approaches, but experts also believe that exchange rate assessments are especially challenging for rapidly developing economies such as China's. Among experts who believe China's currency is undervalued, views on policy steps to correct the imbalance differ. A revaluation of China's currency could have implications for various aspects of the U.S. economy, although the impacts are hard to predict. They depend on multiple factors, including how much appreciation is passed through to higher prices for U.S. purchasers and the extent to which reduced imports from China are replaced with imports from other countries.

A separate provision of the 1988 Trade Act requires that  Treasury report to Congress on specific international economic policy and  exchange rate issues. Some observers are concerned that China and Japan  have intervened in currency markets to maintain an undervalued currency  and that these actions adversely affect U.S. output and employment,  particularly for small manufacturers. Because of these concerns, Treasury\u2019s  currency manipulation assessments have attracted increased attention, and  Congress recently mandated that Treasury report on how statutory  requirements about currency manipulation could be clarified to result in a  better understanding of currency manipulation.", "You asked us to review Treasury\u2019s efforts to meet its requirements under  the 1988 Trade Act and related issues.

In addition, we interviewed  responsible Treasury officials to better understand the assessment process  and Treasury\u2019s reasoning behind its analyses for China and Japan. To  determine the extent to which Treasury has met 1988 Trade Act reporting  requirements, we analyzed the reports Treasury has issued since 1988 that  are required by the Trade Act. Finally, to determine experts\u2019 views on  whether or by how much China\u2019s currency is undervalued and the  implications of its revaluation for the United States, we reviewed academic  papers, other studies, and congressional testimonies by economists with  expertise in this area, and we interviewed experts with a range of opinions  on the matter.

Congressional concerns at the time included concern that the exchange  rates of other countries placed competitive pressures on U.S. producers.", "The 1988 Trade Act directs the Secretary of the Treasury to analyze the  exchange rate policies of foreign countries for the purpose of considering  whether any are manipulating their currencies to gain an unfair trade  advantage and to report on international economic policies, including  exchange rates. To find that a country is manipulating the rate of exchange  between its currency and the U.S. dollar within the meaning of the Trade  Act, Treasury must determine that the country   is manipulating the exchange rate for the purpose of gaining an unfair  trade advantage or preventing effective balance of payments  adjustments, and   has a material global current account surplus and a significant bilateral  trade surplus with the United States.", "If Treasury finds that a country is manipulating its currency as defined by  the Trade Act, the act requires Treasury to initiate negotiations with that  country to ensure a foreign currency exchange rate adjustment that  eliminates the unfair trade advantage.

China has, since 1994, when it unified its dual exchange rate  system, pegged the value of its currency, the renminbi, to the U.S. dollar.   Chinese authorities maintain this peg by standing ready to buy and sell  renminbi in exchange for other currencies within a narrow band around the  fixed rate. When there is an excess supply of foreign exchange at this rate,  such as from surpluses in trade or net private capital flows, China\u2019s  purchases of that excess lead to an increase in its foreign reserves. China  maintains controls on capital flows that to some extent limit the volume of  transactions in the foreign exchange market, although these controls have  not prevented substantial recent capital inflows. In contrast, the Japanese  yen is on an independent float, which means that its value relative to other  currencies is determined by demand and supply in the currency market. In  the past, Japan has carried out significant interventions in the foreign  exchange market through the sale of yen in exchange for U.S. dollars,  which has put downward pressure on the value of the yen relative to the  U.S. dollar. Nevertheless, from January 2002 through January 2005, the  yen\u2019s value relative to the dollar increased 22 percent, from 132 yen per U.S.  dollar to 103 yen per U.S. dollar.

Treasury  officials responsible for the currency manipulation analysis compile  available information on exchange rates and other economic conditions.  Treasury also collects information from external sources, such as private  sector experts, and meets regularly with the IMF on broad international  economic policy issues.", "Treasury officials use the collected data to identify those economies  deserving closer examination. In addition to including bilateral trade  surplus and global current account surplus information in this initial  consideration, they also take into account other factors, such as changes in  currency value, capital flow conditions, and country size.

On the other hand, Treasury reviews some  economies regardless of economic indicators. For instance, Treasury  consistently reviews the activities of major U.S. trading partners, such as  Japan, the European Union, and Canada. It also monitors the three  economies that it previously found to be manipulating their currencies\u2014 Taiwan, Korea, and China.

According to these officials, to reach a positive finding of  currency manipulation under the Trade Act, Treasury must find that the  economies have a material global current account surplus and a significant  bilateral trade surplus with the United States, and they are manipulating  their currency with the intent of gaining trade advantage. Treasury has  significant flexibility in determining whether countries meet these criteria.  Treasury officials told us they do not have operational definitions of a  \u201cmaterial\u201d global current account surplus or a \u201csignificant\u201d bilateral trade  surplus.", "Treasury officials stated that they do not limit their analysis to the use of  the material global current account surplus and significant bilateral trade  surplus criteria listed in the Trade Act, but rather consider multiple aspects  of the economy. Treasury officials also stated that they do not use a  definitive checklist to make their determinations. Treasury officials told us  that the country-specific economic and international trade factors they  consider include  restrictions and regulations governing the use and retention of foreign  exchange and international financial flows;   movement of exchange rates, authorities\u2019 intervention in foreign  exchange markets, and the effectiveness of that intervention;  accumulation of foreign exchange reserves;  institutional development related to banking and financial sectors;  macroeconomic indicators, including gross domestic product (GDP)  growth rates, inflation, and unemployment rates;  savings/investment balances and underlying factors;  foreign investment and international portfolio investment flow patterns;   trade regime barriers; and  external shock factors such as financial crises, oil price hikes, or natural  disasters.", "The 1988 Trade Act does not require Treasury to determine if a currency is  undervalued while performing its currency manipulation assessments.  Although Treasury has in the past included observations on whether  currencies were undervalued, it no longer does so. While Treasury  officials told us they do not make an official determination on  undervaluation, in its March 2005 report to Congress (discussed below),  Treasury included measures of undervaluation among the indicators it  considers in its manipulation analysis.", "Upon completion of the currency manipulation assessments, managers  within the Office of International Affairs prepare recommendations for the  approval of the Under Secretary for International Affairs.

In December 2004, Treasury  reported that for the first half of 2004 China had an overall trade deficit of 1  percent of its GDP.

At that time,  important factors in Treasury\u2019s determinations were China\u2019s pervasive  direct controls on external trade activities and a dual exchange rate regime  with massive restrictions and controls. Since then, China has removed  restrictions on the convertibility of the renminbi for trade transactions and  substantially liberalized its trade regime, including implementing a variety  of reforms related to its accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001.", "Since 1994, China has followed a policy of maintaining its currency peg to  the dollar regardless of economic conditions, according to Treasury  officials. For example, during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s,  China kept the renminbi\u2019s value steady rather than depreciating it to stay  competitive with the cheaper currencies of other Asian exporting  economies. While this helped maintain the stability of its own economy and  the region, it was not consistent with a policy of keeping a cheap currency  for trade advantage, according to Treasury officials.", "Despite the absence of a positive determination on currency manipulation,  Treasury has stated that China should move from its long-term fixed  exchange rate and has engaged in discussions with China to advocate a  shift to market-based exchange rate flexibility. The Chinese government  has indicated its willingness to move to a flexible exchange rate regime  after undertaking a series of preparative steps but has established no  specific timetable to complete them. To date, China has taken some steps  to reduce barriers to capital outflows, liberalize interest rates, remove  investment restrictions, and strengthen its financial infrastructure.  Treasury has provided technical assistance to help China develop market  mechanisms needed for the transition to a flexible regime, including  central bank supervision of currency risk and regulation of foreign  exchange derivative markets.", "With respect to Japan, Treasury officials stated that the country\u2019s ongoing  current account surplus reflects a long-term imbalance between savings  and investment. In the last three exchange rate reports covering 2003 and  2004, Treasury noted that Japan justified its currency market interventions  as a response to market overshooting, or excess volatility, and that such  activity did not target particular exchange rate values. Treasury officials  stated that Japan\u2019s interventions were part of a macroeconomic policy  aimed at combating domestic deflationary pressures.

Treasury\u2019s reports generally discussed at least some elements of  the impact-reporting requirement from the late 1980s through the 1990s.  From 1988 into the early 1990\u2019s, Treasury\u2019s reports generally discussed  exchange rate effects on U.S. external balances and economic growth.

Treasury viewed exchange rates as one of several interacting  economic variables needing attention to address global imbalances. For  example, in the October 2003 and April 2004 reports, Treasury reported that  the current account deficit represented the gap between savings and  investment, and its sustainability depended on the attractiveness of U.S.  capital markets to foreign investors. Its analysis also emphasized the  importance for U.S economic interests of strong growth of U.S. trading  partners. Treasury\u2019s most recent report in December 2004 did identify  exchange rate flexibility for certain Asian economies as an area of policy  the administration is following to reduce global imbalances.", "Given its broad approach to impact-related analysis, Treasury\u2019s semiannual  reports do not contain discrete examinations of the effect on the U.S.  economy of changes in the dollar\u2019s value. Thus, Treasury\u2019s reports do not  specifically address the impact of the dollar on aspects of economic  activity listed in the 1988 Trade Act, including production, employment,  and global industrial competition.

While there is no consensus  methodology for determining whether a country\u2019s currency is undervalued,  experts have applied a number of commonly used approaches to the case  of China. (See app. V for details of the various methodologies and their  limitations.)  These approaches generally involve determining an  equilibrium exchange rate, broadly defined as the exchange rate that is  consistent with a country\u2019s economic fundamentals, when the country is  operating at full employment and in a free market. As table 2 illustrates,  estimates of renminbi undervaluation range from none to over 50 percent.  Some of these estimates are rough calculations based on \u201crule-of-thumb\u201d  assumptions while others are based on formal models. In addition, some of  these estimates may be most appropriately categorized as measures of  near-term undervaluation or short-term pressure indicators. Moreover, the  margins of error for these estimates are generally unknown.", "The significant variation in estimates of remninbi undervaluation can be  attributed in part to different methodological approaches, but similar  methodologies can also yield differences. The absolute version of the  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) methodology, which determines the  exchange rate at which identical goods would trade at the same price in  both countries, produces estimates that generally show the renminbi is  considerably undervalued. The External Balance approach is based on  calculating an exchange rate that would result in a country achieving a  sustainable balance in its external accounts, such as its current account  balance or its trade balance. In the studies we reviewed, this approach  generally produced estimates of currency undervaluation for China from 4  to 25 percent, with one estimate of 40 percent. Moreover, there are often  significant differences in estimates even when similar methodologies are  used. For example, experts who use the Behavioral Equilibrium Exchange  Rate (BEER) approach, which uses econometric relationships between  exchange rates and other economic variables to estimate an equilibrium  exchange rate, have found renminbi undervaluation ranging from 11 to 47  percent.", "Some experts doubt that equilibrium exchange rates can be estimated and  thus believe that whether a currency is under- or overvalued cannot be  reliably determined. Treasury officials and some other experts we spoke  with stated that estimating equilibrium exchange rates is especially  challenging for developing economies with rapidly changing economic  structures, such as China. According to Treasury, the determination of  under- or overvaluation requires analysis of key economic variables, the  measures for which are subject to considerable uncertainty in China.  Moreover, determining an equilibrium exchange rate is especially difficult  for China because China restricts the outflow of funds from the country.  (See app. IV for a discussion of China\u2019s capital controls.)", "Some observers and analysts view China\u2019s growing foreign exchange  reserves  as evidence that the renminbi is undervalued. China\u2019s foreign  exchange reserves increased by $399 billion dollars\u2014185 percent\u2014from  the end of 2001 to the end of 2004. These observers maintain that the  reserves, which partly reflect China\u2019s surpluses in global trade and foreign  direct investment (FDI), are evidence that the value of the renminbi is too  low relative to the demand for renminbi-denominated goods, services, and  other investments; as a result, China must purchase large amounts of  dollars to keep the renminbi\u2019s value from increasing beyond its U.S. dollar  peg.", "Using reserve accumulations as evidence of a mismatch between the  current value of the renminbi and its long-run equilibrium value has  limitations, however, according to several analysts. China\u2019s foreign reserve  accumulation has several components:  the current account balance, FDI  net inflows, non-FDI net inflows (which include portfolio investment such  as stocks and other investments), and undocumented capital\u2014referred to  as errors and omissions. China\u2019s current account surpluses and FDI  inflows were the primary components of the $117 billion increase in its  reserves in 2003, accounting together for about 80 percent. Net non-FDI  inflows and errors and omissions accounted for about 20 percent of the  reserve increase.

There is debate  regarding steps and timing on both issues. With respect to whether and  when China should change its exchange rate policy, there are varying views  even among experts who believe the currency is undervalued. Some  experts have recommended that China immediately revalue the renminbi,  either relative to the U.S. dollar or to a broader group of currencies. Others  have suggested that China should move to a more flexible system\u2014with a  freely floating exchange rate being the most flexible. Analysts have  identified potential advantages of such policy changes for China and also  for other countries. Analysts have also identified a number of challenges  for China. For example, some experts have cautioned that there could be  economic costs to China if the monetary authorities revalue the currency  and guess wrong about how large the revaluation should be. They have  stated that a small revaluation could encourage further speculative capital  flows into the country in anticipation of a further revaluation, which would  increase reserves. Some have also expressed concern that a large  appreciation in the renminbi\u2019s value could unnecessarily slow down the  Chinese economy and worsen labor conditions in the country, which has  high unemployment in certain regions.", "There are also varying views on changes in China\u2019s policies regarding  restrictions on capital flows. China currently restricts outward flows of  Chinese capital for foreign direct investment and purchases of securities  abroad, although it eased some restrictions in 2004. (See app. IV for  additional information on these restrictions.) A number of advocates of  greater exchange rate flexibility maintain that China is not ready for  significant capital account liberalization and that the government should  maintain some capital controls after moving to a more flexible exchange  rate. One reason cited is that liberalization would expose China\u2019s financial  sector to risk if, for example, banks in China that are not financially strong  experienced erosion of their deposit base from investors switching funds  offshore.", "Several policy options advocated for China\u2019s currency involve a gradual or  multistep process, which proponents maintain could minimize the  potential for adverse effects of revaluation. One expert, for example, has  advocated a two-stage currency reform process for China.

Some key  factors include the following:  How much of the exchange rate appreciation is \u201cpassed-through\u201d to  higher prices for U.S. purchasers. Experience with other nations  generally shows that pass-through is less than complete, particularly in  the short term, because contracts for exports to the United States may  be written in dollars. Longer term, the extent of pass-through depends  on factors such as the extent to which Chinese exports to the United  States are made up of inputs from other countries (since these would  become cheaper with a stronger renminbi), and the extent to which  Chinese exporters reduce their costs or profit margins.", "The extent of the U.S. market response to the higher prices. In some  markets, U.S. purchasers may continue to buy nearly the same volume  of Chinese imports at the higher prices, while in others U.S. purchasers  may decide to sharply reduce their purchases. The less responsive the  overall U.S. demand is to price changes of Chinese imports, the less  changes in the renminbi-dollar exchange rate will affect the U.S. trade  balance, production, or employment. The same is true on the other  side of the market; if Chinese demand for U.S. exports is unresponsive  to the lower prices of U.S. goods, Chinese buyers will not buy much  more in the short run even if prices of U.S. exports have fallen.", "The extent to which products now being manufactured in China  would be produced in other countries rather than in the United States.  It is probable that goods from other countries with low labor costs  would replace a portion of Chinese exports to the United States if the  renminbi were to increase in value, thus reducing the impact on the U.S.  economy. Specifically, some experts believe that decreased imports  from China would be largely replaced by slightly higher-priced imports  from other low-income countries such as Sri Lanka, Vietnam,  Bangladesh, and Pakistan, among others, instead of being manufactured  in the United States.", "Whether other countries follow China and adjust their policies. Some  analysts contend that the renminbi\u2019s peg to the dollar induces other East  Asian countries to intervene in currency markets to keep their  currencies weak against the dollar so that they can remain competitive  with China. Some believe that a revaluation by China might encourage  other countries to change their exchange rate policies as well. This  would magnify the impact of a revaluation on the United States.", "The time period necessary for these adjustments to take place. While a  currency appreciation has some immediate effects, the impacts on the  trade statistics, production decisions, and employment generally take a  longer time. In the short term, the U.S. trade deficit may increase as it  takes more dollars to buy the same amount of Chinese products. As the  higher prices are factored into new purchasing decisions, the  appreciation would lead to effects on U.S. production and employment  that could occur over a period of months or years.

However, in terms of employment, many experts believe that a  rise in the value of the renminbi relative to the dollar would be unlikely to  have much, if any, effect on aggregate employment in the United States.  This is because the overall level of U.S. jobs is generally viewed as being  largely determined by factors such as the domestic labor supply and  broader macroeconomic factors such as U.S. monetary policy.

The estimates use as a starting point an assumption for the  relationship between the overall exchange rate of the dollar and the U.S.  trade deficit from the IMF\u2019s April 2004 World Economic Outlook and then  illustrate the impact of additional assumptions regarding exchange rate  pass-through, import displacement, and follow-on exchange rate  adjustments (see table 3).", "These assumptions are not analytically precise, and other researchers have  used different assumptions.", "As shown in the table, with a hypothetical upward revaluation of 20  percent, the estimates for trade deficit reduction due to a revaluation of the  renminbi under these assumptions range from $3.3 billion to $13.3 billion,  depending on pass-through, the displacement effect, and follow-on  exchange rate adjustments. Estimates outside of the range of estimates  provided here could be obtained using different assumptions. These  estimates could change further by accounting directly for other factors  such as the sensitivity of U.S. demand to price changes of Chinese imports.", "Some analyses have drawn conclusions about the impact of exchange rate  changes on U.S. manufacturing jobs by using additional assumptions to  those employed above. For example, one analysis used the assumption that  a $1 billion increase in the U.S. trade deficit would lead to a decline in U.S.  manufacturing jobs of about 15,000. Applying such a value to estimates of  a 20 percent renminbi revaluation, under the assumptions shown in  scenario 3, would lead to estimates of manufacturing sector job impacts of  about 49,800 jobs. Under scenario 4, with the additional assumption of  follow-on exchange rate adjustments if the renminbi were revalued, the  manufacturing sector job impact estimate would be 199,000. These  analyses have limitations. Researchers have observed that trade affects the  demand for manufacturing labor in complex ways, particularly with  respect to imported goods and components. Moreover, as noted above, the  long-run level of employment in the economy is generally viewed as being  determined by demographic and broader macroeconomic factors such as  monetary policy. Thus, to the extent there are manufacturing sector job  impacts of a renminbi revaluation, they may be offset by job losses in other  sectors of the economy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "An Upward Renminbi Revaluation Could Have Implications for U.S. Capital Flows", "paragraphs": ["Capital flows must also be considered in an assessment of the implications  of a renminbi revaluation. The U.S. bilateral trade deficit with China\u2014and  its maintenance of a fixed exchange rate to the dollar\u2014has been  accompanied by an inflow of funds into U.S. capital markets from China.   This has occurred during a period of an overall rise in inflows of foreign  capital accompanying increasing U.S. trade and current account deficits.

To  describe and analyze country economic data and indicators used by many  of these experts, we used data from the International Monetary Fund\u2019s  (IMF) World Economic Outlook and other sources, including the Bureau of  Labor Statistics and the Federal Reserve Board.

We used these data because they constitute the only data  available for these transactions, but we note in presenting the information  that because of the way the data are collected there is a bias toward  overcounting flows to countries that are major financial centers and  toward undercounting flows to other countries. As a result, excessive  foreign holdings may be attributed to some countries that are major  custodial centers, such as the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Belgium, and  Luxembourg. Moreover, because the Bureau of Economic Analysis adjusts  the TIC data somewhat before it reaches the Federal Reserve Board and  because of timing issues, the data on total foreign holdings from the two  sources have slight but insignificant differences.

Because these  transactions are known to be substantial, producers of the data note that  this could produce significantly inaccurate data. Moreover, because these  data include commissions and taxes associated with each transaction, the  result is a slight overestimation of net purchases. These data are also  revised periodically. The TIC system is the official source of this data, it is  widely used by outside experts, and the limitations are not particular to any  one country. Therefore we determined that they were sufficiently reliable  for a comparison of net purchases of U.S. securities by China with other  major purchasers and generally assessing the role of China in U.S. financial  markets.

In some cases, narrower units have formed the basis of PPP  comparisons, such as the \u201cBig Mac\u201d index which is a widely cited shortcut  version that analyzes one standardized good across countries.  Unfortunately, the law of one price has limitations; it does not hold across  nations of sharply differing levels of development and is biased toward  finding undervaluation for low-income countries compared to their higher- income counterparts.

The technique  involves choosing a point in time that corresponds to equilibrium and then  projecting the new equilibrium rate using the inflation differentials  between countries.

These include:  The import content of Chinese exports to the United States. A large  portion of China\u2019s export operations consists of the final assembly of  products using components produced in other countries, especially  Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. Some experts believe that the import content  of Chinese exports to the United States may be 35 to 40 percent of the  total value, and others have estimated as much as 80 percent. An  appreciation of the renminbi could thus have limited impact on the  prices of these exports to the United States because the currency  change would leave the imported portions of the products (as much as  80 percent) unaffected, while a smaller portion (20 percent) would  become more expensive.", "The flexibility of the Chinese labor market.  Some researchers believe  that Chinese laborers might willingly take wage cuts to keep their jobs  given the high unemployment rate in the country.

The sensitivity of U.S. demand for Chinese goods  and of China\u2019s demand for U.S. goods to price changes are also  important factors. If U.S. consumers are sensitive to price changes of  Chinese imports (i.e., elasticity of import demand is high), then an  increase in import prices would significantly reduce the demand for  Chinese goods and improve the bilateral trade deficit with China.
