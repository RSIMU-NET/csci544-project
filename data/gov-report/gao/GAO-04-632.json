DOD identified three separate backlog estimates; (1) more than 61,000 reinvestigations (required for renewing clearances) that were overdue but had not been submitted, (2) over 101,000 new investigations or reinvestigations that had not been completed within DOD's established time frames, and (3) over 25,000 adjudications (a determination of clearance eligibility) that had not been completed within DOD's established time frames. From fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2003, the average time that it took DOD to conduct an investigation and determine clearance eligibility for industry personnel increased from 319 days to 375 days. Delays in conducting investigations and determining clearance eligibility can increase national security risks, prevent industry personnel from beginning or continuing work on classified programs and activities, hinder industrial contractors from hiring the most experienced and best qualified personnel, increase the time needed to complete national-security-related contracts, and increase costs to the federal government. Several impediments hinder DOD's ability to eliminate the backlogs and reduce the amount of time needed to conduct an investigation and determine security clearance eligibility for industry personnel. Impediments include a large number of new clearance requests; an increase in the proportion of requests for top secret clearances, which require more time to process; inaccurate workload projections for both the number and type of clearances needed for industry personnel; and insufficient investigative and adjudicative workforces to handle the large workloads. Industrial contractors cited the lack of full reciprocity (the acceptance of a clearance and access granted by another department, agency, or military service) as an obstacle that can cause industry delays in filling positions and starting work on government contracts. Also, the effects of past conditions, such as the backlog itself, have been identified as impediments to timely eligibility determinations. Furthermore, DOD does not have an integrated, comprehensive management plan for addressing the backlog and delays. DOD is considering several initiatives that might reduce security clearance backlogs and processing times for determining clearance eligibility for industry personnel. Among those initiatives that DOD is exploring are (1) conducting a phased, periodic reinvestigation; (2) establishing a single adjudicative facility for industry; (3) reevaluating investigative standards and adjudicative guidelines; and (4) implementing an automated verification process for identifying and validating industrial security clearance requirements. These initiates could, however, face implementation obstacles, such as the need to change governmentwide regulations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As a result of an increased awareness of threats to our national security  stemming from the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11,  2001, and increased efforts over the past decade to privatize federal jobs,  individuals working for private industry are playing an increasingly larger  role in national security work conducted by the Department of Defense  (DOD) and other federal agencies.

The impediments and recommendations apply  to industry personnel as well as military members and federal employees.  Likewise, the House Committee on Government Reform recently  documented problems with DOD\u2019s personnel security clearance program  and recommended changes to, among other things, reduce the backlog.", "Recent legislation could affect DOD\u2019s security clearance process. The  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 authorized the  transfer of DOD\u2019s personnel security investigative functions and more than  1,800 investigative employees to the Office of Personnel Management  (OPM). However, as of May 6, 2004, this transfer had not taken place. The  transfer can occur only after the Secretary of Defense certifies to Congress  that certain conditions can be met and the Director of OPM concurs with  the transfer.", "In response to your request, we reviewed the process that DOD uses to  determine security clearance eligibility for industry personnel.

In addition, we reviewed reports by GAO,  DOD, congressional staff, and other government entities. We also  interviewed DOD and industry officials; observed the procedures used to  process clearance information; and analyzed data from the Case Control  Management System\u2019s database, which manages the collection and  dissemination of personnel security data from receipt of personnel  security history to the monitoring, closing, transmitting, and maintaining  of personnel security records. We assessed the reliability of the Case  Control Management System\u2019s data used to determine the extent of the  backlog and the time needed to conduct an investigation and determine  eligibility for a clearance and determined that the data for fiscal years 2001  and thereafter were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of this report. In  addition, we reviewed the methodology, sampling, and modeling  techniques used in the Defense Personnel Security Research Center\u2019s  reports on various DOD initiatives relating to the clearance process.

Within OUSD (I), the  Defense Security Service (DSS) is responsible for conducting background  investigations and administering the personnel security investigations  program for DOD and 22 other federal agencies that allows industry  personnel access to classified information. Two offices are responsible  for adjudicating cases involving industry personnel. DSS\u2019s Defense  Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) adjudicates cases that  contain only favorable information or minor issues regarding security  concerns (e.g., some overseas travel by the individual), and the Defense  Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) within the Defense Legal Services  Agency adjudicates cases that contain major security issues (e.g., an  individual\u2019s unexplained affluence or criminal history).", "As with military members and federal workers, industry personnel must  obtain a security clearance to gain access to classified information, which  is categorized into three levels: top secret, secret, and confidential. The  level of classification denotes the degree of protection required for  information and the amount of damage that unauthorized disclosure could  reasonably be expected to cause to national defense or foreign relations.  For top secret information, the expected damage that unauthorized  disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause is \u201cexceptionally  grave damage;\u201d for secret information, it is \u201cserious damage;\u201d and for  confidential information, it is \u201cdamage.\u201d Individuals who need access  to classified information over a long period are required to periodically  renew their clearance (a reinvestigation). The time frames for  reinvestigations are 5 years for top secret clearances, 10 years for secret  clearances, and 15 years for confidential clearances.", "To ensure the trustworthiness, judgment, and reliability of industry  personnel in positions with access to classified information, DOD relies  on a three-stage personnel security clearance process. (See fig. 1.) This  process, which is essentially the same for industry personnel as it is for  military members and federal employees, entails (1) determining that  the position requires a clearance and, if so, submitting a request for  a clearance to DSS; (2) conducting an initial investigation or a  reinvestigation; and (3) using the investigative report to determine  eligibility for access to classified information\u2014a procedure known as  \u201cadjudication.\u201d", "In the preinvestigation stage, if a position requires a clearance, then the  industrial contractor must request an investigation of the individual. The  request could be the result of needing to fill a new position for a recent  contract, replacing an employee in an existing position, renewing the  clearance of an individual who is due for reinvestigation, or processing a  request for a future employee (up to 180 days) in advance of the hiring  date. Once the requirement for a security clearance is established, the  industry employee completes a personnel security questionnaire, and the  industrial contractor submits it to DSS. All industry requests for a  DOD-issued clearance are submitted to DSS, while requests for military  members and federal employees are submitted to either DSS or OPM.", "In the investigation stage, DSS, OPM, or one of their contractors  conducts the actual investigation of the industry employee by using  standards that were established governmentwide in 1997 and  implemented by DOD in 1998. As table 1 shows, the type of information  gathered in an investigation depends on the level of clearance needed and  whether an initial investigation or a reinvestigation is being conducted.  For either an initial investigation or a reinvestigation for a confidential or  secret clearance, investigators gather much of the information  electronically. For a top secret clearance, investigators gather additional  information that requires much more time-consuming efforts, such as  traveling, obtaining police and court records, and arranging and  conducting interviews. DSS\u2019s Personnel Investigations Center forwards the  completed investigative report to DISCO.", "In the adjudicative stage, DISCO uses the information from the  investigative report to determine whether an individual is eligible for a  security clearance.

However, if the case is  determined to be an \u201cissue\u201d case\u2014a case containing information that  might disqualify an individual for a clearance (e.g., foreign connections  or drug- or alcohol-related problems)\u2014then DISCO forwards the case  to DOHA adjudicators for the clearance-eligibility decision. Regardless  of which office renders the adjudication, DISCO issues the clearance- eligibility decision and forwards this determination to the industrial  contractor. All adjudications are based on 13 federal adjudicative  guidelines established governmentwide in 1997 and implemented by  DOD in 1998 (see app. II). DISCO and DOHA serve as central adjudication  facilities for industry personnel, whereas DOD uses eight other central  adjudication facilities to approve, deny, or revoke eligibility for a security  clearance for military members and federal employees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Backlog for Industry Personnel Was Roughly 188,000 Cases, and the Time Needed for the Clearance Process Has Increased", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s security clearance backlog for industry personnel was roughly  188,000 cases, and the time needed to conduct an investigation and  determine eligibility for a clearance had increased by 56 days during  the last 3 fiscal years.

For the  25,000 completed investigations awaiting adjudication, DSS found that  over 19,000 of the cases were at DISCO and more than 6,300 of the cases  were at DOHA. However, as of March 31, 2004, DOHA independently  reported that it had eliminated its adjudication backlog. A complicating  factor in determining the size of the industrial personnel backlog is that  the backlog may be underestimated, since DSS had opened relatively few  cases between October 1, 2003, and March 31, 2004, in anticipation of the  authorized transfer of the investigative function from DSS to OPM. DSS  had received, but not opened, almost 69,200 new industry personnel  requests received in the first half of fiscal year 2004. Cases received in  fiscal year 2004, which have already exceeded the set time frames for  completing the investigation, are included in the 101,000 backlogged  investigations identified above.", "To view the industry personnel backlog in its proper context, we  compared this backlog to the DOD-wide clearance backlog as of  September 30, 2003, the date of the most recent DOD-wide data. For the  preinvestigation stage, DOD did not know the total number of personnel  DOD-wide with overdue requests for reinvestigation that had not been  submitted\u2014even though their clearances exceeded the governmentwide  time frames for submitting reinvestigations. (See fig. 2.) Any request for a  reinvestigation that has not been submitted within a specified time frame  is overdue and considered part of the backlog. As noted in our February  2004 report, DOD could not estimate the number of military members and  federal employees who had not requested a reinvestigation. Similarly, in a  prior report, we indicated that DOD estimated its backlog of overdue but  not submitted reinvestigations at 300,000 cases in 1986 and 500,000 cases  in 2000. Because DOD\u2019s Case Control Management System has limited  query capability, DOD was unable to identify the number of overdue  but not submitted industrial personnel reinvestigations as of  September 30, 2003. Although this system can identify overdue  reinvestigations for industry personnel when queried at a specific point in  time, it does not allow DOD to identify the number of military members  and federal employees whose reinvestigations are overdue but not  submitted at any time.", "The size of the total DSS-estimated backlog for industry personnel  doubled during the 6-month period ending on March 31, 2004. Table 2  compares the sizes of the investigative and adjudicative backlogs at the  end of fiscal year 2003 with the end of the first-half of fiscal year 2004. This  comparison does not include the backlog of overdue reinvestigations that  have not been submitted, because DSS was not able to estimate that  backlog as of September 30, 2003.", "As of September 30, 2003, the estimated size of the investigative backlog  for industry personnel amounted to roughly 44,600 cases, or 17 percent of  the larger DOD-wide backlog of approximately 270,000 cases, which  included military members, federal employees, and industry personnel.  (See fig. 2.) DSS\u2019s time frames for completing investigations range from  75 days to 180 days, depending on the investigative requirements. For  instance, an initial secret investigation is required to be completed within  75 days, while a secret or top secret reinvestigation has to be completed  within 180 days. Some requests for investigations receive priority over  other requests. For example, requests for initial clearances receive priority  over requests for reinvestigations, since individuals awaiting initial  clearances cannot work whereas individuals who already have clearances  that are due for reinvestigation can continue to work.", "As of September 30, 2003, the estimated size of the adjudicative backlog  for industry personnel totaled roughly 17,300 cases. This number  represented 19 percent of the roughly 93,000 cases in the DOD-wide  adjudicative backlog on that date. Of the 17,300 industry personnel cases,  some 12,800 were awaiting adjudication at DISCO (most of which were  reinvestigations) and the remaining 4,500 cases were awaiting adjudication  at DOHA. As of March 31, 2004, DOHA independently reported that it had  totally eliminated this backlog of cases that had been awaiting initial  adjudication by its security specialists. Typically, about 14 to 20 percent of  the cases received by DISCO are eventually sent to DOHA for adjudication.  As shown in figure 2, DISCO and DOHA use different time frames for  identifying cases as backlogged. For example, DISCO uses 3 days for  initial clearances and 30 days for reinvestigations, while DOHA uses  different time frames on the basis of the number of cases on hand for  30 days that exceed a steady workload of 2,150 cases each month.

In a 1999 report, the  Joint Security Commission II pointed out that delays in initiating  reinvestigations create risks to national security because the longer the  individuals hold clearances, the more likely they are to be working with  critical information and systems.", "In addition, delays in determining security clearance eligibility for industry  personnel can affect the timeliness, quality, and cost of contractor  performance on defense contracts. A 2003 Information Security Oversight  Office report identified concerns about the length of time required to  process industrial security clearances. According to the report, industrial  contractor officials who were interviewed said that delays in obtaining  clearances cost industry millions of dollars per year and affect personnel  resources. Interviewees reported having difficulty in filling sensitive  positions and retaining qualified personnel. The report also stated that  delays in the clearance process hampered industrial contractors\u2019 ability to  perform duties required by their contracts. According to industry  contractors, these delays increased the amount of time needed to  complete national-security-related contracts. In interviews we conducted  during our review, industrial contractors told us about cases in which their  company hired competent applicants who already had the necessary  security clearances, rather than individuals who were more experienced  or qualified but did not have a clearance. As a result, according to industry  association officials, industrial contractors may not be performing  government contracts with the most experienced and best-qualified  personnel, thus diminishing the quality of the work. Moreover, industry  association representatives told us that defense contractors might offer  monetary incentives to attract new employees with clearances\u2014for  example, a $15,000 to $20,000 signing bonus for individuals with a valid  security clearance, and a $10,000 bonus to current employees who recruit  a new employee with a clearance. In turn, the recruit\u2019s former company  may need to backfill the position, as well as settle for a lower level of  contract performance while a new employee is found, obtains a clearance,  and is trained. In addition, defense contractors may hire new employees  and begin paying them, but not be able to assign any work to them\u2014 sometimes for a year or more\u2014until they obtain a clearance. Contractors  may also incur lost-opportunity costs if prospective employees decide to  work elsewhere rather than wait to get a clearance.

In other words, the increase in the average wait  time was small compared to the increase in the number of cases. Fiscal  year 2001 is an important baseline for examining changes in clearance  processing because (1) major problems with DSS\u2019s Case Control  Management System had been largely corrected and (2) the end of fiscal  year 2001 occurred shortly after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks,  which prompted an increase in clearance requests.", "Table 6 shows that from fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2003, the  number of clearance eligibility determinations for industry personnel  increased by more than 63,000 cases, or 174 percent.", "Beginning with fiscal year 1995 through fiscal year 2003, the proportion of  all requests requiring top secret clearances for industry personnel grew  from 17 to 27 percent. As indicated earlier, top secret clearances require  more information than that needed for secret clearances. According to  OUSD (I), top secret clearances take 8 times more investigative effort to  complete and 3 times more adjudicative effort to review than do secret  clearances. In addition, a top secret clearance must be renewed twice as  often\u2014every 5 years instead of every 10 years for a secret clearance. The  full effect of requesting a top secret, rather than a secret, clearance thus is  16 times the investigative effort and 6 times the adjudicative effort.", "The increased demand for top secret clearances also has budget  implications for DOD. In fiscal year 2003, security investigations obtained  through DSS cost $2,640 for an initial investigation for a top secret  clearance, $1,591 for a reinvestigation of a top secret clearance, and $328  for an initial investigation for a secret clearance. Thus, over a 10-year  period, DOD would spend $4,231 (in current-year dollars) to investigate  and reinvestigate an industry employee for a top secret clearance, a cost  13 times higher than the $328 it would require to investigate an individual  for a secret clearance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inaccurate Projections for Clearance Workload Hamper Planning", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s inability to accurately estimate the number and type of clearance  requests that it will have to process for industry personnel during the  next fiscal year is part of a bigger DOD-wide workload-estimation  problem.

For  example, inaccurate forecasts for both the number and type of security  clearances needed for industry personnel make it difficult for DOD to plan  ahead and to size its investigative and adjudicative workforce to handle  the workload and fund its security clearance program. For fiscal year 2003,  DSS reported that the actual cost of industry personnel investigations was  almost 25 percent higher than had been projected. DOD officials believed  that these projections were inaccurate primarily because DSS received a  larger proportion of requests for initial top secret background  investigations and top secret reinvestigations, both of which require  considerably more effort to process. Since fiscal year 2001, DSS has  conducted an annual survey of security officers at cleared contractor  facilities over which DSS has cognizance to obtain their best estimates of  the number of background investigations they would require over the next  7 years. Using those estimates and historical data, DSS then prepares its  annual security clearance projections for industry personnel. For fiscal  year 2003, DSS asked each facility for the number and types of clearances  that they would need. DSS said that about 25 percent of the approximately  11,000 cleared contractor facilities voluntarily responded to this request,  but that 80 to 90 percent of the facilities with the largest dollar contracts  responded. DSS officials attributed the inaccurate projection estimate to  the use of some industry employees on more than one contract and often  for different defense agencies; the movement of employees from one  company to another; and unanticipated world events, such as the  September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Currently, DSS does not receive data  from DOD\u2019s acquisition community that issues the contracts\u2014primarily  military service and defense agency acquisition managers\u2014to help DSS  more accurately forecast the number and type of industrial personnel  security clearances that would be required to implement or support their  particular acquisition programs and activities.", "DOD is developing a plan to link the number of investigations required for  contract performance to an electronic database with personnel clearance  information, and to require that the contracting officer authorize the  number and type of investigations required.

Currently, Standard C mandates the same  investigative scope for all reinvestigations for top secret clearances,  whereas the phased approach uses different standards for clean versus  potential issue cases. Second, any change in Standard C would necessitate  a corresponding change in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Third, we acknowledged  policy changes, but many of the changes were implemented from 4 to 18  years earlier\u2014using waivers for clearance reinstatements and conversions  to eliminate the need to perform another investigation (2000),  implementing national investigative standards and adjudicative guidelines  (1999), utilizing full reciprocity (1997), and granting of interim clearances  to put industry personnel to work (1986). These positive steps must,  however, be considered in the context of major concerns that remain.  These concerns include the sizeable and long-standing backlog; the length  of time needed to conduct an investigation and determine eligibility for a  clearance, which now takes, on average, over 1 year to complete; the  failure to implement JPAS throughout DOD with all of its intended design  features, even though DOD said it would be implemented in fiscal year  2001; and DOD\u2019s declaration that its personnel security investigations  program has been a systemic weakness since fiscal year 2000. We believe  that our report presents a balanced representation of the improvements  and the failures that contributed to a long-standing problem that can  increase national security risks; affect the timeliness, quality, and costs of  contractor performance on national-security-related contracts; and  ultimately increase costs to the federal government.", "DOD\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix III.

We also met with selected industrial contractors and  industry associations whose employees and members are affected by the  DOD backlog and delays in conducting investigations and determining  eligibility for security clearances. We conducted our work in Washington,  D.C., at DOD, including the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Intelligence (OUSD ); Defense Security Service (DSS); and the Defense  Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA); at the Office of Personnel  Management; the Information Security Oversight Office at the National  Archives and Records Administration; and at the Personnel Security  Working Group of the National Security Council\u2019s Policy Coordinating  Committee on Records Access and Information Security.

In addition, we held discussions with officials  representing industry associations, including the Northern Virginia  Technology Council and the National Classification Management Society  in Washington, D.C.; via telephone with the Shipbuilders Council of  America; with officials from the Information Technology Association of  America, Arlington, Virginia; and with representatives from the Aerospace  Industries Association and National Defense Industrial Association,  Linthicum, Maryland.", "To determine the size of the security clearance backlog and changes  during the last 3 fiscal years in the amount of time it takes to conduct an  investigation and issue a clearance eligibility determination, we met with  DSS and DOHA officials to obtain the relevant data from the Case Control  Management System and discussed their methods for determining what  constitutes a backlog. As part of the process for estimating the backlog,  we observed the steps used to process investigative and adjudicative  information during our visits to the DSS Personnel Investigations Center,  DISCO, and DOHA. During these site visits, we obtained information on  the number of days required to complete an investigation or adjudication,  the time frames for designating what constitutes an investigative or  adjudicative backlog, and data reliability through questionnaires and  interviews. Our Applied Research and Methods team assisted us in  reviewing the reliability of the databases used to determine the backlog.  We also examined data for fiscal years 2001 to 2003 to track changes in  how long it took industry personnel to obtain a clearance during  those years. We discuss developments during the first half of fiscal  year 2004, where appropriate, so that information is current as of  March 31, 2004.", "To identify the reasons or impediments for the backlog and delays in  conducting investigations and issuing eligibility determinations, we  reviewed reports by GAO, DOD Office of the Inspector General, House  Committee on Government Reform, Defense Personnel Security Research  Center, Information Security Oversight Office, and the Joint Security  Commission II. We interviewed officials from DSS, DISCO, and DOHA and  observed and reviewed their procedures. We also discussed impediments  with officials of OUSD (I), the Defense Personnel Security Research  Center, the Information Security Oversight Office, and the Chair of the  Personnel Security Working Group of the National Security Council, as  well as industry representatives. In addition, we reviewed these agencies\u2019  prior reports. Our Office of the General Counsel reviewed various public  laws; executive orders; federal regulations; and DOD policy  memorandums, directives, regulations, and manuals.", "To identify additional steps that DOD could take to reduce the time  needed to conduct investigations and issue eligibility determinations, we  reviewed prior reports to identify previously suggested initiatives. We  supplemented this information with discussions on the status of those  previously identified steps, as well as ongoing initiatives, with both  industry representatives and government officials. Where appropriate, our  Applied Research and Methods team reviewed Defense Personnel Security  Research Center reports to help ensure that the center\u2019s (1) approaches  were methodogically sound, (2) sampling and statistical modeling  techniques were sufficient, and (3) proposed empirically based procedural  changes to DOD\u2019s security clearance process also were methodologically  sound. The team also reviewed industry association survey results and  evaluated the validity and reliability of the survey methodology and  results.", "We assessed the reliability of the data that were provided by DSS\u2019s Case  Control Management System and used to determine the investigative and  adjudicative backlog and the time needed to conduct an investigation and  determine eligibility for a security clearance by (1) reviewing existing  information about the data and system that produced them,  (2) interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data, and  (3) reviewing DISCO\u2019s and DOHA\u2019s responses to a detailed questionnaire  about their information technology data reliability. We determined that the  data for fiscal years 2001 and thereafter were sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of this report.", "The Case Control Management System also faced certain limitations,  which had an impact on our findings. Although the Case Control  Management System, which is used to obtain the backlog estimates, can  provide the total elapsed time between opening a case and issuing the final  security clearance eligibility determination, it is not capable of generating  separate time estimates for the intermediate stages of the clearance  process. Nor does it have the capability to identify how much time DOHA  needed to adjudicate issue cases. Therefore, all of the time-based findings  include the time period beginning when personnel security questionnaires  were entered into the Case Control Management System and ending when  DISCO notified the industrial contractor of the DISCO or DOHA  adjudicators\u2019 decisions to determine eligibility for a clearance. Thus, the  total number of days to determine eligibility for a clearance includes  investigative time; DISCO and possibly DOHA review time; additional  DISCO investigative time, if required; and DOHA\u2019s appeals process that  may follow the denial of a clearance request or the revocation of a  clearance. Finally, the Case Control Management System has the  capability to monitor overdue reinvestigations and generate accurate  estimates for that portion of the backlog for industry personnel; however,  it does not have this capability for military members and federal  employees.", "We conducted our review from July 2003 through May 2004 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

They include the following 13 guidelines and the reasons for concern.  1.  Allegiance to the United States: The willingness of an individual to  safeguard classified information is in doubt if there is any reason to  suspect the individual\u2019s allegiance to the United States.  2.  Foreign influence: A security risk may exist when an individual is  bound by affection, influence, or obligation to persons, such as family  members, who are not citizens of the United States or may be subject  to duress.  3.  Foreign preference: When an individual acts in such a way as to  indicate preference for a foreign country, such as possession and/or  use of a foreign passport, then he or she may be prone to make  decisions harmful to the interests of the United States.  4.  Sexual behavior: Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a  criminal offense; indicates a personality or emotional disorder; may  subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, exploitation, or  duress; or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.  5.  Personal conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment,  untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, or unwillingness to  comply with rules and regulations could indicate that an individual  may not properly safeguard classified information.  6.  Financial considerations: An individual who is financially  overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate  funds. Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from  financially profitable criminal acts.  7.  Alcohol consumption: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to  the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, and failure to  control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of  classified information due to carelessness.  8.  Drug involvement: Improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises  questions regarding an individual\u2019s willingness or ability to protect  classified information.  9.  Emotional, mental, or personality disorders: Emotional, mental, or  personality disorders are a security concern because they may indicate  a defect in judgment, reliability, or stability.  10.  Criminal conduct: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates  doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  11.  Security violations: Noncompliance with security regulations raises  doubt about an individual\u2019s trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to  safeguard classified information.  12.  Outside activities: Involvement in certain types of outside  employment or activities is a security concern if it poses a conflict  with an individual\u2019s security responsibilities and could create an  increased risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information.  13.  Misuse of information technology systems: Noncompliance with  rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations pertaining to information  technology systems may raise security concerns about an individual\u2019s  trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to properly protect classified  systems, networks, and information.", "The guidelines state that each case is to be judged on its own merits and  that a final determination to grant, deny, or revoke access to classified  information is the responsibility of the specific department or agency.  The adjudicators are to consider available, reliable information about the  person\u2014past and present, favorable and unfavorable\u2014in reaching an  \u201coverall common sense\u201d clearance-eligibility determination that gives  careful consideration to the 13 adjudicative guidelines.
