Grantees may choose to provide center-based programs, home-based programs, or a combination of both.", "Once approved for funding as a result of a competitive application process, Head Start grantees do not compete for funding in succeeding years. However, they are required to submit applications for continuation awards (hereafter called awards) to support their programs beyond the initial grantee budget year. After Head Start receives its annual appropriation from the Congress, the respective HHS regional offices make awards to grantees in their administrative service areas at the beginning of each grantee\u2019s budget year as shown in table 1.", "Grantees use their awards for the following purposes, among others, to: purchase or rent a facility if providing a center-based program; hire qualified teachers, aides, and support staff; coordinate or contract with Public Health agencies and local health providers to deliver medical and dental services; buy or lease vehicles to transport children to Head Start centers; purchase utilities, services, and supplies needed to operate a center and administer the program; and comply with program standards and local building and health codes that ensure quality and safety.", "During a grantee budget year, grantees may also receive supplemental awards for specific purposes (such as expanding enrollment) or to cover normal, though sometimes unexpected, expenses such as repairing a roof or purchasing a new heating system.

HHS permits grantees to carry over unspent funds into the next grantee budget year to complete any program objectives that remain unmet from the previous year. HHS regional offices generally handle carryover funds in two ways: 1. Carryover balances from a previous year or years are added to an award that a grantee receives in a subsequent year. This procedure is known as \u201creprogramming\u201d funds, and the amount of carryover funds added to a grantee\u2019s award is called total obligating authority (TOA). 2.

Twice in fiscal year 1990 and once each in fiscal years 1991, 1992, and 1993, the Congress appropriated additional funding for Head Start to, among other things, increase local enrollments, strengthen the program\u2019s social, health, and parent involvement components; improve services for disabled children; initiate and improve literacy programs; and enhance salaries, benefits, training, and technical assistance for program staff.

We considered these spending variances small if the amount of unspent funds was 5 percent or less of a grantee\u2019s award in a given year. These small budget variances could have occurred because, for example, (1) grantees\u2019 projected budgets\u2014upon which grant awards are based\u2014did not equal their actual expenditures or (2) grantees did not purchase an item or service as originally planned. For example, a grantee in Ohio had ordered two buses and playground equipment for its Head Start center. However, these items were not delivered nor paid for before the grantee\u2019s budget year ended, resulting in an unspent balance of $84,762."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Timing Issues", "paragraphs": ["We found that from 10 to 24 percent of grantees with unspent balances in grantee budget years 1992 through 1994 (1) had problems renovating or building a center, which delayed planned expenditures until subsequent years, or (2) received additional funding late in a grantee budget year, making it difficult for grantees to spend all of their funds before year\u2019s end. For example, a Head Start grantee in Colorado received funding to increase its program enrollment in early September 1991\u2014about 2 months before the grantee\u2019s budget year was to end on October 30. Due to the short time remaining, the grantee could not spend $89,980 of the amount awarded for expanding program enrollment. This same grantee had agreed verbally with a private company to prepare a site so that the grantee could place a modular unit on it to serve as a Head Start center. Site preparation would have involved establishing water, sewer, gas, and electrical hookups at the site. Before any work began, however, new owners took over the company and did not honor the verbal agreement between the grantee and the previous owner. It took the grantee 2 years to find another site suitable for the center, and that facility required extensive renovations.", "HHS\u2019 Office of Inspector General reported in 1991 and 1993 that acquiring adequate, affordable space was a major problem for Head Start grantees attempting to expand program enrollments. Grantees told the Inspector General\u2019s office that it can take up to a year to find suitable space that then may have to be renovated. Strict construction licensing requirements and delays in license approval could also slow spending for center construction or renovation. The Inspector General reported that space problems were most prevalent among grantees funded to increase enrollment by more than 200 children. The grantees believed that being notified at least 6 months in advance of funding disbursements would help to alleviate this problem.", "Head Start grantees interviewed by the Inspector General\u2019s staff also said that receiving expansion funding late in the budget year results in carryover fund balances. After expansion, more than twice as many grantees interviewed had carryover balances of over $50,000.

For our analysis, we defined carryover funds as any unspent funds used to either offset or add to a grantee\u2019s award during a subsequent budget year. Carryover funds are not always added to or offset in the year immediately following the year the unspent funds occurred. For example, a grantee in Florida with $45,913 in unspent funds in grantee budget year 1992 did not have this amount totally added to or offset as carryover funds in grantee budget year 1993. In fact, $45,759 was added to its budget year 1993 award and the remaining $154 was used to offset the grantee\u2019s budget year 1994 award. A grantee in Minnesota, on the other hand, had $3,840 from grantee budget year 1993 added to its budget year 1995 award. Yet, a Michigan grantee had its entire grantee budget year 1992 unspent balance of $1,568 offset as carryover funds in 1993.", "On the basis of our analysis of grantee files, we found that in grantee budget year 1993 HHS added about half of all carryover funds to grantees\u2019 awards as TOA and the remaining proportion of carryover funds was offset as NOA.

NOA for the same period ranged from $59 to $664,700 and averaged about $39,000.", "In grantee budget year 1994, we found that about three-fourths of carryover funding was added to awards as TOA, and the remainder was offset as NOA. Of the grantees in our sample with TOA in grantee budget year 1994, the amount of unspent funds added to grantee awards ranged from $3,200 to $2.4 million and averaged about $197,400.

Of the $97 million of TOA carryover funds, the intended use of 40 percent of these funds was for expansion and 37 percent was for facilities. Data from the files indicated that about 23 percent of the total TOA for these years was reportedly to be used for capital equipment, supplies, and other purposes such as staff training and moving expenses.

Depending on the size of grantees\u2019 awards, their reported unspent balances in those years ranged from as little as $2 to about $2 million. On the basis of Head Start files, we determined in most cases that these unspent balances resulted from (1) small differences between grantees\u2019 budget estimates and actual expenditures; (2) grantee problems renovating or constructing facilities, which delayed planned expenditures; and (3) the receipt of supplemental funding by grantees late in their budget year, which made it difficult for grantees to spend their funds before year\u2019s end.
