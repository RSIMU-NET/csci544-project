This report describes the factors considered and actions taken by airport operators, government officials, developers, and others to facilitate airport-centric development.", "To do this work, GAO identified five factors that facilitate airport-centric development from relevant literature, interviews with experts, and observations at selected U.S. airports and their surrounding regions. GAO examined these factors by reviewing relevant documents and interviewing stakeholders, including airport officials, business owners, representatives of development organizations, and federal, state, and local government officials. GAO selected 14 airports for more in-depth study. These airports were selected based on annual passenger enplanements and cargo amounts, and experts' recommendations. The findings from these 14 airports cannot be generalized but provide insights that may be of interest to stakeholders in other regions. GAO is not making recommendations in this report. The Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration, and others provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that airport operators, government officials, real estate developers, and other regional stakeholders are taking actions consistent with five factors when pursuing airport-centric development (development on the airport property to enhance the airport's nonaeronautical revenue and development outside the airport that leverages a region's proximity to the airport).", "Development at the airport. Airport operators are developing or enhancing the number and types of services within airport terminals for passengers and visitors such as upscale shops and personal services; they are also developing services for passengers and businesses outside of the terminal areas but on airport property such as hotels and business centers.", "Air and surface connectivity. Most stakeholders GAO spoke with noted that a region's ability to connect to a variety of domestic and international destinations by air is important in attracting businesses, tourists, and cargo to the region. In addition to air connectivity, the routes taken by passengers or cargo to and from the airport may be enhanced by efficient highway, rail, and port connections. One example is the Metrorail extension, which will connect Dulles International Airport with downtown Washington DC.", "Funding sources. Transportation improvements for airport-centric development may entail large capital-intensive projects that generally require pooling money from different sources. The federal government has a number of programs, such as grants from the Economic Development Administration, designed to support regional transportation-infrastructure development. State and locally generated money--such as state transportation trust funds, dedicated sales taxes, and highway tolls--have been used to match federal funds. Stakeholders in Memphis, for example, were awarded a $1.26 million grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, matched with $900,000 in local funds and in-kind services, to develop a master plan for their airport-centric development efforts. The private sector may also provide funding through a public-private partnership agreement.", "Development in the region. Stakeholders GAO spoke with identified a variety of mechanisms to attract businesses, such as linking airport development to commercial activities in the region; identifying and leveraging unique cultural, tourist, or general qualities of the region; developing industry clusters (groups of complementary businesses); and designing policies or providing incentives to attract businesses to the region.", "Stakeholder collaboration. Collaboration among various stakeholders can help achieve specific airport-centric goals. Consultation with residents near the airport and with committee composed of representatives from the airport and the public and private sectors is important; the lack of such consultation can make it difficult to implement development plans. GAO found that multilateral committees representing airport, public-sector, and private-sector groups had been established to promote airport-centric development."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In an effort to increase airports\u2019 efficiency in moving passengers and  cargo while bolstering the economies of regions surrounding airports,  some domestic and international airport owners and operators,  government officials, and business owners are exploring opportunities to  strategically develop airports and the regions around them.

These  stakeholders view airports as a central piece of their development efforts,  believing that businesses in close proximity to an airport can use that  proximity as a marketing tool. For businesses that seek to satisfy  consumer demand for timely delivery of goods and services, this close  proximity can be an element of their business plans. Some efforts are  also under way in the United States to promote development at airports  and in the regions around them.", "There have been several efforts in Congress to recognize this type of  development (also sometimes referred to as an \u201caerotropolis\") as being  eligible for federal funding. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st  Century Act (MAP-21), which reauthorized several surface transportation  programs, contains a provision that directs the Secretary of  Transportation to establish a program to assist states in \u201cstrategically  directing resources toward improving the efficiency of freight movement,  on highways, intermodal connectors, and aerotropolis transportation  systems.\u201d Other bills to specifically include development at and around  airports were introduced in the 112th Congress, but were not enacted.", "Given the possible economic benefits of airport-centric development, you  requested that we examine such development efforts. This report  describes factors airport stakeholders identified as considerations for  airport-centric development and some of the actions taken by airport  operators, government officials, and developers to facilitate airport-centric  development. For the purpose of this report, we define airport-centric  development as development on the airport property to enhance the  airport\u2019s nonaeronautical revenue (see panel A of fig. 1) and development  outside the airport that is intended to help the region economically by  leveraging its proximity to the airport (see panel B of fig. 1).", "To address our objective, we identified factors that facilitate airport-centric  development from relevant literature, interviews with experts, and our  observations at selected U.S. airports and regions. We reviewed  academic, industry, and government reports and other documents  describing the role of the nation\u2019s air transportation system, defining  airport-centric development and related concepts, and identifying the key  factors relevant for reviewing and understanding the nature and scope of  airport-centric developments. From this work, we developed an  organizational framework consisting of five factors considered by officials  from airports and jurisdictions when pursuing airport-centric development.", "We selected 12 airportsstudy of airport-centric development activities and the regions in which  they were located. We selected these airports because of their passenger  enplanements and annual cargo-weight landed and based on media  releases about regions looking to leverage their airport to promote  development, and experts\u2019 recommendations. In addition to the 12  airports with scheduled-airline service, we also studied two industrial  airports that specialize in cargo and business services. We selected these  two industrial airports based on their airport-centric development efforts.  (See app. II for profiles of the airports in our study.)   with scheduled-airline service for more in-depth  We conducted semi-structured interviews of airport officials, officials from  businesses located adjacent to or near airports, representatives of  international and national real-estate development organizations, local  and regional economic-development specialists, and federal, state, and  local government officials. The focus of these interviews was to gather  information on airport-centric development efforts from the perspective of  knowledgeable stakeholders. As a result, interviews inquired into the  officials\u2019 activities and motivations and their perspectives on the regional  assets they identified as part of their development efforts. In collecting  this information, we did not verify the accuracy of stakeholders\u2019  statements, but instead used their statements to understand the  perspectives of those participating in airport-centric development at the  sites we selected. We use the indefinite quantifier, \u201csome\u201d \u201cmany,\u201d and  \u201cmost\u201d to inform the reader of the approximate quantity of stakeholder or  interviewee type within the regions where we interviewed who agreed  with the particular statement or idea (see app.III for an explanation of how  these indefinite quantifiers are used). We also reviewed the airports\u2019  financial data from about 1997 through 2011, master plans, and other  project plans. We analyzed the information obtained from these sources  to better understand the context in which the regional stakeholders and  airport operators approached airport-centric development.", "We conducted our work from June 2011 to March 2013, in accordance  with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant  to our objective. The framework requires that we plan and perform the  engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to meet our  stated objectives and to discuss any limitations in our work.

Airports have long served as places for planes to take off and  land, consisting of runways, control towers, terminals and other facilities  that directly served airlines\u2019 passengers and cargo. Airlines play a key  role in the functioning of airport systems because they make decisions  about which airports to serve and how frequently to provide service.  Airlines may consider a number of factors in making these decisions,  such as the presence of regional businesses and residents who are  potential customers, the market share that can be obtained, the effects on  their service network, and the service provided by competing carriers.", "Over the last three decades some airports began providing a greater  range of passenger and business services and increasing their  concessions to increase their revenue stream. Airport operators began to  view airports as a destination as well as a place from which to take off  and land. By the early 2000s, many airports focused on upscale  concessions, such as exclusive restaurants and designer boutiques, and  other premium services, such as rental car facilities and parking facilities  linked to the airport, to help maximize revenue generation.", "John Kasarda, an airport and development expert, along with other  researchers, noted these changes occurring at airports, both nationally  and internationally, and began researching commercial development on  airport property\u2014referred to as the airport city\u2014more than 15 years ago.  According to Kasarda and other researchers, development on the airport  spills over to the surrounding region and results in a new urban growth  form with the airport at its center. (See app. IV for a selected  bibliography.) According to Kasarda, this new urban growth form, for  which he coined the phrase, \u201caerotropolis,\u201d is similar to the growth of the  traditional metropolis, in which the central city is linked to the suburbs  through a surface transportation system.", "Studies on growth around airports have found that businesses that  require or benefit from air transport seek locations near the airport,  extending as far as 20 miles. Regional corporate headquarters,  information and communications technology complexes, retail, hotel and  entertainment centers, manufacturing facilities, trade representative  offices, big-box retail stores, health, wellness, and fitness centers,  conference centers, and residential developments, for example, are  increasingly being established near airports as a part of airport-centric  development. Researchers have noted that plans for such development  involve arrangements for targeted development to facilitate the efficient  flow of surface traffic, attract complementary businesses, and mitigate  environmental contaminants usually associated with airports to increase  the speed at which airport-centric development occurs. Researchers have  also noted that the benefits from the development on the airport property  reach far beyond the airport into the surrounding region, which can, in  turn, reciprocally benefit the airport.", "Globally, aviation and airport systems vary and, in practice, the  approaches to airport-centric development have varied. In several  European countries and in the United States, airports were established  decades ago and commercial development around most of those airports  evolved in a piecemeal or ad-hoc way, without centralized planning or the  cooperative efforts of airport operators, local and regional planners, and  business developers. In the United States, the last large airports serving  scheduled airlines that have been newly constructed on previously  undeveloped land were the Denver (1995) and Dallas/Fort Worth (1974)  International Airports. Operators at airports like Hong Kong and Incheon  in South Korea are beginning to incorporate elements of commercial  development at their airports and some operators have introduced  policies or incentives to encourage targeted airport-dependent land use  and development at and around the airports. In countries in which the  aviation and airport systems are much newer, such as China and the  United Arab Emirates, officials are employing a centralized planning and  cooperative approach to rapidly expand commercial development on and  around airports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financing Airports", "paragraphs": ["Airport operators at domestic airports with scheduled airline service rely  on revenue from two types of activities: aeronautical and  nonaeronautical. Aeronautical activities at an airport occur on the airfield  or in the terminal areas where airlines operate. For purposes of this  report, revenue generated from aeronautical activities includes fees  airports charge airlines to operate within the airport and other fees paid or  collected by aircraft operators, including Passenger Facility Charges  (PFCs), and Airport Improvement Program (AIP) grants.", "The Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) was introduced in 1990, Omnibus Reconciliation  Act of 1990. Pub.L. No. 101-508, \u00a7 9110, 104 Stat. 1388, codified as amended at 49  U.S.C. \u00a7 40117. financed through taxes on aviation fuel and passenger airline tickets.  Airports may also receive capital funds through state and local sources in  addition to federal funds.", "Airport operators may also borrow the funds needed to finance capital  projects through municipal bond markets.  Airport revenue, including  PFCs, may be used to pay debt service on bonds issued for eligible  projects. Because funds from bonds are issued based on projected  airport revenue, they are not considered by FAA to be a separate source  of airport revenue.", "Nonaeronautical activities include food and beverage, retail concessions,  and parking, automobile rentals, and rent on land and non-terminal  facilities, such as manufacturing, warehousing, and freight forwarding.  Nonaeronautical revenue may be used to reduce payments by airlines  and may also be used to maintain and improve commercial services.  (See fig. 2.) At some airports, terminals used by specific airlines are also  financed and built through agreements between the airlines and the  airports.", "Some airport operators are pursuing public-private partnerships (P3s) to  finance their commercial development efforts, outside of their financial  agreements with airlines. P3s are negotiated contractual agreements  between public entities, such as an airport, and a private entity such as a  contractor or developer. P3 contractual arrangements can allow  developers to build and operate a facility and then transfer the facility to  the airport, although there are various types of P3 arrangements. Under  one of these types of arrangements, the private developer provides all or  part of the financing and intends to capture its development or  management fees. This type of P3 arrangement can provide the airport  with the most leverage for commercial development."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Five Key Factors That Facilitate Airport- Centric Development", "paragraphs": ["Based on our research, we found that officials from airports and  jurisdictions considered the following factors when pursuing airport-centric  development:   (1)  development at the airport,   (2)  air and surface connectivity,   (3)   funding sources for development,   (4)  development in the region, and  (5)   collaboration among stakeholders. (See fig. 3.)   \u201cDevelopment at the airport\u201d refers to existing infrastructure already in  place and the actions of airport operators to enhance the viability of  their airport by focusing on commercial activities to increase airports\u2019  aeronautical and nonaeronautical revenue. \u201cAir and surface  connectivity\u201d includes the routes taken by passengers or cargo to and  from the airport to and from other destinations that may be enhanced  by highway, rail, and port construction and additional airline routes.  \u201cFunding sources for development\u201d include the funding for airport- centric developments as well as airport operations. \u201cDevelopment in  the region\u201d involves leveraging existing regional assets, expanding  existing assets, or attracting new employment opportunities and  business activity. \u201cCollaboration among stakeholders\u201d refers to the  various actions that stakeholders can take to reach the goals and  objectives that may further airport-centric development.", "An airport\u2019s ability to generate revenue and contribute to the regional  economy depends on its ability to attract airline service, passengers, and  cargo shipments. Airport operators\u2019 development efforts occur on airport  property and involve: (1) providing services that directly support airline  operations; (2) providing an expanded number and type of services within  the airport terminals for passengers and visitors from the region; and (3)  developing services for passengers and businesses, including airlines, on  airport property but outside of the terminal areas.", "Officials at most of the airports in our review believed that their ability to  attract and retain airlines was necessary to spur airport development. In  particular, airline operators pay for their use of airport services ranging  from the use of runways and cargo facilities, to the use of gates and ticket  counters. Revenue from airlines for these services constitutes an  important component of total airport revenue. In an effort to attract airlines  and generate additional revenue, most airport operators we interviewed  are expanding the number and type of services they offer, and some offer  financial incentives. For example, some airport operators have begun  offering services such as catering, maintenance, and warehousing that  airlines or other third parties previously provided. Miami International  Airport officials said that they waive landing fees for international and low  cost carriers for the first 2 years in which the airlines schedule flights to  Miami\u2014forgoing some current airport operational revenue to help  increase future airline operations while capturing more nonaeronautical  revenue.", "As airport operators seek to attract revenue from passengers and visitors,  they are renovating their terminals or improving their physical designs to  improve the flow of people to the shops, concessions, and gates. The  operators are also increasing the number and quality of retail and  services\u2014such as wine bars, massage spas, health care clinics, and high  fashion shops\u2014offered to passengers and, in some cases, visitors from  the local area. (See fig. 4.) For example, the Miami International Airport  was named one of the top 10 U.S. airports for dining and one of the  world\u2019s top 10 airports for retail shopping. The new $1.7 billion Tom  Bradley International Terminal at Los Angeles International Airport is to  contain 140,000 square feet for premier dining, retail shopping, and airline  club lounges. Also, the Atlanta City Council approved a $3-billion  concession contract for 126 food and beverage locations at 24 retail  locations at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.", "Airport officials we spoke with in Miami and Los Angeles International  Airports have cited the importance of passengers who arrive at or depart  from their airports for the regional economy rather than those passengers  connecting to other flights. Tourism is an important draw to each of these  regions, and airport officials have improved airport facilities to more  efficiently process and admit international visitors and tourists through  security and immigration and customs checkpoints. Airport officials at  these airports said that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) staffing  can be insufficient at peak travel times and were concerned that  international travelers might avoid their airports because of screening  delays. These officials also believe that improvements to their airports  could increase the rate of passenger and cargo processing if a sufficient  number of CBP agents were available to staff inspection booths at peak  travel times. However, many U.S. airports lack the space to expand their  security facilities, and therefore, may need to identify innovative  approaches to overcoming screening delays.", "Many airport operators are also developing airport property outside the  terminal area to attract businesses and to use available land to generate  revenue. Some have organized their management structures to include  development or real estate offices to coordinate with airport management,  developers, and public agencies. They are establishing commercial  services and activities, such as hotels, parking facilities, and logistics  parks, or leasing land for short-and medium-term use until it is needed in  the future.", "Most airport officials we spoke with said that the amount of available land  on the airport property was a factor in their ability to attract commercial  activities to the airport. Officials varied in the type and extent of  commercial activities or land uses they were pursuing.  Airport officials  from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport,  Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, Los  Angeles International Airport, and Miami International Airport said that the  amount of land they had available limited their development options on  airport property. According to officials in Miami, state law enabled the  Florida Department of Transportation and airport officials to obtain land  adjacent to the airport property for the development of an intermodal  transportation center. This center contains the rental car facility and  connections to the Metrorail and TriRail commuter rail systems that  service Miami and nearby cities. Airport officials at Indianapolis  International Airport partnered with a community college to develop a  worker-training program in logistics and distribution at the airport to meet  an anticipated growing need for this skill. Officials at Lambert-St. Louis  International Airport would like to develop cargo services, including  warehouses and cold storage facilities, to attract cargo operations that  could generate revenue at the airport. Their goal is to use cargo revenue  to lower the cost of passenger flights in an attempt to increase passenger  traffic. In addition, airports with land not being used for operation have  found ways to generate revenue through temporary or short-term leases  of airport property while also reserving the land for future aeronautical  needs. We found that Indianapolis and Denver International Airports plan  to develop solar energy farms on airport property; Denver International  Airport produces more solar energy than any other airport with scheduled  airline service in the United States. Officials at Dallas/Fort Worth  International Airport have leased a portion of the airport property for oil  extraction. See figure 5 for examples of such airport land use and  development.", "In two localities, airport and regional officials indicated that activities in the  region were contributing to the commercial viability of the airport.  Regional officials told us that, in part, because of the U.S. automotive  industry\u2019s presence in Detroit, several of the leading Asian automobile  manufacturers have established research and development facilities in  the Detroit metropolitan area. In addition, these officials said that a vibrant  Asian community, the availability of highly skilled engineering workforce,  and access to institutions of higher education offering degrees relevant to  their careers attracted Asian automobile industry researchers. According  to regional officials, these activities have increased the traffic at Detroit  Metropolitan Wayne County Airport.", "Officials from Miami International Airport and the region discussed the  symbiotic relationship between Miami International Airport and the Port of  Miami. According to an official, the Port of Miami is the busiest cruise port  in the world with over 4 million passengers annually. Of these  passengers, 60 percent arrived in Miami through Miami International  Airport. The construction of rail connections between the port, downtown  area, and airport is expected to facilitate connectivity. These officials  noted that the expansion of the Panama Canal to accommodate larger  ships in 2014 will benefit Miami because large ships can use the Port of  Miami and is to help to promote trade with Asia. If this expected growth in  cargo operations occurs, then, according to port officials, the Miami  region will benefit and, in turn, contribute to the growth of Miami  International Airport by expanding its potential passenger and cargo  markets.", "Most stakeholders we spoke with believe that a region\u2019s ability to connect  to a variety of domestic and international locations by air is key to  attracting businesses, tourists, and cargo to the region. Airport and  regional officials sought to increase the number and frequency of flights to  a variety of locations by establishing new relationships with foreign  airports and business groups and offering incentives to airlines for  additional destinations by the airlines. For example, airport and regional  officials in Atlanta and Paris have begun cooperating on ways to promote  their airport areas for business exchanges. Similarly, Miami International  Airport officials visited and reciprocally hosted South African business  groups to encourage business development and the flow of passengers  and cargo between their respective regions. In July 2012, airport  operators at the Memphis International Airport began a $1 million  incentive program to attract new, non-stop domestic and international  routes.", "Despite efforts by airports to maintain good air connectivity to many  locations, it is airlines that make decisions about what routes to fly. Most  airport officials noted that the airlines\u2019 decisions to change or eliminate  routes can sometimes negatively affect the region\u2019s level of air  connectivity. In recent years, the General Mitchell International Airport in  Milwaukee experienced a period of growth followed by a decline because  of airline business decisions. According to the airport operator, the  presence of three low-cost carriers increased the number of flight  offerings, but the subsequent merger of two of those airlines and  relocation of the third resulted in fewer flights. Similarly, officials in  Memphis were concerned about potential loss of air services after a major  airline announced plans to decrease its passenger services at Memphis  International Airport in response to low demand making the route  uneconomical for the airline. Among our selection of airports, international  connectivity varied. For example, as of February 2013, 33 airlines served  Dulles International Airport, offering direct flights to more than 40  destinations in Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and parts of Europe,  South America, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. By comparison, direct  flights from General Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee were  limited to destinations in the United States, Mexico, and the Caribbean.  Because cargo may be transported below the passenger decks of  airplanes, a decline in international passenger flight offerings may affect  a region\u2019s potential to directly provide cargo access to international  markets for those businesses that rely on air services.", "In addition to air connectivity, officials we spoke with discussed the need  to improve the connectivity of their surface transportation system to  attract businesses, especially those that handle time-sensitive or high- value goods such as perishable items or electronic components. These  officials cited the importance of identifying and marketing the various  transportation modes of a particular region. For example, as mentioned,  officials at the Port of Miami estimated that 60 percent of its cruise ship  passengers arrive by air. This, they said, highlights the importance of an  efficient connection between the airport and the seaport for moving  tourists to and from cruise ships. Miami International Airport officials also  highlighted the importance of an airport to highway connections for  importing and distributing perishable items, including flowers and  produce, from Latin America. They noted that many trucks transport  cargo from the airport to the federal highway system daily, helping to  distribute perishable food and produce imports to the United States.  These officials also said that a viaduct dedicated to truck traffic was being  built to stem a projected loss of $1 billion in revenue by 2015 because of  congestion on the roads between the cargo area inside the airport and  the warehouses and freight forwarders in the nearby city of Doral.  At  Indianapolis International Airport, officials cited the region\u2019s rail and  highway connectivity and the presence of FedEx facilities as important  infrastructure to support a growing logistics, freight-forwarding, and  distribution industry. Airport officials and other regional stakeholders in  Memphis market its \u201cFour Rs\u201d\u2014road, river, rail, and runway\u2014to appeal to  businesses that may rely on intermodal transportation. Figure 6 illustrates  intermodal transportation systems and surface transportation connectivity.", "With access to multiple modes of transport, businesses can determine  shipping routes and methods that are cost-effective and meet customer  requirements. (See table 1 for examples of multimodal transportation at  airports.) FedEx, for example, determines which mode is the most cost  effective based on fuel prices, distance traveled, and time of travel and  selects the mode to use. Stakeholders in the Memphis region also noted  that the airport\u2019s geographic location provides companies with timely  access to major U.S. markets and many places around the world.  According to a FedEx official, their ability to reach two-thirds of the U.S.  population within 12 hours and most international locations overnight was  a key factor in locating in Memphis.", "Many stakeholders told us that a region cannot fully benefit from an  efficiently run airport if the surface transportation needed to access the  airport is congested. Surface congestion can increase costs, contribute to  system inefficiencies, and delay on-time freight delivery. These  stakeholders also considered ways to increase public transportation  options to relieve congestion from roads while providing alternate  transportation options to travelers and airport workers. Most regions in  our review offer local bus services to their airports and many also offer  local rail services, or plan to offer new rail connections between the  airport and the central business district, downtown, for example, in Miami,  Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and Denver. Alternatively, a well- integrated surface transportation network can provide the basis for an  efficient logistics and distribution services within a region. Many experts  we spoke to agreed that intermodal networks consisting of highways, rail  capabilities, or waterways, linked to the airport may facilitate airport- centric development by improving mobility and allowing more people and  cargo to access the airport.", "Some experts we spoke with, as well as literature sources,advancements in high speed rail and the potential for code sharing across  modes of transportation as a way to free up additional capacity at the  airport in some congested regions of the country and extend the region  served by an airport. Under a code sharing arrangement, integrated air- rail ticketing would allow a passenger to use both modes of travel through  one purchase transaction. Some experts believe that high speed rail  development could help contribute to the commercial development of  airports. California is considering options as it develops its high-speed rail  capabilities, with one potential plan to link San Diego through Los  Angeles to Sacramento and San Francisco and airport officials in Miami  told us that they believed a high speed rail link between Miami and  Orlando would increase the number of passengers at Miami International  Airport. Other experts, however, believe that high-speed rail could divert  demand from air transport and reduce the need for commercial  development at airports, especially if high speed rail is not directly linked  to airports. Currently, roads and light rail affect airport development more  than high speed rail."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Funding Sources", "paragraphs": ["Transportation improvements for airport-centric development may entail  large capital-intensive projects that generally require pooling money from  different sources. Federal funds are often sought, but airport and regional  officials also seek other sources of funds for their development efforts,  particularly intermodal funding and public-private partnership funding. The  failure to obtain adequate funding can prevent or inhibit the growth of  these airport-centric projects. Officials from the City and County of St.  Louis and the State of Missouri were unable to obtain the funding they  needed for airport-centric development after airport and the private sector  representatives formed the Midwest-China Hub Commission in 2008.  After establishing a freight and commercial logistics facility at the airport,  the commission sought to attract regularly scheduled freight service to  Asia and Latin America and obtain foreign direct investment. Members of  the commission visited China, established an office in Beijing, and hosted  visitors from China. A Chinese cargo airline began scheduled flights to St.  Louis in 2011; however, its operations were not sustainable without  financial assistance, according to airport officials at Lambert-St. Louis  International Airport. Stakeholders sought to obtain $480 million in state  funding to: (1) subsidize the cost of initially flying goods out of the St.  Louis region to China (2) provide tax breaks to companies engaging in  foreign trade at the airport, and (3) subsidize the cost of constructing  millions of square feet of warehouse and factory space in locations across  the region. The commission was unable to obtain state funding and is  delaying their airport-centric development efforts while it seeks funding  from other sources.", "According to an April, 2011, evaluation of the Global TransPark logistics   the TransPark received  airport-centric effort in Kinston, North Carolina,a total of $248 million in funding from local, state, federal, and private  sources\u2014far short of the estimated $733 million total cost of the complex.  Evaluators found that the TransPark Authority was unable to repay a $25  million loan that had been made in 1993, because operations at the  TransPark did not generate sufficient funds to repay the loan. The  balance of the loan\u2014$39.9 million because of interest accrual as of  February 2011\u2014is to be repaid by the state of North Carolina. One expert  attributed the Global TransPark\u2019s failure to attract sufficient business  activities to recover costs in a timely manner to an original project design  that was too optimistic and the financial risks surrounding large-scale  projects.", "As shown in table 2, the federal government has a number of programs  designed to support regional transportation infrastructure development,  which some regions have leveraged as part of their airport-centric  development efforts.", "Although federal sources of funding\u2014such as those identified above\u2014 can sometimes be used to develop intermodal capabilities at U.S.  airports, the primary planning and development responsibilities for these  efforts rest with state and local government agencies. State and locally  generated money\u2014such as state transportation trust funds, dedicated  sales taxes, and highway tolls\u2014have been used to match federal funds.  For example, contributions from the Commonwealth of Virginia, the  Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, Fairfax and Loudoun  Counties, and toll revenues from the Dulles Toll Road will be used to pay  for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Metrorail  connection to Dulles International Airport. A \u201ctransportation improvement  district\u201d was also established to help fund the Metrorail extension from  downtown Washington, D.C. to the airport. States may also have their  own credit assistance programs. For example, Florida used funds from its  credit assistance bank to provide loans to help develop the Miami  Intermodal Center at the Miami International Airport. The Miami  Intermodal Center has levied a customer facility charge on car rentals to  pay for its consolidated rental car facility.", "Some airport operators and an expert with whom we spoke said that  FAA\u2019s grant assurances and obligations\u2014that is, requirements on the use  of federally administered funds\u2014can limit the airport operator\u2019s ability to  fund certain types of intermodal projects. For example, airport operators  may use PFCs or AIP grants to fund rail access at airports, if the project  is owned by the airport, located on airport property, and used exclusively  by airport passengers and employees. PFCs may be used to fund related  activities when they are a necessary part of an eligible access road or  facility.  This requirement on the use of PFCs exists to avoid revenue diversion-the use of airport revenue for other than airport purposes.   According to an expert we spoke with, the failure to meet these conditions   may preclude an airport from using such funding to connect with a transit  line that connects communities on each side to the airport because FAA  would require that riders on the transit line begin or end their journey at  the airport, rather than bypassing the airport.", "There are also federal restrictions on the development and sale of airport-  owned land and the use of revenues generated from an airport\u2019s land  because of the grant assurances an airport accepts as a condition of  receiving federal land or funds. Other funding sources on which airport  operators generally rely to improve or commercially develop their airports,  such as state grants and bonds, also involve various assurances.", "A public-private partnership (P3) for airport-centric development usually  refers to a contractual agreement formed between a public airport and  private sector developers for the developers to renovate or construct and  operate or manage an airport\u2019s facilities on airport land. Some airport  operators view public-private partnership arrangements to commercially  develop airports as an alternative or supplementary funding source to  funds that may be limited by federal restrictions or grant assurances. The  particular arrangements of public-private partnerships vary considerably,  but developers may finance, design, build, operate, and maintain an  enterprise (including charging fees) for a specific time period, after which  ownership of the enterprise reverts back to the airport in most P3  arrangements.", "The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey partnered with the private sector for the  $1.2-billion expansion of Terminal 4 at John F. Kennedy International Airport, which when  it opened in 2001, represented the largest P3 of its kind at a North American airport. In  October 2012, the Port Authority issued a request for qualifications for a P3 to replace  LaGuardia\u2019s main terminal in addition to new roads and taxiways with anticipated  construction beginning in 2014. debt already incurred to renovate the airport\u2019s terminals. We have  previously reported on the benefits and trade-offs of P3s and have  expressed concern about how the public interest is protected in these  projects. The most recent surface transportation reauthorization, MAP- 21, requires the Secretary of Transportation to develop standardized P3  agreements, identify best practices, and provide technical assistance to  P3 project sponsors.", "Denver International Airport illustrates another possible type of public- private funding, although a type that is likely to be of limited use to most  U.S. airports. Denver International Airport, as part of the Denver  Department of Aviation, receives funds from the sale and development of  Denver\u2019s previous airport, Stapleton. This land is being zoned as mixed- use and being developed primarily as residential communities. To  develop the Stapleton site, a private non-profit corporation established by  the city of Denver and the Denver Urban Renewal Authority, had to re- grade the site to provide adequate storm water drainage; install water,  sewer, and other utility lines; develop roads and interchanges; plan and  develop parks and trails; preserve wetlands; and install community  facilities, such as fire stations, a recreation center, a branch library, and  schools."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Development in the Region", "paragraphs": ["Most local government and private sector officials with whom we spoke  promoted their region\u2019s existing assets and proximity to the airport to  attract or expand businesses that benefit from air connectivity. Officials  identified a variety of mechanisms to attract businesses, such as (1)  linking airport development to commercial activities in the region, (2)  identifying and leveraging unique cultural aspects of the region and  promoting tourism or the general quality of life offered by the area, (3)  developing industry clusters,incentives to attract businesses to the region. and (4) designing policies and providing  Local government officials at many localities indicated that activities on  airport grounds contributed to development in the region around the  airport.  Officials at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport told us  that based on a 2009 economic impact study of the airport; they expected  a new international terminal to increase airport operations and attract  businesses and create jobs in the region surrounding the airport. These  airport officials noted that regional stakeholders have already established  two new hotels, an office building, and the Georgia International  Convention Center on property near the airport. The Mayor of Denver has  said that development at the Denver International Airport has the potential  to spur commercial development in the Denver region for decades,  including development along a planned commuter rail corridor that  connects the airport with downtown Denver. The Regional Transportation  DistrictAirport; airport officials are planning to build the terminal station and, in  conjunction with the city of Denver, one or two additional stations to  encourage development in the resulting corridor between the city of  Denver and the airport.   is building electrified commuter rail to Denver International  Cargo service airports can also contribute to regional development. For  example, Alliance Global Logistics Hub, an industrial cargo airport near  Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, developed in 1982, has attracted  more than $7 billion in investments and 290 corporate residents, including  50 companies listed on the Fortune 500, Global 500 or Forbes\u2019 Top List of  Private Firms. Although the North Carolina Global TransPark in Kinston,  North Carolina, has not attracted the initial investment or new jobs initially  envisioned, some development has taken place. The TransPark has, as  of February 2013, attracted 13 tenants. One of the tenants received a Job  Development Incentive Grant from the North Carolina Department of  Commerce, and is expected to employ more than 1,000 workers by 2014.  An official representing the TransPark said that new developments like  the TransPark take time to fully install supporting transportation  infrastructure and utilities to attract tenants, but hopes that additional  companies will locate at the TransPark.", "Officials at Los Angeles and Miami International Airports cited cultural ties  to other regions of the world and tourism as important drivers of  passengers and cargo traffic. For example, airport officials in Los Angeles  said that the city has large Korean and Iranian populations, and Miami  airport officials spoke of the city\u2019s close cultural ties with Latin America.  Officials in Los Angeles said that the large population of Asians in the Los  Angeles region has reinforced strong cultural ties to Asian countries and  has helped to support trade with these countries. Similarly, officials in  Miami said that tourists from Latin America and the Caribbean visit Miami,  in part, because of the cultural familiarity, the access to world-class tourist  attractions and cruise ships, and the shopping options that may be  unavailable in their countries of origin. In both locations, the regional  aspects helped to attract visitors who use the airport and spend money in  the region. Officials in Memphis said that some of their development  efforts, such as developing Elvis Presley Boulevard and the potential  redevelopment of downtown Memphis, are intended to increase tourism  and attract more passenger flights to the area. They also noted that by  drawing visitors to the region, the airport would generate additional  revenue and airlines might offer more flights to the region.", "In some regions, local officials told us that they were trying to attract  complementary businesses to form industry clusters that might benefit  from the availability of a skilled and interchangeable, or transferrable,  workforce. For example, officials in Miami have been fostering growth in  the region\u2019s banking, insurance and legal services, by promoting its  multicultural and multilingual workforce and its direct air connectivity to  Latin America and the Caribbean. Stakeholders involved with business  development in the Baltimore region expected that the influx of military  jobs at Fort Meade would result in the growth of defense contracting jobs  in the region. These officials anticipate that defense contracting jobs will,  in turn, lead to additional growth in the region. For example, one regional  stakeholder noted that the growing number of government consultants  rely heavily on air transportation and area hotels. Executives at a private  corporation in Detroit told us that they are trying to attract compatible  businesses that could leverage the region\u2019s strength in research and  development in automobile electronics.", "Most local officials we spoke with have implemented state, regional, or  local tax-based incentives and land use policies to attract businesses and  developers to their regions. For example, airport officials in Indiana,  Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia have applied to  the U.S. Department of Commerce for foreign trade zone designation at  and around their airports to support tax-free manufacturing. Stakeholders  in Detroit leveraged state-approved tax incentives to attract businesses  that rely on the airport for commerce to a 60,000 acre area around the  Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County and Willow Run Airports. Local  planning officials have affected particular land uses near airports through  planning policies, including policies related to noise, environmental quality  (air, water, wetland, species protection), and zoning restrictions. This can  help with airport-centric development because it prioritizes limited  developable land for uses that are compatible with airport operations and  compliant with local, state, and federal requirements. At the Hartsfield- Jackson Atlanta International Airport, a private developer cleaned up an  abandoned industrial site east of the airport and sold a portion of the land  to the City of Atlanta for the airport\u2019s use and sold another portion to a  high-end auto manufacturer. The auto manufacturer expressed interest in  purchasing more land from the developer to attract another high-end auto  manufacturer to develop and share a track on the site to attract  prospective buyers to fly into the region to test drive cars.", "Airport officials in three of the regions in our study said they have  considered the potential to utilize one airport primarily for passengers with  a nearby airport for cargo; however, those officials also identified potential  challenges to splitting passenger and cargo operations. For example,  officials from Los Angeles International Airport told us that it would be  inefficient to move their cargo operations to nearby Ontario Airport in the  Los Angeles region because much of the cargo passing through their  airport travels in the lower deck of passenger planes. Officials at Detroit  Metropolitan Wayne County Airport said they use nearby Willow Run  industrial airport for air cargo to complement passenger and cargo  services offered at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, but cited  limitations in the airport\u2019s runway length and condition. An official at  Alliance Global Logistics Hub, on the other hand, said that the passenger  services offered at nearby Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport  complemented the cargo-only services offered at Alliance Global  Logistics Hub because Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport offers  passenger services most major cities in the United States, Mexico and  Canada within 4 hours.", "While the economic viability of all-cargo operations at Ontario and Willow  Run Airports is not yet known, we have previously identified regional  airport planning as one approach to constrained capacity. Some  metropolitan planning organizations (MPO) conduct regional airport  planning as a part of their activities. In 2010, we found metropolitan- planning organizations that conduct regional airport planning have no  authority to determine the priorities of airport improvement projects in  their regions; MPOs do have authority over surface transportation  projects. As a result, the regional airport plans that MPOs produce have  little direct influence over airport capital investment and other decisions.Support and funding of regional airports depend on the FAA\u2019s  assessment of the project. Thus, GAO recommended that FAA develop a  review process for regional airport system planning.

Consultation with residents near the airport and with city  officials representing the interest of their constituents is an important step  in the airport-centric development process. Without collaboration or  agreement among stakeholders, development plans may be difficult to  implement. Los Angeles International Airport officials, for example, would  like to further expand the airport\u2019s northern airfield to address safety and  efficiency issues related to aircraft operations (including accommodating   and discussions with stakeholders in the regions we  larger aircraft); however, given the proximity of the airport to residential  areas and community opposition to potential noise issues, there has been  little public or political support for the airport\u2019s expansion. As our previous  work has shown early and continuous community involvement is critical to  efficient and timely project implementation. For example, some airport  operators are using AIP funds for long-term environmental planning;  continuously self-monitoring their environmental footprints to help prepare  for and address environmental issues; and soliciting community concerns  to anticipate and address environmental issues. In addition, several FAA  processes have been established to help airports address environmental  concerns such as a streamlined environmental review process for airport  projects where expansion is critical for handling the growth of air traffic.", "In the future, as airports like Los Angeles International Airport learn to  better manage their environmental impacts, airports may be better able to  garner community support for airport expansion.", "The stakeholders we spoke with gave examples of the ways in which they  collaborated with other stakeholders, such as establishing new groups to  promote airport-centric development.
