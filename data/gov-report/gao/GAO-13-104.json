However, while the system draws on a host of existing Medicare data sources and has been integrated with existing systems that process claims, it has not yet been integrated with the agency's payment-processing system to allow for the prevention of payments until suspect claims can be determined to be valid. Program officials stated that this functionality has been delayed due to the time required to develop system requirements; they estimated that it will be implemented by January 2013 but had not yet developed reliable schedules for completing this activity.", "FPS is intended by program integrity officials to help facilitate the agency's shift from focusing on recovering large amounts of fraudulent payments after they have been made, to taking actions to prevent payments as soon as aberrant billing patterns are identified. Specifically, CMS has directed its program integrity contractors to prioritize alerts generated by the system and to focus on administrative actions--such as revocations of suspect providers' Medicare billing privileges--that can stop payment of fraudulent claims. To this end, the system has been incorporated into the contractors' existing investigative processes. CMS has also taken steps to address challenges contractors initially faced in using FPS, such as shifting priorities, workload challenges, and issues with system functionality.", "Program integrity analysts' use of FPS has generally been consistent with key practices for using predictive analytics identified by private insurers and state Medicaid programs.

CMS program integrity officials stated that, as  of April 2012, about 10 percent of ZPIC investigations were initiated as a  result of using FPS. By prioritizing these investigations, these officials told  us that they intend for ZPICs to target suspect providers for investigation  as soon as aberrant billing patterns that are consistent with fraud are  identified, rather than targeting providers that have already received large  amounts of potentially fraudulent payments. In addition, investigations of  leads from FPS should be faster because the leads provide information  about the type of fraud being identified, and the system is designed to  provide investigators with data and statistical tools to conduct  investigations. CMS program integrity officials also told us that the agency  intends to use FPS to deny only a small number of claims without further  investigation once it completes integration of FPS with its claims-payment  system and that ZPICs will continue to coordinate with the MACs to take  administrative actions against providers.", "In addition to directing ZPICs to investigate leads from FPS, CPI also  established a working group, referred to as the command center, to work  with and provide training to the ZPICs on how to use the system to initiate  administrative actions more quickly against providers suspected of fraud.  On a recurring basis, typically every 2 weeks, select staff from a ZPIC  travel to CMS to receive training related to the system and to discuss  current FPS trends and investigations. CMS officials stated that these  training sessions and discussions help the analysts develop new and  streamlined approaches for gathering evidence and taking action against  providers suspected of potential fraud. For example, CMS conducted  training with ZPIC staff on how to investigate system leads that target  certain forms of fraud, such as fraud associated with home health  services. In addition, ZPICs received training on how best to use the  system to ensure that resulting administrative actions, such as  revocations of providers\u2019 billing privileges, are well supported by the  evidence. For example, ZPICs received training on Medicare revocation  policies and processes and were provided with examples of successful  revocations that were initiated based on system leads. Finally, based on  these training sessions, CMS continues to refine the system to provide  investigators with data and statistical information useful in conducting  investigations.", "Concurrent with the implementation of FPS and to further help move  away from its pay-and-chase approach to detecting fraud, CMS has  directed the ZPICs to focus on recommending and initiating administrative  actions\u2014especially the revocation of Medicare billing privileges\u2014against  providers suspected of fraud. As directed by CMS, ZPICs previously  focused their investigative efforts on gathering evidence to verify  overpayments and developing criminal and civil cases for law  enforcement agencies\u2014a lengthy process that often involved many  investigative steps. In particular, CMS program integrity and ZPIC officials  cited the large amount of time and resources involved in reviewing  medical records\u2014an investigative process in which staff with clinical  backgrounds review claims to determine whether billed services are  potentially fraudulent or inconsistent with clinical practice. According to  CMS program integrity officials, the information provided by FPS is well- matched with the evidence necessary for ZPICs to recommend  revocations against providers without having to conduct extensive  investigations. These officials also told us that they have directed the  ZPICs to focus on pursuing revocations because revocations prohibit  providers suspected of fraud from billing Medicare.

CMS requires the ZPICs to determine whether the providers  associated with those leads are \u201csuspect\u201d or \u201cnon-suspect.\u201d These  reviews are often conducted by the FPS teams. ZPIC officials told us  that they often look for certain patterns associated with fraud when  making this determination. For instance, identification of a provider  that bills for a small number of beneficiaries but an excessive number  of services may lead to a suspect determination.", "Refer suspect providers for further investigation: Suspect leads  become formal investigations of the provider and are generally  referred to other ZPIC investigators for further investigation. For  example, a lead from FPS related to home health services may be  referred to an investigator with expertise in that area.", "Conduct investigation: Once a lead from the system is assigned to an  investigator, it is investigated similarly to other leads. The investigator  can take multiple investigative actions to determine whether the  provider is engaged in potential fraud including interviewing the  provider and the provider\u2019s beneficiaries, conducting onsite audits to  review a provider\u2019s records and assess whether the provider\u2019s  facilities are appropriate for the services provided, determining  whether there are other complaints against the provider, and  conducting additional data analysis using FPS and other tools. The  ZPICs can refer suspect providers to HHS OIG or recommend them  for administrative actions.", "Officials from the ZPICs reported that FPS has not fundamentally  changed the way in which they investigate fraud. The system has not,  according to ZPIC officials, significantly sped up investigations or enabled  quicker administrative actions in most instances. Instead, officials  reported that leads from the system were broad indicators that particular  providers were suspect, but did not in all cases provide sufficient  evidence of potentially fraudulent billing to allow for faster investigations  or resolutions. FPS investigations were similar to those from other  sources in that they often required additional investigative steps, such as  beneficiary and provider interviews.", "On the other hand, ZPICs reported certain advantages as a result of  using FPS. For example, analysts can query the system for specific data  to support their analysis of leads and export data from FPS into other  systems they use to conduct additional analysis of claim lines flagged by  FPS. Data generated by the system may also notify investigators of  information available in other CMS databases, such as the national Fraud  Investigation Database. In addition, using FPS\u2019s near-real-time claims  data, some investigators reported identifying and conducting interviews  with beneficiaries shortly after they received services from providers  under investigation, when beneficiaries can better recall details about  their care.

CMS has been responsive to many of these  challenges and has developed processes for soliciting and incorporating  ZPIC input and feedback on the system and its use. Certain ZPICs  attributed some early challenges with the system to CMS not soliciting  their input during the development and initial implementation of FPS.  CMS has since developed a process in which ZPICs submit \u201cchange  requests\u201d to propose changes to the system\u2019s functionality and  enhancements to the models so that they better target suspect providers.  The command center also serves as a forum for ZPICs to discuss and  provide feedback on FPS and its use. These processes for soliciting and  implementing feedback are consistent with key practices we have  previously identified for implementing management initiatives. In  particular, feedback can provide important insights about operations from  a front-line perspective.", "The challenges ZPICs faced using FPS centered on several common  themes, and CMS has taken steps to address these challenges:  Impact on continuing proactive data analysis investigations: Officials  from all of the ZPICs we interviewed reported that the implementation  of the system represented a change in direction that limited some of  their own proactive data analysis and investigations. This happened  because the ZPICs were required to devote more time and resources  to following up on leads from the system and less on investigations  that were already under way from other sources, including earlier  proactive data analysis. In addition to investigating leads from the  system, the ZPICs investigate leads based on their own data analysis  and cited specific advantages of their proactive investigations.  Specifically, while FPS models address specific types of potential  fraudulent activity, the ZPICs conduct proactive data analysis and  investigations to target forms of fraud that are not addressed by those  models. Additionally, ZPIC officials told us that fraudulent activity  varies by region and proactive data analysis and investigations are  needed to keep up with localized and emerging trends of fraud. CMS  officials told us that they plan to have ZPICs continue their proactive  data analysis and investigations in addition to those in response to  FPS leads.", "Certain CMS directions for using FPS: ZPICs identified certain CMS  directions for using the system that created workload challenges. For  example, the agency initially directed the ZPICs to continue tracking  and reevaluating providers that were determined to be nonsuspect,  which led the ZPICs to expend resources investigating those  providers. In response to ZPIC complaints about having to reevaluate  providers determined to be nonsuspect, agency program integrity  officials told us that they revised the policy so that the ZPICs only  reevaluate nonsuspect providers under certain conditions and also  modified FPS to alert ZPICs when such providers should be  reexamined.", "False positives: ZPICs told us that certain FPS models identified and  prioritized the investigation of a relatively high proportion of false  positives\u2014i.e., improper identification of suspect providers that were  not engaged in fraud. Some of these false positives related to the  nationwide application of models, which did not take into account  localized conditions that may help explain certain provider billing  patterns. For example, a physician in a rural area may provide care  for beneficiaries dispersed across a large geographic range\u2014 something that would raise suspicion for a physician in an urban area.  ZPICs also told us that the system sometimes prioritized leads that  target forms of fraud that are not prevalent in their zone and that  investigating such false positive leads has taken time away from other  investigations. In response to ZPIC feedback that certain models  produced a high number of false positive leads, CMS changed the  way the system generates leads and how it assigns risk scores to  providers identified by those models. According to program integrity  officials, CMS is also considering approaches to control for  geographic variations in fraud.", "FPS functionality: ZPICs cited challenges related to aspects of FPS\u2019s  functionality. For example, when first implemented, the system only  provided data directly relevant to the aberrant billing patterns  associated with its leads. ZPICs, however, told us that determining  whether a provider is potentially suspect requires contextual and  background information, such as provider profile and billing history  information. Because this information was not provided by FPS, the  ZPICs had to use other sources to obtain this information.

One official  from a state Medicaid program noted that, since organized fraud  operations often move from scheme to scheme, identifying the  networks of individuals involved in fraud, rather than simply limiting  their ability to perpetrate certain schemes, is increasingly important.  While FPS does not yet include social network analysis, CMS  program integrity officials were conducting a pilot to determine how to  integrate social network analysis into future model development.

Predictive  analytics systems need effective and continuous feedback on the  outcomes of investigations so that they can be refined and updated to  better target fraudulent activity and reduce false positives. For  example, investigative staff can guide the development of predictive  models by providing information on emerging fraud schemes that they  encounter during the course of their investigations. CMS has  coordinated with the ZPICs to develop and refine FPS models. For  example, CMS has obtained ZPICs\u2019 input on emerging trends in  potentially fraudulent activity to generate new ideas for FPS models.  According to CMS program integrity and ZPIC officials, ZPIC staff with  experience and expertise investigating particular types of fraud have  been involved in developing FPS models. After models have been  implemented, ZPICs have provided feedback on issues or challenges  that they have encountered, which has subsequently been used by  CMS to refine and update the models.", "Collaboration with external stakeholders, including other insurers and  government health programs, can aid in the detection of fraudulent  providers and leverages resources. Such collaborations enable  information sharing about bad actors and emerging fraud schemes,  which can be effective because providers engaged in fraud often do  not target just one company or government program, but attempt to  defraud many insurers and programs. CMS, along with other agencies  involved in ensuring Medicare program integrity\u2014specifically the HHS  OIG, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of  Investigation\u2014have established a collaborative partnership with a  number of private insurers and anti-health care fraud associations.

These officials stated their intention was to measure benefits  based on savings resulting from the system\u2019s contributions to the  agency\u2019s efforts to prevent payments of fraudulent claims. However, while  CMS could potentially quantify financial benefits resulting from the  amount of suspended payments or other administrative actions based on  the results of FPS, the capability of the system that could provide benefits  through the suspension of payments had not yet been implemented.

In this regard, CMS did not define measures or targets for  meeting them that reflect the extent to which the system identifies  potentially fraudulent claims. For example, such measures could track the  number of ASRs in certain risk categories that result in investigations,  revocations, payment suspensions, or other administrative actions that  support the agency\u2019s goal to prevent Medicare fraud.

We selected a nonprobability sample of  stakeholders to interview and, therefore, the information gathered from  key stakeholders is not generalizable beyond the individuals we  interviewed; however, the interviews provided insights into issues  pertaining to all three objectives. While not all users employed  sophisticated predictive analytics\u2014including predictive modeling and  social network analysis\u2014at the time of our interviews, they all had  experience with data analytics and were able to provide insights into  process-oriented strategies for incorporating analytics into their antifraud  efforts. Our understanding of predictive analytics and its use was also  informed by trade journal articles and interviews with system vendors and  health insurance and antifraud organizations.", "To determine the extent to which CMS defined and measured benefits  and performance goals for the system and identified and met milestones  for achieving those goals, we reviewed requirements established by the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for agencies\u2019 management of  information technology investments and for reporting the status of those  investments. We assessed efforts taken by CMS officials to meet OMB\u2019s  requirements. Specifically, we discussed with the FPS business owner  and other program officials the steps they had taken and plan to take in  efforts to define ways to measure financial and other quantifiable benefits  of the system. We also discussed with them their approach to and  processes for developing performance measures, targets, and milestones  to determine the extent to which the system was producing outcomes that  supported the agency\u2019s fraud prevention strategies and goals.  Additionally, we reviewed agency-wide strategic plans and program  planning documents, and assessed the extent to which the system\u2019s  performance plans and objectives supported efforts to achieve the goals  defined by these plans. We also examined reports submitted to OMB that  included information about the system\u2019s expected performance, and  interviewed program officials about steps the agency had taken to  achieve the goals and objectives.", "For each of the objectives, we assessed the reliability of the data we  obtained from interviews with agency officials and users by comparing  them to documents describing FPS\u2019s program plans and status,  information technology infrastructure, system design specifications,  system usage reports, and performance goals and measures. We found  the data sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this review.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2011 to October 2012  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts named above, Teresa F.
