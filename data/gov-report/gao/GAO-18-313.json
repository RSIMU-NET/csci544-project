All 12 of the money transmitters GAO interviewed, which served Haiti, Liberia, Nepal, and particularly Somalia, reported losing some banking relationships during the last 10 years. As a result, 9 of the 12 money transmitters reported using channels outside the banking system (hereafter referred to as non-banking channels), such as cash couriers, to move funds domestically or, in the case of Somalia, for cross-border transfer of remittances (see figure). Several banks reported that they had closed the accounts of money transmitters because of the high cost of due diligence actions they considered necessary to minimize the risk of fines under Bank Secrecy Act regulations. Treasury officials noted that despite some money transmitters losing bank accounts, they see no evidence that the volume of remittances is falling.", "Example of a Cash-to-Cash Remittance Transfer Using a Cash Courier", "U.S. agencies have taken steps that may mitigate money transmitters' loss of banking access. For example, several agencies have issued guidance to clarify expectations for providing banking services to money transmitters. In addition, Treasury is implementing projects to strengthen financial institutions in some fragile countries. However, U.S. agencies disagreed with other suggestions, such as immunity from enforcement actions for banks serving money transmitters, since those actions could adversely affect goals related to preventing money laundering and terrorism financing.", "Treasury cannot assess the effects of money transmitters' loss of banking access on remittance flows because existing data do not allow Treasury to identify remittances transferred through banking and non-banking channels. Remittance data that U.S. agencies collect from banks do not include transfers that banks make on behalf of money transmitters. Additionally, the information Treasury collects on transportation of cash from U.S. ports of exit does not identify remittances sent as cash. Therefore, Treasury cannot assess the extent to which money transmitters are shifting from banking to non-banking channels to transfer funds due to loss of banking access. Non-banking channels are generally less transparent than banking channels and thus more susceptible to the risk of money laundering and terrorism financing."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Treasury should assess the extent to which shifts in remittance flows to non-banking channels for fragile countries may affect Treasury's ability to monitor for financial crimes and, if necessary, should identify corrective actions.

Remittances can be sent through money  transmitters as well as depository institutions, such as banks and credit  unions, among other methods.", "In recent years, the World Bank and others have reported that some  money transmitters have been losing access to banking services with  depository institutions due to derisking. In a prior report, we identified  derisking as the practice of banks limiting certain services or ending their  relationships with customers to, among other things, avoid perceived  regulatory concerns about facilitating money laundering, or other criminal  activity, such as financing to terrorist groups. Further, the International  Monetary Fund has raised concerns that large depository institutions may  be reducing correspondent banking relationships due to fear of risk  exposure, which in turn may limit the ability of smaller depository  institutions to provide remittance transfer services to their customers,  including money transmitters. According to Oxfam America, constraints  on money transmitters\u2019 access to banking services may have significant  humanitarian, economic, and security implications, effectively cutting off a  stable source of funds and isolating communities from the global financial  system.", "Financial institutions that provide international money transfers are  subject to regulations to prevent financial crimes such as money  laundering or terrorist financing.

Historically, many consumers  have chosen to send remittances through money transmitters due to  convenience, cost, familiarity, or tradition. Money transmitters typically  work through agents\u2014separate business entities generally authorized  to, among other things, send and receive money transfers. Most  remittance transfers are initiated in person at retail outlets that offer  these services. Money transmitters generally operate through their  own retail storefronts, or through grocery stores, financial services  outlets, convenience stores, and other retailers that serve as agents.  In one type of common money transmitter transaction\u2014known as a  cash-to-cash transfer\u2014a sender walks into a money transmitter agent  location and provides cash to cover the transfer amount and fees.  Generally, for transfers at or above $3,000, senders must provide  basic information about themselves (typically a name and address,  among other information) at the time of the transfer request. The  agent processes the transaction, and the money transmitter\u2019s  headquarters screens it for BSA compliance. The money is then  transferred to a recipient, usually through a distributor agent in the  destination country. The money may be wired through the money  transmitter\u2019s bank to the distributor agent\u2019s bank (see fig. 1), or  transferred by other means to a specified agent in the recipient\u2019s  country. The distributor agent pays out cash to the recipient in either  U.S. dollars or local currency.", "Money transmitters also offer other transfer methods, including online or  mobile technology, prepaid money cards or international money orders  sent by U.S. Postal Service, cash courier services, or informal value  transfer systems such as hawala.", "Transfers through banks.

Money transmitters use cash couriers either  because the money transmitter or their agents had lost bank accounts or  because it was cheaper to use armored trucks than banks to move funds.  In addition to the safety risks money transmitters face when they only  accept cash, customers who remit large sums of money also face safety  risks because they must transport cash to the money transmitter.

Some of the banks that  provide correspondent banking services said they conduct more due  diligence on the customers of the banks they serve than regulatory  guidance requires. Several of the correspondent banks noted that this  additional due diligence was challenging to conduct due to the  distance between the correspondent bank and the customers of the  banks they serve.

Moreover, the flow of funds such  as remittances from banking to non-banking channels decreases the  transparency of these transactions. While U.S. regulators have issued  guidance to banks indicating that they should not terminate accounts of  money transmitters without a case-by-case assessment, several banks  we contacted remain apprehensive and are reluctant to incur additional  costs for low-profit customers such as money transmitters. At the same  time, senders of remittances still prefer to use money transmitters to send  funds, which the senders regard as a critical lifeline for family and friends  in fragile countries. Although federal and state regulators have  undertaken recent efforts to obtain remittance data from financial  institutions such as banks and money transmitters, these efforts are  designed for consumer protection and the regulatory supervision of  financial institutions, rather than to track remittances sent by money  transmitters using banking channels.

We administered the survey from July 2017 to September  2017, and collected information for the 3-year time period of January 1,  2014 to December 31, 2016. Aggregate responses for the close-ended  survey questions that are related to this report are included in appendix II.  The survey also collected information for two additional GAO reports: one  reviewing closure of bank branches along the southwest border of the  United States, and another assessing the causes of bank account  terminations involving money transmitters.", "To identify the universe of banks, we used the bank asset data from  FDIC\u2019s Statistics on Depository Institutions database. Our initial  population list contained 5,922 banks downloaded from FDIC\u2019s Statistics  on Depository Institutions database as of December 31, 2016. We  stratified the population into five sampling strata, and used a stratified  random sample. In order to meet the sampling needs of related reviews,  we used a hybrid stratification scheme. First, banks that did not operate  in the Southwest border region were stratified into four asset sizes (small,  medium, large, and extra-large). Next, by using FDIC\u2019s Summary of  Deposit database we identified 115 Southwest border banks as of June  30, 2016.", "Our initial sample size allocation was designed to achieve a stratum-level  margin of error no greater than plus or minus 10 percentage points for an  attribute level at the 95 percent level of confidence. Based upon prior  surveys of financial institutions, we assumed a response rate of 75  percent to determine the sample size for the asset size strata. Because  there are only 17 extra-large banks in the population, we included all of  them in the sample. We also included the entire population of 115  Southwest border banks as a separate certainty stratum. We reviewed  the initial population list of banks in order to identify nontraditional banks  not eligible for this survey. We treated nontraditional banks as out-of- scope. In addition, during the administration of our survey, we identified  27 banks that were either no longer in business or that had been bought  and acquired by another bank, as well as 2 additional banks that were  nontraditional banks and, therefore, not eligible for this survey. We  treated these sample cases as out-of-scope; this adjusted our population  of banks to 5,805 and reduced our sample size to 406. We obtained a  weighted survey response rate of 46.5 percent.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random  selections, our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we  might have drawn. Since each sample could have provided different  estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular  sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval (for example, plus or  minus 7 percentage points). This is the interval that would contain the  actual population value for 95 percent of the samples we could have  drawn. Confidence intervals are provided along with each sample  estimate in the report. For survey questions that are not statistically  reliable, we present only the number of responses to each survey  question and the results are not generalizable to the population of banks.", "The practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce errors,  commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For example, difficulties in  interpreting a particular question or sources of information available to  respondents can introduce unwanted variability into the survey results.  We took steps in developing the questionnaire, collecting the data, and  analyzing the results to minimize such nonsampling error. We conducted  pretests with four banks. We selected these banks to achieve variation in  geographic location and asset size (small, medium, large, extra-large).  The pretests of the survey were conducted to ensure that the survey  questions were clear, to obtain any suggestions for clarification, and to  determine whether representatives would be able to provide responses to  questions with minimal burden.", "To supplement the results of the survey, we conducted interviews with  eight extra-large banks regarding correspondent banking and money  transmitter accounts and with two credit unions regarding money  transmitter accounts. We selected the eight banks to interview using the  following criteria: (1) the bank was in the extra-large asset size group  (banks with greater than $50 billion in assets), and (2) the bank was  mentioned by at least one of the money transmitters that we interviewed  as terminating accounts with them or the bank was listed in an internal  Treasury study on correspondent banking. Of the banks in the extra- large asset size group, 7 were mentioned in our interviews with money  transmitters as having closed accounts with them. Nearly all of these  banks, plus one additional bank were also mentioned as correspondent  banks in the Treasury study. In addition, we selected two credit unions to  interview based on information from our interviews with money  transmitters. Money transmitters identified four credit unions in our  interviews; of these, we selected for interviews two that were mentioned  as closing accounts with money transmitters. We did not contact the other  two credit unions that currently have money transmitter accounts. The  results of the survey and the interviews only provide illustrative examples  and are not generalizable to all banks or credit unions.", "For our second objective, we analyzed U.S. agency information and  documentation about relevant projects and activities. We also interviewed  officials and obtained relevant guidance documents from Treasury,  including OCC, OTA, FinCEN, and Terrorism and Financial Intelligence;  the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); the U.S. Department  of State; the U.S. Agency for International Development; the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve); and the  National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Additionally, we also  interviewed officials from the World Bank and International Monetary  Fund to understand the data, methodology, and findings contained within  reports by those organizations, as well as to understand the International  Monetary Fund\u2019s role in technical assistance in our case-study countries.  To gather information on solutions proposed by banks and others to  address challenges money transmitters face in transferring funds through  banks from the United States to fragile countries, we interviewed banks  and credit unions as noted above. We also reviewed reports by the World  Bank, the Center for Global Development, and Oxfam to gather  recommendations addressing challenges in transferring remittances to  fragile countries. We interviewed officials from Treasury, FDIC, the  Federal Reserve, and the U.S. Agency for International Development to  gain their perspectives on these proposed solutions.", "For our third objective on U.S. agencies\u2019 efforts to assess the effects of  challenges facing U.S. money transmitters on remittance flows to fragile  countries, we interviewed agency officials and analyzed available data on  flows going through banking and non-banking channels. For available  data on flows through the banking channel, we analyzed the Consolidated  Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report) data from the Federal  Financial Institutions Examination Council, which started collecting these  data in 2014. These remittance data are reported on a semiannual basis.  We also reviewed Call Report data on remittances for credit unions,  which started to be collected in 2013, as well as data collected from  Money Service Businesses, which some states started collecting in 2017.  For data on remittance flows through non-banking channels, we obtained  and analyzed data on filings of FinCEN\u2019s Form 105 \u2013 Report of  International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments. This  report is required of individuals who physically transport currency or other  monetary instruments exceeding $10,000 at one time from the United  States to any place outside the United States, or into the United States  from any place outside the United States. The paper form is collected by  the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s U.S. Customs and Border  Protection at the port of entry or departure. We obtained the tabulated  Form 105 data from FinCEN by arrival country, state of U.S. exit port, and  for calendar years 2006 through 2016. We also interviewed officials and  obtained written responses from FinCEN and the Federal Financial  Institutions Examination Council. We compared the results of our data  analysis and information from interviews with agency officials against  FinCEN\u2019s mission to safeguard the financial system from illicit use by,  among other things, obtaining and analyzing financial transactions data.  Additionally, we also compared the results of our analysis and information  obtained from agencies against the federal standards for internal control,  which state that agency managers should comprehensively identify risks  and analyze them for their possible effects.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2016 to March  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
