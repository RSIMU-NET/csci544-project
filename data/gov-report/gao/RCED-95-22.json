The federal lands were owned by the U.S. Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management. The act also required the bulk of the proceeds from the Bureau\u2019s land sales to be used for a buyout program through which the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Forest Service would purchase environmentally sensitive private lands in the Lake Tahoe Basin in an effort to stem further degradation of the lake.", "This report responds to your concerns about whether property owners in the Lake Tahoe Basin, especially those who acquired lands before December 1969\u2014the date when the states of California and Nevada formally began to implement cooperative land-use controls to regulate development in the basin\u2014are being treated fairly when their environmentally sensitive lands are acquired by the Forest Service under the Santini-Burton Act.

It lies in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California and Nevada. The lake, which lies two-thirds in California and one-third in Nevada (see fig. 1), has been called a national treasure. Governing bodies within the basin include the 2 states, 5 counties, and 20 local jurisdictions. The beauty of the Tahoe basin has attracted large numbers of visitors interested in recreating at the lake and people wanting to establish permanent year-round or vacation homes along its shores.", "Many reports and research projects have documented the degradation of the Tahoe basin\u2019s air, water, soil, and scenic characteristics\u2014all of which were attributed to the rapid development occurring in the basin. With this knowledge came the recognition that something would have to be done to curb future development of the basin, particularly in its most environmentally sensitive areas.", "Working together to address the problems associated with the growth and activity in the basin, the legislatures in California and Nevada agreed on a Tahoe Regional Planning Compact, which was eventually ratified by the Congress in 1969. This compact, as amended by Public Law 96-551, dated December 19, 1980, stated, among other things, the following:", "The waters of Lake Tahoe and other resources of the region were threatened with deterioration or degeneration, which was endangering the natural beauty and the economic productivity of the region.", "The Lake Tahoe region had unique, irreplaceable environmental and ecological resources.", "There was a public interest in protecting, preserving, and enhancing these resources for the residents of and visitors to the region.", "To preserve the scenic beauty and outdoor recreational opportunities of the region, there was a need to ensure an equilibrium between the region\u2019s natural endowment and its man-made environment.", "To carry out the provisions of the compact, TRPA was established in 1969. In an effort to, among other things, protect the basin\u2019s water and air quality, fish and wildlife, vegetation, and scenic resources and provide for high-quality recreation, TRPA regulates land use, the rate of growth, the extent to which land is covered with homes and other construction, excavation, and impacts on scenic views.", "After much deliberation that occurred over several years, the Regional Plan for the Lake Tahoe Basin, which governs the long-term development of the basin, was approved in 1987 by California and Nevada and a 15-member Governing Board that oversees the administration of TRPA. TRPA\u2019s regional plan and Code of Ordinances help achieve and maintain the environmental thresholds against which all projects and activities, including those on national forest land, are measured.", "In 1987, TRPA approved the Individual Parcel Evaluation System (IPES) as the standard to be used in determining the environmental sensitivity of vacant land parcels zoned for single-family residential buildings. Before the initiation of IPES, vacant lands in the basin were evaluated under the Bailey Land Classification System, which classifies soils into seven capability classes with varying degrees of tolerance to land development. However, because the Bailey System did not evaluate individual parcels, it proved to be unsatisfactory for residential parcel owners wanting to build single-family residences and resulted in several lawsuits. As part of the consensus-building process of developing a regional plan, TRPA approved the use of IPES for determining the environmental sensitivity of such parcels.", "Once IPES was adopted, site evaluation teams initially visited over 10,000 vacant parcels in the Tahoe basin to assign them scores. (See app. I for the distribution and the percentage of the IPES scores of the original 10,000-plus parcels surveyed by TRPA.) A major goal of the IPES scoring process is to enable TRPA to be in a position to direct new construction to the areas that are most suitable for development from an environmental standpoint. IPES determines, among other things, which lots may be built upon, what percentage of each lot may be developed, and when the lots may be eligible for development. Among the environmental factors considered in assigning an IPES score to a parcel are its (1) potential for soil erodibility and runoff, (2) location with respect to a stream environment zone, (3) ability to revegetate, and (4) proximity to the lake."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Universe of Properties to Be Acquired by the Forest Service Under the Santini-Burton Act", "paragraphs": ["After the Santini-Burton Act was enacted, the Forest Service planned to acquire about 20,000 acres of land under the land buyout program authorized under the act.

The offers are either accepted or rejected by property owners.", "Through February 10, 1994, the Forest Service had acquired 3,378 parcels (3,183 of them by purchase agreements, including 495 that involved multiple parcels, and the remaining 195 by donations) totaling about 11,000 acres. Through July 1994, a total of about $86.5 million (including about $7 million in grants from California) had been spent by the Forest Service for land acquisitions and related administrative expenses. The bulk of the acquisition funds came from the proceeds of Bureau of Land Management land sales in Clark County, Nevada. The Forest Service planned to make offers during fiscal year 1994 for about 100 additional parcels.

This score can range in value from 0 to 1,140. Originally, it was established that a parcel with an IPES score of 726 or higher would immediately be eligible for development, while a parcel with a low IPES score would not immediately be eligible. Whereas the market value of a property with a high IPES score would likely be increased, the market value of a property with a low IPES score would likely be diminished. Real estate brokers in the basin told us that in California, for example, a lot that cannot be developed has about one-fourth to one-third the fair market value of a lot that can be developed.", "Appraisal reports we reviewed support this contention. Many appraisals prepared for the Forest Service show that the fair market value of a property was based to a great extent on its potential for development. One appraisal report, which included an analysis of 19 lots in Washoe County, Nevada, stated, for example, that \u201cresidential lots suffering from development constraints would have a value of from 33 percent to 80 percent of their value assuming that they could be developed without undue delay.\u201d", "The fair market value determination required for a Forest Service acquisition under the Santini-Burton Act must be made by an independent appraiser, where practicable, on the basis of comparable sales at the time of acquisition. Comparable sales are sales that are similar in time, location, type of property, and intended use after sale. They are used to determine that the price paid fairly represents the property\u2019s value. In determining the comparability of other property sales, the appraiser must also consider the utilities, services, and facilities associated with the properties being compared.", "Determining the fair market value of land parcels in the Tahoe basin has been difficult. Because opportunities for development in the basin have been limited over the past several years, data on relatively few sales are available for comparison. Thus, appraisers often must use other evidence to arrive at a property\u2019s fair market value. Other evidence that may be considered includes the view afforded by the property; its relation to points of interest or importance; the price at which the property was bought (if recent enough to reflect on the current value of the property); expert opinion on the property\u2019s value; the uses for which it is available, which are affected by, among other things, its IPES score and the amount of the parcel that can be covered with a home, a driveway, etc.; and the cost of any improvements (if they increase the property\u2019s value). According to Forest Service officials, appraisers are not to add taxes, interest, and other expenses incurred by the landowner to the property\u2019s last sale price to arrive at the current fair market value.", "The issue of defining \u201cfair market value\u201d as it pertains to the Santini-Burton Act has come under scrutiny by the Forest Service. Of concern to Forest Service officials at the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit was the following statement in the act. \u201cAny change after the date of the enactment of this Act in the value of any property to be acquired under this section shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining the fair market value of such property to the extent that such change is attributable to the enactment of this Act.\u201d", "Questions arose as to whether this language was intended to exclude consideration of changes in such areas as zoning, ownership of development rights, number of units allowed per acre, or restrictions on lot coverage\u2014any one of which could significantly affect a property\u2019s valuation.", "In response, Management Unit officials were advised by Forest Service regional officials and by the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Office of the General Counsel that the intent of the wording in the Santini-Burton Act was to negate any change in the value of the land resulting only from the act itself. We were told that the language cited did not refer to any legislation, zoning ordinance, or restriction imposed by a local agency that was not a direct result of the act.

Thus, our estimates apply to an estimated 2,256 of the 2,688 individual land purchases made by the Forest Service since 1982. We calculated that the Forest Service paid an average acquisition price of about $23,600 for these 2,256 parcels. The prices of our sampled parcels ranged from $1,000 to $187,000, and the parcels ranged in size from 0.05 acre to 12.7 acres.

For the parcels in our sample, the differences ranged from $250 to $120,500. In almost 22 percent of the cases, the owners received less for their land than they had paid for it. The differences ranged from $500 to $35,000. We estimate that for fewer than 3 percent of the purchases, the Forest Service paid the owners the same amounts that the owners had paid for the parcels.", "The above calculations do not account for any inflation that might have occurred over the time that the owners held their properties, which would have reduced the purchasing power of the dollar between the dates that the owners purchased the parcels and the dates that they sold the parcels to the Forest Service. Our analyses showed that when inflation was factored in, about 36 percent of the owners received more than they had spent to acquire the properties. The increases ranged from $245 to $107,810.

The court also concluded that the land-use restrictions did not deprive Mr. Kelly of all economically viable use of his land. The court pointed out that the lots as a whole remained a valuable asset, since only seven lots were affected by TRPA\u2019s regulations. Of these seven, only four are presently precluded from development, and these parcels are expected to be eligible in a few years.", "The court also concluded that the owner\u2019s investment expectations had been met. At the time he purchased the plots, Mr. Kelly was aware of potential development restrictions in the Lake Tahoe area. Also, his land was worth considerably more than he had paid for it. Furthermore, the court considered that TRPA\u2019s regulations benefited not only the public but also Mr. Kelly himself because, without environmental land-use controls, his lots would diminish in value over time.", "The taking issue is also presently the subject of two pending federal court cases. The first of these cases\u2014Tahoe Sierra Preservation Council, et al. v. TRPA, et. al\u2014consolidates identical cases brought originally in the federal district courts of Nevada and California. The Federal Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently decided to return the case to the federal district court for consideration of the taking issue.

This finding made numerous additional parcels in these two counties immediately eligible for development and presumably increased their fair market value.", "Even land parcels in the basin receiving very low IPES scores retain some economic value because they are generally assigned some area of allowed surface coverage (the square footage of the parcel that may be covered by any impervious surface\u2014such as a dwelling\u2014that does not permit vegetation to grow or precipitation to reach the ground). This surface coverage allowance may be transferred to other currently developable lots in the same watershed.

While these owners are not currently allowed to build on their lots, the allocations may be transferred to other lots that are developable according to their IPES scores but do not have one of TRPA\u2019s limited annual building allocations.
