EPA awards grants through 93 programs to such recipients as state and local governments, tribes, universities, and nonprofit organizations. In response to concerns about its ability to manage grants effectively, EPA issued its 5-year Grants Management Plan in 2003, with performance measures and targets. GAO was asked to assess EPA's progress in implementing its grant reforms in four key areas: (1) awarding grants, (2) monitoring grantees, (3) obtaining results from grants, and (4) managing grant staff and resources. To conduct this work, GAO, among other things, examined the implementation of the reforms at the regional level for two Clean Water Act programs in 3 of EPA's 10 regional offices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["EPA has made important strides in achieving the grant reforms laid out in its 2003 Grants Management Plan, but weaknesses in implementation and accountability continue to hamper effective grants management in four areas. First, EPA has strengthened its award process by, among other things, (1) expanding the use of competition to select the most qualified applicants and (2) issuing new policies and guidance to improve the awarding of grants. Despite this progress, EPA's reviews found that staff do not always fully document their assessments of grantees' cost proposals; GAO also identified this problem in one region. Lack of documentation may hinder EPA's ability to be accountable for the reasonableness of the grantee's proposed costs. EPA is reexamining its cost review policy to address this problem. Second, EPA has made progress in reviewing its in-depth monitoring results to identify systemic problems, but long-standing issues remain in documenting ongoing monitoring and closing out grants. EPA and GAO found that staff do not always document ongoing monitoring, which is critical for determining if a grantee is on track in meeting its agreement. Without documentation, questions arise about the adequacy of EPA's monitoring of grantee performance. This lack of documentation occurred, in part, because managers have not fulfilled their commitment to improve monitoring documentation. In addition, grant closeouts are needed to ensure that grantees have met all financial requirements, provided their final reports, and returned any unexpended balances. For fiscal year 2005, EPA closed out only 37 percent of grants within 180 days after the grant project ended, as required by its policy. EPA also did not always close out grants properly in the regional files GAO reviewed. Third, EPA has initiated actions to obtain environmental results from its grants, but these efforts are not complete. For example, EPA's 2005 environmental results policy establishes criteria grants should meet to obtain results. However, EPA has not established a performance measure that addresses these criteria. Furthermore, EPA has not yet identified better ways to integrate its grant reporting systems. Finally, the Office of Management and Budget's 2006 assessment indicates that EPA needs to continue its concerted efforts to achieve results from grants. Finally, EPA has taken steps to manage grant staff and resources more effectively by analyzing workload, providing training, assessing the reliability of its grants management computer database, and holding managers and staff accountable for successfully fulfilling their grant responsibilities. Management attention is still needed because, among other things, EPA has just begun to implement its performance appraisal system for holding managers and staff accountable for grants management."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has faced challenges for  many years in managing its grants, which constitute over one-half of the  agency\u2019s budget, or about $4 billion annually. To support its mission of  protecting human health and the environment, EPA awards grants through  93 programs to a variety of recipients, including state and local  governments, tribes, universities, and nonprofit organizations. As of  September 30, 2005, EPA was administering grants through headquarters  and regional offices to 4,075 grant recipients. Given the size and diversity  of EPA\u2019s grant programs, its ability to efficiently and effectively  accomplish its mission depends to a large extent on how well it manages  its grant resources and builds accountability for results into its efforts.", "In response to concerns about its ability to manage grants effectively, EPA  issued its Grants Management Plan. In this plan, EPA for the first time  presented goals, objectives, milestones, and performance measures with  targets for tackling the agency\u2019s long-standing grants management  problems. The 5-year plan was comprehensive in that it set forth five  major goals that the agency sought to achieve. These goals addressed  major concerns we had identified in our 2003 report on grants  management. EPA has also issued a series of policies to implement the  plan and other grant reforms. The plan\u2019s goals are to (1) strengthen the  award of grants by using competition to select grantees for certain awards  to ensure that the best applicants are chosen; (2) monitor grants to ensure  that grantees are making progress toward their objectives and, at the end  of the project period, to ensure that recipients have provided all financial  and technical reports before closing out the grants; (3) obtain results from  grants by identifying and measuring their environmental and public health  outcomes; (4) enhance the skills of EPA personnel involved in grants  management; and (5) leverage technology to improve program  performance. Each of these goals is challenging, especially measuring the  outcomes of environmental activities, but EPA needs to demonstrate the  results achieved through its $4 billion annual investment in grant  programs. EPA is currently revising this plan to reflect accomplishments  achieved and to address remaining issues.", "You asked us to assess EPA\u2019s progress in implementing its grant reforms  for (1) awarding grants, (2) monitoring grantees, (3) obtaining results from  grants, and (4) managing grant staff and resources.", "To address these issues, we conducted our work at EPA\u2019s headquarters  and regional offices. EPA conducts its grant activities through its Office of  Grants and Debarment\u2014the office primarily responsible for grant  policies\u2014and program offices, located in both headquarters and 10  regional offices\u2014offices primarily responsible for implementing the grant  policies. At EPA headquarters, we reviewed EPA documents, including the  Grants Management Plan, policies and guidance, internal reviews of  management operations, and annual post-award monitoring plans. We  also interviewed Office of Grants and Debarment officials. In addition, we  interviewed officials and obtained information from EPA\u2019s Office of Water,  one of the program offices involved with grants. We reviewed EPA\u2019s Office  of Inspector General reports as well as the Office of Management and  Budget\u2019s (OMB) Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART). We also  reviewed prior GAO reports.", "In conducting our work, you asked us to address the implementation of  EPA\u2019s grant reforms at the regional level for Clean Water Act programs.  We selected Wetland Program Development Grants (wetland grants)  because it is a discretionary grant program\u2014that is, EPA decides who  receives the award and its amount, and the program is subject to  competition. We selected Nonpoint Source Management Program Grants  (nonpoint source grants) because it is a type of formula-based grant  program\u2014grants that are often awarded on the basis of formulas  prescribed by law or agency regulation. We reviewed EPA\u2019s progress at  the regional level by selecting grants in 3 of EPA\u2019s 10 regional offices:  Region 1 (Boston), Region 5 (Chicago), and Region 9 (San Francisco). We  selected these regions, in part, because, collectively, they represent a  significant share of regional grant funding for the two programs we  reviewed and geographic dispersion. At the regional offices, for these two  grant programs, we reviewed grant files, and interviewed EPA grant  specialists\u2014who are responsible for overseeing the grantees\u2019  administrative and financial activities\u2014and EPA project officers\u2014who are  responsible for overseeing the grantees\u2019 programmatic and technical  activities. Our regional work provides insights into regional grant activities  in the two Clean Water Act programs in the three regions we visited, but it  is not generalizable to all grants in all regions because we (1) selected only  two of the programs conducted in these offices and (2) incorporated  nonprobability sampling into our grant selection process. In conducting  our review, we did not assess the implementation of some of EPA\u2019s  policies because they had been issued too recently. Finally, we obtained  EPA data used in this report from the agency\u2019s grants computer databases  (Grants Information and Control System and the Integrated Grants  Management System), which have not had a complete data reliability  review. However, we determined that the data elements we used in this  report were sufficiently reliable for our purposes in this report.

This office also carries out certain types of administrative and  financial functions for the grants approved by program offices, such as  awarding headquarter grants and overseeing the financial management of  program office and regional grants. On the programmatic side, national  program managers are responsible for establishing and implementing  national policies for their grant programs, for setting funding priorities,  and for identifying specific environmental results from grant programs.  They are also responsible for technical and programmatic oversight of  headquarter grants. Regional grants management offices provide  administrative management for regional grants, while regional program  offices provide technical and programmatic oversight. Both headquarters  and regional program offices conduct grant competitions. EPA has  designated officials\u2014referred to as senior resource officials\u2014who are  typically deputy assistant administrators in program offices and assistant  regional administrators. These senior resource officials are in charge of  strengthening agencywide fiscal resource management while also ensuring  compliance with laws and regulations and are responsible for effective  grants management within their units.", "As of September 30, 2005, 119 grant specialists in the Office of Grants and  Debarment, and the regional grants management offices, were largely  responsible for administrative and financial grant functions. Furthermore,  2,064 project officers were actively managing grants in headquarters and  regional program offices. These project officers are responsible for the  technical and programmatic management of grants. Unlike grant  specialists, however, project officers also have nongrant responsibilities,  such as using the scientific and technical expertise for which they were  hired.", "In fiscal year 2005, EPA took 6,728 grant actions involving funds totaling  about $4 billion. These awards were made to six main categories of  recipients, as shown in figure 3.", "EPA offers three types of grants\u2014discretionary, nondiscretionary, and  continuing environmental grants:    Discretionary grants fund a variety of activities, such as environmental  research and training. EPA has the discretion to independently determine  the recipients and funding levels for these grants. EPA has awarded these  grants primarily to state and local governments, nonprofit organizations,  universities, and Native American tribes. In fiscal year 2005, EPA awarded  about $644 million in discretionary grants.", "Nondiscretionary grants are awarded primarily to state and local  governments and support water infrastructure projects, such as the  drinking water and clean water state revolving fund programs. For these  grants, Congress directs awards to one or more classes of prospective  recipients who meet specific eligibility criteria, or the grants are often  awarded on the basis of formulas prescribed by law or agency regulation.  In fiscal year 2005, EPA awarded about $2.4 billion in nondiscretionary  grants.", "Continuing environmental program grants contain both nondiscretionary  (formula) and discretionary features. These grants are nondiscretionary in  the sense that (1) they are awarded noncompetitively to the same  government units to support ongoing state, tribal, and local programs that  do not change substantially over time, and (2) allotments of funds are  initially made on the basis of factors contained in statute, regulation, or  agency guidance. These grants are also discretionary in the sense that  allotments are not entitlements, and EPA exercises judgment in  determining what the final award amount should be. In fiscal year 2005,  EPA awarded about $1 billion in grants for continuing environmental  programs.", "In this report, we focused on two EPA programs under the Clean Water  Act:    Wetland Program Development Grants (Wetland grants) Wetlands are  areas where water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the  surface of the soil throughout the year or for various portions of the year,  including during the growing season. Wetlands, such as bogs, swamps, and  marshes, support a number of valuable functions\u2014controlling floods,  improving water quality, and providing wildlife habitat, among other  things. The wetland grants provide applicants with an opportunity to carry  out projects to develop and refine comprehensive wetland programs. The  authority for the program is under section 104(b) (3) of the Clean Water  Act. Grant funding must be used to improve the wetlands program by  conducting or promoting the acceleration of research and studies relating  to the causes, effects, and other aspects of water pollution. Wetland grants  provide states, tribes, local governments, interstate agencies, intertribal  consortia, nonprofits, and nongovernmental organizations an opportunity  to carry out wetland projects and programs. Wetland grants are  discretionary grants.", "Nonpoint Source Management Program (Nonpoint source grants).", "Nonpoint source pollution is pollution that does not have a well-defined  source but instead originates from a number of sources, such as acid mine  drainage, agricultural runoff, and roads and highways. Under section  319(h) of the Clean Water Act, EPA makes grants to states, territories, and  Indian tribes to support a wide variety of activities, including technical and  financial assistance, education, training, technology transfer,  demonstration projects, and monitoring. Nonpoint source grants are  continuing environmental program grants.", "Grants from these two programs can be incorporated into the National  Environmental Performance Partnership System, which was established in  response to state needs for greater flexibility in using and managing their  continuing grant funds. Under this system, states may enter Performance  Partnership Agreements with EPA and into Performance Partnership  Grants. The agreements set out jointly developed priorities and protection  strategies, including innovative solutions for addressing water, air, and  waste problems. The partnership grants allow states to combine  continuing environmental program grant funds to implement those  solutions. States can also enter into Performance Partnership Grants  without a Performance Partnership Agreement. Under traditional  continuing environmental program grants, states received funds to  implement particular waste, air, water or other program\u2014such funding  can only be spent on activities that fall within the statutory and regulatory  parameters of that program. Under Performance Partnership Grants,  states can combine up to 21 separate grant programs into one award, and  move funds from one media, such as air, to another.", "Both the wetland and nonpoint source grants are under the auspices of  EPA\u2019s Office of Water in headquarters, but grants under these programs  are carried out by water program staff in regional offices. Moreover, in its  national guidance, the Office of Water states that it is committed to  accomplishing the goals that the Office of Grants and Debarment has  identified in its Grants Management Plan.

Specifically, the  policy    was binding on managers and staff throughout the agency;  required EPA staff to determine evaluation criteria for grant solicitations  and publish a grant announcement at least 60 days before the application  deadline; and   created the position of a senior-level competition advocate for grants. The  advocate oversees the policy\u2019s implementation and compliance and  evaluates its effectiveness.", "According to EPA\u2019s Inspector General, the 2002 policy was a \u201cpositive  step\u201d toward promoting competition, and competitions under the policy  were generally fair and open.", "Specifically, for the 38 grants that the Inspector General reviewed, EPA  had (1) published an announcement soliciting proposals, (2) written  procedures to ensure an objective and unbiased process for reviewing and  evaluating applications, and (3) selected recipients according to reviewers\u2019  recommendations.", "In 2004, EPA\u2019s grants competition advocate reviewed the policy, as  required, and reported, among other things, that steps should be taken to  improve justifications for not competing certain grants by (1) increasing  review and approval requirements for exceptions to competition and (2)  clarifying the language in the policy to ensure appropriate use of  exceptions. The advocate also found that the threshold for requiring  competition for grants of $75,000 or more in the 2002 policy was too high.", "In response, EPA issued a revised competition policy, effective January  2005. It enhanced competition by, among other things,  increasing review and approval requirements for justifying exceptions and  clarifying the language to ensure appropriate use of these justifications; reducing the threshold for competition from $75,000 to $15,000; and   strengthening requirements for documenting the competition process and  results.", "In addition, EPA added (1) conflict-of-interest provisions to increase  awareness of situations that could arise for applicants, reviewers, and  others involved in competition matters; and (2) dispute procedures.", "In commenting on both the 2002 and 2005 policies, the Inspector General  stated that the policies did not fully promote competition and  recommended that EPA could further expand competition in the 2005  policy by eliminating certain remaining exemptions and exceptions for  which the Inspector General believed competition is practicable. EPA  responded, however, that further expansion was not practicable for  reasons of congressional intent, regulatory limitations, and program  effectiveness.", "EPA\u2019s Grants Management Plan lays out goals, objectives, milestones,  and performance measures with targets for promoting competition. For  one of these objectives, EPA planned to improve the accuracy and  specificity of information available to the public on the agency\u2019s grant  opportunities in the federal government\u2019s Catalog of Federal Domestic  Assistance\u2014a listing of available grants and other federal funding  opportunities (available at www.CFDA.gov). However, as we reported in  2005, EPA was not consistently providing this information. Without such  information, potential applicants might not apply, and EPA would not have  the broadest applicant pool from which to select grantees. EPA officials  were unaware of continuing problems with funding priorities and funding  levels in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance until we brought  them to their attention during our review. In response to our  recommendations, in April 2005, EPA implemented revised guidance for  providing complete and accurate information in the Catalog of Federal  Domestic Assistance. For example, EPA now strongly encourages its  offices to provide information on the funding priorities on an ongoing  basis, instead of annually, so that the public has up-to-date information in  the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.", "For the competition goal, the agency developed a performance measure  for increasing the percentage of new grants subject to the competition  policy that are actually competed and set increasing targets for achieving  this measure. According to EPA, about $249 million of the approximately  $3.1 billion it awarded in new grants in fiscal year 2005 were eligible for  competition. EPA exempts certain grant categories from competition,  including all nondiscretionary grants, certain discretionary grants, and  most continuing environmental programs grants. EPA also established a  separate measure for nonprofit grantees. The first performance measure is  for all new eligible grants, including new grants to nonprofit recipients,  and the second is only for new eligible grants to nonprofit recipients, as  table 1 shows. EPA established a separate measure for competing grants  to nonprofit organizations because it believes that selecting the most  qualified nonprofit applicants through a competitive process could  address concerns about the effectiveness of nonprofit grantees in  managing grants.", "As the table shows, EPA reports it now competes a higher percentage of  eligible grants, up from 27 percent in fiscal year 2002 to 93 percent in fiscal  year 2005, exceeding its targets for fiscal years 2003 through 2005. The 7  percent of new grants that EPA reported it did not compete\u2014which  totaled about $10 million of the $249 million eligible for competition in  fiscal year 2005\u2014resulted from exceptions to the policy. EPA\u2019s  competition policy provides for exceptions that meet criteria specified in  the policy, if supported by a written justification and approved by an  appropriate official.

The policy  addresses both the programmatic capability of a nonprofit applicant to  carry out a project and its administrative capability to properly manage  EPA grant funds\u2014problems EPA and the Inspector General have  identified. Under the policy, EPA assesses programmatic capability for  both competitive and noncompetitive grants. The policy also requires the  agency to conduct different types of administrative capability reviews  based on the amount of the grant to the nonprofit organization. For grants  of $200,000 or more, applicants must complete a questionnaire and  provide documents to show that they have administrative and financial  systems to manage grants. For grants below the $200,000 threshold, EPA  staff must query the agency\u2019s grants database for any findings of problems  in the applicant\u2019s administrative capability. If problems are identified in  any of these reviews, the applicant must take corrective actions before  receiving the grant. In 2005, EPA approved 75 of the 87 nonprofit  organizations it reviewed; the remaining 12 nonprofit organizations are  taking steps to address problems identified.", "Also in March 2005, EPA issued a memorandum clarifying the criteria that  must be documented to justify the use of a grant or a contract as the  award mechanism.

Agency officials state that proper documentation of monitoring is  necessary to ensure that third parties\u2014such as other EPA staff who  assume responsibility for the grant or a supervisor\u2014can fully understand  and review the actions that have occurred during the project period.  Moreover, a lack of documentation raises questions about the adequacy of  project officers\u2019 and grant specialists\u2019 ongoing monitoring of grantee  performance. Despite the importance of documenting ongoing monitoring,  the absence of documentation in grant files has been a long-standing  problem that we reported on in 2003.", "To conduct ongoing monitoring, EPA policy requires the following:    Grant specialists should ensure that administrative terms and conditions  of the grants are met and review the financial status of the project. The  grant specialist is to speak with the project officer and the grantee at least  annually during the life of the grant.", "Project officers should ensure that programmatic award terms and  conditions are being met, including ensuring that they have received  progress reports from the grantee. Project officers are also to speak with  the grant specialists and the grantee at least annually during the life of the  grant.", "According to the monitoring policy, the grant specialists and project  officers must document the results of their ongoing monitoring in their  grant files.", "Despite this policy, the lack of documented ongoing monitoring remains a  problem. EPA\u2019s recent internal reviews in program and regional offices  demonstrate\u2014as did our review in three regional offices\u2014that EPA grant  specialists and project officers still do not consistently document ongoing  monitoring. In 2004 and 2005, the Office of Grants and Debarment found  limited or incomplete documentation of ongoing monitoring in internal  reviews it conducted in seven program and regional offices. In addition,  self-assessments completed by 11 program and regional offices during this  period identified the same lack of documentation. Our analysis of these  reviews indicates that several offices experienced recurring problems in  2004 and 2005. For example, an August 2004 Office of Grants and  Debarment internal review cited one regional office as having \u201cvery  limited\u201d documentation of ongoing monitoring; and in the following year,  the regional office\u2019s self-assessment found the same documentation  problem with project officer files.", "Because of these documentation problems, two of the three regional  offices we visited have committed to using checklists to document their  ongoing monitoring. Regions 1 and 9 had implemented such checklists at  the time of our review. As table 2 shows, however, of the 40 project officer  and grant specialist files we reviewed in Regions 1 and 9, more than half of  the checklists were either missing, blank, or incomplete.", "The water program office in Region 5 also developed a checklist for  documenting ongoing monitoring but had not yet implemented it at the  time of our review. Consequently, in Region 5, we examined other  documentation of ongoing monitoring in the grant files and found similar  omissions. None of the six files requiring annual contact with the  grantee\u2014three grant specialist files and three project officer files\u2014had  documentation showing that this contact had occurred.", "In the three regions, we also found that project officers\u2019 files did not  always contain grantees\u2019 progress reports, which can be required  quarterly, semiannually, or annually, as defined by an individual grant\u2019s  terms and conditions. Thirteen of the 32 project officer grant files we  reviewed in these regions were missing at least one or more progress  reports required by the grant\u2019s terms and conditions. According to EPA\u2019s  project officer manual, progress reports are the project officer\u2019s primary  mechanism for determining if the grantee is fulfilling its grant agreement  obligations. In general, progress reports should contain information that  compares grantee progress with the stated grant objectives, identify  problems with meeting these objectives, and state the reasons for those  problems. While the submission of progress reports is clearly the grantee\u2019s  responsibility, it is also the project officer\u2019s responsibility to work with the  grantees to ensure that they provide their progress reports in accordance  with the terms of the grant. When EPA staff do not obtain progress  reports, they cannot monitor effectively, which may hinder accountability.", "In the three regions we visited, the lack of documentation for ongoing  monitoring occurs because of weaknesses at the staff, supervisory, and  management level. First, grant specialists and project officers do not  consistently document key monitoring efforts. For example, several staff  stated that they had not printed out their e-mail correspondence with  grantees or recorded those contacts in the official grant files. Other staff  cited their workload as a reason for not documenting monitoring. Lack of  documentation also occurs because grant specialists and project officers  rely on other staff with technical expertise, known as \u201ctechnical contacts,\u201d  to assist with ongoing monitoring, and these technical contacts may not  provide the documented results of their monitoring for inclusion in the  grant file. We found this situation had occurred in two of the three regions  we visited. For example, one administrative project officer\u2014a project  officer who maintains files but is not necessarily knowledgeable about the  technical aspects of the project\u2014had asked for key monitoring  documentation from a technical contact, who did not provide it. The  technical contact had the monitoring documents in his work area and said  he would routinely provide them to the project officer in the future.", "Second, the lack of ongoing monitoring documentation may occur, in part,  because supervisors do not always effectively review grant files for  compliance with grant policies. According to staff we interviewed in the  three regions, to their knowledge, their supervisors had not reviewed their  files to assess compliance with the agency\u2019s monitoring policies, which  could contribute to the lack of documentation. A regional project officer  told us that he would have completed the ongoing monitoring checklist if  his regional program supervisor had made it a priority. In another region,  officials told us that some supervisors do review some files, but they do  not have enough time to review every file.", "In contrast, supervisory review can contribute to complete documentation  of ongoing monitoring. For example, Region 5 was cited as having  \u201cexcellent\u201d documentation for ongoing monitoring in an Office of Grants  and Debarment 2003 internal review. According to the EPA supervisor in  Region 5 at the time of the 2003 review, she had notified staff that she  would review their grant files to assess compliance with EPA policy for  ongoing monitoring, among other things. She believes that her review  contributed to the region\u2019s excellent rating.", "Third, senior EPA managers in the regions do not always ensure that their  commitments to improve monitoring documentation are being met. For  example, in the post-award monitoring plans submitted to the Office of  Grants and Debarment for two of the EPA regions we visited, the plans  stated that the regions would place a checklist in the grant specialist and  project officer files documenting ongoing monitoring activities. Although  the two regions developed the checklists, more than half of the checklists  we reviewed were missing, blank, or incomplete. This occurred, in part,  because senior managers did not ensure that the commitments they made  were met in their post-award monitoring plans.", "Despite the importance of ongoing monitoring, EPA has not created a  performance measure for documenting ongoing monitoring that would  underscore its importance to managers and staff. Furthermore, EPA\u2019s  Integrated Grants Management System has a field for recording  information about ongoing monitoring that could enable the agency to  systematically identify whether this monitoring is documented  agencywide, but recording this information is optional.

Delays in closing  out the grant can unnecessarily tie up obligated but unexpended funds that  could be used for other purposes. Furthermore, according to EPA\u2019s  closeout policy, closeout becomes more difficult with the passage of time  because persons responsible for managing various aspects of the project  may resign, retire, or transfer; and memories of events are less clear.", "The monitoring policy states that the agency is committed to closing out  grants within 180 days after the end of the grant\u2019s project period.

In fact, EPA had identified closeout, among other things, as a  material weakness\u2014an accounting and internal control weakness that the  EPA Administrator must report to the President and Congress. As we  reported in 2003, however, EPA improved its closeout of backlogged  grants, eliminating backlog as a material weakness.

The  measure, in fact, can allow for a much more generous closeout time, from  183 days beyond the 180 days to as much as 547 days (18 months) beyond  the 180 days\u2014because EPA does not report the performance measure  until September 30, the end of the current fiscal year, as shown by  hypothetical examples in table 4.", "EPA\u2019s current performance measure for closing out grants is a valuable  tool for determining if grants were ultimately closed out.

We reviewed 34 closed grants in three regions. First, as table 7 shows,  grantees often submit their final financial and technical reports after the  90 days that they are allowed.", "According to regional staff, different types of grantees may be submitting  their reports late for different reasons. Specifically:    States do not always provide their final technical and financial closeout  reports on time. The states may not be on time because, for example, they  (1) are understaffed; (2) are awaiting the completion of work conducted  by sub-grantees or subcontractors\u2014which can be legitimately delayed  because of weather conditions that affect the project\u2019s progress; or (3)  consider closeout a lower priority than applying for new grants.  Furthermore, states do not believe there will be any consequences if they  submit final reports late because their grants are for continuing  environmental programs.", "Tribes may submit their final reports late because of high turnover among  tribal staff and limited organizational capacity, and because tribal  councils, which meet intermittently, must approve the reports.", "While grantees are responsible for providing final reports within 90 days,  EPA staff are responsible for working with the grantees to ensure that the  reports are received on time. Under EPA\u2019s 1992 closeout policy, grant  specialists must notify grantees 90 days before the project end date that  final reports will be due 90 days thereafter. However, we found that  regional staff do not always send out these letters. For example, Region 5  adopted the practice of reminding grantees 45 days before the project end  date because the grants management office believes that the 90 days is too  long in advance to be effective. However, several Region 5 grant  specialists stated that their workload is also preventing them from sending  out the 45-day letter to grantees.", "According to EPA\u2019s closeout policy, if a grantee is late with the final  financial or technical report, the region should send reminder letters that  escalate in tone as time progresses. In Region 1, for example, if the grantee  does not submit its materials within 90 days, the grants management office  sends a letter asking that the grantee contact its grant specialist to discuss  the reasons for the overdue reports; if the region does not receive the  reports within 120 days after the project has ended, the grants  management office sends a certified letter that more strongly calls for the  submission of these required reports.", "When these letters do not result in grantee compliance, regional staff and  managers told us that they have no realistic option for taking strong action  against states that are late\u2014such as withholding money\u2014because these  grantees have continuing grants for environmental programs.", "Second, late closeouts result from a variety of internal agency delays. As  shown in table 8, of those files that had information that we could use to  determine the dates the reports were submitted, regional staff closed out  about half within the 90 days provided for in EPA guidance. For 9 of the 30  files that had this report information, it took the project officers or the  grant specialists over 180 days to close out the grant after receiving the  final reports from the grantees.", "For grant closeouts, generally, regional staff often cited workload as a  factor contributing to delays in agency closeout. Delays also occurred  because of peak workload periods during the year, such as the fourth  quarter of the fiscal year, when regions generally give priority to awarding  new grants. Officials in the three regions we visited also told us that they  have transferred or will transfer the administrative and financial functions  of grants closeout to EPA\u2019s Las Vegas Finance Center, which should  reduce the grant specialists\u2019 workload, allowing them to focus on other  aspects of grants management.", "Regional practices also may have contributed to delays in two of the three  regions we reviewed. Region 5 had two practices that contributed to  delays in closing out grants. First, the region uses technical contacts to  assist with monitoring the wetland and nonpoint source grant programs,  including closeouts. The project officer first reviews the grantee\u2019s final  reports to ensure they are complete and then asks the technical contact to  comment on specific points and certify in writing that technical  requirements have been met. The project officer then certifies in writing to  the grant specialist that the grantee has met programmatic terms and  conditions and, from that perspective, the grant can be closed out.  Regional staff stated that in certain cases the added step of getting signoff  by the technical contact resulted in closeout delays because the technical  contact did not always review the grantee\u2019s final reports in a timely way.", "Second, to address its closeout problem, the region\u2019s grants management  office attempted an administrative change to expedite closeout\u2014having a  single grant specialist manage closeout. When this approach did not prove  effective, the region returned to its practice of having the original grant  specialists responsible for closing out grants. According to regional staff,  the transition to and from this process exacerbated delays in grant  closeouts. The original grant specialists had other grant work and waited  until that work was completed before closing out the grants that were  returned to them. Region 5 had the lowest percentage of grants closing out  within 180 days for all its programs among EPA\u2019s 10 regions (16 percent  for fiscal year 2005 as shown in table 5).", "Region 9 had delayed closures for continuing nondiscretionary grants, in  part, because of a practice, discontinued in November 2004, of routinely  carrying over unspent funds from these grants. That is, the region would  not close out a grant until it had awarded a new grant. The unspent funds  from the old grant would then be processed as an amendment to the new  grant, in order to allow grantees to keep their unspent funds. For example,  one state nonpoint source grant was closed 278 days beyond the 180 days  because the project officer had asked the grant specialist to carry over  $426,000 in unspent funds to the following year\u2019s grant.", "Overall, a combination of grantee lateness and internal inefficiencies  contributed to late closeouts. For example:  In Region 5, it took 795 days\u2014615 days beyond the 180-day standard\u2014to  close out a 2-year wetland grant for $56,778. The grantee submitted the  final financial status report 114 days late because a key grant contact had  died. However, it took the region an additional 591 days after the grantee  provided the final reports to close out the grant. According to the grant  specialist, closeout was delayed, in part, because of internal administrative  delays and because the grant was \u201clost\u201d under a stack of other closeout  files.", "In Region 1, closure of a nonpoint source grant that provided $796,532  over 10 years was delayed primarily because of a lack of documentation.  According to the project officer who inherited the file from a retiring  employee, the file had unusually poor documentation, with no assurance  that the grant\u2019s terms and conditions had been met. Moreover, the state  employee who assumed responsibility for the grant could not locate all the  reports detailing how the grant money had been used. Consequently, it  took the project officer nearly 5 months beyond the allotted 180 days to  review available information, ascertain that grant activities had been  completed, and close out the grant.", "According to some of the project officers and grant specialists staff with  whom we spoke, the 180 days allowed for closeout in EPA\u2019s policy is a  reasonable amount of time. Moreover, some staff said that if more days  were allowed, EPA might take longer. As noted in the closeout policy, as  more time passes and the original grant specialists and project officers  move on, it becomes more difficult to close out a grant. Finally, one  regional official pointed out that if the deadline for closeout were  extended, then unexpended funds would go unused for longer periods of  time, which would tie up funds that could have been used for other  purposes.", "We note, however, that EPA still has a 1992 closeout policy that is not  consistent with its current monitoring policy. Specifically, although both  the 1992 closeout policy and the monitoring policy state that closeout  should occur within 180 days after the end of the project period, the 1992  policy also states that closeout should occur within 180 days after receipt  of all required reports and other deliverables. This aspect of the 1992  policy could be construed to mean that EPA has up to 270 days to close  out grants since grantees have up to 90 days to submit their reports. Office  of Grants and Debarment officials stated that EPA has formed a work  group to review its monitoring and closeout polices. As part of its review,  the office plans to examine this inconsistency and the reasonableness of  the 180-day closeout requirement.

Furthermore, the guidance specifically states that the file  should include evidence of closeout, including the final report or product.", "In Region 1, we also identified an accountability concern when grants  were closed out by administrative project officers. An administrative  project officer for a Performance Partnership Grant had not always  received written approval from the technical contacts, who evaluated  grantee documents before the administrative project officer certified that  the grantee had met all the terms and conditions of the grant. According to  a regional official, technical contacts at times tell the project officer that  they have reviewed technical documents but do not provide written  approval.

Using its Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART),  OMB annually evaluates federal programs in four critical areas of  performance: program purpose and design, planning, management, and  results, each scored from 0 to 100. OMB combines these scores to create  an overall rating: effective, moderately effective, adequate, and ineffective.  In addition, programs that do not have acceptable performance measures  or have not yet collected performance data generally receive a rating of  \u201cresults not demonstrated.\u201d As table 10 shows, the PART ratings have  found that some of EPA\u2019s programs are \u201cineffective\u201d or \u201cresults not  demonstrated,\u201d although there has been some improvement from 2004  through 2006.", "Despite this progress, a closer examination of the ratings for 2006  indicated that, with one exception, the scores for the results component  were lower than the scores given to other components.

The analysis showed that EPA had an overall  shortage of project officers and grant specialists, expressed in full-time  equivalents. However, the contractor recommended that before EPA adds  staff, it take steps to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its grants  management operations. For example, the contractor recommended that  EPA review its grant activities and assign \u201cnoncore\u201d activities where  possible to auxiliary federal or nonfederal staff to improve operations,  freeing EPA staff to conduct their core work. It defined noncore activities  to typically include those that are related to grant closeouts.", "The Office of Grants and Debarment asked the grant offices to prepare  project officer workforce plans\u2014due in 2006\u2014that incorporate the  workload analysis to promote \u201caccountable\u201d grants management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Has Provided Some Training on Grant Policies", "paragraphs": ["As outlined in the Grants Management Plan, EPA has developed a long- term grants management training plan.

For  example, EPA held a grants management conference in 2004, attended by  465 EPA staff, which included workshops on new policies. In 2005, the  Office of Grants and Debarment conducted agencywide training on the  new competition policy. It also conducted training on the environmental  results policy.", "However, according to EPA staff, the amount of training has not been  sufficient to keep pace with the issuance of new grant policies. For  example:    A 2006 self-assessment conducted by one program office found that  project officers and managers expressed frustration that both the pace and  complexity of new policy requirements left project officers vulnerable  because they were not properly trained in the policies.", "A 2005 Region 9 self-assessment found that the region\u2019s project officers  did not believe that they had received sufficient guidance from their  programs in headquarters.", "A Region 1 official stated that the rapid pace of new policies and brief lead  time between issuance and the effective date made it too difficult for the  regions to adequately train staff on all the new policies related to grants  management. Nevertheless, Region 1 developed a training course for its  project officers on the award process to address new grant reform policies  issued in 2005. However, only about 25 of the region\u2019s 200 project officers  attended the optional 90-minute course, although there were three  opportunities to do so.", "Regional officials also noted that the grant reforms are changing the skill  mix required of both project officers and grant specialists. According to a  Region 5 official, the grant specialist was once a clerical position, but  additional responsibilities required under the new grants policies indicates  that a business degree or financial background would be helpful. Region 9  officials told us that traditionally project officers had technical and  scientific skills. However, the grant reforms had increased the need for  interaction with grantees, which required more skills in oral  communications, organization, and analysis.

The office does not directly oversee many of the managers  and staff who perform grants management duties, particularly the  approximately 2,100 project officers in headquarter and regional program  offices. This division of responsibilities makes it more difficult to hold  these staff accountable for grants management.", "In 2005, EPA\u2019s Inspector General reported that EPA was not holding  supervisors and project officers accountable for grants management.  Specifically:    EPA does not have a process to measure an individual project officer\u2019s  performance in carrying out grants management duties. In practice,  supervisors relied on project officers to inform them of grants  management weaknesses.", "EPA managers and supervisors are not discussing project officer grants  management responsibilities during end-of-year evaluations. Managers  were not discussing project officers\u2019 grants management responsibilities  during year-end evaluations; and, if grant issues were addressed, the  discussion focused on the grant recipient\u2019s performance, rather than on  the project officer\u2019s performance. Supervisors provided various reasons  for rating project officers without discussing grants management  responsibilities, stating, for example, that the year-end evaluation should  focus on problems or issues with grantee performance, and project  officers\u2019 responsibilities should be discussed at staff meetings or at other  times through the year.", "EPA managers had not conveyed weaknesses from the agency\u2019s internal  reviews and self-assessments to project officers. EPA managers did not  communicate weaknesses identified in internal reviews, such as a lack of  documentation of cost reviews and ongoing monitoring, and supervisors  were not aware of these identified weaknesses.", "Our review is consistent with the Inspector General\u2019s findings. As  previously discussed, EPA grants staff told us that their supervisors were  not reviewing their grant files to determine compliance with grant  monitoring policies. It is possible that the awarding, monitoring, and  closeout problems we found would have been mitigated by effective  supervisory review.", "In response to the Inspector General\u2019s concerns, EPA issued a plan in  January 2006 to ensure that the agency\u2019s new performance appraisal  system\u2014Performance Appraisal and Recognition System\u2014addresses  grants management responsibilities. The new system requires that (1)  appraisals of project officers and supervisors/managers include a  discussion of grants management performance; (2) performance  agreements and associated mid-year and end-of-year performance  discussions focus on key areas of preaward reviews of nonprofit grantees,  competition, post-award monitoring, and environmental results; and (3)  performance discussions take into account the results of internal reviews,  such as those conducted by the Office of Grants and Debarment, self- assessments, and performance measure reviews.

The council is to help develop and implement  new policies agencywide. Similarly, the regional offices we visited have  formed grants management councils to coordinate and implement grant  reforms with the region\u2019s grants management office and various program  offices.", "Despite the efforts of these various national- and regional-level offices,  managers, and councils to identify problems and undertake corrective  actions, some grants management problems still persist. For example,  although some of the regions we visited had implemented checklists as  internal controls to ensure the documentation of ongoing monitoring, the  regions did not ensure they were actually completed.

However, EPA has not resolved its long-standing problems in  documenting ongoing monitoring and closing out grants. As it revises its  management plan, EPA has an opportunity to tackle these continuing  problems.", "Without adequate documentation of ongoing monitoring, EPA cannot be  fully assured that grantees are on track to fulfilling the terms and  conditions of their grants. Furthermore, the agency\u2019s lack of  documentation indicates weaknesses at all levels: staff do not always  document their monitoring; supervisors do not always effectively review  grant files; and managers are not always meeting their commitments to  address known problems with lack of documentation. Despite the  importance of ongoing monitoring, EPA has not created a performance  measure and target for documenting monitoring, which should elevate the  importance of ongoing monitoring to the agency. EPA is also not taking  full advantage of its grants management database, which has a data field  for documenting ongoing monitoring. That is, EPA does not require  project officers and grant specialists to enter monitoring documentation  information into its database. With the information in the database, EPA  would be better able to determine that staff are meeting documentation  requirements. Use of performance measures and targets for ongoing  monitoring as well as the database could enhance accountability.", "EPA\u2019s current performance measure and target for closing out grants is a  valuable tool for determining if grants were ultimately closed out, but it is  not a tool for determining whether grants were closed out within the 180- days now specified in EPA\u2019s monitoring policy. EPA needs an  accompanying measure that accurately reports whether grants are closed  out within the 180 days or other standard EPA may establish. EPA\u2019s  current measure and target mask the fact that, agencywide, almost two- thirds of grants are not closed out within 180 days. A specific performance  measure and target will enable EPA to oversee and manage the timeliness  of grant closeout. We recognize that grantees\u2019 late submission of required  reports is a common problem that contributes to the lack of timeliness in  closing out grants. Because fixing this problem on a case-by-case basis is  difficult, the agency needs an overarching strategy to address it.", "Furthermore, in the three regions we visited, we found instances in which  appropriate documentation was missing from the closeout files. While we  do not know the extent of this problem agencywide, these problems could  indicate a major weakness that EPA may need to address. In responding to  a draft of this report, EPA acknowledged that it does have a problem in  closing out grants properly. Finally, we note that inconsistencies in EPA\u2019s  monitoring and closeout policies may hinder EPA\u2019s ability to close out  grants in a timely fashion.", "While EPA has made strides in trying to identify and obtain results from its  grants by issuing an environmental results policy, it has not yet established  a performance measure and target that reflect the policy\u2019s direction.", "Finally, the lack of effective supervision may have contributed to the  problems we identified.

At headquarters, we reviewed EPA\u2019s Grants  Management Plan, 2003-2008 and EPA policies that address awarding,  monitoring, and obtaining results from grants. We also reviewed reports  on EPA\u2019s grants management, including prior GAO reports; EPA\u2019s  Inspector General reports; the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s  Program Assessment Rating Tool; EPA\u2019s internal management reviews,  including comprehensive grants management reviews, post-award  monitoring plans, grants management self-assessments from 2003 to 2005;  an April 2005 workload analysis conducted by LMI, a government  consultant; and a closeout analysis prepared for GAO by the Office of  Grants and Debarment. We also interviewed officials in the Office of  Grants and Debarment and at the Office of Water.", "In addition, we reviewed EPA performance metric information. These  metrics are based on data from the agency\u2019s Integrated Grants  Management System, which is currently undergoing a data quality review,  and the Grant Information and Control System, which has not undergone a  data quality review. Given EPA\u2019s ongoing data quality review of the  Integrated Grants Management System\u2014and because we present EPA\u2019s  performance metric data as documentary evidence and do not use it as the  sole support for findings, conclusions, or recommendations\u2014we did a  limited reliability review of the two systems. Our assessment included (1)  information from GAO\u2019s prior data reliability assessment work on the two  systems and (2) interviews with an Office of Grants and Debarment  official about the data systems and data elements. We determined that the  performance information we used is sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To assess the progress and problems EPA has experienced from a regional  perspective, we selected EPA Office of Water programs under the Clean  Water Act, at the Subcommittee\u2019s request. We selected Wetland Program  Development Grants (wetland grants) because it is a discretionary grant  program\u2014that is, EPA decides who receives the award and its amount,  and the program is subject to competition. We selected Nonpoint Source  Management Program grants (nonpoint source grants) because it is type of  formula-based grant program\u2014grants that are often awarded on the basis  of formulas prescribed by law or agency regulation. We reviewed EPA\u2019s  progress at the regional level by selecting grants in 3 of EPA\u2019s 10 regional  offices: Region 1 (Boston), Region 5 (Chicago), and Region 9 (San  Francisco). We selected these regions because collectively they represent  a significant share of grant funding for the two programs we reviewed,  geographic dispersion, and a significant share of Performance Partnership  Grants among the regional offices.", "To ensure coverage of the grant life cycle\u2014from awarding to closing out  grants, we conducted a case study review of a nonprobability sample of  these two programs. Specifically, we asked EPA Regions 1, 5, and 9 to  provide lists of wetlands and nonpoint source grants awarded between  January 1, 2004, and June 30, 2005, and those grants officially closed  during this period. We targeted recently awarded and recently closed  grants because the grant reforms began in 2002. To complete the case  study, we reviewed two files per grant\u2014the project officer file and the  grant specialist file\u2014using a detailed data collection instrument. All data  entered in the data collection instrument was verified by a second party to  ensure the accuracy and validity of each entry. Additionally, we conducted  semistructured interviews with project officers and the grant specialists in  order to understand the files. Overall, we reviewed the files for 32 active  grants and 34 closed grants; and we interviewed administrative project  officers, project officers, and technical contacts, and grant specialists  about those files. We also interviewed senior resource officials and grants  management office managers in the three regions we visited.", "We were limited in the number of grants we could review because the case  study approach required multiple, detailed file reviews and interviews for  each grant. Consequently, we selected a nonprobability sample of active  and closed grants in the wetland and nonpoint source programs to review  in each of the three regions. For active grants in our nonprobability  sample, we sorted the grants by recipient type, project officer, and grant  specialist to provide a distribution, and then randomly selected grants for  review. For closed grants, we sorted the grants similarly, but we also  selected grants based on the length of time it took to close out the grant.  Because the case study design is nonprobabilistic, the findings are not  generalizable to all grants in all regions. However, the case study design  provides insights into regional grant activities for the two Clean Water Act  programs in three regions, and it offers an in-depth perspective on some of  the successes and continuing problems EPA faces in implementing its  grants management reforms. Table 12 shows the population of wetland  and nonpoint program grants in Regions 1, 5, and 9, and the number of  those grants we reviewed.", "We experienced some limitations in conducting our review. For example,  we were not able to assess the implementation of some EPA policies at the  regional level because they had been issued too recently to assess during  our file review time frame. We also found evidence in two of the three  regions we visited that staff had added materials to their files after we had  requested the files and before our review, despite the fact that we had  taken precautions to avoid this situation. That is, we had asked the regions  to inform staff not to add documents to files once they were requested,  and we limited the time frame between our request for specific files and  our review of the files. When we determined that these additions had  occurred, we took mitigating steps to \u201crestore\u201d the grant files to their  original state. Specifically, we checked the dates of documents to detect  any widespread updating of files, asked all project officers and grant  specialists we interviewed who were assigned to the grants in our sample  whether they added anything to the file in preparation for the GAO visit,  asked managers to tell their staff to point out materials added to the file,  and, in one region, shortened the time between file request and our visit.  To adjust for the alterations, we used a special code in our data collection  instrument to denote \u201cadditions,\u201d and later subtracted the information in  our analysis.
