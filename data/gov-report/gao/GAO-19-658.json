However, because CBP has not updated many of its policies\u2014in a few cases for almost 20 years\u2014they do not always reflect changes in technology or processes, such as those for conducting searches and handling fentanyl. By reviewing and updating policies, CBP could help ensure officers have guidance needed to consistently and properly perform inspections.", "CBP has various mechanisms at the port, field office, and national levels to monitor inspection activities at land POEs, but opportunities exist to enhance analysis of the results from its national level Self-Inspection Program (SIP) and covert operational testing. The SIP is an annual self-assessment that POEs are to conduct to determine compliance with CBP policies. CBP analyzes the results of the SIP annually to identify systemic compliance issues across CBP that year; however, it does not analyze noncompliance at individual POEs over time. By analyzing these data, CBP could better identify and address deficiencies at individual POEs. In addition, CBP has produced three comprehensive assessments, which analyzed aggregated results for certain types of covert tests, such as fraudulent document tests, conducted at land POEs in fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2018. However, CBP has not done so for other types of tests, such as canine contraband detection tests, conducted from fiscal years 2013 through 2018. By implementing a policy for periodically conducting such analyses, CBP could identify vulnerabilities, trends, and best practices occurring more broadly.", "CBP uses various sets of measures to assess its efforts to detect illegal activity at land POEs.

Although the information provided in this report is more limited, the report  addresses the same objectives as the sensitive report and uses the same  methodology.", "To address all of the above questions, we focused on inbound inspection  activities at land POEs designed to identify and interdict contraband, such as narcotics, and determine the admissibility of travelers. We analyzed  CBP policies, procedures, and reports on inbound inspections. We also  visited a nonprobability sample of land POEs to observe inspections and  interview CBP POE officials on inspection processes, efforts to monitor  the implementation of inspection activities, and use of performance  measures. Specifically, we conducted site visits to seven POEs: Nogales  and Douglas, AZ; San Ysidro and Otay Mesa, CA; El Paso and Marcelino  Serna, TX, and Buffalo-Niagara Falls, NY. We selected these land POEs  using a combination of the following factors: a range of traffic volume;  presence of crossings for passenger vehicles, pedestrians, and  commercial vehicles; a range of geographic locations; proximity to other  ports; and presence of unique or new inspection processes or technology.  The results of our site visits cannot be generalized more broadly to all  land POEs. However, they provide important context and insights into  how CBP is conducting, monitoring, and assessing the effectiveness of  inspections. During our site visits we also interviewed CBP Field Office  officials responsible for overseeing land POE operations. Further, we  interviewed CBP headquarters officials responsible for overseeing  inspection processes, policies, technology, efforts to monitor and assess  compliance, and performance measurement at land POEs.", "To determine the extent to which CBP has processes and policies in  place for the inspection of passengers, pedestrians, and commercial  vehicles at land POEs, we also analyzed DHS and CBP directives, policy  memoranda, standard operating procedures, and documentation on  technology. These processes include the use of law enforcement  databases, non-intrusive inspection equipment, and canines to screen  individuals, vehicles, and cargo seeking entry to the United States.

Additionally, we analyzed Self-Inspection Program (SIP)  reports and data from 2013 to 2018 to determine the extent to which CBP  analyzes SIP results. To assess the reliability of SIP data, we reviewed  documentation on system controls, interviewed knowledgeable CBP  officials, and analyzed the data for any potential gaps and errors. We  determined the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of reporting  SIP results related to operations at land POEs for 2013 through 2018. To  determine the extent the CBP analyzes covert testing at land POEs, we  analyzed test protocols, summaries of test results, and comprehensive  assessments of aggregated test results from fiscal years 2013 through  2018.

These inspections involve a targeting process in which CBP  uses law enforcement databases to identify and target higher-risk  passengers, pedestrians, commercial vehicles, and cargo before arrival at  a land POE.", "Targeting. CBP uses law enforcement, intelligence, and other  enforcement data to identify higher-risk individuals, vehicles, or cargo for  additional scrutiny upon their arrival at a land POE. Most cargo-carrying  commercial vehicles must submit an electronic manifest (e-manifest) with  information on the shipment to CBP at least 1 hour in advance of arrival  at a land POE. CBP personnel at the POEs are to use the e-manifest and  CBP\u2019s Automated Targeting System to identify high-risk inbound cargo.  The Automated Targeting System is a decision support tool that  compares traveler, cargo, and conveyance information against law  enforcement, intelligence, and other enforcement data using risk-based  targeting scenarios and assessments. It draws on many law enforcement,  intelligence, and other enforcement databases, including the Terrorist  Screening Database, the Department of Justice\u2019s National Crime  Information Center, the Social Security Administration Death Master File,  and the National Insurance Crime Bureau\u2019s private database of stolen  vehicles. CBP policy requires that high-risk cargo be targeted for  additional research and analysis and generally will also require the high- risk cargo to undergo a secondary examination once it arrives at the  POE.", "In addition, CBP personnel at the POEs or field offices may review  seizure and arrest reports, and other law enforcement information to  identify individuals or vehicles that have associations with known  criminals and place a \u201clookout\u201d on them in TECS, CBP\u2019s system for  processing travelers. TECS will flag travelers with lookouts for additional  inspection if they arrive at the land POE. CBP personnel at the POEs or  field offices may also use this information to develop products on recent  trends that can help inform inspections.", "Once passengers, pedestrians, and commercial vehicles arrive at a land  POE, CBP has various processes for inspecting them, including  preprimary, primary, and secondary inspections, as explained below (see  figure 2).", "Preprimary. In the preprimary area, both commercial vehicles and  passenger vehicles will generally pass through radiation portal monitors  that are designed to detect radiation and help prevent the smuggling of  nuclear material into the United States (see figure 3).", "In the passenger vehicle environment, the preprimary area also contains  license plate readers and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) readers  to capture information on vehicles and RFID-enabled travel documents.  Examples of RFID-enabled travel documents include passport cards and  border crossing cards. When a vehicle enters the preprimary inspection  lane, a sensor grid determines that a vehicle has entered the lane. The  sensors deploy a flash strobe that illuminates the area and license plate  reader cameras take a picture of the front and rear of the vehicle. The  information associated with the license plate number is run against law  enforcement databases to alert the officer during the primary inspection if  there is a potential issue with the vehicle or its occupants. Similarly, as a  vehicle approaches the primary inspection area, travelers are directed to  hold up their RFID travel documents to be read by RFID readers. Some  land POEs may also have RFID readers for pedestrians. See figure 4 for  examples of a license plate reader and RFID reader.", "The preprimary area is also used to direct travelers to different lanes  according to the type of travel documents they have. For example, CBP  may use signs to designate specific lanes for travelers with RFID or other  machine readable documents (\u201cReady lanes\u201d) or for trusted travelers (see  figure 5).", "Primary inspection. During the primary inspection, CBP officers inspect  travelers, vehicles, and cargo to determine compliance with U.S. law and  admissibility to the United States. A CBP officer is to examine travel  documents to ensure their validity and visually match the traveler to the  photo identification to confirm the traveler\u2019s identity. All travelers\u2019 names  and license plates generally are to be screened against law enforcement  databases. As previously discussed, this screening process may begin in  the preprimary area when license plate and RFID readers collect data on  vehicles and travelers with RFID travel documents. CBP officers may also  manually enter data on travelers and vehicles during the primary  inspection. A CBP officer is to interview travelers to obtain a declaration  of citizenship, the purpose of travel, and items acquired outside the  United States. For commercial vehicles, the CBP officer may also review  the manifest and the results of targeting, if any. All CBP officers  conducting primary inspections are to wear personal radiation detectors\u2014 small devices designed to be worn on a belt\u2014to help detect radiation and  help ensure the safety of officers and the traveling public.", "If the inspection cannot be completed at the primary inspection location, a  more thorough inspection is required and the travelers, vehicles, or cargo  are to be referred for secondary inspection. Travelers, vehicles, or cargo  can be directed to secondary inspection for a wide range of issues,  including when:  radiation is detected (either on the traveler or from his or her vehicle),  the traveler does not have required travel documents,  the officer has questions about the validity of travel documents,  the traveler\u2019s information matches information that may be of concern  from law enforcement or intelligence data, or  the officer suspects that the traveler is carrying contraband.", "Foreign visitors to the United States (with the exception of Canadian  citizens and Mexican citizens using border crossing cards) may also be  referred to secondary inspection to complete processing of their  admission records, referred to as Form I-94s. Additionally, CBP selects  passenger vehicles at random to be sent to a secondary inspection for a  Compliance Examination (COMPEX). COMPEX is a program designed to  help measure the effectiveness of CBP\u2019s inspections and is discussed in  more detail later in this report.", "Secondary inspection. A secondary inspection may include a CBP  officer conducting further questioning of travelers or additional  examination of the traveler, vehicle, or cargo. CBP may use canines, non- intrusive inspection (NII) X-ray, Gamma-ray, or radiation detection  equipment, or physically examine the traveler, vehicle, or cargo. CBP  may also examine a traveler\u2019s electronic devices, such as computers,  tablets, and mobile phones. To examine cargo, CBP may require the  contents to be offloaded. When foreign visitors are referred to a  secondary inspection to process Form I-94 admission records, CBP  officers are to conduct interviews and additional database screening,  including biometric checks of fingerprints. CBP policy calls for  documentation, immigration, and other admissibility issues to be resolved  before a traveler or vehicle is permitted to enter the country. Below, figure  6 shows a canine examination and figure 7 shows an example of NII  equipment and scans of vehicles with indicators of contraband smuggling.", "CBP also has additional processes to enhance preprimary, primary, or  secondary inspections at land POEs, including:", "Canines. CBP has canines that can detect concealed humans,  narcotics, currency, firearms, and agriculture products. Depending on  availability, land POEs may deploy officers with canines to walk  among the vehicles in preprimary waiting to reach an inspection  booth. Canines may also be used in the pedestrian and commercial  vehicle environments. As previously mentioned, canines are also  used for some secondary searches.", "Anti-Terrorism Contraband Enforcement Teams. These teams  conduct special operations that focus on anti-terrorism and the  interdiction of narcotics, alien smugglers, and fraudulent documents,  among other contraband. For example, at one POE we visited,  members of the Anti-Terrorism Contraband Enforcement Team told us  they often walk among the passenger vehicles in the preprimary area  to look for indicators of illicit activity.", "Tactical Terrorism Response Teams. These teams provide  immediate counterterrorism response capabilities at some land POEs.  Members of Tactical Terrorism Response Teams receive  counterterrorism training and are responsible for interviewing known  and suspected terrorists at ports of entry to help determine  admissibility and collect intelligence.", "Blitzes and other local practices. CBP officers at land POEs may  perform \u201cblitzes\u201d, in which inspections are enhanced for a period of  time. For example, CBP officials told us that blitzes may include  looking in all vehicle trunks during the primary inspection or sending  additional vehicles for NII (X-ray) exams during a certain period of  time. Officers at the POEs we visited also discussed other local  initiatives to enhance inspections. For example, one POE we visited  used NII to screen all commercial vehicles. Another POE we visited  partnered with the local authority that manages an international bridge  to deploy license plate readers for commercial vehicles before the  vehicles enter the bridge into the United States. The bridge authority  uses the license plate reading to check if the commercial vehicle has  submitted the required e-manifest to CBP; only those commercial  vehicles that have submitted the required e-manifests are allowed to  cross. Officials from CBP told us that, in the future, CBP and the  bridge authority plan to deploy additional technology in the preprimary  area on the non-U.S. side of the border, including facial recognition  and NII.", "In addition, CBP has plans to make future improvements to inspection  processes. For example, CBP is conducting tests to use facial recognition  technology as part of inspections at land POEs. According to CBP, facial  recognition technology may enhance its ability to detect imposters by  matching facial images of those arriving with images on file. CBP began a  facial recognition test in the passenger vehicle environment at the  Anzalduas, Texas land POE in August 2018 and expects the test to run  for up to 1 year. In September 2018, CBP initiated a project at the Port of  San Luis, Arizona to demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring photos of all  arriving pedestrians and comparing those photos to photos on file.  Subsequently, in October 2018, CBP officials stated they extended this  demonstration project to the Port of Nogales, Arizona. According to CBP,  these pedestrian demonstration projects built upon an earlier pilot project  at the Port of Otay Mesa, California, which ran from February through  May 2016.
