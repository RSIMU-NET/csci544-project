Congress established the NFIP in 1968 to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance in response to the escalating costs of repairing flood damage. During congressional hearings on provisions of the Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004, several legislators testified on NFIP shortcomings, as reported by constituents whose properties had been flooded by Hurricane Isabel in September 2003. The act required GAO to study coverage provided under the NFIP. It also required the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the administrator of the NFIP, to take steps to address concerns about coverage and claims procedures. Today's testimony is based on work in progress to address this mandate. It provides preliminary information on (1) the types of coverage limits, restrictions, and exclusions under the NFIP; (2) how FEMA, in partnership with private insurers, manages and oversees the NFIP and the views of selected private sector program managers on how the program is working; and (3) the status of FEMA's efforts to comply with provisions of the Flood Insurance Reform Act."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As a result of policy limits, restrictions, and exclusions, insurance payments to claimants for flood damage may not cover all of the costs of repairing or replacing damaged property. Some limitations are embedded in statute and others have been promulgated by FEMA pursuant to its statutory authority. FEMA officials said that the coverage limitations are necessary to keep the NFIP self-supporting and actuarially sound. Thus, the program is designed to strike a balance between premium prices and coverage. For example, homeowners may choose not to insure personal property under the program. If they do elect to have this coverage, the value of personal property is depreciated. Basement coverage does not include payment to repair or replace finished walls and floors. The work of selling, servicing, and adjusting claims on NFIP policies is carried out by thousands of private sector insurance agents and adjusters under the regulation, management, and oversight of about 40 FEMA employees assisted by about 170 contractor employees. Agents are the main point of contact for policyholders. Four private sector NFIP managers we interviewed said that the agents have varying levels of NFIP knowledge. While training and support are available, historically neither FEMA nor the insurance companies have required completion of training or demonstration of basic program knowledge. Flood-certified adjusters are responsible for assessing damage and estimating losses when flooding occurs. Unlike agents, adjusters have mandatory training requirements. FEMA has oversight mechanisms in place to review the operations of the insurance companies and the work of adjusters. The private sector NFIP managers GAO interviewed were generally supportive of the program. However, they said that FEMA should find ways to make it less complex than and more similar to other property insurance programs. FEMA has taken steps to address its mandates in the Flood Insurance Reform Act, but it did not meet the 6-month timeframe specified. For example, to establish an insurance agent training requirement, an official said FEMA is discussing options but has not developed an action plan. To meet the requirement to provide \"simple and complete information\" to NFIP policyholders, FEMA has drafted materials explaining coverage, deductibles, and claim- and appeals-related procedures that it expects to have finalized by October 2005."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing to discuss the  National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and the Federal Emergency  Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) role in overseeing processes for issuing  policies and adjusting claims after floods occur. My testimony is based on  preliminary results to date of our ongoing review of the NFIP, as mandated  by the Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004.", "According to NFIP statistics, 90 percent of all natural disasters in the  United States involve flooding. However, flooding is generally excluded  from homeowner policies that typically cover damage from losses  including wind, fire, and theft. Because of the catastrophic nature of  flooding and the inability to adequately predict flood risks, private  insurance companies are largely unwilling to underwrite and bear the risk  of flood insurance.", "Under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, Congress established the  NFIP to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance in response  to the escalating costs of repairing flood damage. In creating the NFIP,  Congress found that \u201ca program of flood insurance with large-scale  participation of the federal government and carried out to the maximum  extent practicable by the private insurance industry is feasible and can be  initiated.\u201d Under the NFIP, homeowners with mortgages insured by  federal lenders on property in communities identified to be in special high- risk flood hazard areas are required to purchase flood insurance on their  dwellings, up to a maximum of $250,000 in coverage for single-family  homes. Optional, lower-cost coverage is also available under the NFIP to  protect homes in areas of low to moderate risk. To insure furniture and  other contents against flood, property owners must purchase separate  NFIP personal property coverage for up to $100,000.", "FEMA, the agency responsible for coordinating the federal response to  disasters, administers the NFIP. FEMA has been generally successful in  keeping the NFIP on sound financial footing. FEMA reports that the NFIP  is self-supporting for the average historical loss year, which means that  operating expenses and flood insurance claims are not paid for by the  taxpayer, but through premiums collected on flood insurance policies.  FEMA has exercised its authority to borrow from the Treasury three times  in the last decade when losses were heavy. However, it has repaid all  borrowed funds with interest.", "By 2005, the NFIP is projected to have approximately 4.7 million  policyholders in the nearly 19,000 participating communities, with   $699 billion of insurance in force. Since its inception, the program has paid  about $12 billion in insurance claims, primarily from policyholder  premiums that otherwise would have been paid through taxpayer-funded  disaster relief or been borne by the home and business owners themselves.", "During congressional hearings held last year on the Flood Insurance  Reform Act of 2004, several legislators testified on NFIP concerns as  reported by constituents whose properties had been flooded by Hurricane  Isabel in September 2003. Problems they reported included inadequate  payments and unclear policies and procedures for filing and adjusting  damage claims. According to NFIP statistical data, NFIP policyholders  filed about 23,770 claims for $454.2 million for flood damage as a result of  this storm, primarily in Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina.", "Several months later, the hurricane season that began in August 2004  struck hard in Florida and other East and Gulf Coast states. In Florida  alone, more than one in five homes suffered wind, rain, flood, or other  damage from the hurricanes, according to FEMA. According to NFIP data,  the combined impact of Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne in  August and September 2004 made them the most costly catastrophes in  U.S. history, surpassing the costs of Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and the  World Trade Center and Pentagon terrorist attacks in 2001. FEMA  reported that these storms resulted in 59,125 NFIP claims for more than  $1.3 billion in payments as of March 2005 on claims that have been closed.", "To meet our legislative mandate, as modified and expanded to include  information on the 2004 hurricane season, and as discussed with your  committee and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban  Affairs, we are reviewing several issues related to NFIP claims and  FEMA\u2019s oversight role. Today, we are prepared to provide preliminary  information on (1) the types of limits, restrictions, and exclusions to  coverage that exist under the NFIP; (2) how FEMA, in partnership with  private insurers, manages and oversees the NFIP, and the views of  selected private sector NFIP program managers on how the program is  working; and (3) the current status of FEMA\u2019s efforts to comply with  provisions of the Flood Insurance Reform Act that mandate it establish  insurance agent education and training requirements, new processes for  explaining coverage to policyholders when they purchase and renew  policies, and an appeals process for claimants. In addition, appendix I  presents data on policies in force and payments claimants received under  the NFIP for flood events over the life of the program through 2004.", "To address these issues, we collected data from the NFIP management  information system, examined program documentation, and interviewed  officials of FEMA and its program contractor. We also interviewed four  private sector NFIP program managers for insurance companies and  managers at one vendor\u2014a company that subcontracts with insurance  companies to handle all or part of their flood business. Using a  semistructured interview instrument, we asked these managers how their  operations are managed and reviewed, how they believe the program is  working, and what suggestions they have for improvements. In  consultation with FEMA officials, we selected the interviewees because  they are among the largest private sector partners for the NFIP. We  observed FEMA-sponsored training of insurance agents and adjusters and  a FEMA oversight review of the management of a private insurance  company\u2019s NFIP business.", "Our work that forms the basis of the preliminary observations presented in  our testimony today is still in progress. For example, we have not yet  completed our review of the NFIP program and the claims made after  Hurricane Isabel and the 2004 hurricane season. Among the ongoing work  to be completed prior to issuing our report later this year are (1) an  assessment of the reliability of FEMA\u2019s management information system,  (2) interviews with the general adjusters who supervised claims  adjustments in Maryland after Hurricane Isabel and in Florida during the  2004 hurricane season, (3) observations of FEMA\u2019s monitoring and  oversight activities, and (4) a review of the operational reviews FEMA has  done over the last several years. Our work is being done in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "In summary, we found:    The NFIP is not designed to cover all flood losses. Some limitations are  embedded in statute and others have been promulgated by FEMA  pursuant to its statutory authority to keep the program self-supporting and  actuarially sound. For example, the limited coverage allowed for  basements does not include payment to repair or replace finished walls,  floors, furniture, and other personal property.", "The work of selling, servicing, and adjusting claims on NFIP policies is  carried out by thousands of private sector insurance agents, adjusters, and  other employees. The private sector effort is regulated, managed, and  overseen by about 40 FEMA employees with the assistance of about   170 contractor employees. The private sector program managers we  interviewed said that the NFIP has many positive aspects, but its  implementation is complex for policyholders, agents, and adjusters. Each  of the four interviewees, when asked how the NFIP could be improved,  said that FEMA should look for ways to make the program less complex  and more similar to other property insurance programs.", "Although its 6-month deadline elapsed in December 2004, FEMA continues  its efforts to comply with mandates of the Flood Insurance Reform Act  that it establish (1) insurance agent education and training requirements,  (2) new processes for explaining coverage to policyholders when they  purchase and renew policies, and (3) an appeals process for claimants  who are dissatisfied with the settlement of their claims. FEMA officials  said that the rule-making process required for two of the initiatives takes  more than 6 months to complete.

If the company  continues to have problems and fails to implement an action plan, it can  ultimately be withdrawn from the NFIP. According to FEMA officials, a  company has been asked to withdraw from the NFIP once in the program\u2019s  history.
