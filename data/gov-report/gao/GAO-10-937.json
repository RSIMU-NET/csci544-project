For example, the average difference between a school's proposed and its negotiated rate was much larger for schools with HHS as the cognizant rate-setting agency than for those with DOD, in part due to the agencies' differing approaches to negotiation. GAO also found that schools receiving a 1.3 percent add-on to their rate to assist with the cost of utilities both proposed and negotiated higher rates than those without the adjustment. Contrary to guidance to periodically review school eligibility, the fixed list of schools eligible to receive this add-on has not been revisited since established in 1998. The cap on the administrative portion of the indirect cost rate limited fiscal year 2007 reimbursement for about 83 percent of schools. The cap was established nearly 20 years ago with the intent of limiting federal reimbursement for schools' administrative costs, and OMB has not reexamined this cap since its implementation. We estimate the DOD basic research cap might have limited fiscal year 2008 reimbursement for some awards at about 22 percent of schools, but the limitation depends on the types of costs included in each individual award and is difficult to determine up front on a schoolwide basis until total costs for each award are tallied. GAO identified weaknesses in the three methods DOD says it uses to oversee that indirect costs for research grants are reimbursed appropriately: the single audit, the closeout process, and audits by DOD's Defense Contract Audit Agency or by cognizant agencies for audit. At least one of the three methods was used at most of the schools we reviewed, but four schools were not covered by any of the methods, indicating a gap in coverage. In our discussions with cognizant agencies for audit, we learned that recent audits of research awards to schools at HHS have led to some significant findings of improper billings of indirect costs. Inconsistencies in rate-setting and reimbursement processes lead to perceived and actual differences in the treatment of schools. Moreover, because of the weaknesses in its oversight methods, DOD lacks assurance that it is reimbursing indirect costs appropriately."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making recommendations to address consistency in rate-setting and to improve oversight of indirect cost reimbursement.

The federal government has  recognized that university research contributes to American  competitiveness and leadership in science, in effect creating shared goals  between the federal government and universities, and has committed to  sponsoring a share of the research costs. The government\u2019s contribution  can be broken down into direct costs (those costs specifically identified  with individual research projects) and indirect costs (those that are not  directly attributable to a specific project or function, such as the costs for  administrative staff), also referred to as facilities and administrative costs  when dealing with higher education institutions. While direct costs are  relatively easy to define and measure, indirect costs can be more difficult  to allocate to individual projects. Further, there has been debate over what  portion of indirect costs is the responsibility of the government and what  portion is the responsibility of the research institution.", "Over the years, Congress has enacted legislation and agencies have issued  guidance to clarify what indirect costs the government will reimburse. For  example, in the early 1990s, revisions to the Cost Principles for  Educational Institutions limited reimbursement of the administrative  portion of indirect costs for higher education institutions to 26 percent of  the modified total direct cost base. More recently, Congress enacted  legislation which capped the reimbursement of indirect costs on  Department of Defense (DOD) basic research grants, contracts, and  cooperative agreements to 35 percent of the total cost of the award. The  House Committee on Armed Services Report for the Duncan Hunter  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (H.R. 110-652)  directed that we review the DOD processes and procedures related to  indirect costs for research. In response, we examined the following issues  related to higher education institutions performing basic research for  DOD: (1) the variation in proposed and negotiated indirect cost rates and  factors that may contribute to variations; (2) how and to what extent the  administrative cap and the DOD basic research cap limit the government\u2019s  reimbursement of indirect costs; and (3) the methods DOD uses for  overseeing compliance with indirect cost reimbursement for grants and  the extent to which each method was used.", "To determine the proposed and negotiated indirect cost rates at higher  education institutions performing DOD basic research, we surveyed  university administration officials at schools that DOD reported had active  grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements in fiscal year 2007 that were  coded as basic research. The survey sample was comprised of (1) the 32  higher education institutions that received more than half of the funding  DOD obligated for basic research, and (2) a random selection of 146 higher  education institutions with obligations of more than $100,000 in fiscal year  2007. Of the 178 sampled higher education institutions to whom we sent  the surveys, 144 responded for an 87 percent response rate. Of the 144  respondents, 114 used a standard format proposal for negotiating an  indirect cost rate, and 29 used a simplified format proposal, which can be  used by higher education institutions that received $10 million or less in  total direct costs for federally sponsored grants, contracts, and  cooperative agreements annually. For the purposes of this report, we  produce population estimates for the higher education institutions within  the United States that use the standard format for proposal submission  and that DOD identified as performing more than $100,000 of basic  research in fiscal year 2007. Based on our survey, we estimate that this  would correspond to about 263 schools. Characteristics and demographic  information for the higher education institutions that used a simplified  form of submitting indirect cost rate proposals can be found in appendix  V. To determine what factors may contribute to rate variations, we  surveyed university administration officials concerning various factors,  such as the school\u2019s cognizant rate-setting agency (which can be either the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or DOD), whether an  institution received an adjustment for the cost of utilities, and whether an  institution is public or private (see appendix III for a list of factors),  interviewed DOD and HHS officials, and interviewed representatives from  higher education associations. Detailed analysis of the factors that  contribute to variations in research rates can be found in appendix III,  with the analysis of key factors included in the objective 1 findings. To  determine how and to what extent the administrative and DOD basic  research caps limit reimbursement of indirect costs, we collected  information through our survey of university administration officials at  higher education institutions and reviewed the intent and legislative  history of the administrative and DOD basic research caps. To identify and  understand the methods DOD uses for overseeing compliance with  reimbursement of indirect costs, we interviewed DOD officials. To  determine the extent to which each of the methods identified by DOD was  used, we focused on the 32 higher education institutions that received  more than half of DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2007 basic research obligations. For  these institutions, we reviewed documentation such as DOD guidance on  grant administration, financial reporting forms for grants, data from  independent public accounting firms on the research and development  awards sampled for the single audit, and previous reports by GAO and  others. We also interviewed officials at DOD, the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB), cognizant agencies for audit such as HHS, the National  Science Foundation (NSF), and the Department of Education, as well as  officials of independent public accounting firms and higher education  institutions to understand their role in reviewing indirect cost  reimbursement on DOD basic research awards.

For example, we estimate that about 60 percent of schools with  HHS as their cognizant rate-setting agency identified negotiation that was  not clearly tied to specific aspects of their rate proposal as a part of the  explanation for the negotiated rate reduction. For example, one school we  surveyed stated that HHS officials told them that 2 percentage points  would be the most that their rate could increase over the previous  negotiated rate. The National Director of HHS\u2019s Division of Cost Allocation  confirmed that a limitation on the increase in negotiated rates of   2 percentage points had been the practice in one of the DCA field offices.

For example, some schools said that DOD officials  made changes to the school\u2019s proposed classification and allocation of  space to research. In addition to the findings from the survey, interviews  with school officials revealed that schools perceived that the reasons for  rate reductions varied depending on which agency the school negotiated  with. For example, in discussions with a group of senior-level university  research administrators, HHS negotiations were described as arbitrary,  whereas administrators negotiating with DOD stated that they clearly  understood why reductions were being negotiated.

Although both cognizant agencies expressed a preference for negotiating  predetermined rates, in part due to the burden associated with carry- forward adjustments, in our survey 5 out of the 15 DOD schools negotiated  fixed with carry-forward rates, while no more than 1 percent of schools  with HHS as their rate-setting agency did.", "The year on which a school based its proposal for 2007 rates also varied by  the cognizant rate-setting agency, with schools negotiating with HHS  using, on average, earlier base years than those negotiating with DOD.

Further, schools that reported an early base year (2001 or earlier)  negotiated an average rate of 6.5 percentage points below their proposed  rate, compared to a 3.6 percentage point rate reduction for schools with  more recent base years. The interaction between cognizant rate-setting  agency, base year, and the degree of rate reduction may relate to the  different policies the two agencies have related to extending rates. DOD  officials stated that DOD does not allow extensions, whereas HHS policy  allows for an extension of an existing rate agreement in some  circumstances. HHS granted extensions to some of the schools included in  our survey and, according to HHS officials, many of the extensions were  granted with associated reductions in the rate, ranging from half a  percentage point to 2.5 percentage points.

The cap was  enacted in 1991 to stop abuses related to indirect cost reimbursement at  schools. In addition, the federal government acknowledged that indirect  costs were rising rapidly, and characterized the situation as problematic  and therefore in 1986 proposed what it considered to be a reasonable  ceiling on all administrative costs for that year. To determine the ceiling,  OMB used the 5-year average administrative rate component for all major  universities. OMB first proposed establishing the cap at 26 percent and  subsequently reducing the reimbursement rate to 20 percent after a year.  This further reduction was not included in the final revision of the circular,  but reflects the initial goal of controlling government costs even below the  average reimbursement rate for administrative costs.

OMB has not reopened the administrative  cap issue since its implementation because they have not seen evidence  that this is a priority issue.", "According to school and association officials we spoke with,  administrative costs have been rising over time. They attribute these  changes, in part, to increased federal regulations, such as regulations  related to national security standards, human subjects and animal care, as  well as reporting and audit requirements, having large impacts on their  indirect costs. However, school and association officials were unable to  provide an estimate of the increased costs associated with federal  regulations. In response to these regulations, schools we surveyed report  taking a number of actions that have raised administrative costs. These  include the following:    hiring new staff to, for instance, report data on grants and subrecipient    opening new offices to monitor compliance with federal regulations,  implementing new information technology systems,    developing processes for improving security and safety, and  training staff on new systems and compliance efforts.", "In order to respond to the government\u2019s research needs with respect to  complex research topics, such as nanotechnology, some schools we  surveyed report making investments in research capabilities which could  require hiring personnel to manage programs in new or upgraded facilities.  Schools claim these indirect costs may not be fully reimbursed because of  the administrative cap. Since the implementation of the administrative  cap, some schools tell us they have had to identify additional sources of  funding to conduct the research. When asked how they bridge the gap  between actual administrative costs and the reimbursement from the  federal government for administrative costs, school officials offered  examples including the use of funds from university endowment and  investments, and student tuition.", "Some government officials have also observed increasing administrative  costs over time. For example, HHS officials who review indirect cost rate  proposals told us they have seen a trend of increasing administrative costs  reflected in schools\u2019 rate proposals. These officials attributed the  increased administrative costs to federal regulations such as post-9/11  regulations related to security standards and foreign students that have led  schools to spend resources on security clearances, student visas, and  other screening efforts. Despite reported increasing administrative costs  and related under-reimbursement, some DOD officials who are  responsible for awarding basic research told us that schools continue to  compete for federal research awards and produce the research that meets  the government\u2019s needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Administrative Cap and the DOD Basic Research Cap Limit Reimbursement for Schools in Different Ways", "paragraphs": ["The administrative cap and the DOD basic research cap limit government  reimbursement of indirect costs in distinct ways, as shown in table 2  below. Whereas the administrative cap limits reimbursement of  administrative costs specifically, the DOD basic research cap limits  reimbursement of all indirect costs for an applicable award. Additionally,  the design of each cap differs in terms of when the cap is calculated, what  entities and awards the cap applies to, and what cost base is used to  calculate the cap\u2019s impact.", "The differences in the way the caps limit reimbursement also means each  cap\u2019s impact may differ and cannot be compared to the other."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Cap on Indirect Costs for DOD Basic Research May Limit Reimbursement for Some Schools, but the Extent That Reimbursement Is Limited Is Difficult to Determine", "paragraphs": ["Approximately 22 percent of schools had a fiscal year 2008 indirect cost  rate high enough for awards to be potentially limited by the 35 percent cap  on indirect costs of DOD basic research awards. While the legislative  intent for including this cap in certain defense appropriations acts is  sparse, House Report 110-279 for the Department of Defense  Appropriations Bill, 2008 indicated that overhead costs had grown to  unwarranted levels, and the House Committee on Appropriations  recommended that DOD limit the percentage of overhead costs that would  be reimbursed for basic research awards. Because the cap could have  affected only some of the fiscal year 2008 awards at about 22 percent of  schools, the scope of its effect might have been limited.", "It is difficult to determine the extent to which the DOD basic research cap  will affect schools in part because its key features differentiate it from the  rate-setting and reimbursement structure outlined in OMB Circular A-21,  the guidance familiar to schools. The DOD basic research cap limits  reimbursement of indirect costs as a proportion of total award costs,  instead of MTDC, which has two important outcomes on the way its  impact is determined. First, the final impact on reimbursement cannot be  determined until total costs are tallied. Second, the cap\u2019s limitation  depends on the types of costs included in each individual award, and  therefore its impact cannot be determined up front on a schoolwide basis.  Moreover, because the cap uses a base of total costs instead of MTDC, the  cap is not structured in the same way as an indirect cost rate.  Consequently, the cap at 35 percent of total award costs does not require  schools to negotiate an indirect cost rate below 35 percent. However, in  our survey we found that some schools mistakenly perceived they would  be affected by the cap if their negotiated indirect cost rate was above   35 percent. For example, two schools stated that the 35 percent rate cap  was lower than their indirect cost rates of approximately 50 percent, and  therefore they believed the cap would decrease their reimbursement. In  another example, a school with a 45 percent indirect cost rate stated the  cap at 35 percent of indirect costs would result in a 10 percent reduction  in recovery of indirect costs on each of their awards. These schools  misunderstood how using a base of total costs instead of MTDC makes the  cap different than their indirect cost rates. In fact, none of the schools in  the examples stated above would be affected by the cap, because their  negotiated indirect cost rates were below 53.8 percent, a mathematically  determined threshold below which no school is affected by the cap.", "The 53.8 percent indirect cost rate at which awards may begin to be  affected by the DOD basic research cap is a minimum and does not mean  that all awards above this rate will be affected by the cap. Multiple schools  may have the same indirect cost rate above this threshold, but each school  may experience different effects from the cap, depending on the  proportion of direct costs that are excluded from the MTDC base for each  individual award. For example, we looked at a DOD award for each of two  schools in our survey that had indirect cost rates of 57 percent in fiscal  year 2007. One of the awards was for research on laser technology at a  large private school. The other award was for research on prostate cancer  at a smaller private school. With an indirect cost rate of 57 percent, if more  than about 6 percent of the total direct costs are excluded from MTDC,  reimbursement on an award is not limited by the DOD basic research cap.  Only one of the two sample awards would have been limited by the DOD  basic research cap because of the level of exclusions for the award. The  affected award\u2014research on prostate cancer at the smaller school\u2014had  no total direct costs excluded from its MTDC, making the proportion of  indirect costs to total costs above 35 percent. The award for laser  technology research at the larger school had more costs (9 percent)  excluded from its MTDC, and therefore the proportion of indirect costs to  total costs was below 35 percent. The higher the percentage of costs  excluded from an award\u2019s MTDC, the less likely the award would be  affected by the DOD basic research cap. Whether the DOD basic research  cap limits reimbursement depends on the level of an award\u2019s exclusions;  therefore, it is difficult for a school to pinpoint and predict the effects of  this cap on a schoolwide basis."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Three Methods DOD Uses to Oversee Reimbursement of Indirect Costs to Schools Have Weaknesses", "paragraphs": ["DOD identified three methods it uses to oversee indirect cost  reimbursement for research grants awarded to schools: the annual single  audit, the award closeout process, and agency audits, performed by DCAA  or by cognizant agencies for audit. However, we identified weaknesses in  DOD\u2019s use of each of these methods. DOD relies primarily on the single  audit, but some schools we reviewed were not individually audited as a  part of the single audit. The second method identified by DOD, the  closeout process, is conducted by DOD administrative grants or  contracting officers using various processes. However, DOD officials told  us they do not verify mathematically if the correct indirect cost rate and  dollar amount was charged at grant closeouts. The third method, audits by  DCAA or by cognizant agencies for audit, covered only a limited number of  the schools in fiscal year 2008, and cognizant agencies for audit had  inconsistent approaches to auditing the awards of other agencies, with  only HHS conducting a limited number of audits on DOD awards. At least  one of the three methods was used in fiscal year 2008 at 25 of the 32  schools we reviewed. However, 4 schools were not covered by any of the  three methods, indicating a gap in coverage (see table 3).", "In our discussions with cognizant agencies for audit, we learned that HHS  has increased the audits of research awards to schools in recent years,  which have led to some significant findings of improper billings of indirect  costs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Some Schools Are Not Individually Audited under the Single Audit, DOD\u2019s Primary Method for Overseeing Reimbursement of Indirect Costs", "paragraphs": ["DOD reports that its primary method for overseeing compliance with  indirect cost reimbursement on research grants is the annual single audit  under the Single Audit Act, as amended. The Single Audit Act adopted a  single audit concept to help meet the needs of federal agencies for grantee  oversight and accountability as well as grantees\u2019 needs for single,  uniformly structured audits. The act was intended to promote sound  financial management with respect to federal awards administered by  nonfederal entities. An audit performed in accordance with the Single  Audit Act is directed at operations of an entire entity. While the auditors  must conduct audit procedures that address particular compliance  requirements as they apply to specific federal programs identified by the  auditors as high risk, the Single Audit Act does not require that auditors  test all federal programs administered by an entity for compliance with all  related requirements. For a large and complex organization such as a  state government or a university system, the auditors examine selected  federal programs administered by the entity based on guidance in OMB\u2019s  Circular No. A-133 Compliance Supplement.", "OMB\u2019s Compliance Supplement identifies the compliance requirements  relevant to audits that are applicable to the major programs, including  research and development, and provides suggested audit procedures for  testing compliance with those requirements, including sampling. The  Compliance Supplement includes a section on testing for allowable costs,  including allowable indirect costs, and the auditor may sample a certain  number of transactions (claims for reimbursement) from federal awards.  Table 4 below shows the indirect cost audit objectives provided by the  Compliance Supplement for use by auditors for federal awards selected  for audit.", "For single audit reporting purposes, the parameters of the reporting can  differ from one school or school system to another. As a result, in some  cases individual educational institutions are considered separate entities  and audited separately, while in other cases they may be audited as a part  of a university system, or even as a part of an entire state government,  which includes numerous institutions or agencies within the reporting  entity.", "The fact that the single audit may not be sufficient to provide assurance  that an entity is in compliance with requirements for indirect costs  charged to research and development grants was reflected in our findings.  In 2008, no research and development awards or transactions were  selected for review at 7 of the 32 schools we reviewed. For 6 of these  schools no research and development awards or transactions were  selected because the schools were a part of larger reporting entities and  the auditors told us that the research and development program from  other schools within the larger reporting entity were selected for audit in  2008. Each of the 6 schools was either a campus at a major public  university and the entity was defined at the university-wide level, or the  entity was defined at the statewide level and the school was included  under the umbrella of the state. However, in terms of receiving federal  awards, each school functioned independently by, for example,  negotiating an indirect cost rate agreement with the federal government  that was only applicable to that school. Further, based on data from the  National Science Foundation, each of these schools received more than  $97 million in federal research and development funding in 2007, an  amount much greater than the $500,000 threshold over which an entity is  required to receive a single audit. For example, the University of California  (UC) was defined as one entity subject to the single audit, although each  of its 10 campuses and the Office of the President separately negotiate an  indirect cost rate agreement. In 2008, no research and development  awards or transactions were sampled for any of the 4 UC campuses  included in our 32 schools, including UC campuses at Berkeley, Los  Angeles, Santa Barbara, and San Diego, because the University of  California is defined as one entity. Similarly, in 2008 the University of  Virginia was defined as a part of the Commonwealth of Virginia for the  purposes of the single audit, although the university negotiates its own  indirect cost rate agreement with the federal government. Because the  university falls under the umbrella of the state as an entity, in 2008 no  research and development awards or transactions were selected from the  university for the single audit. Table 5 breaks down how many of the 32  schools that we reviewed had awards or transactions selected as a part of  the single audit in 2008, and how many did not.", "Furthermore, as shown in figure 10, based on data provided by  independent public accounting firms, few awards were sampled as a part  of the annual single audit in 2008, and even fewer DOD awards were  included in the sample. Specifically, for the 22 of the 32 schools where  research and development awards were sampled as a part of the 2008  single audit, the average number of total awards sampled was 21 awards,  and the average number of DOD awards sampled was 5. Also, the  percentage of total federal award dollars sampled for the annual single  audit ranged from 0.5 to 36 percent, and the DOD award dollars sampled  represented between 0.1 and 65 percent of all federal award dollars."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Does Not Use the Grant Closeout Procedure to Determine Whether Indirect Cost Charges Were Correct", "paragraphs": ["DOD also reported that it uses the award closeout procedure\u2014part of the  postaward administration process conducted on an award after its period  of performance has ended\u2014for overseeing indirect cost reimbursement to  schools. According to DOD, for grants to schools, postaward  administration responsibilities are generally delegated to administrative  grants or contracting officers at DOD\u2019s ONR. As a part of award closeout,  an ONR administrative grants or contracting officer reviews the costs  incurred under a given award to determine whether all costs are  allowable, allocable, and reasonable. According to DOD officials, an  administrative grants or contracting officer may also request an evaluation  of a final voucher be conducted. To facilitate a financial review, schools  fill out a final financial status report within 90 days of the end of the period  of performance, which is to be reviewed and approved by the  administrative grants or contracting officer. The Standard Form 425, or the  \u201cFederal Financial Report\u201d, is used for the final financial status report and  includes a section for recording indirect costs charged by the school on  the award.", "DOD officials at ONR asserted that they use the award closeout procedure  as a method for overseeing indirect cost reimbursements. However, DOD  administrative grants and contracting officers told us that they do not  regularly use the closeout procedure to determine whether or not the  dollar amounts of the indirect costs charged were correct. For example,  DOD administrative grants and contracting officers at two ONR regional  locations and two other DOD service locations that provide contract  administration services for school awards informed us they did not  regularly check indirect costs to determine if they were accurately  charged, even though we found that they can use information related to  indirect costs provided by awardees in the indirect expense section of the  Federal Financial Report to do so. OMB officials told us that, at a  minimum, awards officers are to use information in the Federal Financial  Report at award closeout to determine whether or not the correct indirect  costs were charged to the government. However, the Federal Financial  Report Instructions by OMB on completing the Indirect Expense section  of the form says to complete this section only if required by the awarding  agency and in accordance with agency instruction. According to DOD  officials, this section may or may not be required by DOD awarding  agencies and it is not the current practice of DOD administrative grants or  contracting officers that we spoke with to use information in the Indirect  Expense section to mathematically calculate if indirect costs were  accurately charged.", "While ONR administrative grants and contracting officers stated they do  not use information entered in the Federal Financial Report to verify that  indirect costs were charged accurately on a particular award, ONR does  use information in the form\u2019s Indirect Expense section, and other  information in the form, to determine whether or not a school charged  indirect costs at or below the DOD basic research cap of 35 percent of  total costs. For example, at the two regional ONR offices we visited, the  administrative grants and contracting officers informed us that ONR  developed a form that incorporates data from the Federal Financial Report  for use in determining whether or not an awardee receiving DOD basic  research funds was below the cap of 35 percent of total costs.

Approximately one-third of the audits and  evaluations performed were conducted at 1 of the 10 schools (see table 6  below). We asked the DCAA Chief in the Policy Programs Division whose  areas of responsibility include audits of schools to identify which types of  audit services would include a check on indirect costs. Based on the  official\u2019s descriptions of the audit services, about two-thirds of the audits  were of the type where indirect costs were a main purpose, about a third  of the audits were audit types where indirect costs were not the subject of  the audit but were tested as a part of the basis of the audit opinion, and 3  of the 88 audits were types of audits that typically do not test indirect  costs. Of note, 38 of the 88 audits were of the type conducted prior to an  award, for example, an audit of a proposal. In some cases, an audit that  takes place prior to an award may not oversee compliance with  reimbursement of indirect costs since the costs have not yet been  incurred.", "In addition to performing DCAA audits, DOD officials noted that DOD  awards to schools may be audited by other agencies, in particular when  another agency is designated the role of cognizant agency for audit for that  school. Award recipients expending more than $50 million in federal  funding are assigned a cognizant agency for audit in accordance with OMB  Circular No. A-133. Generally, the cognizant agency for audit is the federal  agency that provides the predominant amount of direct funding to a  recipient. Some of the responsibilities of the cognizant agency for audit  include coordinating audits by federal agencies of the school, performing  quality control reviews of audits by nonfederal auditors, and coordinating  a management decision for audit findings that affect federal programs of  more than one agency.", "We determined that there were four cognizant agencies for audit  (including DOD) for the top 32 schools we reviewed, and these agencies  differ in their practices for addressing other agencies\u2019 awards.

The difference between the proposed and negotiated  indirect cost rate varied based on whether a school negotiated with DOD  or HHS and leads schools to perceive unequal treatment, though  negotiated indirect cost rates were not different. Even though this is only a  perceived difference there are actual differences in how schools may be  defined for rate-setting purposes versus the oversight of cost  reimbursement purposes. Schools are treated differently in terms of the  oversight on their reimbursement of indirect costs because of the  flexibility in how the definition of a nonfederal entity is applied, in some  cases, creating a situation where a school that expends $500,000 or more  in federal funds may not be audited as a separate entity, but is included as  part of a larger entity. DOD does not effectively use the other methods to  oversee indirect costs when a school is not separately audited. As a result,  DOD lacks assurance that it is reimbursing indirect costs appropriately. In  addition, guidance for the indirect cost rate-setting and reimbursement  processes contains provisions that have been in place for a long time, but  are overdue to be reviewed and updated. Because the utility cost  adjustment eligibility is based on information that is 12 years old and  therefore does not necessarily reflect schools\u2019 current costs, the OMB  guidance runs the risk of inadvertently providing benefits to some schools  and not others. Similarly, because the rate at which administrative cost  reimbursement is limited has not been reviewed since it was implemented  approximately 20 years ago, and administrative costs may have changed  over time, it is unclear whether the current limitation achieves the desired  balance between controlling government costs and sponsoring  government\u2019s fair share of research costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To address different processes for negotiating rates by the two cognizant  rate-setting agencies for higher education institutions, we recommend that  the Director of OMB:  Identify methods to ensure that the rate-setting process is applied  consistently at all schools, regardless of which agency has rate cognizance.

For example, to address our recommendation that  DOD establish a process for verifying whether a school has requested  reimbursement at the accurate indirect cost rate and amount, DOD stated  it would require university recipients of research grants to complete the  field for indirect expenses on the final submission of the Federal Financial  Report and have postaward administrators conduct the recommended  verification on a sample of awards each year, using a risk-based  assessment.  While DOD concurred with our recommendation that DOD  assess the current level of audit coverage and determine what level is  sufficient, DOD did not identify any new actions it would take to do so,  relying instead on continued efforts.

Through these interviews, we obtained  information on the impacts of selected caps on the research community,  as well as information about what information would be available to  evaluate these impacts. Finally, we reviewed documentation pertaining to  selected indirect cost caps, including OMB Circular A-21, the Department  of Defense Appropriations Act, 2008, and legislative and regulatory  histories related to the caps.", "To determine the methods DOD uses to oversee indirect cost  reimbursement on grants, we interviewed DOD officials at the office of the  Director, Defense Research and Engineering and the Office of Naval  Research (ONR). To identify the extent to which each of the three  methods identified by DOD was used, we focused on the 32 schools  representing more than half of DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2007 basic research  obligations, based on DOD data. We obtained information about the extent  to which these methods are used from DOD, independent public  accounting firms conducting the annual single audit, higher education  institutions, cognizant agencies for audit, and previous reports by GAO  and others. We also interviewed officials at DOD, OMB, HHS, the National  Science Foundation and the Department of Education, as well as  independent public accounting firm representatives and higher education  representatives. To determine the extent to which the first method, the  single audit, was used, we collected and analyzed data provided by  independent public accounting firms, state auditors, and DCAA on their  sampling of research and development awards for the fiscal year 2008  single audit. To determine the extent to which the second method, the  grant closeout process, was used by DOD, we reviewed DOD  documentation and examples related to the various processes to closeout  a DOD basic research grant. For example, we reviewed examples of  financial information on a standard form that tracks the status of the  grant, including direct and indirect costs. We discussed with the DOD  award officers what and how the process and procedures and forms for  grant closeout check indirect costs to determine if these costs were  accurately charged during the award. In addition, we interviewed OMB  officials to determine the purpose of the Indirect Expense section of the  form developed by OMB, the Federal Financial Report (SF-425). To  determine the extent to which the third method, audits by DCAA and  cognizant agencies for audit, was used, we identified the agencies with  audit cognizance for the 32 schools we examined. We requested and  obtained information from the four agencies with cognizance for the 32  schools\u2014NSF, Education, HHS, and DOD. In addition, we collected  information on the number and type of audits of DOD awards conducted  by DCAA and by HHS at schools in fiscal year 2008 related to indirect  costs. Through interviews with officials from the four agencies, we  obtained information and documentation related to their audit cognizance  programs. We also learned about school audit programs at one of the  cognizant agencies for audit and heard their views on why they no longer  rely on the single audit to oversee the reimbursement of indirect costs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Survey Details", "paragraphs": ["To address our first and second objectives, we designed and conducted a  mail-based survey of a sample of schools in the U.S. that received basic  research awards from DOD that were active in fiscal year 2007. The study  population consisted of all U.S.-based schools receiving more than  $100,000 in DOD funds to do basic research in fiscal year 2007. We  developed our sample frame from DOD-provided award-level data. After  excluding schools with $100,000 or less in DOD basic research dollars in  fiscal year 2007, there were a total of 343 schools in our population.", "From this population, we selected a random sample of 178 schools,  stratified by total award dollars. The first stratum was comprised of the 32  institutions with the highest amount of DOD basic research award dollars  in fiscal year 2007, accounting for over 50 percent of the DOD basic  research dollars for that year. All of these 32 schools were selected in our  sample. From the remaining 311 schools in the second stratum, we  selected a random sample of 146 for our study. The population, sample,  and survey disposition by stratum is displayed in the following table.", "Several of the sample schools were determined to be \u201cout-of-scope\u201d for the  purposes of this study. In particular, we determined that 13 of the  institutions selected in stratum 2 either did not receive basic research  awards in fiscal year 2007 (e.g. the award really was to a different  institution) or the research institution was not a university (e.g. the award  was to a university-affiliated nonprofit not subject to higher education  indirect cost rules). These schools were dropped from the analysis. Of the  178 selected institutions, we obtained useable responses from 144 for an  overall response rate of about 87 percent. The survey data were collected  from July 2009 to October 2009.", "The survey was designed to collect information about a school\u2019s indirect  cost rates and demographic information, as well as the university  administrator\u2019s opinions on factors influencing the rates. Because we  followed a probability procedure based on random selections, our sample  is only one of a large number of samples that we might have drawn. We  express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results  as a 95 percent confidence interval. This is the interval that would contain  the actual population value for 95 percent of the samples we could have  drawn. Unless otherwise noted, in this report estimates of indirect cost  rates based on our survey have 95 percent confidence intervals within   +/- 2 percentage points of the estimate itself. Estimates of the percentage  of schools with particular characteristics have 95 percent confidence  intervals within +/- 7 percentage points of the estimate itself. Estimates of  totals based on this sample are presented along with their corresponding  95 percent confidence interval in the report.", "At each school, we also selected a nongeneralizable sample of one DOD  research award with over $10,000 of activity in fiscal year 2007 and  requested award and reimbursement data pertaining to that year of the  award.", "Where appropriate, we followed up on unclear answers by calling the  school-identified key contact at the sampled institutions for clarification.", "Each school in our sample can have multiple proposed and negotiated  indirect cost rates, for a number of categories of rate agreements (e.g., on- campus organized research, off-campus organized research, instruction, or  other sponsored activities). Unless otherwise specified in this report,  estimates relating to proposed or negotiated rates are limited to the rate  that is associated with on-campus organized research. We focused on this  rate because it represents a comprehensive measure of indirect costs for  research to be reimbursed by the federal government, including both  facilities and administrative costs.", "In our questionnaire, we asked the university administrator to provide the  proposed indirect cost rate applicable to fiscal year 2007, along with the  elements of that proposed rate (the portions for facilities, administration,  and carry-forward). Throughout our report estimates related to the  proposed fiscal year 2007 indirect cost rates are not based on the  proposed rate provided by the school. Instead we calculated each school\u2019s  proposed rate based on the information in the survey responses.  Specifically, the GAO version of the proposed rate is the sum of the fiscal  year 2007 proposed facilities component of indirect cost rate, the carry- forward, and the lesser of the proposed administrative component or 26  percent. We used this as the proposed rate for our analysis to ensure  proposed rates were comparable across schools.", "In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any  survey may introduce nonsampling errors, such as nonresponse bias or  measurement errors. We took steps in developing the questionnaire,  collecting the data, and analyzing the data to minimize such errors.", "To gain an initial understanding of the information reasonably available  from schools about their research costs, as well as their thoughts on  factors that may influence a school\u2019s indirect cost rate, we reviewed  regulatory documents pertaining to indirect cost rates, particularly OMB  Circular A-21, and interviewed officials from government agencies,  including rate-setting officials from HHS\u2019s Division of Cost Allocation and  DOD\u2019s Office of Naval Research. We also spoke with university research  administrators and representatives of associations representing the  interests of research institutions and reviewed past GAO reports and  analysis by other organizations to identify possible influencing factors.", "We pretested our survey instrument with six schools to determine if the  questions were clear, if the survey questionnaire placed an undue burden  on schools, and to determine the sources of information schools would  use to answer the questions. The information learned through the pretests  was used to refine the survey.", "To ensure the best possible response rate, we contacted individuals from  each sampled school via telephone to identify the person most qualified to  answer our survey questions and to confirm the mail, phone, and e-mail  information for that individual.", "After revising the survey to incorporate pretest comments and identifying  the best survey contact, we mailed the survey to sampled schools and  followed up with nonrespondents by e-mail and telephone to encourage  their responses, and we followed up with survey respondents to clarify  unclear or unlikely responses.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2009 to September  2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
