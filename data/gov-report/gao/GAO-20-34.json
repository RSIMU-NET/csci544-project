For example, FDA officials stated that FDA will use the data  obtained from TTB and CBP to help identify tobacco manufacturers or  importers that should have been assessed user fees but were not, due to  the companies not reporting monthly data to FDA as required (non- reporters).

However, the officials stated that they can make  changes outside of the year-end reconciliation. For example, the officials  reported making adjustments to individual user fee assessments for the  cigar class once, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017.

As part of this standard, agencies obtain  relevant data from reliable sources in a timely manner and process these  data into quality information that supports their internal control system.  Federal internal control standards also call for agencies to externally  communicate the quality information necessary to achieve its objectives.  As part of this standard, agencies communicate quality information  externally through reporting lines so that external parties can help the  entity achieve its objectives and address related risks.

FDA\u2019s process related to its quarterly user fee calculations  include procedures to ensure the tobacco product class and individual  manufacturer and importer allocations are accurate. According to FDA\u2019s  procedures, at the start of each fiscal year, FDA Office of Financial  Management, Division of User Fees staff (1) calculate the percentage  share for each tobacco product class and (2) enter these percentage  shares into FDA\u2019s User Fee System, which automatically calculates  quarterly class allocations for each tobacco class. According to FDA  officials, FDA\u2019s Office of Financial Management, Division of User Fees  staff, as well as Center for Tobacco Products\u2019s (CTP) Office of  Management, User Fee Management Team staff, review the class  allocation calculations to verify the percentage shares were accurately  calculated for each tobacco product class before entering the class  percentages into FDA\u2019s User Fee System. Prior to calculating individual  market share percentages that are the basis for individual user fees, the  User Fee Management Team within CTP\u2019s Office of Management reviews  the monthly data reported to FDA by tobacco manufacturers and  importers for accuracy. According to FDA\u2019s procedures, the CTP User  Fee Management Team checks to ensure that the volume and excise tax  data reported on each FDA form 3852 are accurate based on the  accompanying supporting documents. According to FDA procedures, if  the CTP User Fee Team identifies incomplete or inaccurate monthly  reports, it contacts the appropriate tobacco manufacturers or importers to  request the missing documentation or an amended FDA form 3852 and  tries to resolve any inaccuracies prior to calculating individual market  share for the quarterly billing cycle.", "Billing. According to FDA\u2019s procedures, the CTP User Fee Management  Team submits market share percentages to the FDA Office of Financial  Management, Division of User Fees in the month prior to the date that  invoices are to be issued. For example, for the first quarterly invoicing  cycle (October through December), the CTP User Fee Management  Team would submit market share percentages on November 15 and  invoices would be mailed by the Division of User Fees by December 1.  Using the market share data, the Division of User Fees calculates the  quarterly user fee amount assessed to individual manufacturers and  importers within each tobacco product class as part of its quarterly  invoicing process. FDA officials stated that, prior to creating quarterly  invoices, the Division of User Fees reviews CTP market share data to  ensure it received all necessary data. Prior to mailing quarterly invoices  to individual tobacco manufacturers and importers, FDA officials stated  that division staff verifies that the invoices created are complete and  accurate by comparing the invoice information to the CTP market share  data.", "Collection. FDA\u2019s Office of Financial Management, Division of User Fees  utilizes different mechanisms to identify and notify tobacco manufactures  and importers who do not pay their invoices by the quarterly user fee due  date (i.e., the last day of the applicable fiscal year quarter).", "According to FDA\u2019s procedures, the Division of User Fees uses a  program within FDA\u2019s User Fee System\u2014referred to as the Dunning  Tracker\u2014to track relevant invoice data, including the date user fee  payments are due and the amounts owed. The Dunning Tracker is  designed to generate alerts to warn division staff of unpaid invoices  that are approaching 30, 60, and 90 days past due so they can issue  Dunning notification letters\u2014which inform the tobacco manufacturers  and importers that their invoices are overdue and provide instructions  for making a payment. The Dunning notification letters also inform  tobacco manufacturers and importers of the amount of additional  charges assessed based on the number of days that the payment is  late. According to FDA officials, division staff verify that a Dunning  notification letter is issued for each tobacco manufacturer or importer  with an outstanding invoice and that the appropriate charges have  been assessed.", "According to FDA officials, the Division of User Fees also maintains  an arrears list\u2014a list of tobacco manufacturers and importers who  have not paid their quarterly user fees on time. FDA\u2019s procedures  provide that the Division of User Fees will share the arrears list with  the CTP Office of Compliance and Enforcement to assist that office\u2019s  efforts to obtain compliance with the user fee requirements. FDA  officials stated that the office monitors the arrears list and takes  enforcement action when appropriate. The officials said that the office  will first issue information letters, separate from the Dunning  notification letters, to each tobacco manufacturer and importer on the  arrears list to try to obtain voluntary compliance on the user fee  payments owed. FDA officials stated that if the office is unable to  obtain compliance after it issues the information letter, it may take  further action, such as notifying the delinquent company that all  tobacco products manufactured and imported by it are adulterated.  Agency officials told us that, in 2014, FDA notified three individual  tobacco manufacturers that all the tobacco products they  manufactured were adulterated due to these companies\u2019 failure to pay  their tobacco user fees.", "According to FDA\u2019s procedures, the Division of User Fees refers  delinquent debt to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  Program Support Center when outstanding invoices reach 90 days past  due. The Program Support Center will pursue collection efforts per its  standard procedures and issues two reports each month to the Division of  User Fees to inform it of which debts have been collected and which are  uncollectable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Kim Yamane (Assistant Director),  Matthew Byer (Analyst in Charge), Sam Amrhein, Julie Flowers, Jackie  Hamilton, Derry Henrick, Vikki Porter, and LaDonna Towler made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": ["The Food and Drug Administration charges tobacco manufacturers a fee to fund regulation activities (such as educating the public about risks associated with tobacco).
