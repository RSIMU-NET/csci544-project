In March 2012, GAO issued GAO-12-414 , which examined selection of the Trustee, his method for determining customer claims, and expenses of the liquidation, among other things. This report discusses (1) the extent to which account activity varied by type of Madoff customer, (2) the nature of claims filed, and rejected or approved, with the Trustee for reimbursement of losses, (3) litigation and settlement activity the Trustee has pursued in seeking to recover assets for distribution to customers, and (4) the effect of the fraud on customers' federal income tax liabilities.

The remaining accounts were held by institutions, such as pension funds and charities. A higher proportion of accounts held by an individual (60 percent) were \"net winners\" based on their net equity position--meaning they had withdrawn more from their accounts than they had deposited--compared to accounts held by institutions (50 percent). Correspondingly, 40 percent of institutional accounts were \"net losers\" that had deposited more into their accounts than they had withdrawn, compared to 29 percent of individuals' accounts that were net losers. However, individual and institutional accounts had similar deposit and withdrawal activity from 1981 through 2008, including increased withdrawals immediately before the firm's failure in December 2008.", "GAO's analysis shows that the Trustee's decisions to accept or reject claims were similar for individual and institutional account holders. Of the more than 16,000 claims, about 66 percent were denied because the customers were not direct account holders of the Madoff firm, but instead had invested in funds or other vehicles that held accounts directly with the firm. For the remaining claimants who were directly invested, the Trustee generally used the customers' net investment positions--that is, whether they were net winners or net losers-- to determine claims. In examining claims decisions by customer type, GAO found the Trustee denied claims filed by individuals and institutions determined to be net winners in similar proportions. Similarly, most claims filed by individuals or institutions determined to be net losers were allowed.", "The Trustee has been pursuing litigation to recover, or \"claw back,\" assets from net winner customers and others that can be used to reimburse customers that did not withdraw all of their principal investments. For those customers that withdrew fictitious profits--net winners--the Trustee has been pursuing more than 1,000 lawsuits to recover funds, as allowed under federal bankruptcy law and state law. In about 60 suits, the Trustee has sought more than fictitious profits, to include principal or other funds received, arguing the parties knew or should have known of the fraud. Thus far, the Trustee said he has recovered about $9.1 billion of the $17.3 billion in principal investments lost by customers who filed claims, including $8.4 billion from settlement agreements.", "Because the Madoff fraud affects customers' taxable income, it also affects tax collections by the Department of the Treasury. Under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules, Madoff customers can deduct lost principal and fictitious profits on which they paid taxes while holding their accounts. However, IRS does not maintain statistics on specific frauds or their impacts on tax collections, and the tax impact may be reduced because some taxpayers may not be able to fully use this tax relief, such as those that lack other income that can be offset by these deductions. Tax experts expressed concerns about the lack of clarity over how payments stemming from fraud-related avoidance actions filed by the Trustee will be treated for tax purposes. In response to a recommendation in a draft report that IRS provide guidance to help limit taxpayer errors resulting in over- or underpayment of taxes, the agency issued such guidance on September 5, 2012, in the form of \"frequently asked questions\" posted to its website."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["After the collapse of Bernard L.

However, the Trustee  told us his investigation indicated the relative was not likely aware of the  fraud."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In Some Asset Recovery Actions, the Trustee Has Alleged That Defendants Knew or Should Have Known of the Fraud", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the good faith lawsuits, the trustee has also filed 30 actions  against individuals or entities in which he has alleged the defendants  acted in bad faith because they either knew, or should have known, of  Madoff\u2019s fraudulent investment scheme. According to the Trustee,  asserting that a defendant acted in bad faith allows him to potentially  recover greater amounts than in other actions. For example, in a bad faith  action, a trustee can seek to recover not only fictitious profits, but also  seek principal amounts invested as well. Additionally, while New York  debtor and creditor law generally limits to 6 years the period for which a  trustee can seek recovery from parties that received funds from a  bankrupt entity, a trustee can sue a customer that acted in bad faith in  earlier years, if it can be shown the defendant knew or should have  known of the fraud and certain other conditions are met. The trustee can  also pursue common law claims such as conversion and unjust  enrichment against bad faith defendants that received other funds from  the bankrupt entity, such as receiving cash or purchases of goods on their  behalf.damages to recover sums allegedly received improperly by the  defendant. However, although the Trustee has the authority and standing  to enforce common law claims, two recent judicial decisions dealing   Common law claims allow the Trustee to seek compensatory  specifically with the Madoff liquidation limited his ability to pursue  common law claims.", "Our review of the 30 bad faith actions showed that the complaints list  several hundred defendants and seek $11 billion overall, with demand  amounts ranging from more than $500,000 to approximately $6.7 billion. Defendants include Madoff family members, employees of the Madoff  firm, individuals who identified investors for Madoff, and other business  associates of Madoff. In addition to suing defendants as individuals, the  complaints also seek to recover funds from vehicles these individuals  used to invest in the Madoff scheme, including corporations, limited  partnerships, trusts, estates, partnerships, foundations, and profit-sharing  plans. Additionally, the Trustee is suing individual retirement accounts, to  recover funds allegedly received from another defendant. According to  the Trustee, his objective in alleging bad faith, even for some net loser  defendants, is to maximize recoveries for distribution to other harmed  customers.", "Twenty-nine of the 30 bad faith complaints are available publicly, either through the U.S.  Courts\u2019 Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) system or the trustee\u2019s  website, http://www.madofftrustee.com. One bad faith complaint is under seal and  unavailable. According to the trustee, this complaint involves a husband and wife as  defendants and is sealed because it includes allegations about the defendants\u2019 federal  income taxes. that could have revealed the Ponzi scheme. In some instances, the  Trustee alleges that defendants were also sophisticated investors with  sufficient education or specialized work experience in securities law,  accounting, or finance that they should have known their returns were  unusual. Table 5 shows the most frequently cited bases on which the  Trustee alleged bad faith, according to our analysis of available cases.", "The Trustee told us that initially, he believed that anyone working in  Madoff\u2019s investment advisory unit would be a bad faith participant.  However, through additional investigation, including document  examination, taking of depositions, and reconstruction of computer  records, the Trustee said he determined not all such employees may  have been aware of the fraud. For example, the Trustee initially believed  Madoff\u2019s secretary was involved in the fraud, given her position close to  Madoff, but later determined she did not have knowledge of the fraudulent  activities.", "In several cases, the Trustee is alleging bad faith against Madoff relatives  who worked at the firm, or other, nonemployee relatives who received  funds. For example, the Trustee sued Madoff\u2019s wife to recover funds  transferred from the firm that were used to buy a yacht for approximately  $2.8 million, to pay off a $1.1 million credit card balance, or to fund other  investments. The Trustee sued the wife of Madoff\u2019s brother, who worked  at the firm, for receiving $1.5 million in purported salary from 1996 to  2008, after the Trustee\u2019s investigation concluded she never performed  any work for the position. Among defendants who were not employees or  relatives are individuals who allegedly identified and recruited investors  for the Madoff firm. For example, the Trustee alleges an accounting firm  pooled hundreds of millions of dollars for investment while keeping tens of  millions of dollars itself.", "Although many Madoff customers typically experienced outsized returns  based on market developments, some bad faith defendants received  exceptionally high returns, the Trustee alleges. In one case, for example,  the Trustee cites returns as high as 175 percent. Moreover, in some  cases, the bad faith defendants include large investors for whom the  trustee alleges their financial or business sophistication provided them  with the ability to realize that they were benefiting from a fraud. For  example, the Trustee alleges one set of defendants is a closely held  family business that was also an investor in another investment fraud that  was so similar to the Madoff firm it should have been clear Madoff was  also running a fraud. In his complaint, the Trustee quotes an employee of  the business as saying shortly after Madoff\u2019s arrest, \u201cOur CIO [chief  information officer] always said it was a scam, \u2018too good to be true\u2019\u201d  Another bad faith defendant, according to the Trustee, had been closely  associated with Madoff professionally and socially for decades, investing  in the firm through more than 60 entity and personal accounts. According  to the Trustee, some of the accounts reported consistently high annual  returns between 20 percent and 24 percent, with only 3 months of  negative returns over 12 years. Other accounts of the defendant  sometimes experienced returns greater than 100 percent or even 300  percent, he alleges. According to the Trustee, the defendant acted as an  investment advisor, and thus should have known such returns were not  likely possible without fraud.", "As shown in table 6, the 10 largest bad faith complaints, measured by  amount sought, have sought a total of $10.7 billion, or more than 97  percent of the $11.0 billion the Trustee is seeking in all 30 bad faith  litigations. As of April 2012, the Trustee had obtained settlements, or a  partial settlement, in four of these cases.", "As noted, feeder funds are investment vehicles that collected funds from  investors and then channeled the money to the Madoff firm. The Trustee  has filed 27 bad faith actions against feeder fund defendants, seeking  nearly $100 billion. The amounts sought range from a low of $10.4 million  to a high of $58.5 billion. The average amount sought is $3.7 billion, with  a median of $182.4 million. The amounts the Trustee is seeking include  fictitious profits, principal amounts invested, fees, interest, and in some  cases, punitive damages. Typically, the Madoff feeder funds raised  money from high-net-worth individuals in operations that spanned the  globe. In addition to the feeder funds themselves, banks and other  financial institutions are among the defendants in these cases. For  example, some were custodians of the feeder funds, some were  administrative agents, and some were involved in marketing the funds to  prospective investors. Some banks and financial institutions had more  than one role in their involvement with feeder funds.", "According to the Trustee, feeder funds account for about $14.2 billion of  the approximately $19.6 billion in total principal lost by all customers. In  suing for bad faith, the Trustee has alleged these defendants either knew  or should have known of the Madoff fraud. In some of the feeder fund  cases, the Trustee is also alleging participation in, and concealment of,  the fraud. With the bad faith allegations, as with bad faith cases filed  against individuals, the Trustee can sue to recover funds beyond principal  withdrawn in the preference period and fictitious profits withdrawn in the  6-year period. In addition, he can use common law grounds to seek  additional damages based on alleged harm caused by parties aiding the  fraud. As a result, the total he is seeking in the six largest feeder fund  actions is $94 billion, which greatly exceeds the amount of principal these  entities invested into the scheme. Table 7 summarizes these cases,  which represent nearly 95 percent of the total amount sought in feeder  fund cases.", "The Trustee told us that compared to other litigation he is pursuing,  feeder fund actions require different types of evidence, due to the nature  of their operations. For example, feeder fund managers benefited through  investment and management fees charged by the funds, which were  subsequently paid to individuals as salaries and bonuses. The Trustee  considers these payments to be fraudulent. In the Tremont case, for  instance, the firm managed five funds that invested directly with the  Madoff firm, as well as more than a dozen other funds that were indirect  Madoff investors, via investments in the directly invested funds. The  Trustee alleged that in the 6 years before the Madoff firm failed, Tremont  defendants received more than $180 million in management,  administration, and other fees; bonuses; profits; compensation; dividends;  and partnership distributions. Additionally, a number of the feeder fund  defendants were net losers. In such cases, the Trustee also sought to  defer SIPA claims they filed pending resolution of the Trustee\u2019s actions  against them. In general, given the complexities of feeder fund  relationships, the Trustee determined amounts sought by looking at  principal, not fictitious profits, he told us.", "As shown in table 7, the Trustee has alleged that banks, financial  services entities, and related individuals facilitated the Madoff fraud. For  example, HSBC served as marketer, custodian, and administrator for  numerous feeder funds. The Trustee alleged that HSBC surrendered all  custodial duties to the Madoff firm, while continuing to collect fees, and  without any disclosure to investors. The Trustee stated that this surrender  removed a system of checks and balances and allowed the Madoff firm to  assert the existence of assets and trades that never existed. As for  marketing feeder funds, the Trustee maintains that HSBC acquiesced to  Madoff\u2019s demands to keep his name out of offering documents, despite  the bank\u2019s own concerns about its inability to conduct proper due  diligence on Greenwich Sentry, a Madoff feeder fund. Feeder funds also  worked with banks to create derivative products based on feeder fund  returns, according to the Trustee. For example, investors in these  \u201cleveraged notes\u201d would be entitled to receive returns based on a feeder  fund\u2019s returns, while a financial institution, usually a bank, would receive  fees for structuring the notes and interest for lending funds used as part  of the investment. Concurrently, the bank would purchase shares in the  feeder fund in order to hedge its exposure in the leveraged notes. The  end result, according to the Trustee, was that hundreds of millions of  additional dollars were invested into the Madoff operation.", "In bringing the feeder fund actions, the Trustee has made a number of  specific allegations to support bad faith and complaints of illicit funds  received. While particular allegations vary across cases, we found the six  cases we examined shared three major elements. First, defendants are  alleged to have profited from the fraud primarily through fees received.  For example, UBS is alleged to have received fees for purportedly serving  in custodial and asset management functions for the feeder funds,  Luxalpha and Groupement Financier. UBS sponsored the formation of  Luxalpha and served as prime banker for Groupement Financier. The  Trustee considers the fees UBS derived to be customer property that  should be recovered. Second, the Trustee alleges defendants breached  their duty of due diligence to their customers. For example, the Trustee  alleged that Fairfield Greenwich Group, Madoff\u2019s largest feeder fund  group, did not \u201cproperly, independently, and reasonably perform due  diligence into the many red flags strongly indicating Madoff was a fraud.\u201d  Third, the defendants are alleged to have either aided and abetted or  actively participated in the fraud. In the JP Morgan Chase case, the  Trustee alleged that through its interactions in different capacities\u2014as  banker, lender, and investor\u2014with the Madoff firm over 20 years, the  bank was uniquely positioned to see the fraud and put a stop to it.  Instead, the trustee alleges that this institution continued to conduct  business as usual, which allowed the firm to profit and the fraud to  continue unabated.", "As with other actions, the Trustee has sought feeder fund recoveries  based on the 90-day preference period and the 2- and 6-year periods,  relying on both the federal bankruptcy statute and New York state law. In  instances where the defendant was considered an insider, the Trustee  sought to extend the preference period to 1 year. The Trustee has also  sought to recover transfers to subsequent transferees. In a number of  cases, for example, the Trustee has pursued this course against  individuals paid a salary or a bonus by the banks or feeder funds  involved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trustee Settlements to Date Have Recovered Nearly Half of Customer Investment Losses", "paragraphs": ["In hundreds of cases, the Madoff Trustee has reached settlements with  former customers and others, either before or after filing clawback  actions, and these agreements have produced recovery of a significant  amount of assets. As of April 2012, the Trustee had entered into 441  settlement agreements in which the opposing parties agreed to return  about $8.4 billion\u2014an amount equal to about 49 percent of the  approximately $17.3 billion in principal investments lost by customers who  filed claims. According to our review, the settlement amounts range from  a low of $36 to a high of $5 billion, with an average of $19 million and a  median of $66,000. Through July 2012, the Trustee had collected 85  percent of total settlement amounts, or about $7.1 billion. Many  settlement terms are complex. For example, settlements with feeder  funds that were net losers require these entities to return certain funds  they received before the Trustee will consider accepting their loss claims.", "The Trustee groups settlements into three major categories:", "Prelitigation: Settlements reached before the Trustee filed a  clawback action.", "Litigation: Settlements reached in cases where the Trustee had  already filed a clawback action.", "Customer avoidances: Recoveries based on the 90-day preference  period, but where no clawback action was filed.", "A fourth category, \u201cFunds not yet received,\u201d is a temporary accounting of  amounts that will be allocated to the three main categories upon receipt of  the first settlement payment. Table 8 shows a summary of the Trustee\u2019s  settlement agreements by category as of July 2012. As the table shows,  for example, the customer avoidance category represents 85 percent of  all settlement agreements reached, although these cases have the  smallest total dollar value among the categories. Although, as the table  shows, the settlements total $8.4 billion, the Trustee through July 2012  had yet to receive $1.2 billion in settlement funds, due to pending appeals  and specific provisions in settlement agreements.", "The Trustee told us he and his counsel consider a number of factors  when deciding to enter into a settlement agreement. There are no formal  criteria, he said, but factors such as location of the defendants, litigation  risk, and timing of the clawback can influence the settlement decision.  Two of the most important factors, the Trustee told us, are the  defendant\u2019s ability to pay and whether the settlement will produce  proceeds that enhance the customer fund he is building during the  liquidation. The bankruptcy court must approve settlement agreements  worth $20 million or more. In addition to whether a settlement is in the  best interest of the estate, the court also considers whether a proposed  settlement is fair and equitable, and above \u201cthe lowest point in the range  of reasonableness,\u201d the Trustee told us. In deciding whether a particular  agreement falls within that range, the court considers: probability of success in litigation; difficulties of collection;  litigation complexity, and expense, inconvenience, and potential for  delay; and   creditor interests.", "On the key issue of ability to pay, the Trustee said his approach is that he  would rather agree to a settlement for less money and be able to collect  it, than win a judgment for a greater sum that he is ultimately unable to  collect. He cited the Katz-Wilpon settlement as an example. Originally,  the Trustee sued for more than $1 billion, but reached a settlement in  April 2012 for $162 million, based on his conclusion of what the  defendants could pay. In other areas, the Trustee also told us he is  sensitive about clawing back funds from charitable institutions, saying that  although they have received other investors\u2019 funds, he did not want to put  them in the position of raising money in order to pay a settlement. We  examined all but one settlement agreement among those worth at least  $20 million.", "Appendix IV provides details of these settlements, including  amounts sought and obtained, the extent to which settlements have been  paid, strategies behind settlements, and key provisions.", "A number of factors motivate counterparties to settle with him, the  Trustee told us. One is that defendants have fiduciary duties to clients or  customers, and amounts at issue in a case might be so significant that,  for example, feeder fund managers might conclude their duty is to settle  in order to recover assets for customers. Some parties, to protect client  confidentiality, may settle in order to prevent disclosure of client  information that could become public in litigation. Other parties might  seek closure. Overall, the Trustee told us he thinks he has built a solid  record in his settlements. The market itself has validated his efforts, he  said, which can be seen in increases in the price of Madoff claims being  traded following announcement of recent settlement agreements.", "As part of our review of records provided by the Trustee, we noted some  customer accounts having a negative balance. For example, in the  Picower case, the records showed a negative balance of $6.3 billion. In  theory, this reflected some kind of margin account or debit account, the  Trustee told us, even though such an amount would not have been in  keeping with standard industry practices. Such negative balances raised  questions whether the reported amounts represented debt owed by  customers to the Madoff firm, and if so, whether the presence of such  debt diminished the value of settlements obtained from such customers.  To obtain the $7.2 billion Picower settlement, for example, the Trustee  told us that he agreed to characterize the amount being returned as a  loan repayment. However, both the Trustee and SIPC executives told us  that the use of this terminology, or presence of negative balances, does  not change the effect of underlying actions, which was to extract fictitious  profits from the Madoff firm. In particular, the Trustee told us, he  determined claims for all accounts based on the money invested less  money withdrawn method.

This program, which was not open to institutional customers, had  two elements for individuals who could demonstrate financial hardship:", "Claims. The Trustee provided expedited consideration of claim  applications. This did not provide applicants with any more favorable  treatment, as claims were still determined on the NIM basis. But it  accelerated consideration of claim applications, which, if approved,  could result in customers receiving any SIPC advances due them  more quickly. According to the Trustee, if complete account  information was available, a determination on qualification for  expedited claim review was made in about 20 to 30 days, with another  20 to 30 days to determine the actual claim. This compares to a  typical claim taking 3 months or more.", "Clawbacks.

Instead, the Trustee told us, he applied his judgment after applications  were reviewed at the Trustee\u2019s counsel law firm. The general factors,  applicable to both the claims and clawback elements of the program,  included whether, due to lost investments or the possibility that funds  withdrawn must be returned, the customer: needed to return to work, had declared bankruptcy, was unable to pay for living expenses, was unable to pay for dependents, or  suffered from health problems.", "Additionally, the Trustee said he took into account whether former  customers used any fictitious profits to pay taxes. If so, the Trustee told  us he considered such payments in his decisions.", "The process for considering hardship applications was similar for both the  claims and clawback elements, the Trustee told us. For claims, an  attorney reviewed an application and made a recommendation to the  Trustee, who then decided the matter. For clawbacks, the Trustee\u2019s  counsel team responsible for the litigation reviewed the application, and, if  necessary, would seek additional information. The team would make a  recommendation to a review committee, comprised of five lawyers, for its  evaluation. The committee would make a recommendation to the Trustee,  who then decided the matter.", "According to information we reviewed, hardship program applicants were  predominantly older, and the most commonly cited reasons for financial  distress, for either element, were the inability to pay living expenses and  health problems. The Trustee said most cases were not difficult to decide,  based on the evidence presented. He told us that while he and others  reviewed applications carefully, requesting additional information when  necessary, they attempted to not be overly intrusive into private affairs.  We reviewed a number of applications provided by the Trustee,  illustrating acceptance or rejection of customers\u2019 hardship applications.  Table 9 summarizes some of the cases we reviewed.", "As noted, the claims hardship part of the program did not alter outcomes,  as it provided only expedited review.

Figure 8 summarizes results.", "Within weeks of the Madoff firm\u2019s failure, SEC officials were studying  whether clawback actions were permissible, and concluded they were.  SEC officials told us the issue was a difficult one, because innocent  investors would become the target of lawsuits; at the same time, if the  Trustee did not pursue the recovery actions, others would be hurt. From  the beginning of the case, SEC thought that clawbacks would produce the  bulk of assets available for distribution to customers, because billions of  dollars had been withdrawn from the firm shortly before its failure.", "SEC officials told us they have had discussions with the Trustee (and  SIPC) on his clawback litigation, on such issues as legal theories being  employed, risks presented, legal costs, and expected future  developments. But they have not had day-to-day involvement in the  litigation, nor been involved in developing the legal strategies employed,  the officials told us. SEC officials told us an examination will come later,  but based on their experience, the Trustee appears to be conducting the  litigation in an acceptable manner and has applied the law properly and  fairly. They said they were not aware of any particular problems or issues  with the litigation, although courts have not always adopted the Trustee\u2019s  positions. SEC officials told us they were not concerned about runaway or  needless litigation, and the main outcome of the litigation is that the  Trustee has recovered large sums that are considerably more than  initially expected.", "SIPC executives likewise told us they always thought clawbacks would be  a critical part of recovering assets for customers. SIPC did not have any  discussions with the Trustee about clawbacks prior to his appointment,  they said, other than to discuss whether there were adequate resources  available at his law firm to bring the expected cases. The officials  characterized their involvement with the Trustee as providing institutional  knowledge and high-level advice and strategy, albeit with the  understanding that the independent Trustee need not accept it. SIPC\u2019s  most significant contribution is payment of litigation expenses, SIPC  executives told us, because otherwise, the Trustee could not finance his  litigation. The SIPC executives told us they consider the Trustee\u2019s  litigation a success, but that his efforts are thus far incomplete, as many  cases remain outstanding. Although total settlement amounts to date  reflect mostly one case ($5 billion for Picower), other settlements still  have produced significant sums.

However, IRS officials were unable to quantify the overall impact of the  fraud on tax collections, and the impact may be reduced by various  factors that could limit taxpayers\u2019 ability to take full advantage of the tax  relief available. In addition, while the use of either NIM or FSM to  determine customer net equity could lead to different outcomes for  account holders, either method likely reduces tax revenues. Tax experts  expressed concerns about the lack of clarity over how payments  stemming from fraud-related avoidance actions, or clawbacks, filed by the  Trustee will be treated for tax purposes.

First,  customers likely paid federal income taxes on fictitious profits reported to  them in each year they held their account.theft of funds invested, which under tax law would be considered an  investment theft loss.", "Second, they likely suffered  Typically, there are two ways to address these effects upon discovery of  such fraud, according to IRS officials. Taxpayers can file amended returns, in which they remove fictitious profits from previously reported  income. In addition, they can claim a theft loss deduction against income,  to reflect principal amounts stolen and fictitious profits reflected on  account statements that were not removed on any amended returns.  Under the Internal Revenue Code, an investment theft occurs when a  taxpayer loses property to theft in connection with a transaction entered  into for profit. Taxpayers can use amended returns or claim theft loss  deductions, singly or in tandem, depending on their situation, according to  IRS officials. But each of these approaches has limitations, according to  the officials. For instance, taxpayers can generally file an amended return  to claim a refund of taxes paid within 3 years of the original filing date, or  2 years from the date the tax was paid, whichever is later. In the case of  the theft loss deduction, taxpayers cannot take the deduction to the extent  they have been reimbursed for the loss, and if they have a claim for  reimbursement, they cannot deduct their loss until the amount of recovery  to be received can be \u201cascertained with reasonable certainty.\u201d In the  Madoff case, the Trustee is working to recover assets to benefit former  customers, but how much he will ultimately recover, and by when,  remains unknown.", "In addition to these typical remedies, IRS has also provided another  option, referred to as a \u201csafe harbor\u201d approach. This allows taxpayers to  deduct a percentage of lost principal including all previously reported  profits in a single year\u2014the year of a criminal charge against the  perpetrator, or 2008 for the Madoff case. According to IRS, the purpose of the safe harbor is to ease the compliance burden for both the agency  and taxpayers, avoiding what can be complicated questions on size and  timing of a theft loss deduction. Under the safe harbor approach,  taxpayers can deduct 95 percent of their losses in the year of discovery  (when the lead figure is criminally charged). The loss is calculated by  adding principal invested plus profits (whether fictitious or real), less cash  withdrawals and recoveries from SIPC or other sources. For taxpayers  seeking recovery from third parties, such as through lawsuits, the figure is  reduced to 75 percent. If the taxpayer follows the safe harbor  requirements, IRS agrees not to challenge the taxpayer\u2019s treatment of a  qualified loss as a theft loss, and taxpayers waive their right to other  remedies that might have been available. The safe harbor approach  deems the reasonable prospect of recovery condition of the standard theft  loss deduction to be satisfied in the year of discovery. Thus, Madoff  customers electing to use the safe harbor approach may be able to  recognize their losses earlier than under the normal method for deducting  a theft loss. However, if customers using the safe harbor approach later  receive distributions of recovered assets from the Trustee that cause their  claimed deduction to exceed their actual losses, they must report the  excess amounts as income in the year received.", "IRS officials told us they could not say which method of claiming tax relief  is best for taxpayers, because individual tax situations can vary widely.", "Tax practitioners to whom we spoke said the safe harbor is attractive for  its certainty and ease of use, but some taxpayers may be better off using  the traditional methods.

According to IRS officials, SIPC executives, and tax  practitioners, factors affecting the ability to make use of the theft loss  deduction include:", "Deductions need income. The theft loss deduction is a deduction  against income, not a tax credit. Therefore, to use the deduction,  taxpayers must have income to apply it against. If they do not have  sufficient income, they cannot use all or part of the deduction. This  could be a common situation, because many Madoff customers are  older and without income. If taxpayers have insufficient income to  make use of the deduction in a particular year, IRS rules allow theft  loss deductions to be carried over to other years\u2014generally,  backwards for 3 years, and forward for 20. But taxpayers must still  have income, and even if they do, it could take a number of years to  fully apply their deductions on that income, meaning that benefits  could be delayed.

Individuals claiming the theft loss deduction might also have other  personal deductions, such as interest, taxes, or charitable  contributions. With application of the theft loss carryback or  carryforward amounts, income is reduced, with the result being that  income against which to claim the personal deductions can be lost.", "With insufficient income against which to claim the personal  deductions, they are lost as well, offsetting benefits of the theft loss  deduction. This is because the personal deductions are not  themselves subject to carryback or carryforward. Generalizing about  the effects of leakage is difficult because such calculations are  taxpayer-specific, but the effect can be substantial, according to one  tax practitioner.", "Rate differences. A taxpayer may have initially paid taxes on  fictitious profits at a relatively high marginal rate, but later realize a  theft loss deduction at a lower rate. This can mean the actual value of  fraud-related tax relief received is less than initial amounts of tax paid.  For example, someone may have paid taxes at a 35 percent rate, but  be subject to a 15 percent rate when claiming deductions, because,  for example, they lost investment income or retired and their income  has fallen. As a result, their deduction reduces their income by a  smaller amount than the amount of taxes that they paid in the past  when their income tax bracket was higher. Such a rate difference  could be significant if a taxpayer uses the IRS safe harbor approach.A taxpayer may have received reported profits for a number of years,  but be required, under the safe harbor approach, to deduct all losses  in a single year. Such a large deduction in one year could reduce the  taxpayer\u2019s marginal tax rate from a high rate to a low rate. For  example, a taxpayer may have paid taxes at the 35 percent rate, but  by taking a deduction for all losses in a single year, find their tax rate  averages out significantly lower. Further, the manner in which the  Alternative Minimum Tax is calculated could also cause customers to  realize the benefit of their theft loss deductions at a rate lower than  when they initially paid taxes.", "Death. Should Madoff customers have died, estate and trust taxation  issues could prevent full utilization of tax relief arising from the Madoff  losses. For example, losses can offset estate income, but any losses  remaining may not transfer with the property in subsequent tax  considerations, according to one tax practitioner.", "In addition, other factors also stand to affect tax collections, either  providing additional revenues or increasing revenue loss, according to our  review. These factors include:", "Future tax liability. Taxpayers using the safe harbor approach may  owe additional taxes in the future. By allowing taxpayers to claim 95  percent (or 75 percent) of their losses, the approach assumes a 5  percent (or 25 percent) recovery of assets by the Trustee or in other  recovery proceedings. According to IRS officials, if actual recoveries  exceed those amounts, taxpayers must declare the excess as income  and pay taxes on that income. Currently, the Trustee expects  recoveries to be at least 50 percent, meaning losses taxpayers have  claimed under the safe harbor could be overstated, triggering the  future tax liability.", "Other deductions. Investors can generally deduct expenses incurred  in the production of income, IRS officials noted. That means that over  the course of the Madoff fraud, customers would have been able to  reduce taxable income based on any expenses the Madoff firm  charged them.", "Madoff insiders. The Trustee told us that payments received by  Madoff insiders raise tax issues. In some cases, Madoff made loans  to immediate family, other relatives, and close associates. He often  forgave such loans later, but the forgiven amounts were not reported  to IRS as income, the Trustee said. In other cases, some people  received large cash payments from Madoff that were not reported as  income. Additionally, according to the Trustee, some insiders  periodically asked Madoff to produce gains or losses on their  accounts, presumably in order to offset income from non-Madoff  sources for tax purposes.", "Timing. Even if the government surrenders tax revenue as Madoff  customers realize tax relief, the U.S. government collected and had  use of tax receipts for multiple years. Meanwhile, as discussed earlier,  taxpayers may have difficulty making full use of available benefits  today.

Under NIM, net winners generally have their claims denied  and are not eligible for reimbursement from the SIPC fund. Because SIPC  payments reduce the amount that a taxpayer would claim as a loss, these  customers would then likely have correspondingly larger theft loss  deductions. In turn, those higher deductions could cause revenue losses  for the Treasury that would not have been experienced if the Trustee had  used FSM, which would have provided higher SIPC reimbursements.  This can be seen in SIPC estimates for coverage under the two methods.  Under NIM, SIPC estimates an outlay of $889 million for payment of SIPC  advances to Madoff customers. If FSM had been used to value claims,  SIPC executives estimate that SIPC reimbursements would have  increased by an additional $1.2 billion to about $2.1 billion. According to  IRS officials, an increase in SIPC coverage amounts\u2014or any other  coverage of losses\u2014will correspondingly lower theft loss deductions.", "Ultimately, though, the choice of either claims determination method  creates the potential for loss in tax revenues, because both NIM and FSM  would create deductions against income by parties affected by the Madoff  liquidation. While using FSM might have lowered theft loss deductions,  owing to the greater SIPC reimbursements, it also would have caused  greater demand on the SIPC fund, according to SIPC executives. As a  result, SIPC\u2019s broker-dealer members would have had to pay additional  amounts to keep the fund at the level targeted by the SIPC board, the  executives said. These greater amounts would have been either in the  form of higher member annual assessments, or maintaining SIPC\u2019s  recently increased assessment for a longer period, they said. At this new  assessment rate, SIPC members are currently paying about $400 million  into the fund annually.", "Under SIPA, the assessments are an ordinary business expense, SIPC  executives told us. Thus, they are deductible as business expenses for  tax purposes by member broker-dealers, which would have the effect of  lowering members\u2019 taxable income (or increasing losses). As a result,  rather than the U.S. Treasury facing lower tax collections from Madoff  customers due to use of NIM, it would experience lower revenues from  broker-dealers under FSM.

IRS officials also told us initially that the  agency did not have generally applicable guidance on the treatment of  those payments. They said the agency had been seeking to formulate the  right answer for dealing with clawbacks, but that it has otherwise provided  only \u201cfactually specific guidance\u201d on a case-by-case basis. In cases in  which IRS has not issued such specific guidance, taxpayers must rely on  the Internal Revenue Code, regulations, court cases, and relevant  revenue rulings by the agency. Tax practitioners to whom we spoke noted  uncertainties in determining how clawbacks should be treated for tax  purposes, and that this makes completing income tax returns challenging  and could contribute to errors.", "IRS officials to whom we spoke said they had not issued guidance on this  topic because their general approach was to initially focus on issuing  guidance in areas with more widespread effect, such as the safe harbor  procedures.

Future financial fraud cases could  involve clawbacks in their resolutions as well. Without additional guidance  to taxpayers for such situations, the potential for taxpayer error is  increased, which could lead to either over- or underpayment of taxes to  the U.S. Treasury. A recent audit by the Department of the Treasury  Inspector General for Tax Administration illustrated tax compliance issues  surrounding investment theft losses. After reviewing what it said was a  statistically valid sample of 140 returns claiming investment theft loss  deductions for 2008, the inspector general\u2019s audit estimated that 82  percent of 2,177 tax returns may have erroneously claimed deductions  totaling more than $697 million and resulting in revenue losses of  approximately $41 million.

However, looking back, he said the \u201cmost favored nation\u201d  provision has been an issue. Optimal recently attempted to invoke the  clause following the Trustee\u2019s recent settlement with Hadassah. Due to  the complexity of these cases, it is difficult to discern what constitutes a  settlement to which the clause would apply, the Trustee said.", "Based on our examination of the largest settlement agreements, table 14  provides a summary of key settlement provisions.", "The Trustee\u2019s settlement agreements also go beyond simply obtaining  cash agreements, we found, as allowance of customer claims and SIPC  advances have also been key components of settlements of feeder fund  cases. For example, the Tremont settlement, in addition to its $1.025  billion settlement amount, also included allowing more than $3 billion in  customer claims and granting SIPC advances for eligible accounts. With  the exception of the Katz-Wilpon case, all seven settlements that included  allowed customer claims as part of the agreement were feeder fund  cases. Because these feeder funds were net losers, the settlement  agreements granted SIPC advances to each of the funds that directly  held Madoff accounts. In the Katz-Wilpon agreement, the allowed  customer claim was assigned to the Trustee, so that customer  distributions will fund the $160 million settlement payment.", "For both the Picower and Levy settlements, the Trustee told us he  believed he obtained the largest sums possible. The $5 billion settlement  in the Picower case represents 100 percent repayment of funds received  by the Picower estate and related investors named in the complaint.  Similarly, the Levy settlement, reached before litigation was filed,  represents nearly 100 percent of the amounts the Levy account holders  withdrew during the 6 years prior to the Madoff firm\u2019s collapse.  Additionally, both Picower and Levy withdrew their customer claims as  part of the settlements, the Trustee said."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Cody J.
