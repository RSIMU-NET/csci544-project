Best practices and portfolio management standards state that organizations should conduct regular reviews to adjust to strategic changes, among other reasons. The Joint Staff, which is responsible for validating warfighting needs, has taken the most concrete actions to conduct portfolio reviews, but even these efforts did not integrate key requirements, acquisition, and budget information. Requirements and acquisition officials said they lacked the resources, readily accessible data, and analytical tools to effectively conduct reviews. For example, the Joint Staff lacks a database that pulls together current information to help it manage its portfolios and has to rely on repeated data calls, which are inefficient and time consuming.", "The military services have conducted reviews more consistently than the enterprise level and their experiences at the service level may offer lessons for DOD. They have used the reviews to reduce redundancies, plan for budget uncertainty, and realign resources.

First,  DOD plans more weapons acquisition programs than it can afford. In the  Congressional Budget Office\u2019s (CBO) most recent analysis of DOD\u2019s 5- year Future Years Defense Program (FYDP), CBO projected acquisition  costs for weapons and other major equipment to increase by 21 percent  between fiscal years 2015-2019, and to peak in the early 2020s at about  43 percent higher than in 2015. CBO explained that the steep increase in  acquisition costs it projects beyond the FYDP timeframe shows that the  classic bow wave has returned\u2014meaning that DOD is pushing out  funding needs assuming it will receive higher acquisition funding levels in  the future to complete its programs. Similarly, CBO estimated that the  total costs of carrying out the Navy\u2019s fiscal year 2015 shipbuilding plan  would require one-third more funding on an annual basis than the Navy  has received in recent decades. CBO reported that, as a result, the  Navy will likely have to purchase substantially fewer ships than under its  current plans or make other trade-offs. In April 2015, we also raised  affordability issues with the Joint Strike Fighter\u2014DOD\u2019s largest weapon  acquisition program. We estimated the program will require an average of  $12.4 billion per year, which represents around one-quarter of DOD\u2019s  annual funding for major weapons programs, over the next 5 years. We  reported that it is unlikely the program will be able to sustain such a high  level of annual funding and if required funding levels are not reached, the  program\u2019s procurement plan may not be affordable.", "In addition, the military services have a history of tailoring their planned  investments to their own needs rather than trying to find common ground,  which has led to inefficiencies and, in some cases, duplication. More  specifically, the military services sometimes generate unique system  requirements that justify multiple acquisition programs to meet similar  needs. Our work has concluded that redundancy or overlapping  capabilities in some areas may be desirable or necessary, but acquisition  efforts to develop similar capabilities can also result in the same capability  gap being filled twice or more, lead to inefficient use of resources, and  contribute to other warfighting needs going unfilled. In 2012, we found  potential duplication among electronic warfare systems, some of which  DOD has canceled. In 2013, we found additional areas of overlap in the  roles that electronic warfare systems were intended to perform and that  new areas of overlap and potential duplication could emerge as  investment plans evolved. More recently, we concluded that when  developing a new ground radar system, the Air Force focused on what  made its requirements unique from a similar Marine Corps\u2019 system,  instead of looking for ways to leverage the Marine Corps\u2019 program. We  found these programs to be potentially duplicative."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Portfolio Management", "paragraphs": ["Leading commercial companies use a portfolio management approach to  optimize their investments.

Once these  companies have prioritized opportunities, they draft initial business cases  for alternative product ideas that could be developed to exploit each of  the highest priority opportunities. Each alternative product proposal enters  a gated review process. At each review, product proposals are assessed  against others in the portfolio weighing corporate resources, established  criteria, competing products, and the goals and objectives of the  organization as a whole. As alternatives pass through each review, the  number is expected to decrease, until only those alternatives with the  greatest potential to succeed make it into the product portfolio. In effect,  new programs are born from portfolio analysis and management. Over  time, as potential new products are identified or if products under  development experience problems, companies review and rebalance their  portfolio of proposed and existing product investments based on those  products that add the most value and are the best strategic fit.", "More generally, rather than defaulting to optimizing individual programs,  portfolio management focuses on selecting the optimum mix of programs  and modifying that mix as needed over time. Take a hypothetical example  in which DOD starts with 10 programs and $50 billion to invest. Without  portfolio management, program managers will seek to get the most that  they can out of each of the 10 programs, without assessing their  aggregate contributions to defense. Using portfolio management, DOD  executives would look at different combinations of and approaches to the  10 programs to see what, collectively, would provide the best capabilities  for $50 billion. This would enable executives to decide, for example,  whether it is better to concentrate more investment in 7 programs rather  than fund all 10 as best as possible. In another example, if a program  began to have cost or performance problems, portfolio management  would consider whether the other programs in the portfolio could address  the requirements of the problematic program rather than just putting more  money into it.", "Portfolio management literature has identified characteristics and effects  of investment planning processes that are not based on portfolio  management.

These reviews focused largely on  identifying science and technology investments needed to keep up with  future threats. An AT&L official said that the first set of reviews included  some requirements, acquisition, and budget information such as  identification of capability gaps, science and technology needs, and  affordability analyses. However, the reviews did not include other key  requirements and budget information, such as prioritized lists of capability  gaps, outdated requirements, and funding scenarios that would allow  them to look at the portfolio in an integrated manner as suggested by  portfolio management standards and best practices. An AT&L official  responsible for the reviews said that AT&L is in the beginning stages of  developing these reviews and it is still determining how to break down  larger portfolios to review, how they will complement other portfolio  reviews, and what roles other Office of the Secretary of Defense  stakeholders and the military services might play in the review process.  AT&L initially planned to conduct these reviews on an annual basis, but it  has not been able to do so due to time and resource constraints and a  decision has yet to be made on whether the reviews will continue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CAPE Does Not Conduct Regular Portfolio Reviews", "paragraphs": ["At the direction of Deputy Secretary of Defense, CAPE coordinates  strategic portfolio reviews for select portfolios or issue areas to inform  budget decisions; however, these reviews have evolved over time and the  topics covered vary from year-to-year.

CAPE has generally not used the reviews in  the way that they were originally intended. The reviews are not  necessarily organized by portfolio unlike the Joint Staff and AT&L  reviews\u2014they may sometimes address just one system.

For example, in the past, lack of visibility into  certain programs, such as special access programs, urgent operational  needs, and lower ACAT level programs contributed to potential  unnecessary duplication. Joint Staff officials said that past efforts relied  on repeated data calls, which were a drain on resources and time  consuming.

The database is to  track capability gaps to enable the Joint Staff to more easily identify  potential redundancies, prioritize capability gaps and close out capability  gaps that have been addressed or that no longer need to be addressed  because the threats have evolved. Joint Staff officials said that assessing  duplication is challenging because as investment plans and capability  needs evolve, new areas of overlap and potential duplication can emerge.  They expect the database will help them identify which programs are  addressing particular capability gaps, which gaps remain open, which  gaps are closed, and which gaps are outdated. Knowing if there are  multiple systems with requirements addressing the same capability gaps  could help identify potential duplication.", "The Joint Staff has not yet developed a formal plan to address some of  the database\u2019s known limitations.

The review determined that a  proposed precision munitions system\u2014the Non-Line-of-Sight Launch  System\u2014would not provide cost-effective capabilities. The Army  canceled the program and relied on another system to provide similar  capabilities at lower cost.

But DOD currently lacks  the governance structure, policy, and decision-making authorities to  implement the more strategic and integrated approach to weapon system  investment embodied in portfolio management best practices. Completely  breaking down the stove pipes between the requirements, acquisition,  and budget communities; standardizing portfolio constructs; and  empowering enterprise-level portfolio managers to drive investment  decisions would require a fundamental restructuring of how DOD does  business\u2014this is unrealistic in the short run and would be challenging  even in the long run.

Several elements stand out as candidates for  immediate action. First, DOD\u2019s current capability portfolio management  policy is dated, senior leadership commitment has waned, and, as a  result, the policy is not being implemented. Reforming this policy to better  reflect best practices is essential to bridging the stovepipes in DOD\u2019s  requirements, acquisition, and budget processes and moving DOD  toward a more integrated approach to planning and managing its weapon  system investments. Senior leadership with direct line management  authority over the organizations responsible for implementing any policy  will also be needed if the outcomes from any renewed portfolio  management effort will be different from those in the past. Next, if DOD is  to move toward a weapon system investment plan that is affordable,  strategy-driven, and balanced between near-term and long-term needs,  then portfolio managers will need better data and analytical tools to  assess threats and capability needs and make trade-offs between groups  of acquisition programs that can address them. Finally, as DOD has  recognized in its Better Buying Power initiatives, the military services offer  potential lessons for DOD\u2019s portfolio management efforts. The military  services have used portfolio reviews and other assessments to reduce  redundancies, realign resources, produce more analytically rigorous  budget proposals, and plan for budget uncertainty.

Key elements of this recommendation would include designating the Deputy Secretary of Defense or some appropriate  delegate responsibility for implementing the policy and overseeing  portfolio management in DOD;  requiring annual enterprise-level portfolio reviews that incorporate key  portfolio review elements, including information from the  requirements, acquisition, and budget processes; directing the Joint Staff, AT&L, and CAPE to collaborate on their data  needs and develop a formal implementation plan for meeting those  needs either by building on the database the Joint Staff is developing  for its analysis or investing in new analytical tools; and  incorporating lessons learned from military service portfolio reviews  and portfolio management activities, such as using multiple risk and  funding scenarios to assess needs and re-evaluate priorities.", "Second, to help ensure the military services\u2019 portfolio reviews are  conducted regularly and effectively integrate information from the  requirements, acquisition, and budget communities, the Secretary of  Defense should direct the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to  update or develop policies that require them to conduct annual portfolio  reviews that incorporate key portfolio review elements, including  information from the requirements, acquisition, and budget processes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for comment.

Our review found that key DOD portfolio management-related efforts,  including some designed to inform the budget process and some  called for in guidance, have lacked sustained leadership and been  inconsistently implemented.

DOD also stated that it uses  Capability Gap Assessments during the budget process to ensure that  military service budget submissions are consistent with the  warfighters\u2019 capability needs. We continue to believe that annual  portfolio reviews that incorporate key portfolio review elements would  provide DOD a more integrated and comprehensive perspective on its  weapon system investment plans than its current processes provide.  The processes DOD described in its response largely reflect its stove- piped governance structures where the responsibilities for aspects of  portfolio management are dispersed among the requirements,  acquisition, and budget communities.

To describe previous capability portfolio management  efforts in the mid-to-late 2000s and the extent they are being  implemented today, we reviewed relevant documents, including a  September 2006 memorandum from the Deputy Secretary of Defense on  capability portfolio management test cases and military service  requirements, acquisition, and budget policies.

To inform all assessments for this  objective, we interviewed officials from DOD enterprise- and military  service-level requirements, acquisition, and budget communities,  including:", "Requirements: Force Structure, Resource and Assessment  Directorate, J-8, and Directorate for Intelligence, J-2 for the enterprise  level; Army Capabilities Integration Center and Headquarters,  Department of the Army G-3/5/7 Capability Portfolio Review and  Integration; Directorate of Resources; Air Force Office of the Director  of Operational Capability Requirements, A5R; the Air Combat  Command; Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, N803, Joint &  Urgent Requirements; Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, N96,  Surface Warfare; and Marine Corps, Office of the Deputy  Commandant, Combat Development and Integration.", "Acquisition: Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics (AT&L) for the enterprise level; Office of the  Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and  Technology; Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for  Acquisition; Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for  Research, Development, and Acquisition; and Marine Corps Systems  Command.", "Budget: Office of the Secretary of Defense, Cost Assessment and  Program Evaluation (CAPE) and Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense Comptroller  for the enterprise level; Directorate of  Resources, Army G-8, Force Development; Air Force Division Chief,  Planning, Programming, and Requirements Division, Air Combat  Command; the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, N81,  Integration and Force Structure and the Office of the Chief of Naval  Operations, Fiscal Management, N82 and Office of the Assistant  Secretary of the Navy for Financial Management and Comptroller; and  Marine Corps Office of Programs and Resources.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed relevant guidance and  documents to identify enterprise-level portfolio reviews and other  portfolio-level analyses that DOD components conduct and interviewed  DOD\u2019s enterprise-level requirements, acquisition, and budget  communities. We analyzed standards in the Project Management  Institute\u2019s The Standard for Portfolio Management\u2014Third Edition and  GAO best practices and compared them with DOD policies. Based on this  analysis, we developed a list of key portfolio elements which, if included  in portfolio reviews, could help integrate key portfolio management  information from the requirements, acquisition, and budget  communities\u2014information that is needed for an integrated approach to  prioritizing needs and allocating resources in accordance with strategic  goals. We compared the Joint Staff Functional Capability Board portfolio  reviews\u2019 content with these key portfolio review elements. To assess  whether DOD has conducted affordability analyses in accordance with  DOD Instruction 5000.02 and DOD\u2019s Better Buying Power guidance, we  reviewed six Defense Acquisition Board briefings for programs that held  an acquisition or milestone review from January to June 2014. To assess  whether DOD has conducted portfolio reviews and other portfolio-based  analyses to identify and eliminate potential redundancies in accordance  with DOD\u2019s Better Buying Power guidance, we interviewed Joint Staff,  AT&L, and military service officials, and reviewed relevant guidance. We  also interviewed Joint Staff, AT&L, and CAPE officials to determine the  extent to which the three offices have collaborated on these portfolio  reviews and portfolio-based analyses, and to determine whether they had  the necessary data, resources, and analytical tools to effectively conduct  reviews.", "To address our third objective, we reviewed Army, Air Force, and Navy  requirements, acquisition, and budget policies to determine the extent to  which they required portfolio reviews. We analyzed Army and Air Force  portfolio reviews, and the Navy\u2019s analytical assessments by comparing  their contents with key portfolio review elements. The military service  assessments we evaluated include:", "Army: the six capability portfolio reviews the Army conducted in 2012,  including Combat Vehicles; Precision Fires; Sustainment  (Transportation); Aviation; Assured Mobility and Protection; and  Mission Command; and the two most recent unclassified reviews  provided by the Army, including Combating Weapons of Mass  Destruction from 2013 and Movement and Maneuver from 2014;", "Air Force: of its 12 core function support plans from 2012 that  informed the Air Force\u2019s fiscal year 2015 president\u2019s budget request,  we reviewed the nine that had weapon system centric portfolios,  including Global Precision Attack; Space Superiority; Air Superiority;  Global Integrated Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance;  Command and Control; Rapid Global Mobility; Nuclear Deterrence  Operations; Personnel Recovery; and Special Operations;", "Navy: four assessments that were part of the Navy\u2019s Warfighting  Capability, Capacity, and Wholeness process to inform the Navy\u2019s  Program Objective Memorandum for fiscal year 2014, including  Capability Assessments; Front-end Assessments; Warfighting  Support and Capability Plan; and Integrated Program Assessment.", "We also interviewed officials from all four military services\u2019 requirements,  acquisition, and budget communities to determine how they conduct  these assessments, the role of the assessments in their weapon system  investment decision-making, and the results of the assessments. Based  on our assessment of these policies, reviews, and interviews with service  officials, we identified the strengths and weaknesses of these reviews and  the potential lessons they may offer DOD."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Key DOD Enterprise- and Military Service-Level Policies Governing the Requirements, Acquisition, and Budget Processes for Weapon System Investments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Enterprise-Level Policies", "paragraphs": ["Department of Defense, Manual for the Operation of the Joint Capabilities  Integration and Development System (Feb. 12, 2015).", "Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01I, Joint  Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) (Jan. 23,  2015).", "Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 5123.01G, Charter of the  Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) (Feb. 12, 2015).", "Department of Defense Directive 5000.01, The Defense Acquisition  System (May 12, 2003).", "Department of Defense Instruction 5000.02, Operation of the Defense  Acquisition System (Jan. 7, 2015).", "Department of Defense Directive 7045.14, The Planning, Programming,  Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) Process (Jan. 25, 2013).", "Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 8501.01B, Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Combatant Commanders, Chief, National Guard  Bureau, and Joint Staff Participation in the Planning, Programming,  Budgeting and Execution Process (Aug. 21, 2012)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Military Service-Level Policies", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Army", "paragraphs": ["Army Regulation 1-1, Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution  System (Jan. 30, 1994).", "Army Training and Doctrine Command Regulation 71-20, Concept  Development, Capabilities Determination, and Capabilities Integration  (Jun. 28, 2013).", "Army Regulation 71-9, Warfighting Capabilities Determination (Dec. 28,  2009).", "Army Regulation 70-1, Army Acquisition Policy (Jul. 22, 2011).", "Department of the Army Pamphlet 70-3, Army Acquisition Procedures  (Apr. 1, 2009)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Air Force", "paragraphs": ["Air Force Policy Directive 10-6, Capability Requirements Development  (Nov. 6, 2013).", "Air Force Instruction 10-601, Operational Capability Requirements  Development (Nov. 6, 2013).", "Air Force Policy Directive 63-1, Integrated Life Cycle Management (Jul. 3,  2012).", "Air Force Instruction 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management  (Mar. 7, 2013).", "Air Force Policy Directive 65-6, Financial Management: Budget (May 1,  1998).", "Air Force Policy Directive 90-11, Strategic Planning System (Mar. 26,  2009)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Navy", "paragraphs": ["Secretary of the Navy Manual M-5000.2, Department of the Navy:  Acquisition and Capabilities Guidebook (May 9, 2012).", "Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5000.2E, Department of the Navy  Implementation and Operation of the Defense Acquisition System and the  Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (Sept. 1, 2011).", "Chief of Naval Operations Instruction 3050.25, Warfighting Capability,  Capacity, and Wholeness Assessments (Jul. 30, 2012)."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Implementation of Portfolio- Based Analyses to Support Individual Acquisition Program Decisions", "paragraphs": ["In addition to its portfolio review efforts, the Department of Defense  (DOD) has called for other portfolio-based analyses to support acquisition  decisions for individual acquisition programs. These analyses are to  review the program in the context of its corresponding portfolio. The  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and  Logistics (AT&L) called for these portfolio-based analyses to ensure the  affordability of its weapon systems programs and to eliminate programs  that are potentially duplicative of other systems\u2014two areas where we  have identified challenges. However, the Assistant Secretary of Defense  for Acquisition said that AT&L has not implemented the latter of these  efforts because it lacks readily accessible data, resources, and tools to do  so.", "AT&L requires the military services and other DOD components to  conduct portfolio-based affordability analyses under Better Buying Power  and in its acquisition instruction; however, AT&L has not reviewed the  quality of the analyses or used them to inform acquisition decisions. We  also found that these efforts are only partially being implemented (see  table 9). Better Buying Power guidance from 2010 and 2012 recommends  portfolio-based affordability analyses to inform acquisition program  milestone decisions. Subsequently, AT&L required affordability analysis  for acquisition programs under its primary acquisition policy\u2014DOD  Instruction 5000.02\u2014as a tool to promote responsible and sustainable  investment decisions. This policy states that the purpose of the  affordability analysis is to avoid starting or continuing programs that DOD  cannot produce and support within reasonable expectations for future  budgets. The military services are to consider the long-term affordability  of a program within the context of its portfolio to inform the program\u2019s  milestone decisions. The portfolios to be used for these analyses were  provided by the services and are generally different than the portfolios  used for requirements and budget purposes at the enterprise-wide level.  AT&L officials said they have not monitored the military services\u2019  compliance with conducting the analyses or reviewed the quality of the  analyses because the responsibility for conducting them falls to service  leadership.", "In our review of defense acquisition board briefings from January through  June 2014, we found that 5 of 6 programs that held reviews included an  affordability analysis. However, two of these analyses did not look at  affordability over the recommended 30- to 40-year period, and for the  three in which the portfolio exceeded the total obligation authority in any  given year, there was no discussion of possible trades to make the  portfolio affordable. According to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, statute charges the military services with equipping the force,  so it is the services that have to make trade-offs. It is not an AT&L role.", "Better Buying Power guidance from 2012 also called for portfolio-based  analyses to identify potential redundancy and eliminate unnecessary  duplication; however these analyses have not been conducted (see table  10). AT&L was to conduct these analyses for ACAT I programs in support  of all acquisition program decisions, including at requirements decision  points, and during annual program and budget review processes. The  military services were to conduct these analyses for lower dollar  acquisition programs.
