With other international donors, it is focused on transitioning leadership to the Afghan government and has pledged to provide at least 50 percent of its development aid through the Afghan government budget. Improving Afghanistan's public financial management capacity is critical to this transition. In 2010, the Afghan government, consulting with donors, issued a Public Financial Management Roadmap (Roadmap), which outlines goals to improve Afghanistan's capacity to develop a national budget and expend funds. GAO reviewed (1) U.S. efforts to improve the Afghan government's public financial management capacity, including the extent to which they support Roadmap goals, and (2) the extent to which U.S. efforts have improved the government's capacity. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID); Departments of State, Defense (DOD), and the Treasury (Treasury); World Bank; and Afghan government in Washington, D.C., and Kabul, Afghanistan."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["USAID, Treasury, and DOD support the Public Financial Management Roadmap (Roadmap) goals through various activities such as (1) USAID projects that provide technical assistance and training to Afghan civil servants, (2) Treasury advisers' assistance to the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and (3) DOD's Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan (CSTC-A) that provides support to the Ministries of Defense (MOD) and Interior (MOI). GAO found that these efforts are aligned with the Roadmap goals. USAID provides training and technical assistance mainly through two contractor-implemented projects. One USAID project provides technical assistance to 37 civilian ministries to develop their annual budgets, while another USAID project provides training in areas such as financial management and procurement to Afghan civil servants. Treasury provides technical assistance through 6 advisers in MOF, who work with senior officials on issues such as budget execution. Through CSTC-A, DOD has 22 advisers at MOD and MOI, who advise officials on developing their budgets and strengthening the payroll system to improve accuracy. The overall extent to which U.S. efforts have improved the public financial management capacity of the Afghan government cannot be fully determined because (1) U.S. agencies have reported mixed results, and (2) weaknesses in USAID's performance management frameworks, such as lack of performance targets and data, prevent reliable assessments of its results. USAID's evaluations of its two public financial management projects indicate that some activities were successfully completed, while others were terminated because these activities were not deemed useful. Treasury advisers assessed that although their assistance at MOF had a positive effect, some results had limitations. For example, advisers assessed that their efforts to design reports for improved communication of financial information were not as successful as they had expected. Additionally, CSTC-A assessed that while MOD has made progress since 2008 and can perform critical financial management functions with minimal international support, MOI still needs significant international support for such operations. In early 2010, CSTC-A projected that MOD would transition to needing no coalition support for finance and budget functions by January 2012, and MOI would reach a similar goal by March 2012. However, in early 2011, CSTC-A extended time frames for meeting its benchmarks for MOD and MOI to March 2012 and November 2012, respectively. Regarding deficiencies in USAID's performance management framework, both the USAID Mission performance management plan and project-specific plans lack performance targets as required for each indicator related to public financial management. Additionally, implementing partners, such as contractors, have not consistently reported performance data for all indicators. Moreover, baselines for public financial management capacity of civilian ministries have not yet been established. In the absence of baselines, performance targets, and data, it is difficult to assess the extent to which USAID efforts have increased the public financial management capacity of Afghan ministries."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the USAID Administrator take steps to (1) establish performance targets in its Mission Performance Management Plan (PMP); (2) ensure implementing partners' PMPs include baselines and approved targets; and (3) ensure implementing partners routinely report performance data.

After almost a decade of donor-led  efforts in Afghanistan, the United States and international donors have  increased their focus on transitioning leadership to the Afghan  government. The government of Afghanistan and the United Nations  sponsored international conferences in London (January 2010) and Kabul  (July 2010), which were attended by senior officials representing about 70  major donors, including the United States. Participants committed to  supporting Afghan government leadership and ownership and agreed to  increase the percentage of development aid delivered through the Afghan  government to 50 percent by 2012, if the Afghan government showed  progress in areas such as strengthening its public financial-management  systems and reducing corruption. In November 2010, representatives  from 48 countries contributing to the United Nations\u2013mandated  International Security Assistance Force agreed to a plan to begin  transitioning security responsibilities to the Afghan government in 2011  and to complete this transition by 2014. In June 2011, the U.S. President  reiterated that the process of security transition in Afghanistan will be  complete by 2014.

Some  Afghan officials viewed the Afghan-led approach to mean that they did not  need to ensure accountability for some inventory. As a result, in some  cases, USAID inventory stickers were reportedly removed from assets  before the items were transferred to Afghan control, causing  accountability issues, according to USAID\u2019s evaluation. In addition, some  Afghan managers interpreted the concept of Afghan-led to mean that they  could prevent the project\u2019s monitoring and evaluation team from obtaining  data needed to assess project results, according to USAID\u2019s evaluation.  For example, when ACSS staff requested monitoring and evaluation data,  some Afghan managers responded that they were not required to provide  data and that such requests represented an inappropriate desire to exert  control over their operations. As a result, the quality of monitoring and  evaluation of the project suffered.", "To assess the effect of Treasury advisers\u2019 technical assistance to MOF,  Treasury\u2019s Office of Technical Assistance requires each adviser to submit  monthly reports and an annual evaluation.

For instance, the advisers gave a low score for results  related to their efforts to design management reports to improve  communication of financial information and enhanced budget control.  However, the advisers assigned a high rating for results related to  developing training materials to support capacity building.

CSTC-A\u2019s quarterly assessment  of MOI for January through March 2011 rates MOI at the same level as in  2009, citing factors such as lack of consolidation of MOI\u2019s personnel  databases due to delays in contracts and lack of telecommunications  network expansion. As a result, CSTC-A or Afghan officials are not  certain that all salary payments are being made to legitimate Afghan  National Police personnel rather than \u201cghost\u201d employees. Additionally,  current MOI finance office employees do not have formal training in  properly executing the budget and salary functions. Moreover, according  to CSTC-A assessment, MOI has a top-down organizational culture in  which officials tend to delegate key decisions to the minister.

In  addition, project implementers are required to regularly collect, analyze,  and interpret performance data in order to improve their ability to make  project adjustments in a timely manner. The performance management  frameworks for PFM capacity-building projects did not meet USAID  guidance because of deficiencies such as a lack of baselines, targets,  and performance data.", "The performance indicators for EGGI and ACSS related to PFM capacity- building activities do not consistently provide baselines, performance  targets, or actual performance data for each indicator, as required. For  example, as shown in figure 5, for fiscal year 2010, EGGI\u2019s implementing  partner did not establish performance targets or provide actual data on a  quarterly or annual basis for training activities conducted by EGGI.  Additionally, EGGI\u2019s implementing partner did not report target or actual  data for the indicator called \u201cAnnual Tax Revenues Collected in Priority  Revenue Mustofiats\u201d because MOF did not release revenue data during  the project\u2019s performance year. Subsequently, USAID provided fiscal year  2010 quarterly and annual data for this indicator to GAO in the fourth  quarter of fiscal year 2011. While these data may provide information that  is useful for project evaluation, since they were provided retroactively,  they were unavailable for USAID to monitor the progress of the activity  during the performance year. Similarly, ACSS\u2019s implementing partner did  not provide evidence of baseline, quarterly performance targets, or actual  quarterly data for any of the project\u2019s PFM training indicators. This lack of  targets and actual performance data rendered associated indicators  ineffective for either tracking the progress of associated activities or  assessing the extent to which USAID\u2019s implementing partners met interim  goals. Appendix VI provides the available data for fiscal years 2010 and  2011 for EGGI and ACSS.", "For fiscal year 2011, although USAID-funded evaluations note that EGGI  improved its performance measures and data collection, our analysis  indicates that both EGGI and ACSS did not establish performance targets  for each indicator, or report actual data for completed quarters, as  required. As shown in figure 6, EGGI did not establish quarterly or annual  targets for its training activities that include key areas, such as program  budgeting and tax administration, noted in EGGI\u2019s workplan. Similarly,  ACSS did not establish baselines for any of its PFM indicators, which  would make it difficult to assess the project\u2019s training accomplishments.", "In addition to the lack of compliance with USAID guidance noted above,  USAID-funded evaluations of EGGI and ACSS have noted other  weaknesses in the projects\u2019 performance management frameworks. For  example, the evaluator of the EGGI project was critical of the large  number of performance indicators for the project\u2019s first year that do not  demonstrate a direct link between project efforts and improved capacity of  the Afghan government. More specifically, the evaluator noted that only 4  of 7 indicators related to EGGI\u2019s PFM capacity-building component are  directly affected by the project\u2019s work. The other indicators\u2014national  domestic revenues, national tax revenues, and national nontax  revenues\u2014are indirectly affected by the project\u2019s work. Another EGGI  evaluation noted that since MOF was not publishing data for the indicator  related to annual taxes in priority provinces, the implementer should  replace it with a different indicator that can be used to monitor activities.", "The evaluator of the ACSS project noted that the project\u2019s work plan,  performance management plan, and operations manual were not  sufficiently rigorous or comprehensive and, given the scope and scale of  the project, the evaluator expected higher-quality project documentation.  The evaluator also noted that the project\u2019s performance monitoring  framework lacks results-based information about the effectiveness of the  project\u2019s technical advisers.", "In addition to weaknesses in the performance management frameworks  of USAID\u2019s PFM capacity projects, we have previously noted similar  deficiencies in other USAID projects in Afghanistan. For example:  In July 2008, we reported that, among other things, limitations in  USAID\u2019s data collection and performance evaluation frameworks  impeded the agency\u2019s ability to evaluate the effects of its roads  projects.  In July 2010, we reported that USAID did not assure that all indicators  had targets for the eight GAO-reviewed agriculture projects.  In November 2010, we reported that four of the six implementers of  GAO-reviewed water projects did not always establish targets for  performance indicators.", "We are following up on USAID\u2019s progress on these recommendations.  Additionally, the USAID Administrator committed to tracking resources  against outcomes as effectively as possible at a congressional hearing in  July 2010."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The United States and other international donors have begun to focus on  building the Afghan government\u2019s capacity for a successful transition of  leadership for security and governance to Afghanistan. Improving the  Afghan government\u2019s ability to manage its public finances is an important  part of this transition effort. USAID, Treasury, and DOD, along with other  international donors, have undertaken various efforts to address the  Afghan government\u2019s PFM capacity. While DOD and Treasury have  assessed and reported mixed results based on their efforts, the overall  effect of U.S. efforts is not known because USAID, which has a key role  in building Afghan civilian ministries\u2019 PFM capacity, has not consistently  established baselines and targets, or reported actual performance data.  We have previously reported on deficiencies in USAID\u2019s performance  management efforts in Afghanistan and made recommendations to  improve the assessment of USAID program performance and the efforts  of USAID\u2019s implementing partners. During a congressional hearing in July  2010, USAID\u2019s Administrator identified defining, tracking, observing, and  reporting on results of USAID projects as a priority, noting that it is  important to determine how USAID efforts contribute to the U.S. strategy  for Afghanistan. He also committed to tracking resources against  outcomes as effectively as possible. The lack of approved mission-level  and implementing partner-level performance targets calls into question  USAID\u2019s efforts to live up to the Administrator\u2019s commitment.

We reviewed documents and  records from the U.S. Departments of Defense (DOD), State (State), and  the Treasury (Treasury), and the U.S. Agency for International  Development (USAID). We selected these agencies because they  provide guidance or assistance related to U.S. PFM capacity building for  the Afghan government. We also reviewed documents from the Afghan  government and other donors, such as the World Bank. We interviewed  officials from DOD, State, Treasury, and USAID in Washington, D.C., and  in Kabul, Afghanistan. Additionally, in Kabul, we interviewed officials from  other international donors providing PFM assistance, such as the World  Bank and the United Kingdom, as well as Afghan government officials  from organizations including the Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of  Defense (MOD), Ministry of Public Health, and the Independent  Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission.", "To inventory and describe U.S. government efforts to build the Afghan  government\u2019s PFM capacity, we interviewed officials from U.S. agencies,  including USAID, Treasury, and DOD, and reviewed relevant documents.  We also compared U.S. agency efforts with the key components of the  Public Financial Management Roadmap (Roadmap), which represents  goals agreed upon by donors and the Afghan government to improve the  Afghan government\u2019s PFM capacity.  \uf0b7  For USAID PFM capacity-building work we reviewed documents\u2014 including base contracts, contract modifications and scope of work\u2014 that describe USAID-funded PFM capacity building work in  Afghanistan. To identify USAID PFM capacity-building projects since  2009, we interviewed officials from USAID\u2019s Office of Democracy and  Governance, and Office of Economic Growth. Some USAID projects  are divided into major areas of focus called components. Two USAID  projects\u2014Economic Growth and Governance Initiative (EGGI) and  Afghanistan Civil Service Support (ACSS)\u2014have at least one  component related to building the PFM capacity of Afghan  government entities at the national and provincial levels. We selected  these projects for a more detailed review. Some projects did not have  a component focused on building the Afghan government\u2019s capacity in  budget formulation, budget execution, or transparency and  accountability. However, we included them in our inventory because  USAID officials noted that these projects contribute to increasing the  Afghan government\u2019s PFM capacity. We decided to focus on projects  that primarily build PFM capacity at the national and provincial levels  because the Roadmap prioritizes capacity building at these levels.  \uf0b7  To describe the PFM efforts of Treasury officials, we reviewed  documents including Treasury\u2019s 2009 assessment of the need for  advisers to assist the Afghan government with public-expenditure  management and a summary of the roles of advisers currently at  MOF. In Kabul, we also interviewed the Treasury advisers and met  with them at MOF.  \uf0b7  To describe DOD\u2019s PFM capacity-building work, we reviewed  documents including organizational charts and staffing levels, policy  guidance and operating procedures, and various implementation,  development, and evaluation plans for both MOD and Ministry of  Interior (MOI). For information on the role of mentors and advisers in  building capacity at MOD and MOI, we interviewed senior DOD  officials at the Combined Security Transition Command\u2013Afghanistan  (CSTC-A), who were providing the services to both MOI and MOD, as  well as MOD Finance officials who were receiving these services. In  addition, we reviewed MOD and MOI training manuals, course  materials, and adviser guides developed specifically for mentoring  and capacity building in these ministries. We also reviewed the  contracts providing mentoring and training services to MOD and MOI.  \uf0b7  To assess alignment of U.S. efforts and goals with the PFM goals of  international donors and the Afghan government, we compared efforts  undertaken by USAID, Treasury, and DOD with the key components  of the Roadmap. We also reviewed U.S. plans and guidance issued  since 2009, including the U.S. Foreign Assistance for Afghanistan  Post Performance Management Plan (2011-2015) and U.S. Mission  guidance to U.S. agencies on PFM issues in Afghanistan. For U.S.  military efforts we reviewed goals stated in CSTC-A Ministerial  Development Plans for finance and budget functions for MOD and  MOI. We also interviewed U.S. officials from USAID, Treasury, and  CSTC-A to corroborate the extent to which the Roadmap guided their  efforts in working with Afghan ministries. Additionally, we obtained  relevant documentation from MOF officials, including the  implementation plan and a 6-month progress report related to the  Roadmap.  \uf0b7  To assess U.S. efforts within the broader context of other donor  efforts, we interviewed donors including the World Bank and United  Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID) in Kabul.  We also obtained documents, such as the Roadmap Implementation  Plan and Technical Assistance Summary Reports, and interviewed  officials from the World Bank and MOF.", "To assess the results of U.S. PFM efforts, we analyzed relevant  documentation from U.S. agencies.  \uf0b7  For USAID, we analyzed the performance plans for the Mission as  well as for PFM-specific projects. Additionally we analyzed the results  reported in project evaluations as well as monthly, quarterly, and  annual reports for the two main PFM-focused projects. USAID  evaluations were based on document reviews as well as interviews  with contractors, USAID officials, and Afghan government officials.  Additionally, the evaluation for EGGI included surveys of and  interviews with program beneficiaries (e.g., Afghan officials in budget  units). We found these evaluations to be generally reliable to provide  information on the results of specific activities conducted under EGGI  and ACSS for the period for which the evaluations were conducted.  \uf0b7  From the Mission Performance Management Plan (PMP), we  identified objectives and associated indicators that pertain to PFM.  We then reviewed the associated data provided by USAID that  complemented the results framework noted in the Mission PMP. We  identified whether USAID data included fiscal year 2011 targets for  the PFM indicators we had identified in the PMP.  In analyzing USAID project-performance indicators, we reviewed the  most current performance data from USAID and its implementing  partners. Target and performance data were not available for the first  quarter of fiscal year 2010 for ACSS and EGGI because ACSS began  operations in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010; although EGGI  started in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, USAID officials reported  that they did not expect performance targets and data for this quarter  because the project was being set up. As of the date of this report\u2019s  publication, no data were available for the fourth quarter of fiscal year  2011, so our analysis does not include data from that quarter. As part  of our analysis of USAID project-performance indicators, we reviewed  the most current performance data provided by USAID and its  implementing partners. We also interviewed USAID officials and the  contractor to obtain clarifying information about performance data.  Due to unexplained changes and gaps in some target and  performance data, we could not verify the reliability of all performance  data reported by USAID. Additionally, we obtained documentation and  corroborated the effectiveness of U.S. efforts during meetings with  Afghan officials from relevant governmental organizations, such as  the Independent Administrative Reform and Civil Service  Commission. At the commission\u2019s training institute, we met with  contractors who provide training to Afghan civil servants as part of the  ACSS project.  \uf0b7  To assess the results of the efforts of Treasury advisers, we reviewed  a sample of adviser monthly reports as well as advisers\u2019 assessment  for October 2009 to September 2010, the latest available report for a  complete fiscal year. We also interviewed officials from Treasury\u2019s  Office of Technical Assistance to obtain information on the adviser  assessment and reporting process. Moreover, in Afghanistan we met  with MOF officials and contractors in MOF\u2019s budget, treasury, and  internal audit offices, and we obtained their input regarding USAID\u2019s  and Treasury\u2019s efforts and results. We assessed data obtained for our  analysis to be sufficiently reliable to provide an overall assessment of  the extent to which Treasury advisers\u2019 assistance has contributed to  MOF\u2019s PFM capacity.  \uf0b7  We did not independently assess the capability of MOD and MOI  finance offices; rather, we relied on CSTC-A\u2019s capability milestone  ratings, which are used to measure the capability level of a specific  area or department. We spoke with cognizant CSTC-A officials about  the reliability of these ratings and also reviewed documentation about  the ratings formulation process. In addition, CSTC-A officials provided  documentation that showed modifications in their rating process to  make it more rigorous. For example, in 2010, CSTC-A introduced  interim ratings, which it believed provided greater detail and a more  gradual transition from requiring significant coalition assistance to  being capable of fully autonomous operations. We believe that the  capability milestone ratings are sufficiently reliable to measure the  extent of progress in finance and budget functions at MOD and MOI.  Additionally, we analyzed finance- and budget-related development  and evaluation plans for MOD and MOI, quarterly assessment  briefings, Ministerial Development Board presentations, internal  control finance reports, and other adviser reports. We compared  quarterly assessments and projected capability milestone ratings over  time to identify the extent to which DOD was meeting its targets.
